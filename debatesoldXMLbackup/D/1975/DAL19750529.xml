    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £177,022,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig na Ard-Cháraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and certain grants-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on the last occasion, I was talking about dental services in general and the backlog which exists. Since then it has come to my notice, and perhaps the Minister could bear me out in this, that schools which are not primary State-aided schools but which are private or junior schools <Col N="1222" /> are entitled to benefit under the dental treatment scheme for school children if the manager applies.  I was not aware that this was the position but I believe it is so.  If this were to arise in certain areas, the system would become further jammed, but it is information which I believe is not fully available.  I have had parents in the Greystones area, and who have children attending these private schools, coming to me about the dental health facilities for their children.  I believe it is the position that the school manager must make application and the facilities will be provided.  This, of course, will add to the great backlog.</P>
      <P>The only way in which we can possibly get around that situation is to bring in some more dentists from the private sector and that is worth doing. We are dealing here with our children and their basic requirements.  Their dental health is most important.  It is wrong that they must suffer after being examined for up to six months before treatment can be given.  I know the Minister is aware of this and I will not labour it any further than to express the hope that progress will be made as between the dentists' association and the Department on this fee for item matter.</P>
      <P>Speaking in general terms of how I would envisage a hospital, I would see a hospital as being an integral part of the community and I would see it in the context of the overall health of the community it serves and not as some institution apart from the community. I would visualise it as providing the services which people require so that these people could be healthy.  Health and illness are co-ordinated factors, factors which are involved in community well-being.  The day of a hospital being completely apart and the patients in it not being part of the community is long past and I hope that we will have a more integrated system with better in-bed and out-patient facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When dealing with out-patient facilities not alone in the hospitals but also for patients at home, possibly by reason of age or a less serious type of illness, we immediately come up against <Col N="1223" /> the manner in which these people can be served and looked after.  The important people in the maintenance of a good standard of health in these patients are the public health nurses and I wonder if we are sufficiently conscious of the great work these nurses do.  They have a very involved schedule and much is expected of them. They are a vital element in any community care programme but their conditions of service possibly require some attention.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to say that we will have one public health nurse for so many thousands of population.  There are other factors involved such as the general terrain.  My constituency is a classic example of extremes of population density in areas on the east coast and the scattered population in southwest Wicklow, so that the criterion of one public health nurse to so many thousands of population is not of itself sufficient.  It must be adjusted to local terrain factors and also the factor of scattered population.</P>
    <P>These public health nurses provide a good service but their numbers are still too few.  They provide a domiciliary midwifery service and also general domiciliary nursing, especially for the aged.  They also provide public health care for children from infancy to the end of the schoolgoing period and coupled with that, they are available for advice on health education in general.  They act in conjunction with the general practitioner.  I should like to avail of the opportunity to pay tribute to them and I hope their services will not go unrewarded.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister mentioned health education bureaus.  I welcome the setting up of these but the Minister should consider adding one or two specialists to these bureaus.  We have had reports that a certain sector of our community seem to be relatively well fed, if not the best fed according to some statistics, and I am not sure if that relates to food value or intake although I imagine it refers to intake.  Being aware of the fact that deaths from heart disease are on the increase I feel sure the Minister <Col N="1224" /> will investigate the possibility of adding a dietician to the personnel on a health education bureau.  I should also like to see a teacher included in the group.  Although the people chosen by the Minister to date are well qualified it would be an advantage to add those I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The problem of medical cards will always be with us and I do not think we will ever have sufficiently high guidelines to meet the needs of the community.  Nevertheless, we must proceed to up these guidelines and this should be done at least twice annually. The Minister for Finance, in his budget speech, mentioned that a review would possibly take place in September or October and, in conjunction with this review, the Minister for Health should review the guidelines for medical cards. I am aware of the Minister's desire to better these guidelines and I share his concern in regard to this scheme.</P>
    <P>When considering this Estimate a matter which crossed my mind was the dispensing of prescriptions.  In this regard I can recall reading an article which dealt with problems which arise when prescriptions are handed over to illiterates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The prescriptions sometimes are not very legible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When such a person is given a prescription by a doctor in a lot of cases he or she does not go to the pharmacist to obtain the tablets. If the pharmacist knows the person involved and that person goes to the shop the pharmacist goes to the trouble of spelling out in simple terms the number of tablets to be taken per day. However, a difficulty arises where a second party presents the prescription to the pharmacist.  Details as to how often the tablets are to be taken are given by the pharmacist to that person and that person in turn is expected to transmit the message to the patient.  It happens in some cases that the second party is not in a position to transmit the message in detail.  This problem could be got round if the doctor when he writes a prescription for such a person put a capital &ldquo;I&rdquo; on the top of <Col N="1225" /> the prescription.  This would make the pharmacist aware of the position.  I have spoken to a number of pharmacists about this problem and they admit it exists.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give favourable consideration to the establishment of a community hospital in the Arklow area.  I would be obliged if he would inform me when we might have finance and be given the go-ahead for the health centres not only in Arklow but in Dunlavin and Blessington.  I should like to pay tribute to the staff of the health board serving my constituency. I have not known the staff for long but during that period they proved helpful to myself and the people of the region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate because I realise the importance of the Estimate for the Department of Health.  With the most imaginative thinking possible no Minister for Health could possibly realise his visions or dreams in so far as the health services are concerned.  This is something which must be linked up closely with the Departments of Social Welfare and Local Government.  Of the number of people who are seeking medical care and hospital beds a big percentage need this attention because of bad housing.  As a first step towards a general improvement of health standards we should ensure that every family lives in an airy and properly equipped home.  Until such time as all families live in healthy homes we cannot hope to see any improvement in the health of our people.  It is alarming to see the number of people who have a medical problem because of their housing conditions.  If the Minister is to realise his ambitions he must have close contact with the Department of Local Government.  If necessary he should establish an inter-departmental committee in an effort to improve housing conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should ensure that the public are properly educated with regard to health matters.  The greatest gift is good health but there are very few people who make a study of it and who take the necessary steps and precautions to retain good health.  If <Col N="1226" /> we had a proper educational system that put a proper emphasis on health and good living it would considerably relieve the financial strain on the State with regard to the provision of hospitals and the necessary services and it would also ease the strain on the medical profession.  No matter what the Department of Health may do, it will be to no avail until the people are educated on the real essentials of life.  They must know what steps to take to safeguard their health.</P>
    <P>There should be a campaign in every area to advise people on the type of food to eat and what to avoid. The major diseases in this country are cancer and heart diseases.  Many people say there is no cure for cancer but early diagnosis and treatment together with care and attention will reduce the number of deaths.  I do not know what is our contribution to cancer research but it could never be enough.  The amount of money spent on this research throughout the world is money well spent.  We should use some of the EEC funds for this purpose, although I admit they are not extraordinarily large at the moment.  An international effort should be made, in conjunction with the United States and other countries who are experiencing high death rates from cancer, to pool financial resources and to examine all possible means to conquer the disease.</P>
    <P>As a matter of urgency, this country should have hospitals that would cater exclusively for cancer patients.  Outstanding work has been done by existing hospitals but their resources are not sufficient to cope with the problem.  Sooner or later the Department of Health will have to provide large, well equipped hospitals to take the strain from the existing hospitals treating cancer patients.  At present many patients are on waiting lists because they cannot be accommodated in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the late thirties and the forties this country had a serious problem with regard to tuberculosis but, as a result of a major drive in the provision of hospital accommodation, that problem was overcome to a great <Col N="1227" /> extent.  However, we should not make the mistake of thinking tuberculosis is a disease of the past.  Statistics show that there are still quite a number of people suffering from that disease and we must not be under the impression that we have completely solved the problem.</P>
    <P>When people are in good health it is vital that they be educated on the best way to retain it.  It is astonishing to realise that many thousands of people are living on tablets and drugs of all kinds.  What has happened to this country?  There has been an extraordinary change in recent years. People in all walks of life seem to take tablets and drugs four and five times a day.  Do they really know what they are taking?  Have all these drugs been prescribed by doctors?  Is it the situation that some medical people are pushing these drugs on the public in an effort to relieve pressure on their surgeries and consulting rooms?  The indiscriminate use of drugs and tablets is wrong and the sooner our people realise that the better.  Many of the people who are taking these tablets are walking around in a daze.  It will be a problem to break them from the habit of continually taking drugs and medicines.  Years ago people lived to a ripe old age without the assistance of these drugs.  They knew what good, wholesome food they should eat and they knew how to guard against infection and disease.</P>
    <P>I have never understood why health foods were subject to tax.  These foods are of a very good quality.  I do not know why the various brands of imported health foods were subject to tax. I would ask the Minister for Health to consult with the Minister for Finance regarding this tax in relation to health foods and ensure that so far as natural foods are concerned they will not be subject to tax.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to those who have been associated with the blood transfusion service and to all those responsible for keeping a blood bank. I also want to express appreciation of voluntary blood donors.  I trust that whoever is responsible in this particular <Col N="1228" /> sphere is satisfied we have sufficient blood in stock at all times to meet any great emergency that might arise.  One is always hoping that catastrophe and disaster will be avoided but it is absolutely essential that the blood bank should be built up to the very maximum so that, should tragedy befall us, there will be ample supplies of blood readily available. The people involved in the blood transfusion service are doing an excellent job.</P>
    <P>Our aim should be&mdash;it is the aim of the Minister&mdash;to treat people outside of hospital rather than in hospital. Steps have been taken in that direction.  Well over 1,000,000 people are now covered by medical cards and are entitled to completely free health services.  I do not describe myself as a 1975 socialist&mdash;I emphasise the 1975 &mdash;but I am a believer in free health services for all of the very best kind that can be made available.  Those who have no free health services are paying through the nose to subsidise those who have these services.  In the case of those who have to pay for services, particularly where large families are concerned, hospital charges and the cost of specialist treatment are outrageous.  I know not one, not dozens, but scores of people who deliberately avoid going to a doctor because they are afraid they will have to go into hospital and, not being covered by free health services, they fear the financial consequences. That is a shocking situation. No human being should be in the position of putting his or her health at risk because of fear of financial stringency.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister to ensure that all our people will be treated equally and that the best free medical services will be provided for every man, woman and child in the State. Where, the Minister may ask, will the money come from?  Whatever happened to the free-for-all health services, we were told some years ago would be available to all for the price of a packet of cigarettes?  If everyone were contributing it would be possible to provide all our people with proper free health services.  Then no one <Col N="1229" /> would enjoy better treatment than another.  Let there be no question whatever about it, the man who can pay will always be sure of the very best treatment.  We should drop the pretence that there is no difference as between those who can pay and those who cannot.  There is a vast difference.  The man with the financial resources can get the best treatment available inside or outside the country. I implore the Minister and the Government, whatever difficulties may have arisen with any branch of the medical profession, to make use of the conference table to resolve the difficulties. We are always talking about negotiation and reconciliation in other spheres.  Why can there not be negotiation and co-operation where problems relating to health are concerned? If the conference table is utilised and there is goodwill any difficulties that exist should be capable of being resolved satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Ministers change and Governments change but the personnel in Departments do not change.  It is there we want a real change of heart.  I remember being on numerous deputations to various Ministers for Health right from the late Dr. Ward to the present day.  The deputations invariably ended up with the civil servants making suggestions and proposals instead of the deputation telling them exactly what they wanted done. Deputations do not visit Departments to find out what the official departmental view is; they go with the intention of convincing the bureaucrats of a particular course of action they want the civil servants to take. Where there are fixed ideas, many of them emanating from Victorian times, it is impossible to make progress. There must be a change of heart at both governmental and local level.  I know it is hard to cure an old dog of his trot and it is hard indeed to convince highly qualified, professional civil servants; that is why I say an effort must be made to bring about changes right through.  I hope an effort will be made now to embark on free for all health services.  I am a believer in them.  I have seen the hardship middle class people undergo, <Col N="1230" /> people whom we regard as well off until they fall into the hands of those charged with responsibility for curing ill-health.</P>
    <P>I do not know if any speaker has drawn the attention of the Minister to the standard of clinics.  There is an obligation on health boards to provide spacious, airy clinics and it should be the duty of the Department to see that the clinics are inspected frequently.  I have seen clinics where outpatients were packed like sardines in a tin, where there was no proper seating accommodation or proper ventilation or a reasonable standard of comfort.  I cannot understand why the consultants send for so many patients at the one time.  Is it due to transport problems?</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to know the amount of the sum voted for Health that is spent on the transportation of patients from clinic to clinic and from hospital to hospital.  I do not intend to be critical of those who earn a livelihood in transporting patients. It should be open to health boards to give a petrol allowance to a neighbour who would be prepared to transport a patient who had not a car. There have been cases where patients have been brought around the country for miles and for hours while other patients were being picked up or set down.  This is an unsatisfactory arrangement.  It must be replaced.</P>
    <P>A survey of clinics should be undertaken and they should be visited frequently to ensure that they are not overcrowded, that proper accommodation is provided, that there is a proper way of receiving patients and that the clinics are fully staffed and equipped.  I would have preferred not to have seen some of the clinics that have come under my notice.</P>
    <P>We may be critical of our hospitals but we have a great deal to be grateful for.  I want to express appreciation, especially to the religious who have devoted their lives to the care of the sick.  I would also like to express gratitude to the wonderful girls who take up a nursing career, which is the finest vocation that any girl can <Col N="1231" /> follow.  It is regrettable that such a large number of Irish girls cannot be trained at home as nurses.  Our training hospitals are of the highest possible standard but they have the maximum number of trainees that they can accommodate and the prospect of getting girls into them for training is practically nil.  I should like to ask what practical steps have been taken in recent years to ensure a greater intake of Irish girls into Irish hospitals where there are training facilities or to establish new training hospitals so that girls will not have to emigrate to be trained in England and elsewhere.  It is a serious problem from the point of view of administration that so many girls have to emigrate to train abroad.  I trust that the Department will take note of this matter.</P>
    <P>The Elm Park Hospital is one of the finest hospitals in the world. Another fine hospital is the regional hospital in Limerick.  I have not been in many hospitals except to see patients but I realise what it is to be in hospital, having been a patient many years ago for a much longer period than I care to remember.</P>
    <P>Most of our hospitals could do with a general overhaul to bring them up to modern standards but when our hospitals are compared with hospitals that we visit abroad we realise how very well off we are.  I visited a hospital in Copenhagen to see a patient and a hospital in Paris, to see a patient.  I was not impressed.  I certainly was not impressed when I visited the Bellevue Hospital in New York to see a patient.  That hospital left a lasting impression.  When one visits hospitals abroad one realises that some of our major hospitals are much more advanced.  In the Bellevue Hospital in New York there are wards in which there are over 100 patients of all creeds, classes and nationalities.  In the clammy atmosphere of New York city this is not a very pleasant experience.  Because of location, the hospitals in this country are superior to many of the hospitals I have visited abroad.  I have only <Col N="1232" /> visited two hospitals in England and that was in the city of Manchester. Any Dublin hospital impressed me more.</P>
    <P>Our hospital staffs are dedicated people.  I should like to express appreciation of our doctors, physicians, surgeons, psychiatrists for their wonderful devotion to duty and their loyalty to their patients.  These people are extremely proud of the high standards of their profession.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that there will be many Deputies doing it but I want to express appreciation of the doctors in this country who have taken a certain stand against abortion and who have clearly and openly expressed their opinions in no uncertain terms.  I have not heard a single utterance from the Department of Health advising people of the dangers of abortion.  I have not seen one practical step taken to have a proper investigation about the means by which thousands of Irish girls are being ushered out of the country to have abortions performed in Britain and elsewhere.  The Department of Health are closing their eyes to this problem.  Do they know what is going on and are they happy it is going on? Have they taken any steps to investigate who is responsible for sending those girls out of the country to have abortions?  Who is making the arrangements?  It is very easy for them to say that it is a matter for the Garda and the Department of Justice. This matter calls for explanation and also warning of the dangers in relation to these activities abroad.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a very special tribute to the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and to the chemists for the stand they took in relation to the contraceptive campaign.  They acted correctly and wisely.  If there is no other voice in the House to express appreciation for the stand taken by the chemists of Ireland I want to do so now.  I want to express thanks for the firm stand they took at the time and which they conveyed to the responsible authorities.</P>
    <P>I want to make a very special reference, as a member of a health board since health boards were <Col N="1233" /> established, to a matter of vital concern to any constituency.  My constituency is within the midland region, which comprises four counties. I know the Minister for Health, like most Ministers from time to time, has to make some very difficult decisions but he will be faced very shortly with a decision, when considering the hospitalisation of the midland region, on the provision of a general hospital for that region.  I have made a number of submissions on various problems from time to time to the Government and I am glad to say that many of them have been acted on.</P>
    <P>I made a submission to the Minister for Health on 9th March, 1974 based on my dealings with the public, my knowledge of the midlands and my practical experiences as a public representative for over 30 years.  I was not concerned with the political aspect of it because if I was I probably would have given greater choice to my own county.  I wanted to make a submission which I felt was in the interests of health, the interests of the midlands and the provision of proper health services.  I refer to page 125 of the Fitzgerald Report, a much talked about document.  I do not know what has happened to that report, whether it is still active reading for the Department of Health or whether it is lying on the shelves of the Custom House covered with dust and cobwebs.</P>
    <P>This report dealt with the problem of the midlands.  I do not know if the officers of the Department of Health have goggles on when it comes to reading page 125 of the Fitzgerald Report.  It states:</P>
    <P>In the Central Midlands areas there are at present county hospitals in Portlaoise, Tullamore and Mullingar.  All these hospitals are modern buildings, they are comparable in size and the towns in which they are located are also comparable in size.  The three towns are situated on a line running roughly South to North: Tullamore is 20 miles north of Portlaoise while Mullingar is 22 miles north of Tullamore.  In our consideration of this area it was clear to us that the <Col N="1234" /> development of General Hospitals in more than one of these centres would be difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a sub-committee of the Cabinet already dealing with this matter.  Have the Department submitted to each member of the Cabinet on this sub-committee my submission of 9th March, 1974 so that I cannot be told later on they did not know anything about it?  I want that on the record of this House.  If the Department of Health have that submission I am sure it can be conveyed to the Ministers in the Cabinet sub-committee dealing with this and other problems.</P>
    <P>I want the House and the Minister for Health to understand clearly the problem in relation to hospitalisation in the midlands.  Whatever is done now is unlikely to be undone and whatever decisions are taken now will have an effect on the livelihood and the health of the people of the midlands for over 100 years from now. The Fitzgerald Report further states on that page:</P>
    <P>In considering the merits of the different centres we had regard to the impact of our selection on the areas to the north and to the south. If, for example, Portlaoise was to be developed as a General Hospital centre it would infringe on the area which one would expect might be served by Waterford General Hospital while Mullingar, if chosen for development, might be expected to draw patients from Cavan without adequately catering for the Cavan/ Monaghan area.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to this part of the report in particular.  I presume it has already been done by other Deputies for the constituency.  I want to go on record as strongly recommending the submission in the Fitzgerald Report on this matter.  Tullamore is roughly half way between Mullingar and Portlaoise. It is reasonably close to both and it is centrally located.  The entire area is now served by three hospitals. We feel that Tullamore has a strong claim for a regional hospital.</P>
    <P>The alternative to that is to have <Col N="1235" /> hospitals in Portlaoise and Mullingar. We are of opinion that the development of major hospitals in both those towns, which are relatively close to each other and which are within easy reach of Dublin, would not be justified. Accordingly, we recommend the selection of Tullamore as the centre for a regional hospital.  Tullamore has been recommended in the Fitzgerald Report.  I am not an Offaly man.  I am a Laois man.  Has the Fitzgerald Report gone down the spout or up the spout?  Is it covered with dust and cobwebs and placed in safe keeping in the vaults of the Custom House?</P>
    <P>Anybody who wants to cater properly for hospitalisation in the midlands region knows that there must be a hospital in Portlaoise and a hospital in Mullingar but, for major hospital treatment and attention, both of these hospitals can feed a regional hospital in Tullamore.  The Mullingar hospital and the Portlaoise hospital send patients to every hospital in Dublin.  There is enough pressure on the Dublin hospitals from the tremendously growing population in the city.  Nobody suggested, and the Fitzgerald Report did not suggest, that the hospitals in Mullingar and Portlaoise should be closed down or downgraded.  If they were expanded and extended they could function effectively and efficiently and, at the same time, they could feed the central hospital in Tullamore with patients who otherwise would have to be sent to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the attitude of the Minister's advisers on this matter. I am not happy with the attitude of Custom House bureaucrats telling us where the Minister should decide our sick people should be treated.  We are public representatives with knowledge and experience.  We have the capacity to know and understand this matter. We are members of health boards. Our advice and guidance should be of more importance than those of a civil servant who, apart from an occasional holiday, was probably never more than a quarter of a mile from the Custom House.  We know what we want.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> In a general hospital various units are required for general surgery, general medicine, ear, nose and throat treatment, casualty services, out-patient services, radiology, pathology, nursing training schools, and so on.  Are these to be attached to what are described as the mini-scale hospitals in Portlaoise and Mullingar? Is the midlands region to be the poor relation?  All the other regions will have their central regional hospitals but we are to have two mini-scale hospitals.</P>
    <P>A mini-scale hospital has not been defined but the fact that the word &ldquo;mini&rdquo; is used means that something will be lacking.  The Minister's advisers are being penny wise and pound foolish.  I want to go on record as uttering a warning against the provision of mini-scale hospitals in an area where experts have recommended that a general hospital should be provided to cater for the entire area but not at the expense of closing down the hospitals either in Mullingar or Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>What will happen in Offaly if the supposed mini-scale hospitals are approved by the Department?  Tullamore and the surrounding area has a population of 22,000 people.  It should be selected without question for a general hospital.  This country has not benefited from blessings from the present Government or from previous Governments.  Is it to be denied the solemn right which professional gentlemen recommended to the Department after an examination and a survey were carried out?  If these mini-scale hospitals are provided, possibly they will not be fully staffed and they will not be able to give the services which will be sought.  The people of Offaly resent this.</P>
    <P>I strongly and sincerely recommend that the idea of mini-scale hospitals for the midlands should be dropped.  If a job has to be done we should not consider halfpennies and pennies.  We should do the job properly or not do it at all.</P>
    <P>The establishment of such mini-scale hospitals will rob for all time the region of its own central and general <Col N="1237" /> hospital.  Or is it intended to depart from the regions altogether, to abolish the idea of regionalisation?  My understanding was that each region was to be an independent unit, with full health facilities of every kind, ensuring that the region was adequately catered for so far as hospitalisation was concerned.  There will not be a round the clock service in such mini-scale hospitals because the staff will not be available.  The highly skilled medical men will go to the general hospitals in preference.  As a result, we in the Midlands will be the victims of an ill-conceived and speedily taken decision.  I beg of the Minister to remain calm and not allow himself to be rushed into anything in this regard. The future must be considered when perhaps none of us will be here.  Let us not do anything which would be a hindrance to hospitalisation in the Midlands.  That is why I plead with the Minister to adhere to the decision of providing a general hospital for Tullamore.  Mini-scale hospitals, in my opinion, are nothing more than a doubling-up of the consultancy staffs of the present county hospitals. I want to know are people of some areas to lose their county hospitals so that this doubling up can be implemented, or can they be guaranteed any better service than they receive at present by so doing?</P>
    <P>At present 40 per cent of patients residing in the Midlands are treated outside the Midlands area.  This must and will continue if the suggestion of the mini-scale hospitals is implemented. There is an onus, not alone on the health boards but on the Department of Health, to provide the necessary services and cater for the 40 per cent at present being catered for outside the Midlands area.  I make this plea for the sake of raising the standard of medicine in the Midlands but, more particularly, for the health and welfare of patients.  Cannot it be argued in sane and financially wise terms that the best, surest and safest line of action is the provision of a central hospital for Tullamore, which I strongly recommend?</P>

      <P>In those few minutes I want to refer to Irish doctors who qualify here at great expense to their parents and others and then emigrate, which is a tremendous loss.  Practically every hospital in Britain and now many in Canada and the United States are being fully staffed by Irish doctors.  We export too many doctors and a survey taken has shown that more than 60 per cent of our doctors graduating over a five-year period emigrate.  That is a startling disclosure and one which must alarm us when we see shortages of doctors in so many parts of this country.  I cannot understand it.  Perhaps, when they qualify, they have a desire to go abroad.  But I feel that is not so.  There is employment available for them here and for that reason they should be encouraged to remain at home.</P>
      <P>I want to make brief reference to the provision of adequate accommodation for mentally handicapped children. There are quite a large number of mentally handicapped children being cared for at home who, despite allowances granted, would be much better off in suitable institutions.  But I deplore the fact that such mentally retarded children have to be sent to existing psychiatric hospitals.  We should make resources available for training the necessary staff, and I understand that it is the staffing of such institutions which constitutes the main problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to express appreciation to the Department of Health for all they have done for disabled persons.  Since 1st April, 1974, no person, irrespective of his income, need pay more than £4 per month in respect of drugs and medicines, which was a welcome provision. But, in view of the increases that have taken place in the price of drugs and medicines in recent times, this matter might be examined further. I shall not make reference to medical cards because I am a believer in free medical services.  I am not at all happy about the cost of the establishment of health boards at present.  I do not know what the ultimate result will be but I am a member of a health board <Col N="1239" /> and I am satisfied beyond all doubt that the extent of the improvement in our health services has not compensated for the extraordinary amount being expended.  There are too many officers and officials, too many file-keepers; there seems to be developing an overgrowing local bureaucracy in every area which must be scrutinised by the Minister.  It may be a difficult job to undertake but, once engaged in, would yield results.  I hope an effort will be made to improve general standards in future years.</P>

      <P>The Minister's opening speech to the House on this important Estimate, like many others, reflects the rate of inflation which has bedevilled every Department and is the cause of a lot of the trouble being experienced at present in relation to the social services and the whole economy. However, this debate is not one on which we shall harp again on the lack of attention being given to inflation, which is now accepted as having been caused in the main domestically.  The Minister's reference to the phenomenon of inflation bedevelling every health service in the world is not a sufficient excuse for the lack of effort being made to bring about some improvement in the rapidly ascending graph at present frightening our people.  The Minister's opening speech simply points out the additional expenditure being provided in the current year.  It continues to say that that will make for a little improvement in addition to the maintenance of existing services.  In other words, £29 million extra on current account will merely keep the show on the road. And that makes allowance for all the optimism written into what is, in the main, a speech which sought to bring in the bits of cosmetics that might dress up something in the absence of real, solid progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's statement about this very important Department was not very encouraging.  At the base of all our efforts in Government must be the health of our people.  In the absence of any real progress the Minister mentioned many unimportant items but did not neglect to have a swipe at the out-going Administration. <Col N="1240" /> This did not fit in with what should have been an important statement dealing with one of our most important Departments.  When he introduces that political note he builds up expectations of what is going to happen and then points out that such an achievement could not have been matched by the out-going Government. I do not know what that has to do with the health service.</P>
    <P>He outlined his hopeful plans for the future.  He also referred to the White Paper on Mental Health and Employment for the Handicapped which will be published at some time in the future.  He said that this would be an achievement of which all could be proud.  He also took credit for an &ldquo;overall hospital plan&rdquo;.  At column 53, Volume 281, of the Official Report he said:</P>
    <P>We will have taken the first step towards the creation of a fully modern, acute hospital system and solved a problem whose solution has evaded previous administrations.</P>
    <P>He is taking credit in advance for anything that will be done in the future.</P>
    <P>In the past there has been a proliferation in the Department of Health of committees, advisory bodies, councils and reports and before one report is properly studied, it is being superseded by another.  In his speech the Minister promised another report. That is one thing we are not short of.</P>
    <P>The Fitzgerald Report basically sets out a scheme for hospitalisation based on specialised services, bringing specialised services to the regions, proposed closures of hospitals&mdash;all of which met with opposition&mdash;extension of others and the building of new hospitals.  Comhairle na nOspideal made other suggestions and plans. They acted in great haste with regard to some of the changes for which the physical structure was not yet available.  On the whole, the regionalisation of the hospital system created a new basis on which any Minister could find ample scope and opportunity for vast improvement.  This system is in its infancy and still requires a tremendous amount of development, particularly from the <Col N="1241" /> administration point of view, to put it into shape as a properly geared and working system.</P>
    <P>What Deputy O.J. Flanagan said was true.  The cost of the health services is mounting at such a rate that one can hardly visualise where it is likely to end.  The uncontrolled and galloping inflation which we are experiencing at present can have a serious effect on people trying to live on a modest income and where the adjustment of such income has not kept pace with inflation.  These people may find themselves faced with very high health bills.  Health expenses are no longer paid by patients alone but by everybody who contributes through the taxes being foisted on them day after day.</P>
    <P>As I said, there are many committees, consultancy bodies and <i>ad hoc</i> councils making reports and carrying out examinations.  They would be better employed if they turned their attention to ways and means of getting the best health service at the lowest cost.  These matters must be tackled by any Minister or administration who wish to solve these very serious problems.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the health service is commensurate with the amount of money being spent on it.  I am not satisfied either that the regionalisation programme has, from the administration point of view, been as successful as it should have been or as, in theory, it was expected to be. I am prepared to accept that the development at the infancy stage may not be properly guided.  We should now be trying to get these regions working on a more satisfactory basis. A good many years have elapsed since they were first set up but we are not getting the improvements we were led to expect at the time.</P>
    <P>In the western seaboard counties a great many patients had to go to Dublin for specialist treatment.  The journeys were costly, putting visiting beyond the reach of relatives.  We thought then that by now we would have got rid of that by having larger hospitals providing specialist services within the regions, but we know that <Col N="1242" /> a great many patients still have to be transported to Dublin to get these services.  One must ask what efforts are being made to ensure that these specialist services will be made available within the regions.</P>
    <P>I agree with other speakers who said that adult health education forms the basis of any progressive health system.  If we are to examine the costs and to get the best possible return from the lowest possible budget, we must concentrate on adult health education.  We agree that the improvement in medicine generally has given us a new longevity average, that life expectation has been extended. The last speaker decried the use of drugs and said that people lived longer in earlier days without drugs. Everybody knows that is not so, that life expectation has been lengthened and child mortality reduced to a minimum. Geriatric services have been improved and extended and this is showing its effect.</P>
    <P>As I have said, adult health education would not only improve general health in the community but it would lower the cost of the services. The schools could be used during their many vacant periods for the teaching of the rudiments of better health.  I do not see how medical practitioners could be better engaged than in holding weekly or monthly clinics and lectures on adult health matters.  In this way a whole new era of preventive medicine could be established which would reduce costs and improve health.  The number of people eating and drinking themselves to death is very great and much of it could be eliminated if local GPs were to hold periodical clinics in local schools.</P>
    <P>The school medical service initiated many years ago has not been properly developed and this is the greatest sign of neglect in the health services generally.  No Minister for Health can boast of having made progress in the extension and improvement of the medical services who has not fully developed a proper schools medical service.  All of us could see the benefits of such a service where it was operated properly.  We have <Col N="1243" /> seen children with congenital troubles in poor families whose complaints would never have been attended to because of lack of medical examination if it were not for the school medical service.  It made it possible to have the complaints recognised and to have treatment prescribed which meant that these children were able to take their place in the world as normal human beings.</P>
    <P>While on this subject of the decline in the school medical service, it is necessary to say that the dental part of the school service is a laugh.  We are now in the days of preventive dental treatment and it is most essential that children should have their teeth attended to at an early age.  There are areas where the service has not been carried out for years and others in which it has not been followed up with required treatment.  We cannot say we have made progress in the medical service if we have not developed the most critical and essential part of the whole scheme, the school medical end of it.  A proper school medical service would mean a tremendous reduction in medical costs for many people in future years.</P>
    <P>Immunisation schemes are reasonably well attended to but are not publicised to the necessary extent.  Sometimes all that is given is a mere announcement in the church on Sunday that vaccinations or innoculations will take place in particular schools during the week.  I suggest that teachers might, with the aid of pamphlets, explain to children how imperative it is that they should avail of these schemes.  I ask the Minister to concentrate on this and I impress on him again the need to develop a good school medical service.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with adult medical education and have pointed out how essential it is that people should be instructed on what their habits should be and what they should avoid. These days one reads that something causes high blood cholesterol and that something else will be contributory to malignancy.</P>
    <P>Firms producing different foods and <Col N="1244" /> medicines are frequently disturbed by the misguided, unqualified statements made by any particular body when in most cases what is actually meant is that these things should be used in moderation.  Immense damage is sometimes done to the production of good foods by people being told they should avoid them, whereas it is their over-use that is to be avoided.  It is the Department of Health who should make official pronouncements on these matters and not leave it to the <i>Readers' Digest</i> or some other publications to make fantastic announcements time and again based on nothing but a small statement taken out of the context of a lecture given by some professor who stews up all sorts of exotic ideas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in order to produce a thesis or address some international medical body.  Adult health education in itself could eradicate from people's minds some of the misunderstandings and false beliefs they have in regard to certain commodities. There is a fortune to be made out of producing books on slimming, and I suppose that will go on to the end of time.  Here, again, immense damage can be done by people who are not qualified to give advice.  It is a matter for the local GP or the medical practitioner who is qualified in that field to give the proper advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other things which are habit-forming and detrimental to health which may be outside the scope of medicine to some extent, for instance, alcohol and drugs but, nevertheless, are very much a part of the medical field.  I do not know if there is proper co-ordination between the different bodies who deal with these problems.  The greatest organisation this country has ever had is Alcoholics Anonymous, and I am not too sure if they get the full support they deserve from the medical profession. The Minister should let us know if there is appreciation by the medical authorities of the immeasureable value of the work these people are doing, dedicated people, which is the basis <Col N="1245" /> of the whole success of that organisation.</P>
    <P>On the question of dedication, I wish to refer to the voluntary services in regard to health.  If we are to get the best possible services at the most reasonable cost to the country, we shall have to continue to expand the community service given by the voluntary bodies that have grown up and that are doing such a tremendous job. During our period in office we saw fit to introduce, for the first time the idea of subsidising people who heretofore were engaged mainly in raising funds by various means, voluntary subscriptions, giving them statutory significance and assisting them to carry out the important work which only they can do particularly in the field of geriatrics and many other fields as well.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Social Welfare, I have experience of the important work carried out by voluntary bodies generally. They perform a service which no Department could do by any payment of benefits by way of pension or otherwise. For lonely old people an organisation of this type is indispensable to every district.  It should be set up on at least a parish basis with proper co-ordination.  There is a council now and the Minister announced that he has added a few names to it to co-ordinate their efforts and to guide them generally in the immense variety of work they can undertake in the field of medicine as well as that of social service.  That is the direction in which we should move if we are to minimise the cost of the health services which are alarming at present.</P>
    <P>Apart from the proper organisation of the administrative staffs of the different regional health boards, there are many other ways in which the cost of medicine could be minimised.  I, too, like the other members of the party to which I belong, believe those who can afford it, should pay in order that the service may be properly developed for those who need the service and cannot afford it.  The insurance side is one direction in which much organisation is required at present. I am not sure that some people are quite clear as to whether the voluntary <Col N="1246" /> health insurance is a benefit at present.  With the abolition of the insurable limit, many people found themselves qualifying for health services for which they were already insured under the voluntary health scheme.  There is over-lapping there, and I would like the Minister to inform us to what extent this over-lapping has been examined, and to what extent it occurs.  Is it a fact, as I believe happens, that, in certain cases where people go to hospital, they can gain on their hospital bill, which may be attended to in two ways, through the social insurance scheme as well as through the voluntary health scheme.  At a time when the health services are costing so much, such overlapping is very serious.</P>
    <P>The voluntary health service is very important; for those who have no other service, it is essential.  In the case of people who have become entitled to services on the social insurance side which they already had through voluntary insurance there is need for a good deal of examination to ensure that there is not unnecessary expenditure in an area that is already too expensive. That does not say that we should not fully examine the possibility of having as much of the service as possible covered by voluntary insurance so that people pay where they are in a position to do so and that we develop the community service to the maximum because dedication, voluntary effort and local contacts and knowledge are the most valuable things we can have.  This would considerably reduce the cost of the health service and it is something to which the Minister should give priority.</P>
    <P>The Minister recited a litany of proposed extensions to hospitals most of them dating back many years and much of the planning already obsolete before the work has begun.  I wonder if plans regarding hospitals and structures associated with the health service are sufficiently researched in the long-term. One frequently sees that less than a year after a new hospital has been built there is a demand for an extension and by the time it is extended other facilities, such as theatre or kitchen facilities are not in keeping <Col N="1247" /> with the extended hospital.  Hospital planning should not merely provide for what is currently regarded as necessary based on bed turnover in existing antiquated hospitals but should take account of the rapidly changing outlook in medicine generally, the rising population, the higher marriage rate and lower average marriage age as well as the extension of the upper limit on the geriatric side.  Are all these things considered when planning, particularly movement of population in an area?</P>
    <P>I want to refer to what is happening in the north-west region, the one I know best.  When the Minister lists the building projects of the different health boards one finds it includes proposed extensions and buildings some of which have been on the drawing board for five or ten years.  We in public life who must frequently visit hospitals in our own area, always find there are unfilled expectations in respect of every building&mdash;proposed extensions, plans for improvement or rebuilding programmes long ago approved.  The increase in the Vote, which on the Minister's own admission will do little more than keep the show on the road, is not very encouraging as regards expansion of health services in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Chemists have recently been perturbed about their place in the health service.  I have no illusions about the problem involved but I hope the Minister will be able to approach all the sections contributing so much to the health service in an understanding way. At present a chemist would require an extra clerk to do the documentary work involved in the health scheme regarding the dispensing of drugs and provision of pharmaceutical services generally.  They complain that the time-lag in getting payment for drugs dispensed is unduly long.  When money costs so much everybody wants prompt payment and while bodies may be sure, they are not always prompt and much money can be lost on interest rates as a result of extended credit. Public bodies should give the best example in this regard and make payments promptly.  Chemists sometimes <Col N="1248" /> have to wait for periods which nobody in ordinary business life would tolerate.</P>
    <P>The chemist is playing a very important role in medicine at present and should not have to resort to selling costume jewellery and other items outside the pharmaceutical line.  The service he renders and his qualification to render it should carry the greatest weight and he should be involved as much as possible in the field of medicine, which is his proper <i>milieu.</i> Also, he is the source from which drugs and medicines should come rather than dispensaries and clinics.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse what others have said in regard to training of nurses.  Most hospitals seem to be understaffed and there is a tremendous demand for training.  Leaving certificate girls find it difficult to get into training hospitals.  There is need for the creation of a greater number of places for trainees.  The profession is one that requires dedicated people. I often marvel at the number of girls who are anxious to enter the nursing profession but there are many others who would embark on a nursing career too if the opportunities were available.  Many girls go to England to receive their training where it is easier for them to be placed than if they remained at home and, also, where the cost of training is much less than here.  Indeed, in most cases they are not required to pay any fee for their training.  Unfortunately, though, these people do not always find it easy to find places in hospitals here if they wish to return, although many hospitals are not staffed fully.</P>
    <P>Nurses have told me from time to time that, in order to overcome the difficulty of staff shortages, they must forego their days off.  That position should not prevail.  The conditions for nurses should be made as attractive as possible.  During the past few years tremendous advances have taken place in working conditions generally but there is much to be desired in so far as many hospitals are concerned.  I remember a time when psychiatric nurses found it difficult to get a half day off in the week.  They worked very long hours but the situation has improved considerably although that is not to say everything is perfect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> In his speech the Minister referred to his aspirations in regard to psychiatric treatment generally.  He mentioned the provision of units for psychiatric treatment at some general hospitals.  I wonder if this is a wise course.  Would it not be better to concentrate on improving the service in the existing mental hospitals?  Are we to create a situation where, supposedly, there would be a better type of treatment to be had at one place as distinct from another?  It would be wrong to provide a type of treatment at clinics that would result in the downgrading of that which is carried on in the existing institutions.</P>
    <P>In the field of psychiatric medicine, perhaps more than any other, there is much room for improvement.  Although big changes and improvements have been effected in the system, there is much to be done yet if we are to bring these institutions to acceptable standards and if they are to be as good as the hospitals or institutions where other diseases are treated.  The old image of the mental hospital with the huge community room, the padded cell, the enamelled ware, the flagged floors and the untrained male staff who were selected for their muscle rather than for their knowledge is best forgotten.  In those days the treatment carried out was practically nil.  The emphasis was on confinement.</P>
    <P>Any Minister for Health wishing to leave his mark on the health services has a fertile area in the field of psychiatric treatment.  It is an area that should have a high place on any priority list.  I do not know whether the Hospitals' Trust contribute anything to the improvement of the psychiatric institutions but if they do not, perhaps they would agree to devoting the profits of certain sweepstakes to this purpose.  This would be one way of putting a crash programme into operation.  I was a member of the board of a mental hospital for 14 years and during that time there were carried out what we considered to be vast improvements but, looking back, they were small enough.  Much change has occurred in public attitudes to all these matters <Col N="1250" /> and we must do everything possible to bring about the desired improvements. Every effort must be made to find sufficient money to enable us to take psychiatric medicine out of the context of the general health programme and to give it priority rating so that the necessary improvements can be carried out both in relation to the type of institution and service and to the type of equipment available.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of reports, among them the Fitzgerald Report, in relation to the improvement of the hospital service based on the provision of specialised services within reach of people in most areas. It is not possible to have a hospital at every crossroads.  Whenever there are protests about the closure of a hospital we are treated to statistics as to the length of time it takes to remove a person by ambulance from point A to point B and we are told of the risks of patients dying on the way. This is something we cannot completely avoid in any programme but there is reason, there is an optimum, and this should not be disregarded.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that in relation to the members of Comhairle na nOspidéal who are overconcerned with the technicalities on the professional side rather than the administrative and human side, I think public demand should play a more important part than it has been playing.  I saw the importance of the changes that took place in my county of Donegal where hospitals were proposed to be closed and catchment areas arranged for hospitals giving a bigger and better service, but the speed with which the closures took place was undesirable. I think that hospitals should have been phased out because many of them continue to give a good service.</P>
    <P>I do not want to burden the Minister with the now well-known problem of the Sheil Hospital in Bally-shannon, but it was a crying shame that, merely in order to conform to the whims of the specialist people in the field of medicine, the human side was overlooked and the wishes of the people completely ignored and disregarded. This is a hospital on which <Col N="1251" /> vast sums of money were expended in bringing it up to date&mdash;a good operating theatre and all the necessary services for surgical treatment&mdash;but which could be closed overnight and hospitals to serve the same catchment area found themselves not capable of handling the number of cases being sent there.</P>
    <P>This is something that requires the attention of laymen.  Their views should be heard and the service that was satisfactory should continue until such time as the larger specialised units would have proved themselves capable of dealing with the hospital requirements of the area.  That has not yet been reached.  In that hospital surgery was discontinued long before full preparation had been made to accept the amount of surgery going there in any other hospital.  It has been a tremendous set-back to the area.  Apart from all the other points that are put forward time and again, there are the matters of proximity of relatives and shorter journeys for patients.  These are all of very great importance.</P>
    <P>We accepted the discontinuance of surgery in Donegal District Hospital on the undertaking that we would get the new hospital to give a good medical service.  That is now in course of erection, but it is only a 30-bed hospital. I sincerely hope provision is made for its enlargement which will be demanded before it is officially opened.  It is evident that the number of beds is inadequate.  I was prepared to accept that we would get the hospital going, get it built, rather than to be arguing for years as to whether it should be a 30-, 50- or 60-bed hospital. The Minister will have to accept that there will be demands for an extension of this hospital before it is very long in existence.  That was the hope at the outset, that the planning would be such that it would make for the easy extension should it be required. There is no doubt that it will be required.</P>
    <P>The Sheil Hospital is capable of giving a surgical service for a long time into the foreseeable future and will be necessary to take the load off the Sligo <Col N="1252" /> Hospital for some time to come, and provision could easily be made on the basis of either visiting surgeons or a permanent appointment to ensure that this takes place.  Many people have been treated successfully there in the past.  Many notable personalities have undergone very successful surgery in this hospital and that it should be left entirely to medical treatment is absurb.  The Minister will be satisfied that in the view of a very large section of the community surgery should be permitted to continue there until it could be phased out at a time when the people felt satisfied that there was adequate alternative provision for the many cases which passed through the Sheil Hospital.  My main reason for intervening in the debate was to get the opportunity of saying that.</P>
    <P>We all know the importance of the larger hospital unit where you have specialised treatment in the different fields of medicine but we also know that there is something attaching to the smaller hospital.  There is a homeliness, a friendship, an atmosphere that is completely absent in the large unit.  Deputy O.J. Flanagan talked about hospitals in some of the larger cities of the world.  I, too, had occasionally opportunity to look into some hospitals in New York.  This is to be expected in a large city.  They are quite impersonal and the patient is merely a number.</P>
    <P>While large units may be acceptable and desirable, there is a limit to the size they should be, and when a hospital becomes a kind of campus and patients have to be indexed to the extent that they are mere numbers, it loses a good deal of the humane side of treatment.  This we had without doubt in the small units, and while there were other things lacking perhaps, they did give a good service in relation to straightforward surgery where there were no serious complications. They could still continue to do an excellent job and would take the weight off other hospitals where the bed turnover has to be so rapid that sometimes a patient has hardly had surgery until he is on his feet and moved to some other place in order to make beds available.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed that the Minister in his speech merely pointed out that the extra money provided was sufficient to maintain the service with a few improvements.  The field of medicine is rapidly developing from a base which permits tremendous improvement as time goes on.  The amount provided to cope with inflation is not a good enough contribution to what should be an expanding service on the capital and current side.  The Minister devoted most of his speech to what he proposed to do in the future.  We can all foresee thousands of necessary schemes but the Minister should have dealt more fully with improvement in existing ones.  The expectations generated at the time of the regionalisation of the health service have not been realised and the improvements in the health service which should have come about as a result of regionalisation have yet to be experienced.</P>
      <P>A lot of work has still to be done in order to consolidate the services set up and to improve the administrative side.  It will have to be got across to the public that they are getting full value for the huge amount of money the services are costing.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on his comprehensive and encouraging speech.  He has provided ample information and statistical evidence of the tremendous amount of work that has gone on in the health services.  There is general appreciation of the change that has taken place in the health services and of the burden of work placed on the Minister and those concerned with health. Health is a vital area and in this context the Minister for Health has a greater responsibility than many of his Cabinet colleagues.  Public representatives have also a responsibility in this area.  However, I feel less capable of discharging that responsibility efficiently and fully since I ceased to be a member of a health authority. That is not a criticism of the substitution of health boards for health <Col N="1254" /> authorities but it appears that while health boards carry a valuable element of worker participation and industrial democracy there is little scope for public representatives who are not members of the boards to express their views.  They have difficulty in representing fully the needs of their constituents.</P>
      <P>There appears to be an over emphasis on administration.  While administration is important it tends to become top heavy and in a service which was designed primarily for the well-being and health of the people most of the money goes towards administration. In my constituency the need for a forum on which to voice health problems is greater than any other area.  There is no advisory health committee in that area.  The Minister is aware of the circumstances involved. Cork county has been divided into three health areas&mdash;north, south and west.  Those in the northern and western areas were given a voice in health matters by being appointed to the local health committees.  A problem arose for the Minister and the Department when the extension of these facilities was requested in respect of the south Cork health area where there is a greater membership.  But the principle that a voice would be given to the people on health matters in their own area should have been continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the people in the other parts of Cork can voice their views at meetings of the health committees it is legitimate that the people of west Cork should aspire to this.  I appeal to the Minister to give to the people of this area, county councillors and other representatives of the community, a forum to express their views on health.  He can do this by establishing a health committee in that area.  The Minister said it was necessary for him to maintain a balance between the development of the community services on one hand and the building up of hospital services on the other.  The hospital element of the health service is very costly and labour intensive.  It demands a high proportion of the moneys made available to the Department.  There is a necessity for a rationalisation of that service and the location of major hospitals <Col N="1255" /> in future must be thoroughly investigated.  I know the Minister is concerned to ensure that the right thing is done for hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>Every Member has a special interest in the field of hospitalisation.  From my constituency the Minister met a deputation regarding Mallow hospital and I am convinced that there is an unanswerable case for the implementation of the suggestions put forward by those people.  I hope a decision in regard to this hospital will be made in the course of the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The element of entry to hospitals that comes to the notice of public representatives most frequently concerns geriatrics and here the balance between community care and the hospital service is most keenly felt.  With the present development of community care services there is a tendency to retain old people in their own homes where possible and this is laudable.  There is also a tendency to discharge old people from hospitals at an earlier stage than heretofore. This has caused unrest because the community care services are not sufficiently developed to cater for the old people who are discharged from hospital and also to cope with the demand for hospital beds for geriatrics. This is particularly the case where old people are living alone and there is much public concern for the health and welfare of these people. There is a great need for a fully developed community care service, particularly in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many old people are living with their families and here the situation is not quite so bad.  If old people cannot get any benefit from hospitalisation it is obvious that the proper place for them is their own homes.  However this imposes a financial strain on relatives which could be eased if the necessary financial assistance were given.  The home help scheme is of great help to the old and disabled. The allowance given to a prescribed relative is of considerable help to a son or daughter who is obliged to give up employment to care for an elderly person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> The most common situation is where a married daughter or a daughter-in-law cares for an old person but there no compensation is given.  In the eyes of the law the married person is not giving up employment to look after the old person and when financial assistance is sought under the heading of home assistance the people concerned are told the family income would not warrant it.  In the eyes of the people who administer the social welfare schemes the married woman is held to be maintained by her husband and therefore does not qualify.  This discriminates against married women who are giving a service to the elderly and who deserve remuneration for it. Because they are mainly the group who give that service, financial assistance would be of considerable benefit to them.  By caring for old people in their own homes the strain on hospitals is greatly eased.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the role of the community care services especially with regard to geriatrics and he stressed the need for such services. However it will require a very comprehensive service, not just for the elderly but for those in need of medical help.  In addition, an extension of the service provided by social workers will be required.  It has always occurred to me that as a professional group the scale of pay of social workers does not compare favourably with that enjoyed by other professionals. I suspect the reason is that they are mainly female workers.  Having regard to the increased emphasis on social work and the pressure of such work, their scale of pay should be brought more into line with that of other professional groups.</P>
    <P>It is frequently brought to the notice of public representatives that the accommodation in orthopaedic hospitals is inadequate.  There is a constant waiting list for beds in the Cork Orthopaedic Hospital and the only hope a person has of getting early treatment is to pay for a bed and the services.  That is a dreadful indictment of the present system and it is the best case that could be made for the Minister to bring about an end to the <Col N="1257" /> present system and give free hospital care for all.</P>
    <P>In a short time we will look back in disbelief and horror at the present system where, regardless of the extent or the degree of urgency of the illness, what decides a patient's admission is the ability to pay.  I was surprised to hear some Deputies dismiss the Minister's laudable attempt to end that kind of system.  Some of them called it a pipe-dream but that is not the cause because to settle for less would not be worthy of any Minister for Health.  I hope the efforts being made by the Minister to provide free hospital services for all will be successful in the near future.  He has encountered many problems and difficulties but it is my hope that he will be successful in what he is setting out to do.</P>
    <P>There is a constant demand by the public for extension of the medical card system and for an increase in the income limit.  I would definitely say without hesitation that to assume a husband and wife with £24.50 a week are capable of meeting incidental medical needs, such as family doctor and so on, is certainly not a fair assumption.  Indeed, any such assumption is bound to impose grave hardship on those concerned.</P>
    <P>We should appreciate that, no matter how well-intentioned the Minister is&mdash;and I know the Minister is well intentioned&mdash;there is a considerable financial problem involved.  He has told us that a £1 increase in real terms in the income guidelines for medical cards would cost £1 million. That is a very sizeable sum.  The question is: are we prepared to pay the price?  There is the additional problem that a particular organisation has already stated it will seek a review of fees if medical card holders go beyond 40 per cent.  We should not overlook this when pressing the Minister to extend medical card coverage. In fairness to the Minister, it must be said that, since he came into office, there has been a considerable extension. In December, 1972, shortly before the Minister took office, the number holding medical cards was 28.4 per cent; at the end of March, 1975, three years later, the number was 35.2 <Col N="1258" /> per cent.  While the Minister may have had no direct decision in the matter I am convinced it was certainly due to his influence that the number of medical card holders was extended. While we are all of us working towards completely free hospital care and a comprehensive free medical card scheme we must appreciate the steps taken in the interim to extend medical cards.</P>
    <P>There is a belief in the minds of some people now that medical cards are harder to get.  I believe the figures I have given demonstrate that there is no ground whatsoever for this belief. However it does appear to me that less discretion is being used in hardship cases.  This may possibly be as a result of the introduction of recoupment of the cost of drugs.  I believe a good deal of discretion should be used in cases just outside the limit. There are many people with long-term illnesses who do not qualify for special consideration, such as people suffering from asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and nervous disorders generally. Housewives suffer from nervous disorders and they need medication. There ought to be more discretion. Perhaps the scheme could be extended to cover sufferers from these long-term illnesses.  Those on incomes just outside the eligibility limit for medical cards do not always have at hand the money to buy the drugs required &mdash;the recoupment of drug scheme is an excellent one and all credit to those who brought it in&mdash;and they are not in a position to wait for recoupment. Hardship is caused in many cases.  Recoupment does not provide a total substitute for some kind of card, be it a personal card or a hardship card, and we should operate the scheme to a wider extent than it is being operated at the moment.</P>
    <P>We have all given an unqualified welcome to the choice of doctor scheme.  It works well in built-up areas.  There are however problems in rural areas remote from towns and the larger centres of population.  Doctors will not live in these remote areas. We have problems in my constituency. Recently a representative group in Ballyvourney, halfway between Macroom and Killarney, brought to <Col N="1259" /> our attention the fact that there is no doctor resident anywhere between Macroom and Killarney.  This is an area into which there is a tremendous influx of people during the summer months and the local people are aware of needs that could arise which will not be met unless some incentive is given to a doctor to reside in this area.  A better service to meet particular needs in local areas will have to be provided and that service will have to be on a par with the service provided in built-up areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to dental and ophthalmic benefit schemes.  He expressed some dissatisfaction.  We share his dissatisfaction.  Those with medical cards or limited eligibility do not receive the same treatment as do those who can pay.  The services provided cannot meet the demand&mdash;this is another problem&mdash;and there is a tremendous build up of people needing dental and ophthalmic treatment. Some solution will have to be found to this problem.  Where the school dental service is concerned, this should be extended into post-primary education.  Many children do not suffer any dental problems in the primary school; it is when they go into post-primary education that the need for dental care really arises.  Sometimes defects do not show up in the primary school.  There is no dental treatment for children in the secondary or post-primary school.  There is urgent need to extend dental services into both secondary and post-primary schools.  It is very vital in the teenage period.</P>
    <P>In the area of dental and ophthalmic services there is the old story of the insured person being covered for only partial benefit.  The provision of spectacles and dentures and payment for treatment, particularly in the case of the wives of workers of limited wages, imposes a great strain on these families.  If the health service is to be comprehensive it should cover all of these matters.</P>
    <P>The disabled person's maintenance scheme is a very good scheme.  I may have done so before but I would again compliment the Minister on invoking <Col N="1260" /> the regulation which made the scheme available to all disabled persons regardless of family income.  Before the Minister came into office the position was that the disabled person's maintenance allowance was based on a means test and if the disabled person lived with his family or if a brother or a sister in a family was deemed to be earning and capable of supporting him, the disabled person did not qualify for the allowance.  The allowance now, £8.60 for a single person and £15.75 for a married couple, is a step in the right direction. The allowance is rather small but it can be supplemented, perhaps, by home assistance.  Hopefully, the home assistance element will disappear and a scheme based more on the dignity of the person will be introduced in the very near future.  That would be a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>The whole question of rehabilitation and of allowances and grants for that purpose requires drive and I am grateful to find reference to this in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>The auxiliary care allowance of £25 in respect of children who are handicapped mentally or otherwise is a very good thing and, to my personal knowledge, relieves a great deal of hardship.  In many parts of the country there is still a waiting list in suitable homes for handicapped children.  It is not possible to give the treatment and care that is available in these homes in their own homes but where children have to be kept at home the hardship involved for the parents was relieved by the introduction of the £25 monthly allowance.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the remarks of the Minister on the care of the mentally handicapped and mentally ill.  Every Deputy who has spoken has stressed that it is an area to which particular consideration should be given.  We are dealing here with people who cannot speak for themselves.  An important barometer of the success of any Government's social legislation is the progress in the provision and improvement of services for the mentally handicapped and mentally ill.</P>
    <P>I hope that the AnCO training courses for instructors of handicapped <Col N="1261" /> persons will enable courses to be provided which will facilitate handicapped persons in becoming more self-sufficient and independent.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker was rather critical of the Minister in reference to a major White Paper on mental handicap and in regard to many of the aspirations that the Minister mentioned in his speech.  I have nothing but welcome for the Minister's statement. The discussion document issued by the Fianna Fáil Party this morning does not justify Deputy Brennan's criticism of the Minister's activities and plans in relation to health.  I have not been able to study the document in detail but I do not see anything new in it or anything inspiring or anything that has not been a feature of discussion documents on health for as long as I have been reading such documents.  It states the obvious.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that in real money terms there is a 6 per cent increase in expenditure in the three years that he has been in office.  At this time that is a considerable achievement.  The aim must be to provide free hospital service and a free health service for all.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister for Health well, and his Parliamentary Secretary and all those associated with the work that will have to be done to hasten the day when that service will be available. I sincerely hope that their ambitions will be realised in the current term of office of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Comment has been made on the amount of money the Minister for Health has made available for the health services.  There is obviously an increase in the amount of money.  It works out at about 16 per cent.  It is certainly not in keeping with the inflation which it has to meet over the coming year.  To this extent there must be some fall-back in the services that will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the remark that we will see a 1½ per cent growth in the medical services over the coming year and that a cost/benefit analysis was being carried out in the Department. One would wish to see this developed, to see how one could estimate <Col N="1262" /> growth in a Department of Health or in the health services and how one could quantify cost/benefit, because of the variety of services involved and the different age-groups that have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I have been a number of years in the medical service and I have seen changes, all of which have been progressive and of advantage to the persons who benefited by them.  There is a change in attitude.  When I first became a general practitioner the attitude at the time was to limit the services as much as possible and the medicines that were available were watched with a very careful financial eye.  This did not matter very much because most of the medicines that were available were not very beneficial. At that time if a doctor wished to order a particular medicine in a specialised group he had to get special permission from the board of health. That is not now the case.</P>
    <P>I have seen the growth of facilities made available.  Now there are orthopaedic services, E. &amp; T. services, maternity services, paediatric services and other more specialised services none of which were available as such 30 years ago.  No doubt these services will continue to develop.</P>
    <P>It is probably correct to say that a doctor's life is somewhat easier.  In the old days a great deal of a doctor's time was taken up with domiciliary midwifery.  This meant that the doctor could not plan his work.  I notice that last year only 633 women were confined at home.  This represents a big change.  Also, doctors now have more organised time off, with the permission of the Department.</P>

      <P>Before the introduction of the farm modernisation scheme the normal practice was for land project supervisors to attend the RDS Spring Show on a three-year rotational basis. In the case of farm buildings officers a staff conference was convened each year during the show week in the course of which officers were given an opportunity of attending the show.  This year, following the establishment of a single farm development service, it was decided to suspend these arrangements pending a review of existing practice in relation to all branches of the Department's staff and taking into account considerations such as the workload situation and the numbers and cost involved. A number of senior officers of the service did attend the show on official duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>At 30th April last, 1936 farmers in County Mayo had applied to participate in the farm modernisation scheme.  The number of these applicants then classified for the purpose of the scheme was 871 of whom 24 or 3 per cent were in the development category.  It would not be possible at this stage to say what number of farmers in the county might eventually be classified as development farmers.  The recent introduction of a lower comparable income figure for western counties, together with the impending implementation of the directive on disadvantaged areas should result in a significant increase in the numbers qualifying for development status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is now aware from the figures which he has before him&mdash;out of 871 in Mayo 24 are development farmers&mdash;<Col N="1265" /> that the directive is not suitable for this country?  As far as I know the income figure is £1,700.  In the figures published by the Agricultural Institute the average for the whole country was only £1,500 but it still will not bring in very many in the western counties.  Would the Minister not consider an intermediate scheme, as the directive seems to be excluding the vast majority of farmers in the western region?</P>

      <P>I want to say in reply to Deputy Callanan that the scheme is not mine nor was it my predecessor's because it was adopted eight months before we entered the Community. It is an EEC scheme, which we cannot just change overnight.  I have said on numerous occasions before that there is no point in our going for any significant changes in this scheme until we can say we have proved in practice over a period of at least 12 months that it is unsuitable in so many different ways.

      <P>The results of the farm income survey by An Foras Talúntais, which relate to 1973, do not provide a reliable basis for estimating the number of farmers likely to qualify for the development category.  My Department have estimated that 30 per cent to 35 per cent of farmers would be capable of achieving development status over the next seven or eight years.  An earlier study of An Foras relating to land potential for grazing here confirmed that this estimate is attainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acceptance by the EEC Commission of the Government's proposals to apply regional comparable income figures this year and the impending benefits under the EEC disadvantaged <Col N="1267" /> areas directive are expected to increase appreciably the numbers qualifying as development farmers, especially in western areas.</P>
    <P>Those not qualifying for the development category are, of course, eligible for a wide range of investment aids which are only marginally different from those open to development farmers and which are generally better than those available under previous schemes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of exports of certain Irish agricultural products to the UK, accession compensatory amounts which are being phased out over the transitional period, are payable as subsidies.  These are not affected by the decline in sterling when the net monetary compensatory amounts position between this country and the UK is taken into account. Indeed, their value was increased as a result of the changes in the representative rate for the Irish £ in October, 1974, and March, 1975.</P>
      <P>In the case of certain agricultural exports to other member states, the accession compensatory amounts are charged in the currency of the importing member states and, as the value of the Irish £ has fallen in relation to the currencies concerned, the equivalent in terms of Irish currency of these compensatory amounts has correspondingly increased.</P>

      <P>At a meeting on 16th May I informed the executive committee of the Irish Veterinary Union of the arrangements which I intended to operate in 1975 for the carrying out of blood sampling under the brucellosis eradication scheme and the programme of work under the BTE scheme.  These arrangements were decided upon only after prolonged discussions with the union and after taking their views fully into account. In so far as blood sampling is concerned the arrangements represented a considerable modification of my original proposals.</P>

      <Col N="1276" /> I have been informed by the union that their members, by general ballot, have rejected my decisions and are withdrawing from all State work from Tuesday next, 3rd June.

It is for that reason my question is directed to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries rather than to the Department of Local Government or Department of Justice, as well it might.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary throw any light on what is to be the situation for these people?  Will they receive compensation or not?</P>

Is he aware that these fishermen&mdash; three in particular&mdash;are in a dilemma whether to try and mend their own boats as best they can at the lowest cost, perhaps not in the best way, or whether there is any assurance forthcoming that they will be compensated? Surely this is a matter that the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary should try to tease out because it is a most unsatisfactory position and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is fully alive to this?</P>

I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ignore the question of the clean sheet in so far as his Department are concerned and to assume the responsibility that is his Department's, which is the wellbeing of these fishermen.  The Parliamentary Secretary should try to cut through the red tape&mdash;necessary perhaps in some cases but not in this one&mdash;to enable these fishermen get <Col N="1281" /> back fishing, earning their living, and stop this carry-on of talking about malicious injuries compensation and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about this specific case just now.  I should like to ask a general question.  Are the Department issuing a licence in control of the rights of the shorebed and the seabed?  Will they ensure the protection of any expenditure on planting and cultivation of shellfish by any licence holder?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked: &ldquo;are the Department in control?&rdquo; I am afraid they are not in sole control.  Fisheries are vested in the public.  When we announce that we propose to make an order and we get objections, these objections remove control from us.  In such cases we have tried to get local co-operation, or unanimity of opinion among the local people, so that objections will be removed or will be dealt with at local level.</P>
      <P>In this fishery at Cromane Bay, Castlemaine Harbour, the local objections prevent me from making an order. Legal opinion available says that it would not be proper for me to make an order until a compromise is reached on this objection.  That is the peculiarity of this law.  It could be said that the Department are not independent agents.  If they were, from the facts available in this case, I would have made this order.  I am hopeful that the local people will be able to sort out this question among themselves. If they do so, I shall be only too pleased to make the order.</P>

      <P>The order can be made if the Department are satisfied that the application is well founded.  I have power to make that order.  The problem of overruling objections exists in this and other cases.  By virtue of the peculiarities of the regulation it is not too easy to overcome objections in such cases because any citizen around the coast is entitled to object.  If <i>bona fide</i> objections are made they are very hard to overrule because fisheries are vested in the public and not in the State.  If they were vested in the State or the Department, that type of objection could be overruled.  Legal opinion tells me that I am not in a position to make an order until such time as I can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvements proposed for Moville Harbour envisage a new pier 159 feet long at its northern side, 147 feet long at its southern side and 61 feet wide at its outer end.  This would give a total berthage space of 220 feet, at the northern side and outer end, as against 183 feet under the scheme originally agreed with the fishermen. I am at present considering a proposal for the provision of an additional 147 feet of berthage space at the southern side of the new structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so but I think the scheme in hands will measure up to the fishermen's requirements. I was in Moville some time ago and saw the pier.  It is a very poor type of structure but the repairs being carried out will go a reasonable way <Col N="1286" /> towards meeting local requirements. Further schemes are being examined. I mentioned in the reply that I am considering a proposal for an additional 147 feet at the southern side of the new structure.  Perhaps I can meet Deputy Blaney in Moville when the present work has been completed and we can see what the position then is.  I have a nice sketch of the pier here and I can assure the Deputy the Department are mindful of the need to provide proper facilities there and that steps are being taken, that work is under way and that further efforts will be made in the future to ensure that the people of Moville will get the facilities they rightfully deserve.</P>

      <P>However, AnCO are keeping in close touch with the situation and if there is any undue drop in apprentice recruitment, they will endeavour to have the situation remedied.

It is understood that throughout the Community generally apprenticeship vacancies fall short of the demand and such vacancies have not therefore figured on the circulated lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the general shortage of apprenticeships throughout the Community, <Col N="1288" /> there are practical difficulties &mdash;language, educational qualifications, cost of travel and subsistence&mdash;facing young people from this country who might seek apprenticeships in other member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that about 52,500 students are expected to leave primary, post-primary and third-level education this year.</P>
      <P>The National Manpower Service are in constant touch with the official agencies concerned with employment-creation, namely, the IDA, SFADCo and Gaeltarra Éireann, about job opportunities in new and expanding enterprises.  The service are also in regular contact with a wide range of employers in the public and private sectors for the purpose of obtaining particulars of employment openings in prospect.  The information received through these contacts is used in the placement and guidance work of the service.</P>
      <P>I believe that at the present time the limited resources of the service can be more usefully employed in this type of on-going activity than in forecast-type surveys.  Besides, there is sufficient experience to know that such surveys would have severe practical limitations because of the frequent changes in the labour market and the inability of many employers to forecast their labour requirements even for a short period ahead.</P>

    <Col N="1297" />
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to changes in conditions that have taken place in health work and the extension of services with special reference to the fact that we have ENT services, orthopaedic services, maternity and paediatric services now which were not available to us when I began to practise medicine.  I said the life of the doctor had changed somewhat also, because maternity services are now mostly provided in hospitals thus not imposing on a doctor's time to the same extent as in the past.  We now have much more time off.  This became available some years ago and it has made a doctor's life somewhat easier.</P>
      <P>There are still pressures on those in general practice and whatever incomes we get we have to earn them reasonably hard and we must work fairly long hours.  There is also the pressure of the standard of medicine now available.  We must be more aware of what is happening, of how diagnoses are made, of the treatment available for them.  This means we must be better educated.</P>
      <P>A doctor's education is probably available to him from four or five sources at present: first, from his experience; second, from what reading he can do.  A doctor has not much organised time for reading because, with the best intentions, he may decide to study an article but the slightest interruption is likely to put an end to that study.  The third&mdash; and a very important source&mdash;is the information fed back to him from the consultants to whom he sends his patients.  Most of these consultants are very conscious of the work they are doing and have done and generally they try to make this available in detail to the general practitioner. Unfortunately, this is sometimes delayed and I would urge the Minister and the Department to ensure that the consultants have available whatever clerical staff they may need or whatever facilities they may require to get those reports out quickly in a form acceptable to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fourth source of education is the more formal education of post-graduate type whether it be obtained <Col N="1298" /> by taking time off or by time being made available for post-graduate courses.  All this adds up to the doctor being more efficient and making his services much more beneficial to those he attends.</P>
    <P>Another pressure has been removed from the general practitioner by the introduction of the fee for service.  It cannot be gainsaid that the ideal type of medicine would be where a patient could make a direct payment to a doctor for the services he gives.  This ideal obviously cannot be attained in our present society and we must do with something else.  The fee for service is a system that is acceptable to me and to many of my colleagues. Some do not agree with this; in the past there were very many more, but I never had any particular objection to State medicine within reason.</P>
    <P>In the past, with the medical card system, doctors found themselves in the frustrating position of having to carry an extra work-load without any financial compensation.  This is not so with the present system; a doctor is paid for any additional work he does. In spite of all those improvements there are black spots and, as far as I am concerned, a few very black spots. When Deputy Haughey had a motion in Private Members' Time recently I had a few minutes to say to the Minister that there was a grave obligation on him to try to remedy those black spots.  I referred to the dental services and the ophthalmic services which are anything but satisfactory.  The waiting list is too long.  This is a priority service and should be dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>In his introductory statement the Minister said:</P>
    <P>We must carefully look at the resources available for health care.</P>
    <P>Later he said:</P>
    <P>This is a problem of correct allocation of human and financial resources to meet the needs of the future.</P>
    <P>He also spoke of making the best use of additional resources in order to improve the health of our people.  This is one of the most important health areas which should be improved immediately. <Col N="1299" /> Other speakers have mentioned that personnel for this work may be scarce and difficult to obtain and suggested employing private dental practitioners to overcome the difficulties in that regard.  I would agree with those people who say that this would help to provide an answer to the problem on the ophthalmic services side.</P>
    <P>It must be very frustrating for patients who seek advice regarding dental or sight problems to be told that they are being referred to a clinic but that they must wait for perhaps six, nine or 12 months for this service. It is time that an effort was made to deal with the situation, a situation which arose because in the past dentists were not available to do the work involved and also because more people are in receipt of medical cards now than before.  What convinces people most of the need for medical cards is the cost of dentures and spectacles. While they may be prepared within reason to meet other smaller charges, they are not able in many cases to meet the cost of these services and consequently they must seek State aid when they require dentures or spectacles.</P>
    <P>Another black spot in the health service is the delay in respect of patients who are referred to consultants. These delays do not arise through any fault of the consultants but because the workload on them is too great.  Neither can the administrators of the health services be blamed because, to take my area as an example, at one time we had no orthopaedic surgeon whereas now we have three and an orthopaedic unit as well as three or four paediatricians and three or four specialists in the maternity field.  It seems, though, that they are not sufficient personnel to cope with the number of persons being referred to them.  This is another area to which State resources should be diverted.</P>
    <P>Many changes have taken place in regard to our hospitals.  I was the last county surgeon in Roscommon County Hospital&mdash;that was the old <Col N="1300" /> hospital&mdash;and I was the first house surgeon in the new county hospital. At that time there was one senior man at the hospital.  He was the county surgeon and he performed all the acute and chronic surgery cases for the county.  Also, he undertook a large amount of the medical consulting work as well as the more difficult of the obstetrical work.  He carried out all of this work with much interest for his patients but with a lack of consideration for himself and now that he is reaching retirement it is only fair that on behalf of my constituents I should place a tribute to him on the record as a way of expressing their gratitude to him for all he has done for them down through the years.  Later he was joined by a county physician, a very well-qualified man who also undertook obstetrics and it was a number of years before he got extra help.</P>
    <P>Now we have extended hospital services. There are chest and orthopaedic hospitals and a number of maternity hospitals but we do not seem to have an adequate number of beds.  One wonders how all patients can be dealt with eventually.  The situation, however, does not seem to be reflected in the figure made available to us because from my experience I doubt the figure of a 90 per cent bed occupancy.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies during this debate and on other occasions have referred to the desirability of keeping patients out of hospitals because of the high cost of maintaining them in hospitals. I can think of only one way in which this can be done but my suggestion would involve thinking which, perhaps, would not be acceptable to the Department of Health or to many medical personnel.  What I have in mind is to encourage some of those brilliant young men who are studying medicine to train themselves as general diagnosticians rather than embarking on the specialities.  We could place them in the county and other hospitals where they would undertake screening work for the general practitioner. They could make the decisions as to whether patients should be referred back to their GP's or whether <Col N="1301" /> they should be referred for specialist treatment.  This process would remove some of the workload from hospitals as well as enabling people to avail of specialist treatment more speedily than is the present situation.  Also, there would be less pressure on specialists.</P>
    <P>I do not expect that such a suggestion would be accepted by very many people in the medical profession because the whole tendency seems to be towards specialisation.  However, looking back over the years we know that those people who carried the brunt of medicine have been people such as county surgeons and physicians. These people had the wider training and I have no doubt that their work has made and is making a big contribution towards keeping down medical expenses because they are able to channel into the specialist services those cases which must have this specialist treatment.</P>
    <P>On the question of bed shortages one must think of the Fitzgerald Report.  In regard to our local situation it has been suggested that the County Hospital in Roscommon should cease to be a surgical unit.  The Minister has indicated his intention of making some announcement in this regard in the near future.  We do not know what he is to say but I cannot see how he or any of his advisers could recommend a reduction in the number of surgical beds there.  In the area in which I work I am served by three hospitals, Manorhamilton, Sligo and the County Hospital in Roscommon. Frequently when I seek beds in any of those institutions I am told that none is available.  I do not know how we could manage in Roscommon if the acute surgical beds were to be removed. There is no point in suggesting to me, for instance, that my patients could go to Sligo, Ballinasloe or Galway.  That would not be the answer.  It would only result in overcrowding those other hospitals.  In these circumstances the Minister must come to no decision other than one which would leave Roscommon County Hospital a viable unit and staffed as should be any hospital engaging in acute or any other surgery, <Col N="1302" /> that is, with, perhaps, two county surgeons.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into all the arguments which have already been gone into as to why an hospital should be in one place or another, because by and large I appreciate that in the long run people will go to the place where they will get the best service. If the planning people decide that those services will be a long way from them the people will go there but if they do it will be at great inconvenience to themselves, on the one hand, and on the other, at a greater cost to the State.  I have no doubt that if hospitals are placed or developed a considerable distance from patients, somebody will be coming into this House in the future asking the State to make transport services available to relatives to enable them to see patients in various places throughout the country, and remember, a first step has been taken in this direction already in that such services are made available to parents to visit handicapped children.  Travel will be getting dearer for the health boards and everybody else, and to visit these people in hospital will impose a big financial burden on families and indeed the transport of these people to and from hospital will impose on the health boards too.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to drugs. As far as I am aware, I have no drug problem, except the common one of drink and I join with others in deploring the fact that people seem to be drinking too much, particularly young people.  It has been suggested that doctors by holding adult education classes can do something to remedy many of these problems, but I feel that television would probably be a much more adequate medium for doing this. At least it would mean that people would not have to go out at night, leaving their homes and probably profit much more from it.</P>
    <P>On the drink aspect there is one remark I should like to make.  From time to time we see in the papers or we hear of the occurring of an accident and a doctor was not available to attend.  At times such as these, doctors come in for very severe criticism, <Col N="1303" /> and indeed at inquests from time to time this happens.  Nobody ever goes to the trouble of criticising the person who sold the cause of the accident, too much drink, or criticising the person who caused it for taking too much drink.  In my experience, it is true to say this is the cause of 99 per cent of the motor car accidents that I see around me.</P>
    <P>On the medicine side, where I work I have the responsibility of dispensing my medicines to the patients and one of the things that strikes me is the difficulty of trying to satisfy patients with a particular medicine, because of the fact that having come back from a hospital or a consultant, when a certain medicine has been prescribed and has been used in the hospital, even though I have available to me the same medicine by a different pharmaceutical company, psychologically in a number of cases this is not satisfactory for the patient.  This means that I have to order this extra medicine and find myself in some cases with three different bottles containing the same medicine but all of different colours.</P>
    <P>In the past, and I am sure it is so yet, doctors were very jealous of their own right to prescribe whatever drugs they thought best for the patient and were always inclined to resist what they considered to be the arm of bureaucracy interfering in their work. Nevertheless, I feel that something should be done about this.  Some effort should be made to standardise the medicines in the Department so that we could get away from this situation. There is no doubt that my suggestion will not be acceptable to the pharmaceutical companies either, but with the growing increase in the number of medicines available for conditions such as blood pressure, chest diseases and heart diseases, it is an aspect of the administration of medicines on both the medical and administrative side that will have to be faced sometime and a definite decision taken on it.  It would mean a special list for the purpose and this would create its own difficulties.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the school <Col N="1304" /> medical scheme and the Minister is exhorted to have it extended.  I have no fault to find with the scheme because it is better than nothing, but I suggest that it be replaced by a pre-school medical examination.  In the past, a former Minister for Health invited those of us in the Fianna Fáil Party to make suggestions to him for the improvement of different fields in medicine and I went to the trouble of writing something about the school medical scheme at the time.  I have no doubt that at this stage it lies an awful lot deeper in the Department's archives than the document which Deputy O.J. Flanagan has talked about having submitted.  Whatever chance his will have of being recovered, I am sure that mine will never be recovered. Nevertheless, I suggested at the time that in addition to the six weeks' examination which infants get now under the maternity services, a further examination be made available at the age of one year and a still further examination at the end of three years.  I even went into the detail of suggesting that from the six weeks this be recorded in triplicate, one copy to be sent to the county medical officer of health for permanent reference, another to a consultant if the occasion arose, the family doctor to hold the third.  Each examination would be documented, the papers being kept for future reference.</P>
    <P>I saw two good reasons why this system of examination should supersede the school medical examination. On the one hand, it meant earlier diagnosis of whatever defect the child might have, with particular reference to teeth and to eyes and indeed to the orthopaedic situation.  A further advantage was the fact that children having started school would have most of their health defects dealt with and there would be no need to upset their schooling by taking them out of the school to hospital at various stages and in this way interfering with their education, and particularly would be very important at that point.</P>
    <P>I know that there is a pre-school examination scheme being made available in some of the bigger centres but <Col N="1305" /> it is not being made available throughout the whole country and it is time this was done.  It was said in the past that by having the medical examination in the school it was possible to get around all the children but that is not true because children mostly in need of this examination will not go to school on the day the medical examination is scheduled to take place.  A further advantage of what I suggest is that the people who hold the position of assistant medical officers of health would, with training in infant development, infant diseases and paediatrics, be in a position to do further screening of the population submitted to them for examination. In turn this would take pressure off the various paediatric units which are not able to deal with the many problems they face.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most exacting specialities because so much time and detail must be gone into and recorded in the interests of the patient.  Anything that can be done to take some of this workload off the people doing it at present would be an advantage in the long run to those who need the service most.  In his statement the Minister emphasised the attention he intends to give to community care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on record now but I will give some thought to the Parliamentary Secretary's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community care is essential, particularly in rural areas.  It refers to those who because of old age or handicapped conditions are confined to their own houses.  These people need others to visit them and do messages for them. Often it is not on the medical side that these people need so much help but on the physical side such as procuring <Col N="1306" /> food and fuel.  In this regard some areas are doing better than others. In my locality&mdash;a rural mountainous area&mdash;under the auspices of the public health nurse a certain amount of free laundry is done and an effort is made to supply meals to these people throughout the week&mdash;not each day because that would be impossible.  We would benefit further if we had some extra help and this could be provided by a person visiting those people to do messages for them.  This service is more highly developed in County Leitrim. However, it takes so many people to do it on a proper scale, and the cost would be a prohibitive factor in the long run that we must depend on the voluntary effort to do it as well as we would like to see it done.</P>
    <P>I attended funerals and was surprised to see so many people assembled to do honour and respect to the dead person, because I was aware that the previous week that person had nobody to run messages for him.  Our public concern is shown in the wrong traditions. How much more comfortable and happier a person would be if the people decided to devote an hour a week to run messages for them.  I have been accused of putting forward a cynical view in this regard, but I still hold that view.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with others, particularly Deputy Mrs. Desmond, in urging that a female dependant allowance be made available to the daughter-in-law or daughter, irrespective of whether they are married or not, when they are looking after old or infirm people.  So many people get this allowance now that the few who are left out feel they are being discriminated against.  There is no doubt but that this adds to the independence of the beneficiary.  There are times when the people who are being cared for would like that little bit of independence in a certain situation and this can only be given to them in the form of extra financial help.  The Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Social Welfare, should see that this money is made available.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions I advocated that the Minister make provision for the situation where a wife <Col N="1307" /> becomes ill or has to leave home for maternity or gynaecological services. As a result the father of the house has to cease work to care for the children.  As far as I am aware there is no service which can legally be made available to that man during that period.  He may seek unemployment benefit but, strictly speaking, he is not unemployed.  He may decide to seek a certificate for ill-health but, irrespective of what criticism is offered of workers, in general not that many are prepared to do that; they are prepared to make the sacrifice and care for their family.  This is a big imposition on a wife because many are reluctant to seek the medical service they badly need because of the difficulties that will arise if she has to go away for treatment.  The Minister should provide an extra service in this regard or make a new payment to a husband who finds himself in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>In my experience the health services have improved irrespective of what Minister was in office.  I have no doubt the services will continue to improve and that this Minister has as much concern for the individual as anybody else, but I make one qualification. I cannot understand why the Minister proposes to make beds available to the higher income group in the circumstances prevailing at present.  The Minister stated that the resources should be made available to those who need it most.  If the resources are to be used they should be used for the benefit of the handicapped before they are made available to those in the higher income group.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why pressures are coming on the dental and ophthalmic services is because the number of medical cards has increased.  If people are approved by the board for medical cards it is their right to have them, but if we are now to approve of letting in another 10 per cent or 15 per cent of our people under the general medical services at hospital level the people who will suffer are those who cannot under any circumstances provide for themselves.  One Deputy has <Col N="1308" /> stated he would be glad to take his place in the queue in those circumstances, and that is fair enough; but if he is going to deprive somebody else of a bed it is a different matter.  I cannot see this as a working proposition unless the Minister takes over all hospital beds and private nursing homes. I mention nursing homes because many people in the higher and middle income groups who are in the VHI now go into private nursing homes. But for this the public hospitals would not be able to accommodate the people who need the beds.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the biggest black spot in the medical services is the ophthalmic service for people in the middle income group who have not medical cards.  These people are not able to pay the costs involved and I would ask the Minister to give them some assistance towards the costs of dental care and also for the provision of glasses.  When he has given this aid he may then extend the hospital services to the higher income group.  I am not a socialist; I do not care how the medical services are made available. I am concerned that they be adequate for those who cannot pay for them, while paying the people who are providing the service a reasonable amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the delay in the announcement by the Minister regarding the plan for hospital development.  It is very easy for Deputies to say it should have been announced a long time ago but the Minister must consider many factors. He must decide on the geographical position of the hospital and the population that will be catered for, as well as many other factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every medium-sized town there are pressure groups who consider their area should have a regional hospital. For the last number of years I have seen such groups on many deputations here but when these people or their families fall ill they do not go into the small hospitals.  Like many Members here, these people are covered by voluntary health insurance or have the money available to pay for themselves or members of their families in <Col N="1309" /> the best hospitals in Dublin.  If the regional hospital programme is to get off the ground, the hospitals must cater for the better-off section of the community.  A health service will not succeed unless everyone is treated on the same level.</P>
    <P>The pressure groups to which I have referred somewhat amuse me so far as hospitalisation is concerned. There may be commercial interests involved but such interests should play no part in the provision of a hospital. I am a businessman myself and I like to sell and get as much profit as I can, but I am not prepared to allow commercial interests to extend to the area of hospitals.  I agree fully with the Minister's action in not making a decision immediately.  His decision will have an effect for a number of years and it is essential that it be the correct one.  Regional hospitals must be located in large centres.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons referred to the Fitzgerald Report in connection with the Roscommon hospital.  Some kind of federation will have to be reached between Roscommon and Ballinasloe if we are to have a hospital.  A representative from Roscommon might make the point that if it is essential to have a regional hospital in Galway it is not essential to have a regional hospital in Ballinasloe.  I do not want to advance the case for Roscommon at the expense of Ballinasloe; when a person adopts such an attitude it weakens his own case.</P>
    <P>The Fitzgerald Report recommended that Roscommon hospital should no longer have a surgical unit.  The Minister will have to consider seriously the situation.  As he will have all the relevant facts and figures he will be in a better position to make a decision but I cannot visualise the people of my constituency getting a proper service if there is not a surgical unit in the Roscommon hospital.  I should like to pay tribute to Mr. O'Hanrahan the surgeon who has given a good, cheap service to the people of the county for the past number of years. It is unfortunate that he has reached retiring age.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal consists of 23 members, 12 of whom must be <Col N="1310" /> consultants.  I do not wish to take advantage of my position in this House but I must point out it is easy for consultants to decide the future of a hospital in so far as appointments are concerned.  The Minister should consider increasing the board to 24 members.  He could appoint eight consultants, one of whom is a dental consultant, there would be eight nominated by the Minister and one from each of the eight health boards, making a total of 24 members.  People would be much happier about decisions coming from such a board.</P>
    <P>With regard to home care schemes, an allowance should be paid to anyone who resides with and cares for an elderly person of 68, 69 or 70 years. Ultimately it would be much cheaper on the Exchequer when one considers the costs of hospitalisation.  If an elderly person who is living with a married son or daughter falls ill it is natural that his family will try to get him into a hospital or a community care centre.  That is understandable. There may be many reasons why they cannot keep these elderly relatives in their own homes. If they were to get some kind of allowance that would be an encouragement to them to keep elderly relatives at home.</P>
    <P>The Department should give serious thought to a housing scheme like that carried out by the St. Vincent de Paul Society in Ballinamore, my home town. I am a member of the society.  Earlier on we reconstructed four houses with the aid of grants from the Department of Local Government and the county council.  When the scheme was completed we housed four elderly people. Some years later we purchased a site on which we built 12 houses and these houses are accommodating both married couples and single people; in all 18 people are accommodated.  If this accommodation were not there they would be in institutions.</P>
    <P>We have also built a community centre.  I tried to get the Department of Health interested in the scheme at the time without any success.  The centre was grant-aided in the normal way by the Department of Local Government and we receive a grant <Col N="1311" /> of £50 a year from the local authority. If the Department of Health are anxious to get schemes like this off the ground they will have to make up their minds to giving substantial grant aid.  It is a joy to talk to the people in the community centre.  The members of the local St. Vincent de Paul Society and others give two or three nights a week in the centre and the people who avail of the centre are far better off than they would be in any county care hospital.  I believe there should be much more development of this kind.  We had to borrow a substantial amount from building societies but out of the rent we receive we are able to pay off the money owed to the building societies.  The Department of Health will have to come round to grant-aiding these schemes. One thing is quite clear and that is that elderly people do not want to go into community care hospitals.  We have a problem in Leitrim because we have the highest percentage of old people in the country.</P>
    <P>Coming now to medical cards, up to a few years ago a man and wife with an income of £18 a week did not qualify for a medical card.  I think the figure was £14 a week.  In the past two years the figure was increased to £17, then to £20 and now it is £24. That is a considerable step forward and I have no doubt the ceiling will be raised again in the near future. Great progress has been made.  I remember when a poor person would come looking to one at night to write a ticket for a local doctor; they had to get by the person who issued the ticket and then the dispensary doctor. Two years ago approximately 28.4 per cent had medical cards; today the figure is 35.2 per cent.  The Minister is to be congratulated on that.  Now that drugs and medicines are so expensive those with an income of £24 a week would find it utterly impossible to pay for drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>I want to raise now a matter that I have raised with the health board. There are people in St. Patrick's Hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon; five of them are suffering from arthritis and they spend the day in a wheel chair. Prior to the regional health boards <Col N="1312" /> these people were in receipt of £3 a week from the local authority.  Then some genius in the new health board decided that the law prevented him making this allowance and he stopped payment.  For six or eight months these people were without any allowance whatever.  The health board promised me they would look into the matter and these unfortunate people are now getting £1 a week whereas four or five years ago they were getting £3 a week.  One patient is a married man whose wife is dead.  He has no one belonging to him and he is dependent on the generosity of the people who visit for the price of a few packets of cigarettes every week. Another was one of a very large family most of whom have emigrated and some of whom are sending him money.  The Minister should look into these cases.  I am not at all satisfied. I would not want to live in a society which treated people like that and I doubt if the Minister or any other Member would want to either.</P>
    <P>Where the allowance of £8.50 a week to the disabled is concerned, the Minister is to be congratulated on the change he made; the income of no other member of the family is now taken into account.  The amount paid to both a single man and a married man is identical.  Now a married man who is disabled may have dependants and I think he is entitled to a higher rate of allowance.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are doctors who find it impossible to get jobs at home and who emigrate.  They were educated at great expense and it is unfortunate that they should have to emigrate in search of a job.  According to an article I read recently 50 per cent of those who qualified last year had to emigrate.  Side by side with that we have a number of doctors from outside the country working in our hospitals. If anything can be done to rectify that position it should be done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Minister thinks that the Estimate for his Department is the most important but all Deputies would agree that because of its very personal nature and the direct effect it has on almost every family <Col N="1313" /> the Estimate for Health is one of the most important that comes before the House.</P>
      <P>One is struck by the great emphasis the Minister places in his speech on the necessity to have a cost-benefit analysis of the various services.  This is something that has been introduced in many Departments.  I hope that as applied to the Department of Health the exercise will be carried out quickly and much more efficiently than has been the case in a number of other Departments.  I would strongly urge the Minister not to allow cost to be the sole criterion, the be all and end all.  The various social implications and needs should be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The Minister, naturally I suppose, stresses the developments which he described as of major priority.  In truth, many of these services have been evolving for some time.  The Minister may have placed special emphasis on them but credit should be given to his predecessors who in their day helped to evolve and set in motion some of the services that are now taken as part and parcel of the health services.</P>
      <P>At this stage what I or any Deputy who comes after me may say will probably be repetition of what has been said already.  Many Deputies and indeed, the Minister, laid special emphasis on the cost to the State of hospital charges.  The Minister said, that the actual cost is 50 per cent of the cost of all the services and that 40 per cent of the personnel involved are connected with hospitals.  This is by far the most expensive and capital intensive part of the services.  Therefore, it is essential that the attention of the Minister and the Department should be turned towards the need to reduce, if possible, the emphasis on hospital care and to the introduction of services that would help to reduce these costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Gibbons, who is a doctor, referred to the school medical examination service.  This matter is so important that it can be mentioned again.  The suggestions made by Deputy Dr. Gibbons could be examined. I am glad that the Parliamentary <Col N="1314" /> Secretary asked the Deputy to give them to him in writing in some detail.</P>
    <P>I am also of the opinion, having talked to a great number of doctors, that a system of pre-school examination could result in a reduction of the need for hospitalisation because defects and abnormalities would be discovered at an early stage and could be more easily dealt with.  Such examinations would provide an early warning service which would save considerable expense later.  It would be necessary, of course, to reconsider the system in operation at present.  It would be necessary to consult the general practitioners.  There would certainly be a need to retrain the existing school officers.  Such a scheme would be costly but the expenditure would be quickly repaid.</P>
    <P>Last year only one-sixth of school children in the Western Health Board region were examined under the school medical service.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that when Deputy Dr. Gibbons, who has tremendous experience over a long number of years, contacts the Parliamentary Secretary his views will be seriously considered. This could also apply to the dental service.</P>
    <P>Continued expansion of the community care service is yet another way in which the great dependence on hospitalisation could be reduced.  The Minister recognises this but says, as is of course correct, that he has to look after all the other services.  Community care is very important but it is particularly important in the Western Health Board region which contains two of the biggest counties in Ireland and County Roscommon.  The area is vast and there are a considerable number of elderly persons there who are living alone.  A large number of them are visited by members of voluntary bodies.  I should like to put on record my appreciation of the tremendous work being done in the Western Health Board area, particularly in County Mayo, by voluntary organisations in the matter of community care.</P>
    <P>No praise is too high for those involved. They come from all age groups <Col N="1315" /> and provide, and will continue to provide on an ever-increasing basis in the future, the manpower necessary for this service.  Most of these organisations receive some financial assistance, but because of the way costs continue to rise and the ever increasing number of services they are being asked to perform they will need increased financial help.  I believe the greatest service they provide for people like this is the human contact.  In certain areas in County Mayo it is not the laundry service or the meals on wheels that give the greatest satisfaction to those visited but the fact that they meet and talk to people and they can sit down in their own homes and discuss various happenings.</P>
    <P>In County Mayo there has been co-operation with the Western Health Board, the various voluntary bodies and the county council.  The public health nurses, who do a wonderful nursing job, keep the county council informed of the housing conditions of the people visited.  In this way they can help to some extent to keep the expenditure on hospitalisation down.</P>
    <P>Last year when I spoke on this Estimate I asked the Minister what the position was in regard to the appointment of a medical officer at Ballina District Hospital.  I now have to ask him again when that medical officer will be appointed.  He should accede to the request made by every organisation in the Ballina area, agreed to at a meeting of over 500 people representative of all the organisations in north Mayo.  The Minister has met two deputations in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister should appoint immediately to the district hospital a full-time medical officer.  There may have been too much emphasis placed on the question of a consultant.  He should appoint a full-time man to the job, pay him what was given to the former occupant and also money for the 500 patients he is to be given from the GMS.  I believe he will then get somebody with qualifications to satisfy the people in the area.</P>
    <P>What is the position in regard to the expansion of the specialist clinics at <Col N="1316" /> this hospital?  The provision of those clinics would take the load off the County Hospital in Castlebar and would help considerably to reduce the queues there.  Earlier today Deputy Flanagan mentioned the large number of people who are called to a clinic at the same time.  This can result in people called to the clinic at 9.30 a.m. or 10 o'clock in the morning.  They must wait all day until such time as the specialist has gone through his list.  I know of cases where people have to travel 40 miles to a clinic which starts at 9.30 a.m.  They have to wait there all day, sometimes without any food, until 4.30 or 5 p.m. before their turn comes.  They then have to travel home another 40 miles.</P>
    <P>An expansion of the specialist clinics at the District Hospital in Ballina would help to alleviate that problem. As the Minister is also aware, there will be considerable need at the hospital in the future, due to the industrial expansion in the area, for extra services.  In the natural course of events many minor accidents are likely to occur which could be dealt with in Ballina if certain facilities were provided. I should like to record my own thanks to the staff, the doctors and the matron of the District Hospital for their courtesy, efficiency and kindness in dealing with an accident which occurred to a member of my family. Their efficiency and courtesy is one of the reasons why the people in the area would like to see the hospital expanded.</P>
    <P>We also await in the Ballina area a welfare home, which was one of those planned by the county council prior to the establishment of the Western Health Board.  I am glad to say two of those homes have been opened recently and I would like to compliment all connected with them.  They are a credit to everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>In so far as people can be happy outside their own homes, the people who reside in these homes, especially when they are in their immediate areas, will be happy and contented.  I hope the Department of Health will use these welfare homes as a focal point or a centre for all the community care services.  I should like to see them being the hub and the meeting <Col N="1317" /> place for voluntary bodies who staff the community care services.  I should also like to see them being used as day centres where people from the area who are fortunate enough to be able to remain at home can come in and talk to their old friends.  This would be of tremendous benefit to all.</P>
    <P>There has been much emphasis over the past number of years on the question of drugs.  There is not much drug use or abuse in my area.  We have the problem of alcoholism.  I am glad to see that the advertisements against the rounds system, which is the curse of drinking, are continuing.  If possible I should like the Minister to control some of the advertisements directed towards young people.  These advertisements extol the virtues of this beverage or that and they insinuate that the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing is to drink such and such a beverage.  A lot has been said about the number of young people who are drinking.  I submit there are very few other places for them to go.  The lounges and singing bars and singing pubs are much more attractive than some of the dingy meeting rooms which go under the guise of community halls or centres. While I know this is not the responsibility of the Minister of Health, he should urge the other Ministers responsible to make available more money for the provision of community centres and sports halls.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to a matter which has been raised in the House with a number of Ministers.  I appreciate and acknowledge that the Department of Health recognises alcoholism as a disease.  I would ask the Minister to convey to some of his colleagues that this is so.  Particularly I would ask him to intervene in a case where a man was examined in 1971 and was sacked in 1975 on medical grounds.  His own doctor now says that his problem is almost controlled. He has been told he can appeal but, despite the fact that the only grounds he can appeal on are medical grounds, he has not been, and he will not be, furnished with a copy of the medical referee's report which it is alleged was the reason why he was sacked.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan spoke very <Col N="1318" /> strongly this morning about abortion. Very few people would not agree with the sentiments he expressed.  The community should look inward at itself. We should become much more understanding of and adopt a much more Christian attitude to the girls who have had to go to England.  If we adopted a much more Christian attitude to them, probably many more of them would remain at home and have their babies here and be integrated into normal society.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in the western health region, particularly in Mayo, is the very long and annoying delay in the provision of dental services. The dentists in the public service are working as hard as they can but there are just not enough of them.  My information is that the problem will be enlarged because of the fact that a number of private dentists who were doing work for the Department of Social Welfare are now about to withdraw from the service because of the inadequate scale of fees offered to them.  As I understand it they are offered £1.40 for one extraction, £1.60 for two extractions going up to £7.40 for 32 extractions.  I am asking the Minister, under his other hat, to take cognisance of this threat of withdrawal and to come up with realistic salaries and fees for dentists.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies mentioned the question of medical cards.  There has been an expansion in the number of cards available.  A case came to my notice recently of a son who supports his widowed mother who applied for a medical card.  Because he was earning approximately £21 a week, he was not entitled to a card, at least he was so informed by the Western Health Board.  Such people should be considered to be in the married category because, in a number of cases brought to my attention, they were the sole providers.  The mother held a card but because that son was at home and his earnings over £14, he was not eligible even though he was the one who contributed to and supported the household.</P>
    <P>Recently I came across a number <Col N="1319" /> of cases of people with medical cards who having been in hospital were, for some reason unknown to their families, billed.  On inquiry, I was informed they had opted to be private patients.  They were afforded no different facilities; they were entitled to the services because they held medical cards.  Why they opted to be private patients without informing their families I do not know.  That is something which should be clarified with the various boards.  People should be informed that, if they hold medical cards, they are entitled to avail of the full range of services, including hospitalisation, without having to pay extra.</P>
    <P>Another complaint made sometimes with regard to medical card holders is the long delay they experience before they can have certain operations performed.  Yet their own doctors, by sending them in as private patients, can arrange for them to get the services for which they would have to wait months if they went through the county hospital.  A lot of people accept that service under the illusion that they are entitled to it and it is only when the enormous bills arrive at a later date they realise their error. I have seen people under very severe strain on account of medical bills received when they went to an institution or hospital under such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the disappointment felt in the Western Health Board and region at the capital allocation to that board for new work this year.  I think the amount is £50,000, which was a grave disappointment to the members of the board.  There is also some little confusion in that the ordinary revenue account has not yet been settled.  I understand the instructions given are that work should continue and that money will be made available.  But there is a certain amount of fear, that, at some stage in the near future, the Department may say &ldquo;stop&rdquo; and that services which might have been stretched out will have to be curtailed or terminated.  I would ask the Minister, as a matter of urgency, to expedite <Col N="1320" /> the development work at Castlebar Hospital.  His officials have been in the hospital on a number of occasions and have been shown its defects. They know the need for the work involved. The hospital authorities are unable to comprehend why they have not been given the all-clear to go ahead with this necessary and urgent work.</P>
    <P>One of the welfare homes also to be constructed in the region is at Kiltimagh. Perhaps &ldquo;constructed&rdquo; is the wrong word to use in this context because there is a building which needs to be remodelled and reconstructed but which is at present occupied by the Garda.  Possibly it is a forerunner of the welfare homes in that it is a small cottage hospital.  Perhaps the Minister would request the Minister for Finance, through his Parliamentary Secretary, to expedite provision of a site for a new Garda barracks at Kiltimagh as a matter of urgency, so that the cottage hospital can revert to fulfilling the purpose for which it was intended.  I know a number of sites have been offered.  I know that one or two have been offered in the town centre.  All that is required is the money from the Department of Finance to buy the site and have the new barracks erected.</P>
    <P>One service that has caught the imagination of the people of Mayo is that for the mentally handicapped. This is a county-wide organisation, an organisation having contacts with every home in the county.  It is an organisation comprised of some of the most dedicated and unselfish people it has been my good fortune to know. I would urge the Minister&mdash;and, in this case, I know I am flogging a willing horse&mdash;to continue his aid to the mentally handicapped and to expand the services available to them.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable criticism from time to time as to whether the health boards have proved satisfactory. I am not a member of a health board but, in my opinion, all the services available in the region are better than they were prior to the establishment of the boards.  Of course there are faults.  In this world there always will be faults.  If the original concept of the board can be pursued, <Col N="1321" /> the people in any specific area will receive a far greater range of service in that area than could be provided on a county basis.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister consulted the Minister for Justice and had a look at the rules and laws which say that a man or woman can be put into an institution on the say-so of a relative or friend.  I read some reports lately and know from experience of some cases.  Even if only half of what I read is true, it is more than time that this situation was looked into. More than a doctor's certificate should be necessary to put a relative into an institution.  There should be greater control of examinations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to a very few points.  In fairness it must be admitted that I am not saying this because we belong to the same party.  In my view the Minister is making a very great effort to improve the health services in general. I am now thinking of the numbers of people covered by the medical card service.  This is an on-going service. We should continue to increase the numbers of medical card holders until most of our people are covered by the full health services, irrespective of whether they have money in their pockets or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People would gladly make a contribution if they were sure that the different services would be available to them.  This should also include the general practitioner service and drugs in particular.  I do not know what the amount of the contribution would need to be, but an effort should be made to let the people know just how much they would have to contribute to be covered for the drugs which their doctors might prescribe.  In many instances people who are just beyond the limit for medical cards are not very worried about doctors' fees but they are very worried about the drugs he might prescribe, which very often are of a continuing nature.  A man who needs very expensive drugs to keep working may be just outside the limit for a medical card.  I know these things may be taken into account but sometimes these people may be outside the special case limits.  A medical card <Col N="1322" /> service which would cover drugs and medicines should be given to all our people.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the health boards and the passing of the Health Acts a few years back the people in my constituency have not been getting as good a service as they admittedly should.  The service has improved but I believe it would have improved anyway. I am convinced that the health boards have not been giving value for the money invested.  We have set up a new system of administration.  This administration is further from the ordinary people than they were under the various local authorities.  We in Kildare had a service equal to or better than the service we have now in the larger area.  Our people are more remote from the decision-making processes of that service.  The officials operating the Eastern Health Board in Kildare have very little decision-making power.  Most of the decisions are made at a higher level in Dublin. They are very far removed from the public representatives or any form of contact with the ordinary people in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The health boards did not bring about the improvements we expected when they were introduced.  As a matter of fact, they have not given the service we should have expected from them, taking into account the extra amounts of money involved in their administration.</P>
    <P>The limited choice of doctor scheme for medical cardholders could and should be improved without any great effort.  I fail to understand the argument that someone must either die or retire from the panel of doctors in an area before another can be appointed.  When I heard that people would not be confined to the dispensary doctor when the new Health Act was introduced, I was delighted because I thought and believed they would have a genuine choice of doctor.</P>
    <P>Doctors in my area serving people in a private capacity are not taking those with medical cards.  This does not leave the people with medical cards a choice of doctor.  If such <Col N="1323" /> people want to choose a doctor, who is fully qualified to look after their needs, all doctors engaged in private practice should take those people on as well.  The panel system should be done away with.  As the system is operated there is no choice of doctor in most rural areas.  Usually the only doctor available is one who attends a dispensary once a week and his patients have to travel up to 20 miles to visit him.  This should be changed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I agree with a lot of what has been said about hospitals for old people and welfare homes.  We should endeavour to provide one in every large town.  Old people who have to be hospitalised should be able to live as near as possible to the area they have lived in all their lives.  It is very hard to get people into welfare homes because there is a great shortage of beds.</P>
    <P>I find it very hard to understand the attitude of the health boards and the regulations which cover them in regard to the allowance for people who look after elderly people in their own homes.  I have a letter from the Eastern Health Board concerning a person who is looking after her mother.  She is married and was working but when her mother was unable to look after herself she took her into her home and gave up her job.  The letter from the Eastern Health Board states that she is not eligible for the home help allowance as she is the woman's daughter.  It also states that if the woman wishes to resume work her mother can be hospitalised.  This system needs to be changed immediately. This woman gave up her job to look after her mother so that she would not have to be hospitalised. She should not be prevented from receiving a home help allowance.  If her mother was hospitalised it would cost the State up to £30 a week. Something should be done about giving this woman, who is prepared to look after her mother at home, an allowance of up to £10 a week.  If this were done less old people, who have members of their family willing to look after them, would have to go <Col N="1324" /> into welfare homes and there would be more beds vacant for those who have nobody to look after them.</P>
    <P>Wonderful work is being done in my area by voluntary organisations particularly for the care of mentally handicapped children.  I know there are many calls on the Minister for Health for assistance and that a lot has been done in providing schools and homes for young mentally retarded people.  A lot more could be done if extra money was provided.  Those mentally retarded children, when properly trained, have some chance of becoming useful.</P>
    <P>Some mentally retarded children have to be put in institutions but when they reach 16 years of age there is no place for them in those special institutions. The only place they can go is into mental hospitals, which are not the proper place to put children of 16 years of age.  Something drastic will have to be done to provide more accommodation for the kind of people I speak of.  I hope in the near future we will be able to have those mentally retarded people housed in institutions with people of their own age and with the kind of treatment and training they need after leaving the other schools. We have fallen down over the years in the matter of providing proper accommodation for mentally retarded children.  Things have improved over the last few years but a lot will have to be done to provide accommodation, especially for the 16 to 20 year age group who seem to be absolutely neglected.</P>
    <P>Up to some time ago voluntary contributors to social welfare could have contributions included for health services. This has been discontinued, and I think it is a pity because the more people who would be paying contributions the better the system would be. People who have gone outside the scope of the scheme should be allowed to contribute towards free hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>Self-employed people should also be allowed pay contributions to their health authority in order to qualify for free hospitalisation for themselves and their families.  I know a man with six children who is in a small building <Col N="1325" /> business.  Because his income is slightly over £1,600 per year he is not allowed contribute his £12 to the health board. If he was at the limit of £1,600 he would not only qualify to pay the health contribution but also for a medical card.  That is a farcical situation. The limit may have been increased very recently but that was the position, that anyone above £1,600 was outside the free hospital service.  I hope it was changed, but, if not, I hope it will be changed in the very near future.</P>
    <P>My colleague from Kildare said the other day that the free hospital service for all promised by the Minister was just a socialist pipe dream.  I do not accept that at all.  Everybody, no matter what his income, should be free from the fear and the worry of the enormous cost of hospitalisation.  Such hospitalisation should be free.  If it was felt some people should pay a contribution, annually or weekly, that is all right, but no man should be faced with a bill of hundreds of pounds at a time when he is unable to earn money himself.  It is, therefore, essential that the scheme of free hospitalisation for all proposed by the Minister should be introduced, and I think he will find that 90 per cent of the people are with him in his efforts to do that.  Agreement should be reached with the doctors, and I am in full support of the Minister in his effort to make this great step forward of a free hospitalisation scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the matter of ordinary working people who go to their local doctor and then have to go into hospital for a check-up.  Something should be done to speed up that person's return to everyday life.  Where there is expensive X-ray and other equipment in laboratories and where there is staff to use it, it should be used round the clock with the staff working in shifts so that a patient can go into a hospital at night time, be X-rayed, have a full check-up and be back at work the next day or the day after.  I think this is possible and would help to keep people at work.  It would also help to get the full benefit from this expensive machinery instead of closing it down each evening at 5 or 6 o'clock.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's efforts to <Col N="1326" /> provide us with better health services. We are in difficult times economically and it may not be easy to get the capital for the various schemes he has in mind.  However, under no circumstances should we neglect the health of the community.  We should strive to increase the percentage of our people to whom we can give a free medical service, and give free hospital service to all, even if contributions have to be paid.  I should like the Minister to examine the question of what contributions everybody would have to make in order to have free medical services of all kinds, including practitioners services.  People I know have been reluctant to go to doctors or into hospitals because of the terror of what it might cost them.  I believe that when the people know what will be the cost both to the State and to themselves as individuals, they will face up to making whatever contribution is required to provide that free service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad this Estimate is being debated at such length because it shows the interest Deputies have in it and its importance and how deeply people are concerned in it.  I realise, however, that anything I may say will be merely repetition of what has been said already by other Deputies.  We are all anxious to see an improvement in the health services; I think Deputies on all sides are unanimous on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point I should like to mention and which has been mentioned already affects most of us.  It is the issue of medical cards.  I join with our spokesman on Health, Deputy Haughey, when he said in his Private Members' motion last week that the issue of medical cards should be automatic to persons over 65 and persons suffering from long-term illness and families whose net income did not exceed £40 per week.  It would be easier and far more beneficial for the Government to provide this kind of service rather than attempt to provide a free service for all as the previous speaker indicated. If he did a cost benefit analysis of this proposal, I think he would find it was far more important to provide the service for the people who really need it in the lower income group <Col N="1327" /> rather than provide it for the 10 per cent in the better off sector of the community who do not need or demand a free health service.  Why not give it to those who need it?</P>
    <P>It is very hard for the lower income group to understand why the Government should want to provide this kind of service for the better off when every week medical cards are being cancelled because the health boards say that the income of these people from, perhaps, agriculture and social welfare exceeds the guideline.  Guidelines were set last January by most health boards indicating who would be entitled to a medical card but since then inflation has risen by about 10 per cent and upward revision of these guidelines is essential.  Instead, the reverse seems to be happening. Every day I find people in my constituency with valuations as low as £8 who are being told that because of their income from social welfare and agriculture they are not entitled to a medical card.  The limit set seems to militate against the farmers and whoever is making the assessments of income does not seem to realise the uncertainty of the industry at present. They seem to think farmers are making fortunes but anybody involved in farming knows that the markets for both cattle and sheep are very uncertain. The assessors should be far more lenient.  I cannot see why a farmer with a valuation of £8, £9 or £10 should not get a medical card even if he gets an income from social welfare to subsidise his meagre earnings from the land.  This should not militate against him when he is assessed for medical card purposes.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about community care.  The development of community care should get top priority, development to the maximum of service based on the community, the general practitioner, the local health team, voluntary effort and the return to their own communities of as many patients as possible now in long stay institutions.  This aim should get top priority from health boards.  There should be a major shift of emphasis from institutional to community care. <Col N="1328" /> This is attractive on economic as well as on humanitarian and social grounds.  It is more economic to treat such people at home rather than in institutions.  We realise the high cost of patients in institutions at present.</P>
    <P>This would involve a comprehensive support service for the aged, the handicapped and the weak in their own homes or in community conditions resembling their own homes. The success of such an effort would depend on the fullest involvement of voluntary organisations which are doing a magnificent job in every health field.  The family doctor is the cornerstone of a community medical programme.  In many cases the great majority of patients need go no further than their own doctor.  The general practice is the mainstay of our health system and should be maintained and strengthened.  Experience abroad has shown that where general practice was allowed to decline or disappear the loss was consideraable: it showed the importance of the personal doctor as the first contact in helping the patient to get maximum benefit from the increasingly complex and specialised system of medical care. It is important to retain the medical practitioner because even in the dispensary days he was a very important figure in the health service.</P>
    <P>A well-equipped health centre is a very important component in any plan to improve community care and health boards should embark on a programme to develop such facilities.  Such health centres should have accommodation for at least two doctors and facilities to enable the team concept to develop as far as possible.  Isolation reduces the ability of general practitioners to organise reasonable time off and this is an impediment to a high standard of work.  Provision of health centres in many cases would facilitate the introduction of group practice and reduce the disadvantage of professional isolation.  We see this particularly in the western region where many doctors employed by the Western Health Board find it very hard to get a locum or have any chance of a holiday or a weekend off.</P>
    <P>The public health nurses are doing <Col N="1329" /> a very good job and are to be complimented on it.  I should like to see an increase in their number.  The target set in 1966 was to have one nurse on district duties for every 4,000 of the population.  In the light of the extended demand and the special problems encountered by nurses in the Western Health Board area particularly, those standards should be reappraised.  The special problems include physical features such as difficult terrain, islands off the coast and inferior roads.  Nurses encounter all these problems.  They must visit a large number of old people.  Therefore, I believe the number of nurses should be increased and I hope this will be done as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Accommodation for the mentally handicapped cases is completely inadequate. Many mentally handicapped adults and children have to be kept in psychiatric hospitals and this is totally unsuitable for them.</P>
    <P>The absence of residential accommodation for seriously handicapped children is to be regretted as is also the absence of training centres, sheltered workshops and hostel accommodation for mentally handicapped adults.  Every effort should be made to provide these facilities because we are all aware of the grave problems experienced by people who are engaged in the care of mentally handicapped children.  These people deserve our sympathy but, more important, they deserve our support in regard to the making available of funds to them.</P>
    <P>In the Western Health Board area there is much difficulty in finding places in institutions for handicapped children.  I trust the Minister will do everything possible to ensure that places can be found for the children with the least possible delay.  In this context I take the opportunity of paying tribute to the many voluntary organisations who are doing such fine work in this field.  I know many of the people involved.  These are people who give freely of their time in looking after the interests of those children.</P>
    <P>One problem that arises frequently in relation to mentally handicapped <Col N="1330" /> children is that of transporting them from their homes to day centres.  In my area we find very often that children must travel distances of two or three miles to a point where they can be picked up by car and taken to Galway.  So far as possible the children should be collected at their homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The parents of these children do their best for them but it is often very difficult to leave the child at the point where he is picked up and to collect him in the evening.</P>
      <P>We need a director in this field who would co-ordinate all the services involved, somebody who would be available readily to the organisations involved in this work.  Mental handicap is one of our greatest problems in the field of health and education. Much strain and frustration is caused to families who have mentally handicapped children and this in turn may lead to maladjustment and mental illness thereby causing a loss of productivity to the nation.  That is another reason why the Government should be prepared to do everything possible by way of making available funds, sheltered workshops and transport for these children.</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal of criticism of the dental services.  In the Western Health Board area the service is not adequate.  I understand that the health board are finding it difficult to attract dentists.  In these circumstances, they should be authorised to engage the services of private dentists as happened in relation to the Department of Social Welfare.  Regarding the dental service generally, it is important that there should be as much concentration as possible on the prevention of dental decay.  If children are instructed in oral hygiene we would have less demand for dental treatment.  It causes much anxiety to people to have to wait for up to two years for dentures.  I am sure the Minister will do his best to see that this aspect of the service is improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the health service in respect of which there has been considerable criticism in recent times is the <Col N="1331" /> health care allowance which is paid by the health board.  This allowance seems to have been discontinued to a great extent.  Certainly, this is true of the Western Health Board area.  The excuse being given is that in order to qualify for the allowance a person must be bedridden.  However, if those people were entitled to this allowance two years ago when, perhaps, they were much more active, it is difficult to understand why they are being disqualified from receiving it now.  My suspicion is that the reason is shortage of money.  If this is the case it would be much better that the people concerned be told the truth.  Hardly a week passes but I receive complaints from constituents who have been in receipt of this allowance for the past two years or more but who are being told now that they no longer qualify for it.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is causing much concern is the incidence of cancer.  The disease can be said to be reaching epidemic proportions.  This is very frightening.  I wonder whether the Government are putting enough into research into the cause of this disease. Is enough money being spent in this area?  It would appear that the funds being raised by the Conquer Cancer Campaign are not adequate.  It should not be left to individual organisations such as this to deal with such a major problem.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what is being done in this field.</P>
    <P>On other occasions I mentioned here the question of the disabled person's maintenance allowance in so far as dependants of recipients of this allowance are not taken into consideration. I have in mind in particular a number of men in my own area who are in receipt of the allowance, who have young families but who get nothing extra for those children whereas if they were in receipt of unemployment benefit they would qualify for, perhaps, £20 or £25 per week.  The maximum payable is about £8.  It is very harsh that when a person is so ill or infirm that he is not able to work his farm or to work elsewhere that he gets no allowance for his wife or children.  I would ask the Minister to look into <Col N="1332" /> this scheme and consult with his counterpart, the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>At present we have a serious problem at the regional hospital in Galway in relation to overcrowding and this is very unfair to medical staff and patients alike.  We know that they are a wonderful group of people who are doing tremendous work but their task is made very difficult for them by the serious overcrowding there.  They have to cater for patients from Mayo and Roscommon as well as Galway and we had hoped that better facilities would be provided at the hospital.  I hope that before too long an improvement will take place at that hospital and that the overcrowding will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to see this year that the capital allocation to the Western Health Board is the smallest of all the health boards.  This is, indeed, very regrettable, in view of the special needs of that region.  In view of the many complex problems that exist there, I fail to understand why we should get less money this year than any of the other boards. To enable the board to provide the services and to expand them as they had planned to do, more money is needed, and I had hoped the Government would see fit to provide that money and so enable the health board to provide these services as it had planned but, unfortunately, that is not the case this year because, as I say, we are getting a smaller allocation than any of the other boards.  I regret that this should happen and I want to protest in the strongest possible way against the Western Health Board being treated in this fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy for the Minister in this inflationary situation in the amount of money he has to provide for running the health services. He has a very difficult task and I compliment him on the way he is doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, if Deputies from the various counties had to make their decision again, they would not vote in favour of forming health boards in any part of the country and I think that if the county councils were to vote again that decision would be <Col N="1333" /> reversed.  There was no better form of health service than was operated within the county as it stood, and it was a sad day we parted from that principle.  I happen to be the only county councillor in County Mayo who opposed it.  Every other councillor was in favour of the Western Health Board but speaking to people throughout Ireland now and to Deputies from various other areas, I find that they now regret that this happened and I think the Minister's burden today would not be so great were it not for the establishment of these boards which are far removed from the people.  The people have very little contact with them and as far as I know, the Minister has very little power over them.  As I say, to my mind, it was a sad day when it was done but it is there now and we must put up with it.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the matrons and doctors in the hospitals in County Mayo for the wonderful help they are giving to the people and particularly to representatives who try to get patients into hospital.  They are going through a very difficult time, not having sufficient beds, and I must compliment the Minister on providing money for a community home in Westport and Castlebar which was opened recently and tell him they are very welcome in our county.  We have 40 beds in a community home set up in Claremorris which was opened last week and to go into this is exactly the same as going into the Gresham Hotel.  We see these poor people and the way they live around the country coming back there, getting their meals and being looked after and we see the cleanliness of the place.  The men do some small work and it is really a credit.  It was started by the last Government and has been continued now and is of the greatest benefit to the older people.  When you have a community home, the local patient is taken in there and can be visited by his friends or he can go home at weekends or walk up town if he is capable of doing so.  They are, to my mind, of the greatest benefit and we hope to see more of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has agreed to build <Col N="1334" /> another one in Ballina and I suggest to him that Ballyhaunis is a large centre, a scheduled town for development, with a fair population.  If a community home were built in Ballyhaunis, it would service portion of Roscommon.  Ballyhaunis is far removed from the county home in Castlebar where it is difficult to get patients in.  I was in contact with the matron yesterday seeking to get a poor man into the hospital.  The doctor had made application for him.  The man had his leg amputated last year and is in a very poor condition, living with an invalid daughter and needs hospitalisation badly.  There was no place for him in the county home in Castlebar, but the matron will do everything in her power to have him accommodated.  In those community homes, when they are filled, there is no vacancy until such time as the poor man or woman dies.  This is the sad situation in the community and county homes.  The accommodation there is not sufficient and I would like to see these homes being built faster. I know that the Minister will do this when money becomes fully available to him.</P>
    <P>The decision was taken some time ago to upgrade the hospital in Castlebar and make it a general hospital. We are really disappointed by the delay which is taking place, for the simple reason that it would be a training centre in the county in which at least 30 or 40 student nurses could be trained.  This would be of great benefit in view of the thousands of young girls who are trying to get into the nursing profession today and the limited number who get in.</P>
    <P>I must mention in passing something that happened recently in the Western Health Board.  It is the case of a young girl who came to me with her three honours.  She had qualifications sufficient to take her into a training college.  She sat for an interview&mdash;as fine a type of young girl as you could see&mdash;but strange as it may seem, her next door neighbour who just barely passed her leaving certificate got the call and this girl was turned down.  It would make you think just how these things come <Col N="1335" /> about.  This girl approached me about this.  Apparently she later made application to a Dublin hospital and, after interview, was called.  This should be investigated.  I should like to know if the Minister has any power in this regard.  It is a sad situation if Deputies and county councillors are circularised by CEOs or personnel officers to the effect that if they recommend an applicant that person will be disqualified automatically.  I see no harm in a Deputy who represents about 7,000 people recommending a person he feels is qualified for a post.  It does not make sense that applicants are disqualified if they are recommended by public representatives.  No one has a right to interfere with an applicant even if he or she has been recommended by a public representative.</P>
    <P>It is too bad that under the home care allowance scheme some people are deprived of the allowance.  I know of a number of people who are deprived of this allowance by the Western Health Board.  I am not aware whether money is available or not.  I also know of people who have had the allowance taken from them. The fact that people care for invalids and old people at home means that a hospital bed is available for other patients.  Several people would be in hospital were it not for the fact that their relations or neighbours care for them full time at home. In some cases the bedridden patient must be attended to many times during the day.</P>
    <P>The problem of mentally handicapped children is a serious one.  I should like to compliment the voluntary organisations who by their work and dedication brought this situation to light.  Apparently, the Government of the day were not aware of the desperate situation parents of mentally handicapped children found themselves in.  Those parents who suffer a great strain with a mentally handicapped child were unable to gain admission for the handicapped child to special schools or institutions. In this regard I should like to compliment the sisters of the St. John of God Convent who are providing a <Col N="1336" /> wonderful service for the people of Mayo.  The home for mentally handicapped in Ballina which was opened recently will accommodate many children but we have not sufficient space for the number of children requiring attention.  Money spent in the care of mentally handicapped is well spent.</P>
    <P>With regard to dental services, there is a big backlog in my constituency. There seems to be some regulation whereby a private dentist is not freely available to work the dental service.  If a dentist is prepared to work 14 hours a day to attend to people needing dental treatment, the Department should not debar him from doing that, particularly when there is such a big backlog. Many people have written to me about the delay they are experiencing in getting dental treatment.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that many people lose their medical card when the health boards carry out their annual review.  I do not think the limit of £24.50 is high enough for these cards.  A person earning slightly in excess of that figure would not be able to afford to pay for his keep in a hospital for one week.  I view medical cards as one of the most important documents any family can have.  There is a great need for these cards in the west where there are so many small farms.</P>
    <P>On the question of public health nurses, I should like to point out that six midwives have been neglected in so far as a pension was concerned although they were deprived of their jobs.  Years ago they provided a good service when there were no public health nurses, gynaecologists and maternity units.  These people were not treated fairly with regard to pensions. There are only a limited number left and the Minister might consider their case sympathetically.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on what he has achieved in the short time he has been in office. My county has received a fair share of the cake.  I would ask him to expedite the opening of the general hospital in Castlebar which is vital for County Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>The health services affect all the citizens and, because of this, it is natural that many Deputies would wish to contribute to this debate. One of the matters that must be considered is the Government's policy regarding free hospitalisation for all. That immediately implies that new buildings with costly equipment will be needed.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any disagreement among Members about the need for hospital services for those who require them.  I have been involved with hospitals for more than 30 years and at every annual meeting members of the committee concerned experience a sense of gratification when they are told the bed occupancy was 98 or 99 per cent.  It is sometimes considered a reflection on a hospital if the percentage figure is lower than that.  Although our country has one of the best records with regard to the supply of hospital beds, I am convinced if we trebled the number available they would be occupied within one month.  The Minister and his Department are well aware of the high cost involved; it is one of the most expensive items in the health services.  Our aim must be to reduce the number although I stress that nobody will cavil about providing a needy person with medical services.</P>
      <P>We must accept that our finances are limited.  We have two alternative methods we can choose: either we pick certain areas and put the best possible services there or we provide a less effective service over a wider area.  In other words, we would have a second-class service for the whole country.  We should be very careful in our choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a railway station or a Garda barracks is closed there is usually a furore among the people in the area. It is inevitable that this will happen when a hospital in involved because there are many people other than the staff who are engaged in providing goods and services to it.  There is no necessity to close any of the existing buildings because there are many other needs in the area of health care for which they might be used.  It may be that the buildings will not be used <Col N="1338" /> for the same purpose as in the past and this can create difficulties in a small country like this where people are rather conservative about change. This is a problem that can be solved only by education.</P>
    <P>The hospitals in Dublin must be congratulated on the way they coped with this problem.  They amalgamated and they are working successfully.  I have no doubt that some of the hospitals had misgivings and, inevitably, some of the staffs involved must have made sacrifices.  The undertaking was a major one and Dublin has given the country a good example.  I should be glad if the Minister would indicate if any reply has been received regarding the report about the Cork hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to child health services, which is a very important matter.  I should like to know if it is possible to provide medical and dental examinations annually or biannually for children at school.  It is possible that the examination might not be carried out by the doctors but there are many nurses and para-medical staff who could undertake dental examinations and carry out some minor treatment while referring acute and serious cases to the dentists. Such a service would be of considerable benefit to the children who could get prompt treatment for minor ailments. If it is found possible to provide this service for dental care, the Minister might consider extending it to other branches of health care.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the proposed Children's Bill, which will provide services for deprived children and those at risk.  The easily identifiable handicapped child is not the only handicapped child.  There are children severely handicapped because of circumstances in the home who are not so easily identifiable.  We should have a corps of social workers in close communication with the schools so that teachers should consult with them where there was a child who was particularly slow, or backward, or a problem child, which is the term used now, and the social workers could then investigate the family background and the family circumstances.  If that <Col N="1339" /> were done steps could be taken at an early stage to remedy something which might well become a very grievous and expensive ailment in later life.  I never cease advocating the necessity to provide as many social workers as possible.</P>

      <P>There are many organisations dealing with both mentally and physically handicapped children.  There is need for co-ordination between the different bodies to ensure that there is no over-lapping. The greatest worry patients have is anxiety about the future of these children.</P>

    <P>I cannot let the occasion pass without expressing my regret, and I know I am speaking now on behalf of all connected with this work, at the passing yesterday of Dr. Bob Collis; he <Col N="1340" /> had an international reputation as a paediatrician.  He did tremendous work and he was the founder of the cerebral palsy association here.  His passing is a grievous blow.  He will be a great loss to those connected with the handicapped but the biggest loss will be suffered by the handicapped themselves.  His work will continue and his memory will be cherished forever.</P>

      <P>Amen.  Speaking about preventive medicine, health education is vitally important here.  The Health Education Bureau is one of the most important bodies we have.  People very rarely think of health until something happens to make them see a doctor. Do we value the health we get so easily?  I do not think so.  I believe a bigger effort will have to be made through the media to educate people into a realisation and appreciation of the value of good health.  Nothing like the same emphasis is placed on the care of teeth and health as is laid on a child getting his intermediate or leaving certificate.  These are relatively unimportant in the context of good health, to say nothing of the fact that one can have another chance. But, if one loses one's health, there is no second chance and no money will buy it back.  We lay emphasis in the wrong places.  Through the various media of communication people should be taught the value of eating the proper food and avoiding excess in everything, especially drinking, smoking or drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People take drugs for kicks.  I believe they do not realise the consequences and those of us who are old enough to appreciate the consequences and who have seen so many tragedies are not doing enough to bring the dangers home to our young people.  There is a good deal to be said for a poor society.  Affluence brings its own perils and, compared with some other countries, we are an affluent society.  Facilities must be provided for youth so that they can make a proper use of leisure.  We must have playing fields and swimming pools and so on.  These are an <Col N="1341" /> investment from the point of view of health because they can result ultimately in less expenditure on health. Again, another result could be a lessening of demand on medical men and dentists, who seem to be in somewhat short supply in some areas.  Prevention is still better than cure.  I should like to see facilities for regular medical examination of all citizens at specific intervals.</P>
    <P>With regard to convalescent homes, we have only one convalescent home in Cork city; it is for females and it holds only 24 or 25 patients.  We have no male convalescent homes and, therefore, male patients are being kept in hospitals for up to 40 more days than they need to be, thus occupying badly-needed hospital space.  This is tremendously expensive.</P>
    <P>I shall touch only briefly on the dental side of the medical services. Private dentists should be given work in the public service to relieve the pressure, especially in schools.  I know there are difficulties.  I am saying this ten years after I gave up the business myself.  I think that technicians should be employed, as they are in many civilised countries, to look after the matter of dentures.  It would be worth the Department's while to examine this.  There is an acute shortage of dentists in the public service and the suggestion I have made could be examined in consultation with the dentists' profession.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows more than I do.  The point I was making is that there should be a plan prepared by the Department on dental care, particularly in the schools.  We have been talking about this for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> There has been a great deal of comment on community care and involvement. In Cork we have a fair idea that when an appeal is made for voluntary workers they are there.  Our task is to guide their endeavours in the proper direction and the Department could help in this respect.  Voluntary workers should be encouraged to join societies like the Red Cross, the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the Knights of Malta.  They are anxious to engage in such work, to help voluntary bodies, but they are unaware of how to do it.</P>
    <P>A Deputy mentioned the position in regard to student nurses.  I should like to be on record as saying that the way we select them is unsatisfactory. Student nurses should be selected by an outside board and no influence should be used by public representatives. One thing I have always regretted is that people like us, public representatives, seem to be able to get candidates appointed as student nurses.  There have been cases where people with high academic qualifications have been appointed, whereas their next door neighbours, much more eligible for appointment as student nurses, have been unsuccessful. A girl without all these academic qualifications, who has personality and the other personal attributes required in nursing should be appointed by a board who will have the problem of selection by number only.  We are often asked for personal references as to whether a girl is good and honest.  If a girl is not good and honest at that age, she never will be.</P>
    <P>We have heard criticism of the health board system.  I think it is working very well.  A Deputy spoke of it today in regard to County Cork. That is a problem on its own and I do not propose to follow it.  However, there is one unnecessary appendage, the regional hospital board.  I do not know if they have got off the ground. We have Comhairle na nOspidéal, and I wonder to what use the regional hospital board can be put.  If they are serving a purpose, I should like to know what it is.</P>

      <P>The Health Estimate covers some of the most important <Col N="1343" /> aspects of the lives of citizens.  It touches on the most fundamental aspects of every person's life from birth to death.  Great strides have been made in our health services.  The Minister is seeking a sum not exceeding £177,022,000 from the House.  He is to be congratulated on looking for this amount.  As he said, he is endeavouring to achieve a real growth rate of around 1½ per cent in our health services in 1975.  He is anxious to maintain our health services and to see a growth rate even in a time of economic difficulty throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be complimented on his approach to the care of our elderly citizens.  Magnificent strides have been made in the past few years. In my constituency we have a new geriatric unit attached to the county hospital in Tullamore, Ely House in Birr, a home in Mountmellick, a home in Edenderry and different homes throughout Laois-Offaly.  Major improvements have been made.  The degree of comfort and cleanliness and the standard of the food are to be commended.  Television and reading facilities have been provided.  The Government are to be complimented and also the voluntary organisations and the religious organisations who have helped out in the manning and the running of these services.  Our medical teams and medical staffs are also to be complimented.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connolly is in the House and I am sure that he has often been in the old county home in Tullamore. It dates back to around 1856 or 1866. As an Offaly man, every time I went through that old home I felt it was a scandal to see elderly people having to live out their days there.  People felt a sense of despair when they entered that old home.  It was a relic of former days.  The new homes which have been provided are excellent. More people are applying to enter these than can be accommodated.  I hope these wonderful homes will be provided in all the important towns in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that <Col N="1344" /> elderly people like to reside as close as possible to the localities in which they were born and reared so that they can be with their neighbours and friends.  Many elderly people feel a sense of loneliness when they are brought to areas with which they are not familiar.  There have been wonderful improvements.  I hope they will continue and that further strides will be made.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consult with the Minister for Education in regard to the transport of mildly-retarded children to training centres. It is important, if at all possible, that these children should be collected from their homes and returned to their homes.  I know one child who is driven six miles by his parents to be picked up by a bus and taken to a school.  The child is dropped off out in the countryside in the evening. That is not safe for a mildly-handicapped child.  I would ask the Minister to make every effort to ensure that such children are delivered to their homes.</P>
    <P>The programme for our mentally ill is very important.  In the current year a sum of £35.8 million is being spent on services for the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped.  I am pleased that this amount of money is being spent in an effort to improve the services being provided for mentally ill children and adults.  The training and employment opportunities available for our mentally ill and mentally handicapped are not sufficient. The Minister has recommended a review of this service.  I compliment him on that.  It is absolutely essential that more employment opportunities should be provided for mentally handicapped boys and girls when they leave school.  With care, education, medical health and training, these children can adapt themselves and live reasonably normal lives.  They can obtain employment and contribute to their country.  They also have the satisfaction of doing a job and being paid for it.</P>
    <P>The statistical information provided on the health services is excellent. Some of the figures are somewhat alarming.  I note that at 31st <Col N="1345" /> December, 1974, there were 844 children up to the age of 16 years in residential centres and in respect of children aged 16 years and over, the figure was 295. I note also that in respect of the moderately handicapped, aged up to 16 years, the figure is 848.  What alarms me is that the numbers aged 16 and over in residential centres increased from 848 to 1,262.  In respect of severely handicapped cases, in the age group up to 16, the figure increased to 710 and, in respect of those aged 16 years and over, it was 734. This is an increase on the figures presented in 1964 and I do not know what is the reason.  In 1964 the figure was 347 in respect of those aged 16 and over and 487 in respect of those up to the age of 16 years.  There is not sufficient information given in the statistics provided by the Minister to ascertain the reason, but there must be some.  Do I take it that most of the moderately handicapped remain in these different institutions?  Do I take it that a similar situation arises with regard to the severely handicapped? It is sufficiently important to warrant thorough investigation to ascertain the reason for these increases. In presenting these figures the Minister may have thrown this out for discussion.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to day centres is entirely different where the figure for mildly handicapped up to the age of 16 years, is 2,645 and, in respect of those aged 16 and over it is 273.  In respect of the moderately handicapped it goes from 1,778 down to 352 and a similar drop occurs in respect of the severely mentally handicapped. I have known young boys and girls who have gone into those institutions as mildly or moderately handicapped and, in some cases, severely mentally handicapped.  Normally between the age of 16 and 18 years they are transferred to different psychiatric homes or mental hospitals, where the environment is different; it is not at all the same as that to which they had been accustomed in those residential centres.  They have established relationships with people in those centres whom they have grown to know and, <Col N="1346" /> when they are moved from one centre to another, it must cause them considerable discomfort.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been in office for approximately two years only.  This is not something he can change overnight because large numbers of people are involved.  The resources at his disposal are somewhat limited and a large number of buildings have to be provided as well as much training.  But I am glad to note that the Minister is reviewing all these services.  I would ask him to ascertain the causes behind the important figures he has presented to the House.</P>
    <P>In his comprehensive speech on his Estimate the Minister dealt at great length with the medical card scheme services.  The Minister is to be comlimented on the efforts he has made in regard to that scheme.  I notice that on 31st of March last there were 1,095,919 persons covered by medical cards, representing approximately 35.2 per cent of the population.  The Minister went on to say that figure compared with a figure of 864, 106 or 28.4 per cent of the population covered on 31st of December, 1972.  In my constituency in the normal week I would have, perhaps, seven, eight or ten people approaching me in regard to medical cards.  Medical cards are very important to a married man and his wife with a young family, because otherwise they may be faced with the tremendous burden of meeting doctors' bills, chemists' bills and so on.</P>
    <P>We all place too much emphasis on major illnesses.  What alarms many married couples are day to day visits to the doctor: John is sick today; Mary is sick tomorrow; Eileen is sick a few days afterwards.  I know the cost varies according to the day and time but normally it costs a person £2 to go to his doctor and, if the doctor has to call to the House it certainly costs a minimum of £2, if not more.  The Minister extended the income eligibility limit of people coming within the scheme approximately four months ago but it is important that every effort be made to extend it further.  The Minister mentioned the cost of increasing the eligibility limit.  He said that raising the income guidelines for eligibility <Col N="1347" /> for medical cards costs in real terms about £1 million per £1 increase. That is a very large amount.  I should like to see as many people as possible provided with medical cards.  In Laois-Offaly the percentage of people with medical cards is approximately 40 in one county and 44 in the other.</P>
    <P>Discussion on this Estimate has been very wide-ranging.  Many items have been discussed and at this hour of the evening it is difficult to introduce new ideas.  The Minister will have observed that the General Council for the Blind some years ago were anxious to have as many blind people as possible employed in the different Government Departments. That was approximately four of five years ago.  I tabled a number of questions to the then Government to ascertain the number of blind people so employed and the answer I received was: &ldquo;None in any Department&rdquo;. I do not know what the figure is at present.  I cannot say if the situation has changed.  If it has not, the Minister should change it.  Our Government Departments should give a lead in this direction.  I would hope that we are the trend-setters and will give an example in this very important sphere.</P>
    <P>I am sure that in such a vast Department, with a little thought, care and effort, the Minister will be able to provide employment for blind and other physically handicapped persons. He has tried to implement courses for the handicapped.  I would ask him to go a stage further and get in touch with the Minister for the Public Service to ensure that Government Departments employ as many handicapped as possible.  Employment opportunities for these people are difficult at any time but they are even more difficult at present.  As a humane person with the interest and care of the people who need help at heart, I am certain he will not be found wanting. I compliment him for the 40 instructors he initiated through AnCO.  These instructors can, will and must prove very important in the training of the physically handicapped.</P>
    <P>Alcoholism is a major problem here.  We all talk about cancer, heart trouble and other diseases but alcoholism <Col N="1348" /> can create great hardship for families and may cause deaths, through accidents or otherwise.  Many young boys and girls go to bed hungry because their mother or father is an alcoholic.  This very important problem must be recognised by everyone. We all enjoy a drink but it must be taken in moderation.  A drink can be a help in many instances, but when taken in excess drink can be the greatest curse to hit a family.</P>
    <P>If an alcoholic is well off he can go into a home such as St. Patrick's or St. John of God's to dry out and get a cure.  Alcoholics do not wish to be locked up in an institution.  It is important that we should provide homes on a regional basis for people who are not well off but have a drinking problem.</P>
    <P>The alcoholic could go into these homes and if he was not happy there he could leave.  I know many people drink to excess.  It would have been beneficial to them if they could have gone into such homes.  In certain homes once they leave of their own accord they cannot go back.  If the alcoholic continues to drink to excess what often happens is that a relation will commit him to an institution. This is very sad because the person who is committed has a sense of grievance and is antagonistic towards the person who has committed him. The Minister should provide regional homes for people in the middle and lower income groups who have a drink problem.  They could go into these homes for treatment.  I am sure the treatment they would get in those homes would be very beneficial with the result that there would be less lives lost on the roads, less hardship among families and less people in hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is such a home in Athy on the borders of Laois/Offaly.  This is in its very early stages yet.  I would like to congratulate and compliment the Reverend Sister running this home.  I wish her every success in her project and hope it expands and proves an example to others who might have such ideas in the future.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that our health services must be expanded.  At the moment <Col N="1349" /> they are a great burden on county councils and we must congratulate county council members for the work they put into this area of local service. At local level we must ensure that our <i>modus operandi</i> will be sufficient to ensure that the money available will be channelled to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>There are two final points I wish to make.  About four months ago there were plans to provide a lift in the Birr District Hospital.  I have been on to the Department, but the lift has not been provided.  The hospital is small but with the provision of a lift 16 extra beds could be provided without fire hazard.  It is difficult to carry elderly patients up and down the stairs.  I have had many representations in an effort to have the lift provided and I hope the Minister will give special attention to it.</P>
    <P>My final point is in relation to the Minister's statement in his opening speech about the geographic distribution of general hospitals.  In this context I shall refer to the Fitzgerald Report of 1968 and I refer the Minister to paragraph 10.59, page 125:</P>
    <P>In the Central Midlands areas there are at present county hospitals in Portlaoise, Tullamore and Mullingar.  All these hospitals are modern buildings, they are comparable in size and the towns in which they are located are also comparable in size.  The three towns are situated on a line running roughly south to north: Tullamore is 20 miles north of Portlaoise while Mullingar is 22 miles north of Tullamore.  In our consideration of this area it was clear to us that the development of General Hospitals in more than one of these centres would be difficult to justify.  In considering the merits of the different centres we had regard to the impact of our selection on the areas to the north and to the south.  If, for example, Portlaoise was to be developed as a General Hospital centre it would infringe on the area which one would expect might be served by Waterford General Hospital while Mullingar, if chosen for development, might be expected to <Col N="1350" /> draw patients from Cavan without adequately catering for the Cavan/ Monaghan area.  The situation of Tullamore, roughly half-way between Mullingar and Portlaoise, reasonably close to both and centrally located in relation to the entire area now served by the three hospitals, gives it, we feel, a stronger claim for development as a main hospital centre.  Finally, there is the point that the alternative to choosing Tullamore as a hospital centre is to have hospitals at both Portlaoise and Mullingar and we are of opinion that the development of major hospitals in both these towns, relatively close to each other and within easy reach of Dublin, would not be justified.  Accordingly we recommend the selection of Tullamore as a centre for a General Hospital.</P>
    <P>The position is, as the Minister is aware, that the Tullamore Hospital with 300 beds is catering for a population of 120,000.  Within a 20 mile radius of Tullamore there are three towns and within a 30 mile radius there are eight towns, including Athlone, which are not serviced in the midland regional area.  The most economic service therefore and the most suitable to the people in the area could be provided by a general hospital in Tullamore.  It would be convenient throughout Laois, Westmeath, Offaly and most of Longford.  A general hospital in Tullamore could cater for the vast majority in that region&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an alternative. There are two hospitals in Mullingar but I think all will agree that the development of a general hospital in Tullamore would serve the people of the region much more centrally. There is still another alternative of having two general hospitals in the region but I suggest to the Minister that one central hospital in Tullamore would be more beneficial both economically and from the point of view of the people living in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fitzgerald said that many of the hospitals that would be affected by <Col N="1351" /> reorganisation would be treated more as community centres.  However, I should like to see the services that are at present being provided in the hospitals maintained as far as possible. The vast majority of the people of the midland area would be anxious to have a first-class general hospital. Many people will be affected by the Minister's decision.  The present hospital in Tullamore is severely overcrowded. I know there are many pressures on the Minister but I am confident that the Minister will reach the right decision.  I would hope that this general hospital will be provided in Tullamore and that the services will be maintained in the other two hospitals in the area.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his comprehensive statement to the House and his fine statistical analysis of the working of his Department, and I wish him every success in his future years in the Department of Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the Estimate and, being from the same constituency as my colleague, Deputy Enright, I can say that many of the problems he has mentioned are very familiar to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems with which I should like to deal is the care of the aged.  Today more of the aged are depending on homes.  There seems to be a swing away from old people being looked after at home.  This is regrettable, but it is happening.  As the Minister is aware, the number of homes available are too few to meet the demand being made on them. The Midlands Health Board do not pay a home care allowance to the person who is looking after an aged relative whether it be a brother, husband or wife.  I presume the reason is that the Midland Health Board have not got the finance to provide this allowance.  However, people are now being transferred into homes, geriatric units or anywhere else where they can be taken.  To keep an elderly person in a home today costs at least £25, and I cannot understand why the <Col N="1352" /> health board will not pay an allowance of even £3 a week.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that younger members of the family at home are not able to give the care and attention they would like to give these elderly people because of the demands of living, the demands of the household and trying to keep their heads above water.  The question of the aged is now more of a problem than even the mentally handicapped.  There is not a week goes by that I am not asked by some relation of an aged person if I can get him into a geriatric unit or some institution, and I am sure other public representatives are coming up against this problem as well.  I would suggest that the Minister make an arrangement with the health boards that a small allowance be paid to the relative or whoever is looking after the aged person.</P>
    <P>The hospital position generally is not a very happy one.  There is much overcrowding in my own area, the Midland Health Board area.  In the surgical part of the Tullamore Hospital there are beds in the corridor, day after day, week after week.  It is the same in the maternity wing and in the children's unit; if an outbreak of an infectious disease occurred in the children's unit.  I do not know how they could be isolated.</P>
    <P>One might ask how has this come about in the last couple of years.  The population is growing and so also is the demand.  People are more educated now and they are quicker to come to the doctor and to realise that they should have hospital treatment. That is the position.  I cannot see anything occurring to alleviate that position in the Midland Health Board area in the future.  I presume the Parliamentary Secretary knows about Our Lady of Consolation Nursing Home in Ardagh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary could use his influence to have that home recognised. It is only partially recognised at present but if patients, after minor operations in the county hospital <Col N="1353" /> could be removed there for convalescence it would take much of the pressure from the county hospital, even though that would only be a temporary relief.  I have no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will pass that request to the proper quarter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks very much. I believe there has been an application in the Department to have the home recognised for the past three months or so.  Our doctors are doing great work but they sometimes suffer a good deal of abuse.  The general practitioner, the local family doctor is on call all the time.  He may or may not have a free weekend.  If an emergency arises, he is nearly always on hand.  He is also subject to abuse about charges and people say the doctors are cleaning up at the expense of everybody.  I know the doctors as fine, respectable, upright men who never refuse to attend anybody whether he has means or not.  The doctors in the hospitals and in the Midland Health Board area are giving a very good service to the community.</P>
      <P>Medical cards have been abused. People entitled to them have been refused them and others who should not have them, have them.  That has been the situation for a long time now.  The income limit revision that took place at the end of last year has been overtaken by rounds of wage and salary increases.  The problem is that as soon as you raise the medical card income limit, the wage agreement brings up a man's income so that he is caught again.  If there is long-term illness in a household, no matter what job the wage-earner has, he should at least have the medical card because, irrespective of his occupation, he could not meet present-day hospital bills.  The charges and the prices of drugs are enormously high.  Drug prices have risen by about 100 per cent in the last couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the psychiatric side, in regard to the mental hospitals and especially the external clinics, there has been much abuse of tablets.  These are <Col N="1354" /> brought home, thrown aside and, perhaps, thrown out even though they are very costly.  This is a very difficult illness to handle and this makes the situation more complicated but there should be more supervision on the issuing of drugs.  This is an item where a good deal of money could be saved. It might be hard to work out a suitable system and it might evoke criticism if you cut down or supervised the issue of these drugs but abuse is taking place especially in connection with the treatment of mental illness.</P>
    <P>Chemists have also come in for a lot of criticism as regards hours and the money they seek and so on.  The chemists I know are available Sunday and Monday.  They are always available to anybody and they do not mind opening their premises and giving out the drugs or prescriptions required. Some people may say their charges are high but we must realise that most jobs are on the basis of a five-day week and on Friday evening workers down tools and are off until the following Monday morning&mdash;or the following Tuesday morning if it is a bank-holiday weekend such as is now coming.  The chemists are always on call and I have found them to be fine, decent men.  The only problem that I can see with them is that in the case of medical card holders the system of payment operated by the health boards leaves much to be desired.  Drugs are very dear.</P>
    <P>A chemist could find himself out of pocket to the extent of thousands of pounds in a matter of a couple of weeks supplying drugs to medical card holders.  I expect that one of the reasons chemists are seeking increased fees and special allowances is because the health boards are slow to pay and the suppliers of drugs are bringing pressure to bear on the chemists for payment.  If the chemists cannot get the money from the boards they must go to the bank in the hope that the bank manager will accommodate them.  Much of the pressure would be removed from chemists if payments were made at least every four weeks on, say, the first of the month.  However this matter may be outside the Minister's control since at the beginning <Col N="1355" /> of the year the boards get a capital allowance from the Department and are told to do the best they can with it.  I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will take note of what I am saying.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal now with the question of the health boards generally.  These boards are only in their infancy, so to speak, but so far there has been much criticism of them.  The aspect of them that concerns me is that of staffing.  Every other day one sees elaborate advertisements in the newspapers for personnel for the boards.  They seek principal officers, chief executives, junior executives, senior clerk typists, junior clerk typists and so on.  The advertisements alone must be costing a fortune.  I am not casting aspersions on anyone concerned but I am wondering whether a situation is being reached in which there will be so many personnel employed by the boards that they will be tripping each other up.  In any case it is a matter that should be looked into. What interests the public is the treatment they will receive, but I am afraid that when all the personnel sought are appointed there will be too much delegation of duties.  I am not to be taken as trying to prevent anybody from getting a job but our ability to pay so many people must be taken into consideration.  I would be afraid of overlapping.  Any time there is mention of regionalisation I ask myself what new appointments will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our present economic climate there is no reason for hoping that any extra moneys will be made available in the field of health.  Indeed a number of projects in the Midland Health Board area have had to be abandoned. One example is the home for aged that was proposed for my area.  Although the tender for that building has been sent to the Department the cash is not available to go ahead with the project. From reading the Minister's speech we can have no reason to hope there will be any extension of the health services or that there will be any new building <Col N="1356" /> developments.  I doubt if the Government have the money to do anything in this field.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright spoke of the question of general hospitals.  All I would say in this regard is that we need have no worry because it is not likely that there will be enough money to build as much as a wing to any of those hospitals.  We have been told that the Minister is to announce some plans later in regard to general hospitals, but we are entitled to ask where he proposes to get the money for whatever plans he has in mind.  There is no point in announcing a fancy programme if there is no prospect of its being implemented.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of a regional hospital where people from surrounding areas are catered for.  There has been mention of mini-hospitals.  The word &ldquo;mini&rdquo; conveys a shortage of something or something that is skimpy. It is my belief that whoever mooted the idea of mini-hospitals had in mind something that would be of benefit to himself.  I would ask that when the Minister comes to announce the proposals, he announces a general hospital for the region.</P>
    <P>I would not agree with these mini-scale hospitals anywhere in the country. In County Offaly, the extern hospital account is about £3 million. That is what we are paying to outside hospitals and if mini-hospitals were brought in, would that not continue?  It must continue, if it is mini-scale, if my information is right.  I have found it very difficult to get anybody to explain to me what these mini-scale hospitals are, and even at the health board meetings they were unable to explain it, but I know what a regional hospital is.  Such a hospital covers all the needs of the people and the extern hospital patient treatment would then be practically nil.</P>
    <P>If we are to have extern hospital treatment and to have mini-scale hospitals, it would be better for the Minister to improve the existing services in the county hospitals in Mullingar, Tullamore and Portlaoise and leave it so.  I am totally and utterly against these mini-scale hospitals, the proposals for which I believe are in the Minister's <Col N="1357" /> office awaiting his attention.  These in my opinion would be bad for the region and I want to put it on the records of the House that irrespective of where the hospital goes, a regional hospital is the hospital for the Midland Health Board area.  When the Minister has to make a decision on it, it will not be an easy decision, but if he makes it in the interests of the health of the people, as I believe he will, he will go for the regional hospital.  These minis being spoken about are out.  They are no use because we will still have the extern hospital account, paying for outside hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>The mental hospitals are doing a very good job and I want to congratulate the staff in St. Fintan's Hospital in Portlaoise.  They look after the patients of Laois-Offaly and I would like to thank the RMS and all the staff in that hospital for the work they have done down the years.  At times the work in these hospitals is unpleasant because mental illness is a difficult illness to handle and look after but they are doing an excellent job in St. Fintan's.  There is no overcrowding anywhere and the patients are very well looked after.  The food is excellent and the surroundings and social amenities first class.</P>
    <P>There were some adverse comments recently about these mental hospitals suggesting that there was such and such wrong with them.  As far as the mental hospital in Portlaoise is concerned, it is giving an excellent service and some of the patients I have seen who had to go in there, after two weeks were able to come out and go back to their jobs.  That is due to the treatment provided by the doctors and everybody in that hospital.  The only fault I see is that when the patients come out of these hospitals some of them go to the clinics as well and the drugs they receive there are abused.  They are thrown about and there is a lot of waste.  I do not know how you would correct that situation but these drugs are costing an awful amount of money today.  I think their cost is the heaviest drain on the purse now.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the Estimate in general, as I see it, the Minister has very little to offer because the finances <Col N="1358" /> available to him were greatly tied up and have dried up.  Nobody can deny that and it is easy to know why this happened.  That situation has been brought about by the Government's handling of the country's financial affairs, a Government who have not made money available but have brought about a situation in which capital is leaving the country.  There is no doubt that the taxation policy of the Government has had an effect on the financial resources the Minister has available.  I do not know how he can extend any hospitals, never mind build new ones.  I cannot see that coming about at all and if we are able to keep the hospitals and all these homes in operation he will be doing very well because what is alarming is the increase in the running costs of hospitals. Salaries and running costs generally have gone up by about 30 per cent a year.  This is an enormous increase.  That being so it would put an extra strain on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Estimate presented by the Minister will meet the requirements of the health service in this financial year.  In fact, I do not think it is sufficient to keep the existing services in operation.  The problem of alcoholism has been referred to by many Deputies.  This is more of a problem now because the youth spend four nights each week, from Thursday to Sunday night, in every rock and roll house in the country.  They go to these places because they are licensed to sell drink.  A young lad going for a night's entertainment will first ask if the dance hall or premises where a ballad session is being held is licensed.  The swing is away from the dance hall and all the youth want is to drink and drink.</P>
    <P>When I visited a premises where a ballad session was being held recently I could not help noticing that many of the young people were between 15 and 16 years of age.  A young fellow who approached me pulled a £5 note out of his pocket and asked me if I was having a drink&mdash;I can remember when he did not have 5p to spare. Many of those young people, if one refuses to accept the invitation to have a drink, give the impression that they <Col N="1359" /> have been insulted.  I do not think educating the youth about the dangers of alcohol will help; it is a phase they are going through.  The problem of drink is carried into the homes.  The young people give money to their parents on a Friday night but when Monday night comes they are borrowing some of that money back.</P>
    <P>Because of this problem of drink we now have hooliganism at football matches and other centres of entertainment. The youth, apparently, have no interest in games and this is bad for their morale.  One feature about this is that it brings in the finance into the Exchequer and keeps publicans and pop groups happy.  The evening papers are covered with advertisements for pop groups but if one wants evidence of how serious this problem is and how the young people are affected by drink all one has to do is to visit any of the mental hospitals. There are many broken homes through drink and drugs and we should endeavour to impress upon our youth the importance of drinking in moderation.</P>
    <P>While a lot has been done in regard to the care of mentally handicapped children many problems still exist. The problem with mentally handicapped children is mainly that it is not possible to find suitable homes for them.  It is also very costly to care for these children.  Even if there was sufficient finance available the Minister would experience difficulty in finding accommodation.  It is not right to put such children into a mental hospital; they should have specialised treatment.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any new hospitals being extended or erected in the midland region in the next ten years because there is no money available for this work.  The sheik has been well shook and he has not a lot left.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs made a trip to the Middle East recently to see if there was anything left there but, apparently, the fellow is not around any more, according to a reply in the House last week.  We are back to square one.  We will be doing well if we are able to keep what we have.  I <Col N="1360" /> regret I have to say I cannot see any new extensions being provided or buildings being erected for some time to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern of the last speaker for my difficulties.  I am grateful to those who have contributed to the debate.  I think there were more contributions than usual which, as some Deputies have pointed out, stresses the importance of this Department. Apart from a few barbs, I recognised the sincerity of what people were saying because this is an important area so far as the public are concerned. All aspects of the health service were covered although there was different emphasis placed on the various services.  I do not think I will be expected to reply to every point raised in the debate but I shall try to draw the main points together.</P>
      <P>I do not know if it was unusual but I should like to congratulate the shadow spokesman for health on his attendance during the debate.  I appreciate it and it demonstrates his interest in the sphere for which he has been given responsibility as a member of the front bench of the Opposition.  His opening remarks in the debate were predictable.  I did not expect any bouquets from him or from any side of the House.  He described my speech as &ldquo;pedestrian&rdquo;; perhaps I could say his speech was equestrian.  He was a little niggling and peevish at times.  I admit that the opening speaker for the Opposition is somewhat at a disadvantage in that he has only a short time to go through the Minister's speech, to pick out what he considers the important and the vulnerable points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey referred to a shortage of financial resources and said I was totally submerged by the economic situation.  I do not think I should ever be dishonest with this House and I freely admitted in my speech that resources were not available to the same extent as last year or the year before.  I did not try to disguise anything.  I said that the situation was one of difficulty and that it did not allow me and the Government <Col N="1361" /> to make the improvements we would make in normal times.  These are not normal times and everyone accepts that fact.  The situation is not unique to this country.  I do not wish to engage in an economic debate because my function is to try to spend as best I can the moneys allocated to me.  Most developed countries have the same kind of problems but despite that I repeat my statement that so far as the Department of Health are concerned there will be a growth of 1½ per cent after allowance is made for inflation.  Such a growth rate is not inconsiderable in 1975 having regard to the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The amount of money allocated last year and the previous year was an indication of the Government's determination to improve social services particularly in health and social welfare where there have been spectacular improvements in the last two or three years.  I think Deputy Haughey will agree that we will never have enough money for health services. There is always an incessant demand and I think this is admitted in the Fianna Fáil discussion document which will be the basis of their policy later.</P>
    <P>The last speaker was most pessimistic. While we will not be able to improve the services as much as we would like this year, there will be some development and improvement. The amount allocated for current expenditure last year was £169 million and it has been raised this year to £198 million.  There will be improvements this year.  Nobody should be under the misapprehension that there will be cutbacks in health services in 1975.</P>
    <P>Between 1972-73 and 1975 there has been an increase of 84 per cent in health expenditure in money terms&mdash;I realise of course that is not the real guide&mdash; and in real terms the average over the three years has been approximately 6 per cent.  I do not think I need apologise to anyone for the level of development in the health services during that period.  It can also be seen that a greater percentage of the gross national product is being devoted to the health services.  In 1972-73 it was <Col N="1362" /> 4.8 per cent and in 1975 it was 5.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said we would not be able to erect buildings in 1975 but if he had read my speech or had been present in the House he would know that is not the case.  As far as capital expenditure is concerned, there will be 30 new building projects in major works at the general hospitals in 1975. They may not go to Laois-Offaly but we must devote the money to the areas where it is most needed.  I think it will be agreed that these new building projects are worthwhile and are necessary for the operation of the health services, not in any special place but throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies are under the impression there will not be any improvements so far as personnel are concerned. This is entirely untrue because in current expenditure I have allocated moneys to health boards to enable them to commission institutions and buildings that will be completed during the year.  I should like to list the units of accommodation which will be commissioned during the year.  Many speakers mentioned welfare homes. This year eight welfare homes will be completed and that will mean an extra 320 places for the aged; five units of new accommodation for chronically sick aged persons, comprising 230 beds; nine hospitals for psychiatric patients; two industrial therapy units; a child psychiatric unit; two acute psychiatric units and two intensive care units.  Health boards have been notified these funds are available.  There are other units of accommodation in the voluntary hospital areas which will have staff provided for them this year and, with the deployment of staff and the other changes effected in the hospital services I have mentioned, there will be the creation of 500 new jobs.  I would not regard that as a cut-back, certainly not as dangerous as the last speaker, Deputy Connolly, suggested it would be.</P>
    <P>In respect of one particular place in Dublin which seemed to cause concern to Deputy Ray Burke and Deputy Ciarán Murphy, one would get the impression from what they <Col N="1363" /> said that nothing was being done.  I would like to remind them that a scheme for heating and hot and cold water services is expected to be completed this year at a cost of £620,000. I am not suggesting all that money is being spent, but these things will be completed this year and the bulk of the money will be paid.  There are other improvements in that hospital costing quite an amount of money and tenders have been invited for still further improvements costing in the region of £500,000.</P>
    <P>I freely admit the financing of health services poses a big problem.  It is not unique to this country; it is a continuing dilemma every country is experiencing. There have been allegations of abuses by health boards and allegations of waste.  Members have queried the efficiency of the health boards.  There seems to be divided opinion as to the efficiency of the boards compared with the old county system.  As far as I am concerned, I have no real evidence and no statistics to show whether or not the old system was more efficient.  The health boards were established in 1970.  I believe the system is working reasonably well and that was the conclusion come to independently by the various groups that attended the Waterford seminar.  No matter what system we adopt the cost of the services, because of their labour-intensive nature, are prone to very, very steep and rapid increases year by year.  Members may be surprised to know that in the hospital services, both the health board hospitals and the voluntary hospitals, there are 43,000 people employed.  When one has regard to inflation and the labour-intensive nature of the work one readily understands that quite an amount of money goes by way of payment of salaries and wages.  There are hundreds of grades in the hospital service.</P>
    <P>All this poses the question of how to get the best benefits from the services, particularly in the light of rapidly rising costs and changing technologies which mean more expensive medicines and methods have to be employed and have naturally to be paid for.  There <Col N="1364" /> are ever-increasing demands.  Every speaker in the debate had some demands to make, demands totalling some millions of pounds expenditure in his own health board area.  I do not take exception to this.  It is the duty of the Government to provide money and it is the duty of the Minister to try to get the money and, having got it, to employ it in the best way he can.  Expenditures of millions and millions of pounds have been demanded in this debate and by way of parliamentary question.  All these demands cannot be met in just one year. People are inclined to think in terms of one year in regard to any particular project.  Opposition Deputies and Government Deputies should remember that, when they talk about building various units of accommodation, clinics and so on, they are not talking about something that arose only in the last two or three years.  They are talking of a backlog going back five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten years.  I freely admit that even to keep the services at present levels needs vastly increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>I paid tribute in the past to legislation passed by the former Administration, particularly in the 1970 Act, which provides for all sorts of services. It is all very well to legislate for people to get dentures, particularly those in the lower income group, but money has to be provided.  We can legislate for all these things but, having legislated, the problem then is to get the money in order to deliver the goods.  So far as expenditure is concerned we must examine and analyse the existing services and determine priorities.  It is not a very easy job to evaluate benefit in terms of health care in any particular service and it is more difficult still to make a comparison between the benefits to be gained from the different services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey talked about cost/ benefit.  I agree with him.  I believe he is an accountant.  I must confess, as a layman, I do not know how this exercise could be engaged in but I believe it could be done and I believe it should be done.  There are very limited areas I can think of where savings could be made, apart from <Col N="1365" /> one particular item to which I shall refer later.  For instance, one could save money in the psychiatric service if it were possible to provide for the patients outside an institution with relatives or with someone else.  That would be much cheaper.  Again, kidney transplants would be much cheaper than renal dialysis in the home or in the hospital.  These are small examples of what could be done. People talk about shifting resources but to do that quickly is wellnigh impossible; if it is to be done at all it must be done gradually.</P>
    <P>One thing that came out loud and clear in this debate was the unanimity in regard to the extension of community care.  The emphasis was on saving hospital costs, not just general hospital costs but all the other institutional costs.  Some progress has been made.  I do not claim credit for it all because it did not happen in my time but it shows the trend and it shows the direction in which we hope we are going and the direction in which I hope the medical profession think it is best to go.</P>
    <P>In the health board regional hospitals in 1973 the duration of stay was 11.8 days as against 19.2 days in 1966. There was a somewhat similar reduction in the county hospitals as between 1966 and 1973, from 11.4 to 9.5 days. If we can, and if it is proper to reduce it further we can save an immense amount of money and we can also make beds available for those in various parts of the country who cannot get beds at the present time.</P>
    <P>There have been allegations of waste.  We heard Deputy Connolly talk about expensive advertisements and other Deputies spoke about empire building.  Various other suggestions of abuse, and of course, of overlapping of services or overlapping of personnel and in some cases too much personnel, were made.  On the other hand, we remember the demands that have been made in the House from those directly connected with the health boards.  There have been suggestions that we should have more and more personnel attached to the various institutions of the health boards.  I believe the members of the <Col N="1366" /> health boards have a responsibility.  I have the overall responsibility of trying to ensure that the moneys are spent in the right way but the questions that are being addressed to me in some respects should be addressed to the health boards, the CEOs and the programme managers.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be disrespectful to my late predecessor but I remember that was the attitude he took up.  He even refused to answer questions on medical cards or on anything to do with the health boards. He said they should be addressed to the health boards.  I suggest that if those who spoke here believe there is abuse, waste, empire building and too much staff, the place to take it up is with the health boards.  The Department of Health and the officials of my Department are always watchful to ensure as far as they can that there is no waste and no overstaffing.  Members of this House and members of health boards in particular should engage themselves in that sort of practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey in his speech spoke about the possibility of giving health boards full budgetary powers.  I am not too clear what he meant.  My initial reaction was that maybe he meant they should be allowed to decide themselves what schemes they would operate and what schemes they would develop and just send the bill back to the Department of Health. I do not think he meant that and I do not think it would be correct. There must be some control by the Department of Health, particularly in view of the fact that the Department now pay 90 per cent of the total cost of the health bill.  I make no secret of this, and Deputy Haughey knows it, that when one gets around the Cabinet table there are other considerations besides one's own Department and particularly, as far as I am concerned, in respect of social welfare, housing and education, those which could be regarded as social Departments.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy and the House will accept that the Minister for Health and the Government must retain the right to determine priorities for the whole country.  The determination <Col N="1367" /> of these priorities will obviously impose some constraint on the way the health boards can spend their money.  For example, if they decide to shift it from hospital to community care it must be done in such a way that there will not be a disruption of the service.  However, when priorities are agreed between the Department of Health and the various health boards, I can see a case for allowing flexibility to the boards in the job of providing services, especially the improvement of services in areas where deficiencies now exist&mdash;and there are many.</P>
    <P>The overall policy must be generated and must be conveyed to the health boards by the Minister for Health through the officials in the Department of Health.  I thought the Deputy was childishly critical of what he described as my listing of minor developments since last November. Maybe it was one of the things which annoyed him when he flipped through my speech whilst I was making it.  That sort of an Estimate speech is not unusual.  It is only right the House should know what has been spent and what will be spent during the current year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also chided me because I mentioned the thalidomide children and the compensation which was given to them and my reference to the National Social Service Council, a council which is regarded as very important by two able colleagues of his, Deputy Wyse and Deputy Ray MacSharry.  I believe it is my duty to detail as far as I can the expenditure in respect of the various health services.  It is not the first time that the Deputy spoke in some vague sort of way about my relationship with the professions in the medical services. What Minister for Health has not had some difficulty with the medical profession? My late predecessor had.  I remember a long and bitter row between the former Deputy MacEntee and the medical profession.  I believe I am on good terms with the medical profession.  I do not know if they would agree with that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> The medical profession voluntarily participated in a seminar in Waterford. There was never a question about their practice.  There was never a question of interference with their jobs.  Any time there was any sort of a dispute or difficulty between the medical profession and myself was in trying to arrive at a proper salary or a proper fee.</P>
    <P>I had my dispute with the junior hospital doctors.  They went through the usual processes and after long discussions over a period of a month we settled the dispute.  Similarly, in respect of those engaged in the choice of doctor scheme they had their demand and I had my view.  They went to arbitration but eventually the difficulties were solved.  If bad relationship with the profession means that I have a dispute about money they are bad relations but I do not believe such is the case.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy who spoke was concerned about the general hospital plan.  Some time ago I announced what the position in Dublin would be and talked about the development of six major hospitals in Dublin, which entailed the building of two hospitals, one at Newlands and the other at Beaumont.  Deputy Moore spoke about the plans for St. James's Hospital. I should like to tell him that planning is going on quite well.  A project team of the Department of Health and members of the hospital board has been set up and detailed planning has been going on.</P>
    <P>As far as the other five major hospitals are concerned, discussions have taken place between the Department of Health, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the hospital authorities concerned with a view to the planning of the hospitals.  I am very pleased to say that the discussions are going on well.  It is proposed to set up project teams in respect of those other five hospitals together with the project team established for the planning of St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked about Beaumont.  I should like to tell him that discussions between my Department and the owners of the site to be <Col N="1369" /> acquired are going on favourably.  I do not see any hitch in that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to the Federation of the Dublin Voluntary Hospitals and asked if it was working. I was very surprised to hear Deputy Moore ask that question because he is a member of the board of Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital and it is included in the federation.  It was established in 1961 to co-ordinate the activities of the seven Dublin hospitals: the Adelaide, the Meath, Sir Patrick Dun's, Dr. Steevens', The Royal City of Dublin, the Children's Hospital and Mercer's Hospital.</P>
    <P>Before it was established the small hospitals recognised that they could not continue independently.  This has been emphasised in the recent decision on the Dublin hospital plan which was very much welcomed by the federation.  I am very pleased to say that the federation is co-operating fully in the implementation of that plan.  Needless to say, Dublin has not been a problem but various Deputies had various interests in the general hospital plan for the country.  Naturally their interest was in their own constituencies.</P>
    <P>I have been accused of being dilatory in making a decision.  I do not accept that.  The Fitzgerald Committee was set up in 1967 and the report was published in 1968.  Fianna Fáil did not do a thing about it.  They now want me to resolve this very difficult problem in a period of 18 months.  It was dropped.  It was buried.  People were given the impression that the Fitzgerald plan would not be implemented. I had my criticisms of that report and most Deputies rejected the recommendations in that report. In a very short time it was forgotten.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey knows the need for a general hospital plan and, indeed, has in some fairly vague way referred to it in the document which I was grateful to receive from the Fianna Fáil Party this morning.  That document did not attempt to make any specific suggestions about a hospital plan.  Paragraph (g) under the heading &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; says that while basic services must be uniform and of the highest possible standard through <Col N="1370" /> out the country, regional and national centres for highly specialised units will be provided.  I presume what is meant by that is that they will think about a hospital plan when all the cumainn in the country have received this document and considered it.  If they are going to start from scratch on the assumption that they will win the next general election, I presume that plan will be shelved for another seven or eight years.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence in the Department of Health that anything was to be done about a general hospital plan. The general election of 1969 came and went and there was no mention of a hospital plan.  The general election of 1973 came and there was no announcement or no murmur whatsoever about a hospital plan.  The impression given to supporters of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour was that Fianna Fáil had no intention of implementing any plan.  I believe this plan is necessary.  It is acknowledged by Fianna Fáil and by Deputy Haughey that the plan is necessary.  I have been pressing ahead in order to finalise what I consider to be a fair and equitable plan for general hospitals which will give the best medical services to the people.  I had to start from scratch.</P>
    <P>I faced up to the problem.  I treated it in a different way from the way in which it was treated by Deputy Seán Flanagan, who was then Minister for Health.  He established the Fitzgerald Committee in 1967.  It was recognised at that time that the members of the committee were all consultants.  That does not take away from their ability as consultants or their ability to give their opinion as to what a hospital plan should be.  The big criticism at that time was that other people were not involved, and particularly public representatives were not involved.  In a matter like this those of us who were members of a health board should not have been involved.  It was for that reason that I referred the whole matter of a general hospital plan to the Comhairle na nOspidéal. They gave me certain guidelines. These guidelines were presented to the eight health boards.  There was <Col N="1371" /> widespread consultation with Comhairle na nOspidéal, the regional hospital boards and the health boards.  They came up with certain suggestions to me upon which I will have to act in a very short time.</P>
    <P>I believe in consultation with people.  I believe in their involvement so far as possible in decisions which have to be made.  I met 20 deputations in connection with the hospitals.  I considered everything they said.  When I say I met 20 deputations I should preface it by saying that these were not necessarily deputations from any particular health board.  They were from county advisory committees and various other interests in the various towns, such as chambers of commerce and social groups.</P>

      <P>I would not call them pressure groups.  I would say they were people who were genuinely concerned about their own towns the same as any Deputy would be and the same as I would be concerned about mine.  No deputation was refused.  It is not my practice to refuse to receive any deputation.</P>
      <P>The plan which I hope to publish before the end of the session will be much more acceptable than the plan suggested in the Fitzgerald Report. It will not please everybody.  If we are to have a proper hospital plan and proper hospitals in various parts of the country, we must be prepared to make sacrifices and we must be prepared to make decisions which I believe will be in the best interests of people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey suggested the establishment of project teams on the same lines as the project teams established for the planning of the regional schools of technology.  The Deputy has a very good point.  That has been done in St. James's Hospital. The same sort of practice will be adopted in other hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell suggested that there should be a centralised register <Col N="1372" /> for the recruiting of trainee nurses operated by An Bord Altranais.  I can see the merit in this.  I believe it is one of the matters that should be examined.  Certainly I shall refer it to them by the Working Party on Nursing I am establishing.  There are some Deputies in the House who believe that anybody who wants to should become a nurse.  Had that obtained in the country over the last decades, I am afraid we would be swamped with nurses.  I know it is a natural vocation for an Irish girl but, unfortunately, there are not enough positions to go round.  There was a Deputy who said that a neighbour of his had got three honours in the Leaving Certificate but she was refused admission as a trainee and another Deputy who knew somebody who had got two passes only, or something like that, and she had been admitted.  I do not think there is any lesson to be learned from that because, as far as nursing is concerned, academic qualifications are not the be-all or end-all.  I would say the interview board would try to assess candidates' potential capabilities as nurses rather than admitting people who had five, six, or seven honours in their Leaving Certificates.  However, that is a problem, as indeed is the over-production&mdash;if I may use that expression&mdash;of doctors here. Both problems must be looked at.  It is pathetic to see these girls applying from hospital to hospital in an endeavour to be taken on in some of the training schools.  If it could be done properly, it would be a good idea if there was established a central register.  There might be difficulties involved in that but it would obviate the necessity of these girls having to apply to seven or eight hospitals in order to ensure they will be admitted to one.</P>
    <P>It was inevitable that the question of medical cards would be brought up in this debate; it was inevitable that it would be mentioned by each Deputy who spoke.  I believe high priority must be given to this area because, after all, it concerns the people who were regarded as being in <Col N="1373" /> the lower bracket so far as their incomes were concerned.  I agree that high priority should be given to the extension of medical cards but I believe also that, since I became Minister for Health, progress has been made.  There have been 231,813 people covered by medical cards which, in percentages, means that those covered in 1972-73 at 28.4 per cent are now up to 35.2 per cent. That ought to be an indication of my concern for these people, particularly those on the borderline.  I recognise that there is hardship still being experienced in meeting doctors' fees and various other medical expenses even though the cost of drugs now to families is limited to the extent of their having to pay £4 only per month. Certainly, I have sympathy with those just outside the limits laid down, shall I say, the uniform guidelines laid down, particularly those people who have not got medical cards and who have sustained or frequent periods of illness.  I should like to see the hardship clause being operated by the chief executive officers of the health boards around the country.</P>
    <P>I can see a case for the issue of a medical card to one person in a family who may be chronically ill or delicate all his life.  It is indeed difficult to dole out whatever a doctor charges now in various area.  No matter how one views it, it is £2 off the wage packet and, if there has to be two visits made, it is £4 off the wage packet weekly. Mind you, such people live from week to week; they have nothing just before they draw their wages on a Friday evening or Saturday morning.  I believe the hardship clause should be used more liberally by the CEOs than is being done at present.  The cost burden is fairly heavy on some of these people but, as I have indicated, progress has been made.  However I recognise that much more needs to be done in that field.  I should like to extend further, and as rapidly as resources allow, the entitlement to medical cards, particularly in relation to the needs and demands of other areas.  I do not underestimate the difficulties, as I had occasion to say on Deputy Haughey's Private Members' Motion some time <Col N="1374" /> ago.  Again I must have regard to cost, and cost is a factor which Fianna Fáil recognised in the White Paper issued here this morning.</P>
    <P>In 1972-73 general medical services cost £12 million.  In the year 1975 they are costing £21 million, which is an increase of 75 per cent.  I forget in what part of the document there was reference to it; I cannot find the exact quotation.  It did speak about steady progress as resources became available. That is valid enough.  But the motion by the Opposition, to which I have referred, would have cost £15 million.  Fifteen million pounds, were it available, would be very desirable to have devoted to that branch of the health services.  My approach is that we would extend gradually medical cards to the greatest number of the population as we can, having regard to resources and, in addition, other demands.  I see the need for it.  Just as any other Deputy in the House, I meet my constituents and receive the incessant calls for medical cards.  I know what are their difficulties and problems and what they suffer.  As far as I am concerned, I shall try to improve the situation as soon as I possibly can.  But there have been improvements made.  I find I did write down the quotation from the document to which I referred.  It says: &ldquo;There must be a steady and progressive extension of general medical services.&rdquo; Yes, certainly I would agree with that but I do not think that the motion which suggested an increase from 35 per cent to 60 per cent could be described as steady progress or as having regard to the moneys available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey suggested also that inflation would put some medical card holders out of the full eligibility class. This is so.  I am afraid that others who did not hear or read my speech at the beginning did not realise that I said that, in consultations with the Chief Executive Officers, steps would be taken to review the guidelines fixed in June last because I do appreciate that some people could be put out of full eligibility.  As far as I am concerned, the review will ensure that inflation will not hurt these people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell seemed to <Col N="1375" /> have the idea that there was some secrecy about the guidelines.  I had occasion recently to tell him that the guidelines were available at the health boards throughout the country, but he wants to make them more widely known to the public.  I think it would be a waste to advertise these guidelines even though it might be once or twice a year only.  There is established a National Social Service Council; there will be community information centres in the various areas, where all that sort of information can be obtained.  Were it to be done in respect of guidelines on eligibility for medical cards, possibly it would have to be done also in relation to the other cash benefits and so on in the Department of Health and to the many cash benefits and conditions in respect of benefits and allowances paid by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell made a suggestion that the public should be educated to the &ldquo;over-use of medical cards&rdquo;, as he described it.  There is a possibility that this is so, not in any deliberate way by the holders of medical cards.  People believe that because they have medical cards they are entitled to visit the doctor of their choice at any time, I suppose sometimes unnecessarily.  I am not in a position to judge that because I am not in the medical profession.</P>
    <P>I recall that in Britain there was a campaign to ensure that the health service would not be over used.  I do not know if we can do that with our own system, but, it is worth looking at.  It was suggested that we should make the people aware of the cost of these calls.  I know that would not impress a great many of my constituents but there is the possibility that if they believe as taxpayers they were using money that need not be used, they might react to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Toal made the point about eligibility.  He said there was a gap between the time a child left the primary school and went into the secondary until he became eligible in his or her own right for a medical card at 16 years of age.  I would like to bridge that gap as Deputy Toal <Col N="1376" /> suggests but I do not think it would be possible to do so at this time.  The children of the families&mdash;35 per cent of the population&mdash;covered by the scheme would not, of course, be affected.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that we might exclude social welfare recipients in the determination of eligibility for medical cards.  I do not know if the Deputy was talking about benefits or assistance as such.  Those in receipt of assistance have already gone through a means test and become automatically entitled to a medical card.  When dealing with those in receipt of social welfare benefit, that is, insurance benefits on their stamp record, it would have to be taken into consideration because such a person might have another income.</P>

    <P>Practically every Deputy spoke about the community care service.  I share their views and stressed this in my opening speech.  I also expressed the belief that we would make a bigger effort to keep people out of hospital. I am attempting to shift resources to this specific area.  As has been pointed out it is more expensive to provide hospital care than to provide community care.  For the purpose of discussion we have two areas of community <Col N="1377" /> care&mdash;primary health which is provided by the general practitioners and public health nurses, dentists, social and other para-medical workers and the welfare workers.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the developments in primary health care.  The progress in the general medical service has been matched by a steady improvement in other community health services.  That may not mean much to people who are not concerned, but there was the introduction this year of the very desirable extension of this service to long-term illness, and the extension of the free drugs and medicine scheme.  The activities of the public health nurse is very important in community health.  This scheme has also been approved.  At present we have 800 public health nurses which, I admit, is not a dramatic increase on the number we had in 1972.  It is encouraging that 70 public health nurses are being trained each year.  As far as the community service is concerned, these nurses are very important.  It is my ambition to try to increase the numbers as quickly as I can.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that we were slowing down the building of homes for the aged.  The contrary is the case, as I indicated in the list I read out at the beginning of my speech this evening.</P>
    <P>Deputies also spoke about the inadequacies of the dental and ophthalmic services.  I do not deny their allegations.  I have seen this problem for a number of years.  I will not say there have been improvements in them in the last two or three years or even for some years before that.  This is a long standing problem, and I can assure the House that as far as I can I will try to have it improved as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. O'Leary and Deputy Power complained about the school health examination and the reduction in the numbers of children examined between 1969 and 1973.  The decrease in the numbers examined is due mainly to a change in the nature of the school examination scheme which took place since 1969.  In that year <Col N="1378" /> the object was to provide three routine school examinations for each child when at national school.  The examinations were relatively simple and, without any reflection on those who carried them out, they were not in-depth examinations.  I will not say they were crude, but a proper diagnosis was not made.</P>
    <P>In 1973 it was decided to replace that system with a more detailed examination.  The objective now is to provide a detailed examination of all new entrants and to provide a followup examination of the children considered to be at risk resulting from the first examination.  This is a desirable change because, of necessity, it would not be possible to examine every child in every national school in the country on his entrance to a school.  I believe that this system will identify those at risk and in need of treatment in view of the fact that they will be getting a more thorough examination from now on.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDonald referred to the cost of drugs in the GMS and said there could be considerable waste.  He said an all-out effort should be made to encourage economy.  The House is aware that we are in negotiation with the pharmaceutical organisation and it has been agreed that there should be an examination, conducted jointly with the medical organisations.  This investigation will be under way very soon. There were complaints about delays in refunds in regard to drugs.  I was not aware of it and I will try to ensure that refunds to the middle income class will be made as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry said the guidelines for medical cards should not be so rigid.  He suggested that for certain services the CEOs should be more flexible in accepting eligibility.  I have dealt with that and I said my view is that there could be more use of the hardship clause than there is.  Deputy McDonald spoke of the limit of 2,000 patients for the general medical service in each area.  He said this could lead to difficulties and it should be made more flexible.  I should like to inform him that 2,000 is not a rigid figure.  It can exceed that because health boards <Col N="1379" /> have discretion to fix a higher limit if it is needed in any particular area.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the community welfare services as distinct from the community health services, there were three particular points made.  Deputy Callanan was one of the first to speak on this question.  He rightly values the home help service and the work of the voluntary organisations in this respect.  He advocated further development and I agree with him because I think it is very valuable to keep old people and children out of institutions, apart altogether from the daily or weekly cost of accommodating them in institutions.  Deputy Callanan congratulated the voluntary workers and all of us subscribe to that.  He advocated further development and stressed the need to keep as many people as possible out of hospital.  I have not been remiss in this matter. Again, I can only quote money to illustrate what I am speaking about.  In 1972-73 the amount devoted to the home help service was £150,000 and in 1975 the amount allocated is £960,000. Therefore, as far as financing that service is concerned, it cannot be said we have fallen down.  The service has been improved vastly.  I appreciate there may have been more demand for that service this year but the plain fact is that there has been an increase of £800,000. It benefits about 300 families, 3,000 elderly people and 450 handicapped and invalided people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan questioned me recently in the House about this service and suggested the money had run out.  I cannot understand this.  I made further inquiries and discovered that last year the allocation for the Western Health Board was £218,000.  This year it is £280,000, an increase of 28 per cent.  I did not take exception to what Deputy Callanan said.  Perhaps the problem is that many more people are looking for this service and if it is to be continued in respect of the people who have been availing of it for the past two or three years I do not think health boards should take on new people. Having regard to the fact that the Western Health Board are receiving <Col N="1380" /> £280,000 this year as against £219,000 last year I do not think there is any great crib.</P>

      <P>I agree but things like this cannot be done in any one year. It has to be done by a process of taking money from the hospital fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to know what people are talking about when they refer to &ldquo;prescribed allowances&rdquo;. That is the official term given to an allowance made available by the Department of Social Welfare, not the Department of Health, to persons who are not able to look after themselves, who are in receipt of pensions and who have some near relatives to take care of them.  It has not been done away with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>People are getting a bit mixed up when they talk of these allowances in relation to home help service.  Another point in relation to community care was raised by Deputy Wyse who referred to the National Social Service Council.  The establishment of that body and the giving of teeth to them have been welcomed by the House, particularly by Deputy MacSharry who said that people did not know their entitlements and this would mean the establishment of centres where they could find out about their entitlements.  The service of Deputies and other public representatives in this regard has been in great demand but we are in the process of establishing such centres. It will not be done in a full year but these centres will be available in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wyse suggested that relations between the council and local <Col N="1381" /> community groups would be damaged if the council were to be the licensing body.  He may be unduly concerned about this because the role of the National Social Service Council is in setting standards and if and when individual standards are achieved and staff are suitably trained I am certain the council will have wholehearted support.  Any centre that has the trained staff for it will qualify.  It is not the intention of the council to disrupt relations between them and the voluntary organisations.  The council's job is to get voluntary organisations to work in harmony.</P>
    <P>The third point in respect of community care was in relation to social work services and the employment of the personnel who have been doing such valuable work.  This is part of the family support services.  Their work is valued and it is desirable there would be further improvement. Progress has been made.  In 1972 there was 38 social workers attached to the health boards.  Now there are 133, a trend which indicates my concern to develop this service as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Their work has not been seen at its best, in that we have not enough of them, but Deputy Dr. O'Connell said &mdash;and nobody disagreed with him&mdash; that the fact that a person gets a diploma indicates that he is a good social worker.  There is the stipulation of course that after qualifying they must train for a year under supervision and must do a post graduate course the year after. Therefore the Deputy can be assured that social workers will be properly trained and will give the service required, particularly to the families that need that service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said it was a mistake to have the same person&mdash;and he was not being personal&mdash;as Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare.  This is a criticism we have heard before, but I would refute it on two grounds.  First, all Deputies will agree that there must be a co-ordination between the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare, because if social security does not offer reasonable incomes <Col N="1382" /> for recipients, then there is the possibility that the health services will meet the need.  It is not unusual in other countries to have the same Minister in the dual capacity.  The late Deputy Dr. Jim Ryan was also Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare.  Furthermore, it was a recommendation contained in the Devlin Report.  Secondly, I wish to refute the implication that the Government's performance in regard to health policy is not all it might be.  I have given figures to show the improvements that have taken place in the last two-and-a-half years.  I am afraid Deputy Haughey did not read his own policy discussion paper because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy concedes Fianna Fáil made mistakes in the past.  It probably was not in his time.  Most Deputies talked about the mentally handicapped.  It is gratifying to note the interest of Deputies in this regard, and it is also very good to know that there is a new and enlightened attitude among the public. I recognise the need to develop services for the mentally handicapped, and I also believe it is desirable, as Deputies have said, to provide alternative accommodation to the psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree these hospitals were never intended for the mentally handicapped. They certainly were not equipped to provide the appropriate therapeutic environment.  This system <Col N="1383" /> was built up over the years, but there has been a change of policy recently.  I am not saying this has happened in my time.  As I say, there has been an enlightened approach by the people in recent times and there has been different thinking and right thinking, in my view, by various Ministers for Health over the past ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>I believe the admissions of mentally handicapped to psychiatric hospitals should cease as soon as possible, but until proper accommodation is available, of necessity, some admissions of the mentally handicapped to psychiatric hospitals will continue.  Of course, there is an increasing demand for accommodation, because in recent years the expectancy of life has increased, and particularly in this group. However, progress is continuing and despite the gloomy prophecies of some of those who spoke, extra places are being planned for the mentally handicapped to the extent of 142 in 1975, 266 in 1976, 140 in 1977, and 210 in 1978.  I gave some details of these places in my opening speech and again here tonight.  In addition, there is under examination a proposal for a further 650 places.  These are being examined and I hope to be able to make progress in this regard as well.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I hope the increasing number of mentally handicapped will not require permanent residential care.  I would hope that those who graduate from the special children's centres, with the benefit of training and placement services under the new National Rehabilitation Board, will be able to work in the community either at home or in the hostels.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said there were some parts of the report on the training and employment of the handicapped with which he would not agree.  I would be genuinely interested to know what these parts are, because having read the report and talked to members of the working party, I came to the conclusion that their assessment of the situation was correct and that their proposals were acceptable.  I think Deputy Haughey thought the National Rehabilitation Board was to become <Col N="1384" /> some sort of bureaucratic organisation and that there would not be sufficient freedom for the voluntary organisations. That was not the view of the working party; it is not the attitude of the Board, and it is certainly not my wish that they would act in that capacity.</P>

      <P>No, but if Deputy Haughey has reservations, not on the particular point I mentioned but about any of the recommendations I should like to have them and those of anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wyse also referred to this report, and while he did not resume his speech, he had some reservations in respect of blind people.  He talked about the need to introduce new measures to educate and train the blind.  I think there are very important implications to the advantage of blind people in the recommendations.  As a matter of fact, a full chapter of the report was devoted to the blind and to their training and employment.  The emphasis was on measures to develop to a greater extent their capacity to lead an independent life.  There is also a recommendation to the effect that <Col N="1385" /> they would be trained not entirely in a blind people's institution but with other handicapped workers as well.  I think that would be of particular advantage to them.  They are not being regarded as the cinderella among handicapped people.</P>
    <P>The National Rehabilitation Board has established a special advisory committee on which organisations for the blind are represented.  It should make it possible for them to escape from the rather closed-in atmosphere associated with employment of the blind.  I believe they should be trained in other activities apart from the conventional employment they had of basket making and things like that.  They deserve a better life and I believe the recommendations of the National Rehabilitation Board and the committee that has been established will produce suggestions to that end enabling them to lead as independent a life as possible.  Their present range of work is extremely narrow and should be expanded.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry made the point that there was a new paraquat preparation on the market which is not stenched.  He is quite right in that statement and the firm making that product is called Terraklene.  The firm have suggested that in future they would not put it on the market through the usual retail outlets but would confine its availability to direct sale by them to State, semi-State, or local authority undertakings.  I do not consider that good enough.  We made some progress when the stench was added to paraquat.  That was a good safeguard but I do not accept that the new product, which is unstenched, should be sold even to the organisations or bodies which they say they would supply.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy who spoke mentioned alcoholism and I shall not repeat everything said about this grave problem.  We all recognise the social and economic consequences of having an alcoholic in the family.  It is a national as well as a family problem and it is very difficult to know how to provide a cure.  We have three methods of treatment&mdash; which need not necessarily be the best &mdash;but treatment centres are available, <Col N="1386" /> primarily psychiatric services, and treatment to some extent in segregation. We have a number of specialised units providing residential treatment and there is a limited number of detoxification units in general hospitals. I think nobody will suggest that there is a standardised method of treating an alcoholic.  I should like to pay tribute to and commend the work of Alcoholics Anonymous. I attended one or two of their functions and I admire their courage in the admissions they made before other alcoholics and the general public also.  We look upon alcoholics in different ways.  Some regard them as social outcasts.  There is a suggestion that they should be locked up.  I think the alcoholic needs sympathy and help, not abuse.</P>

      <P>It will be pretty dry, perhaps.  There is also the important report by the Irish Council on Alcoholism and Excessive Drinking. I shall not say that all their recommendations were put into operation but one that is being implemented is that each Department appoint a welfare officer to refer to various agencies those who are alcoholics or who drink excessively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the media, the bulk of the work there is done by the Department of Health.  Those who spoke may not know that RTE have agreed on a code of advertising for alcoholic drink on RTE.  I could list the standards that have been laid down but this code is available in the Library.  Some may suggest that the <Col N="1387" /> code has been broken but possibly those who receive three or four television programmes may be confusing RTE with another channel.  A code has also been agreed with the Advertising Institute of Ireland and a copy of that code is also available in the Library.  If anybody believes the code is being broken I should like to hear from him.</P>
    <P>Much emphasis was rightly put on the establishment of a health education bureau.  Much can be done in the realm of education not only in regard to drink, drugs, tobacco and so on but also in regard to fitness and, as Deputy Dr. O'Connell suggested, by emphasising fitness rather than ill-health.  The idea of the board is to co-ordinate the activities of all the voluntary organisations now existing; not to supersede them or take over their functions, but to co-ordinate their efforts to produce the best result.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said I had not referred to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  That is so, but it is continuing in its usual efficient way.  I see no diminution in its activities in the future.  The board's premium income last year was £5 million while claims amounted to £4.9 million.  It has introduced a new scheme which gets rid of the regulation whereby one must stay in hospital overnight before a test is taken next morning thus occupying a hospital bed.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the Waterford seminar and, as I promised at the beginning of my speech, as soon as reports are available to me I shall in turn make them available to Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the circulation of statistics.  Deputy Wilson suggested that the statistics be compiled on a county basis.  I agree with him on that and shall try to have his suggestion implemented.  There were complaints from some Deputies that the brief was not given in time.  In future I will try to give it as soon as possible, perhaps at the beginning of each year.  The reason for holding it back so long was to enable us to give the most up-to-date figures.  So far as those proposals <Col N="1388" /> are concerned I will see what can be done.</P>

      <P>The family referred to in Parliamentary Question No. 247 of May 22 came to County Meath on March 5th this year.  There were then two school-going children, one aged eight and one four-and-a-half, in the family but the parents were informed by the authorities at Castle-knock national school that because of overcrowding only one of the children, the older, could be accommodated but that the younger one would be taken in July.  The parents were satisfied with this arrangement and the school bus began coming by the house so as to pick up the older child.  There were also three other children living on the road who availed of this service but at the end of April the parents were told that it was not possible to continue this arrangement and, consequently, the children would have to make their own way to the main road where they would be collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eight-year-old child must travel three miles to the main road and the road on which he lives is one on which there is a fair amount of traffic.  When he reaches the main Dublin-Cavan road he must cross to the other side and continue for another 300 yards to the Fairyhouse junction where he boards the bus.  In the evening the bus comes down a little further but still leaves about 2.8 <Col N="1389" /> miles for the child to travel home.  It is very dangerous for a child of this age to have to travel so far along this busy and twisty road but the situation will be much worse for the four-and-a-half-year-old child.  Regarding the other three children on the road the problem is not so great because in their case the distance to the pick-up point is only about a mile and they have been used to making the journey as they are older children. The father of the two children I am referring to is away from home from Monday to Friday.  His wife does not drive a car so they have no means of transporting the children to the main road.  The child does not cycle but, in any case, it would be dangerous for children so young to cycle along the road concerned and they would have to go about two miles before coming to the houses where the other three children live.</P>
    <P>I understand in the case of a Church of Ireland school that the Department sanctioned transport for an area where there are five school-going children.  With the younger child I am referring to going to school in July there will be five children from the area attending school.  This younger child had been going to school before the family came to Meath so in his case there is a break.</P>
    <P>Since special consideration is given to Church of Ireland children I am asking that the same concession be granted to these children.  A school transport system was in operation for Church of Ireland children before the implementation of the general scheme but the parents subscribed a certain amount towards it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The services provided under the free school transport system are arranged as a network of routes serving each school area.  The best possible service consistent with economy and reasonable journey time is provided.  However, due to the nature of terrain and scattered population and in view of the cost involved, it is not possible to provide a door-to-door service for pupils. Transport services cannot be set up <Col N="1390" /> for small scattered groups of children. There should be a sufficient number in a distinct locality who are attending the nearest school to secure that the average daily number of eligible children conveyed each term is of a minimum figure.</P>
      <P>Because of the smaller numbers and the more scattered distribution of the Protestant population a special scheme operates for them.  The age and distance qualifications are the same as those for children attending schools under Catholic management but, instead of the minimum of ten specified in the general scheme, services are provided if there is a sufficient number of children in a distinct locality who are attending their nearest suitable national school to ensure that the average number conveyed daily would be at least seven, or exceptionally, five.  It is in accordance with this particular scheme the transport service is being provided for the child concerned in the question.</P>
      <P>The cost of the free transport scheme has increased enormously since its introduction&mdash;from £2.1 million in 1968-69, the first full year of operation, to well over £7 million in the current financial year.  This cost results from the provision of services on the basis of the published regulations.  Any amendment of these which would result in substantial extra cost could not in present financial circumstances be contemplated. We are discussing a particular case here tonight and may I say to the Deputy and to the House that the cost of granting a concession of this nature is pretty substantial, over and above what the service is already costing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say that it should not be forgotten that the scheme was introduced in the first place to help those who are a long distance from school and children under ten less than two miles from school and children over ten less than three miles from school are not entitled to free transport at all. There are, however, many children who are walking or cycling these distances <Col N="1391" /> to school and many thousands more who are entitled to free transport who have to walk or cycle to the bus route to meet the bus.  The child involved in this case is therefore one of many who have to make their own way for up to three miles either to school or to the nearest pick-up point on the bus route.</P>
    <P>I would not wish this discussion to be expanded into a debate on the whole policy relating to school transport.  As I said, the scheme is expensive and is in my view not perfect in its application to the individual circumstances of all cases.  It is to be anticipated that its expansion on a graduated basis over a period of time will bring its advantages to a greater number of pupils and allow further improvements in the conditions governing the administration of the service.  I can assure the Deputy, and I am sure he knows this, that the Parliamentary Secretary would wish to have the scheme operated on the most flexible basis possible.  The Government are fully conscious of the value of the service to pupils in first and second level education, many of whom may not have the opportunity of proceeding to third level, but if they do so, will owe the opportunity in large measure to the existence of a suitable transport service to primary and secondary <Col N="1392" /> schools.  But I have to make the point and to insist that the regulations are of general application and regulations of general application are fundamental to the satisfactory administration of the scheme and they cannot be departed from in their application to individual cases.  I recognise nevertheless that in relation to the administration of the scheme, the aim should be to achieve the maximum degree of flexibility and that the difficulties of individual families should be considered as sympathetically as possible and I can assure the House that such has always been the approach of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the case put forward by the Deputy reasonably, and it is a great attraction to a Minister for Education to have a case put reasonably to him, that this service should be extended.  While I cannot promise here and now that the decision already made may be altered, I undertake to have the matter sympathetically examined to see if there is something in what the Deputy put to us tonight which was not adverted to when the decision was being made and I shall then communicate my final decision to the Deputy in a matter of a few days.</P>
