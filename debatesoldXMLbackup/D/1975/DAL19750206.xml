      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: No. 6 (resumed) and Questions from 2.30 to 5 p.m.  The sittings for next week will be as follows: Tuesday, 3 to 10.30 p.m., Wednesday, 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. and Thursday, 10.30 a.m. to 5 p.m.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, and in relation to the Taoiseach's announcement regarding next week's sittings, I should like to reiterate what was conveyed to the Taoiseach through his Parliamentary Secretary, that is, that in our agreeing to the longer sittings we hope this extra time will be availed of to ensure that the legislation which must be passed before the Easter Recess will be brought forward in sufficient time to enable ample discussion from this side both at Second and Committee Stages. I refer in particular to the capital acquisitions tax and wealth tax Bills which, apparently, are envisaged for circulation, discussion and conclusion during this session.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition and will endeavour to arrange what he suggests.  However, he will understand that in the changed procedures we have adopted, up to now the only change in the procedure was to the advantage of the Opposition, namely, that extra Private Members' time has been allowed.  In accordance with a recent agreement the Law Reform Commission Bill is being transferred to a special committee but committees are <Col N="1872" /> not being used for these other Bills.  For that reason the Deputy will appreciate that the progress we had anticipated has not been made and in so far as it is possible to do so, the legislation will be brought forward.</P>

      <P>On Tuesday evening I was dealing with the extent of borrowing in which the Minister is engaging both at home and abroad and the effect that this will have on the private sector.  If this borrowing continues there will be no money for the private individual, for the industrialist, the house builder or the farmer.  This will create many problems.  The Minister is seeking to borrow £158 million from banks and other finance houses here.  If the Government continue to borrow to this extent all we can envisage is that they will complete three years in office so as to qualify for their pensions and leave the mess for us to clear up once again as has happened on other occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1873" /> The people have always had confidence in Fianna Fáil but there were some who thought that, perhaps, a change of Government might be good.  They have been disappointed. They know now that this Government have not honoured the promises set out in the 14-point plan which they put before the people prior to the general election.  No effort has been made in regard to controlling prices.  The increased tax on petrol is hitting industrialists hard and the price of gas is now to be increased. Many other essential items have been increased in price also.  The Government are leading the country to bankruptcy.  Financial advisers and economists have reminded the Government that they are on a disastrous course.  In these circumstances I can only hope that in the near future the people will be given the opportunity to decide who should be in charge of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is a good one when one considers the circumstances in which the Minister had to operate.  For as long as this Government continue to show their concern for the less well-off sections of the community, I shall be prepared to continue supporting them.  In the three budgets introduced by the present Minister increases have been given to the less well-off on a much greater scale than ever before.  I admit that some of the benefits have been nullified because of inflation and the increased cost of living, but there can be no doubt that people such as old age pensioners and other social welfare recipients are much better off now than they were when this Government took office.  I know there are difficulties of administration here but all our increases come into effect at an earlier date after the budget than ever before. This is very important.  The recipients will get these increases in the autumn. This shows the concern which this Government have for the less well-off members of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people living on social welfare are still hard hit, especially an old age pensioner or a single person living alone and who is solely dependent on <Col N="1874" /> social welfare.  I recommend that the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare consider the introduction of a selective increase through the health boards, or some other way, for these people.  I know that in some cases health boards are contributing to help some of the people I have mentioned, but something more could be done.  I do not know how many such people there are or how much this help would cost.  If these people were helped, a good day's work would have been done.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies have been moaning and groaning about the housing situation.  In the first complete year in office, the target of 25,000 houses was exceeded.  All the signs indicate that that figure will be exceeded by 31st March, the second complete year in office for this Government.  We are now told that these houses are not occupied.  There may be some truth in that but I do not believe that there are many newly-built houses still unoccupied.</P>
    <P>In this buduget £100 million was provided for houses, more than double the figure ever provided by the Fianna Fáil Government in a capital budget.  I am most anxious to see an increase in the number of local authority houses being built.  These houses are for the people in the lower income group who are living in bad housing conditions.  This Government continue to show concern for the less well-off people in our community, those on social welfare, old age pensioners, widows, orphans, the disabled, the mentally and physically handicapped and deserted wives. People in these categories have been brought under social welfare for the first time in the history of this State by this Government.  If Fianna Fáil think there is a crack in the support of the Labour Party for this Government they are wrong because as long as this Government continue to show concern for the less well-off members of our community they will have our support.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said that he did not like tax increases of any kind but he accepted that the tax on spirits was all right.  The people in my constituency <Col N="1875" /> accept the tax increases, which were substantial in the case of drink, tobacco and cigarettes.  The people in my constituency not only accepted but welcomed them because they know and realise that this money will be distributed to the people who need it most.  I believe that is what participation in Government is all about: the redistribution of wealth. I congratulate the Minister for attempting to do just that.</P>
    <P>Tax reliefs were given right across the board.  Relief was given to companies who need assistance in order to keep their people employed.  I support this Government whose first priority is to keep people in employment.  If we must make a choice between increased prices and jobs, we are prepared to choose to keep people in employment.  It has also been said that this Government intend to abandon price control.  That is not so. Price control has been more strict since this Government took office and more people have been engaged in the detection of offences against price control than at any time since the time of the Emergency.  Conditions over which the Government have very little control have brought about a situation which made it impossible to keep prices down.  That did not mean that price control was abandoned.  In the present situation some firms must get increases for their goods or they will have to reduce the numbers employed.  I accept that in that instance they must get increases, probably greater increases than would normally have been allowed.</P>
    <P>Because of the present inflationary situation our goods at home and abroad are not selling as well as they might, and this in turn is leading to increased unemployment.  I discussed the position with the managing director of an industry in my locality recently and he told me that his sales in Ireland are as good as they ever were and that it is his sales in Britain and in other foreign countries that have fallen.  Purchasing power in various other European countries has fallen far more steeply than it has in this country.  The great United States, a very wealthy country, has an unemployment <Col N="1876" /> problem which is getting out of hand and they have not got a Coalition Government there.  I wonder would Fianna Fáil try to hold the National Coalition responsible for the unemployment situation in Britain, in the European countries or even as far away as Japan.  They blame the National Coalition for the situation here but they know and I know that the Government are not responsible for it.</P>
    <P>In the Government's programme it is laid down clearly what is necessary to bring our country through the present economic crisis.  Nobody is trying to say there is not an economic crisis.  It is well-known that there is and we on this side of the House are very worried because the unemployment figures are as high as they are but the increase in unemployment is inevitable when the purchasing power in the European Community and in the world generally has fallen and our products are not being bought.  Two industries in my constituency have gone on short time, in both cases due to a falling-off in purchasing power in foreign countries.  While we continue to increase social welfare benefits and tax-free allowances, particularly for the lower income group, and while we continue to provide the means by which our people can do their business and carry on in employment, we are doing a good job.  The people on the opposite benches want fewer tax increases and more assistance right across the board and to have no penalties of any kind imposed.  Any practical person knows that is not possible.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil had had their way two years ago they would have gone for balancing the budget and that, as is now clear, has been a fiasco anywhere it was tried.  The proper method is to have an inflationary budget and to go for a fairly high excess of expenditure over income.  This is now recognised.  It was recognised here more quickly than in most countries.  The first thing to be tackled is unemployment and not inflation.  Inflation is bad, too, and is the second objective to be tackled but when we must make a choice between inflation and jobs our Government are doing the right thing in giving jobs first priority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> There have been fairly substantial increases given in income tax allowances.  This is the second set of increases given by the Government and it is an earnest of what they mean to do for the people in the income tax bracket.  Fianna Fáil's record in that field will not stand up to examination.  Over their 16 years I think only once was the ordinary tax allowance increased.</P>
    <P>I want to publicly assure the Minister that in all his efforts to rationalise and bring about a fairer system of taxation we in the Labour Party stand firmly behind him.  In the fields of housing, social welfare and taxation, so long as the present Government continue along the road on which they have started I, for one, will remain their supporter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course Deputy Bermingham is quite right.  Tax free allowances should be increased and social welfare benefits should also be increased if the economy can bear it and if it is not going to put people out of work.  If the economy is being slowed down by an inflationary policy the net result must be further unemployment because every community must be able to pay its way and if it is not the Government responsible will be faced with major difficultes.  Listening to the Minister on January 15th I felt there was a gleam of hope in that in his speech he announced the provision of a deferred amount, as he described it, in tax rebate of £12 million.  I thought this was the first indication of a realisation by the Minister that the economy, industry and business were in difficulties.  In so far as the deferment of £12 million in tax due may enable some of the better-off manufacturing industries to continue working.  In that it may provide them with some of the additional cash flow that is so badly needed by all businesses and companies, it will make a small contribution to the survival of the economy.  Last year the British Labour Government announced for their economy a tax rebate of £1,500 million.  If one compares that with the <Col N="1878" /> relatively small economy we have it shows they have a better understanding of their economy than the Government here have of ours.  If the Minister had a proper understanding of the economy he would have announced <i>pro rate</i> a deferment in the region of £80 million.</P>
      <P>The US Government announced some weeks ago that tax reductions to individuals and industry of the order of £6,500 million were being budgeted for.  If my figures are right the equation in reference to our economy would be about £85 million. In the interests of the economic future of the country I welcome the £12 million given but I have to point to some of the inadequacies in it.  First of all, it is a deferment.  It does not help in any industry which was hit a year ago by inflation and has a cash flow problem.  Secondly, it appears to be something in the region of about one-sixth of what is necessary.  Some economists have suggested that there are at present 27 companies who need £100 million in cash flow to get through 1975.</P>
      <P>The problem created here relates to two types of industry.  The Minister does not include those engaged in either wholesale or retail business.  In ordinary circumstances one would not include them but nevertheless those people have to carry very large stocks from time to time.  They have to be able to order from Irish manufactures what they hope to sell.  If you order from any Irish manufacturer what you sold last year you have to order 20 per cent more in money value. You can only do that if you have the surplus money and you have paid your tax on it.  If you have not got it and inflation has already hit you you cannot order or you have to ask your bank manager if he will allow you an extra 20 per cent on what you had last year.  As the Minister said in his speech, there is a risk problem with banks.  You will always get money from a bank if you have it and you will not get if you have not got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present if you have to order from a retailer, wholesaler or manufacturer the cost in cash terms will be 25 per cent greater than last year.  If <Col N="1879" /> your bank will not give the money to you and the Minister for Finance has already taken it the previous year in tax, then you will be forced to order less.  If you have to do that, Irish manufacturers will be put on short time.</P>
    <P>This is the stark reality of Irish industrial life at the present time.  We have an extraordinary deficit of £150 million.  The real meaning of reflation is the survival of the economy.  The word &ldquo;reflation&rdquo; has been suddenly rediscovered and used as if it were a magic word that will save our economy.  If the deficit which the Minister has estimated were to go into reflation I would support it.  Unfortunately, all I can see going into true reflation is the deferred payment of £12 million in tax.</P>
    <P>I do not see any real effort to slow down inflation in the Minister's budgetary provisions.  The figures I shall quote now indicate to me that the balance is very heavily in favour of increasing the level of inflation.  In the budget there is an additional petrol tax amounting to £27 million if the unfortunate motorist can afford to dig up the extra £2 or £3 a week to pay for the petrol.</P>
    <P>There are additional taxes on beer, cigarettes, whiskey and gambling&mdash; these are taxes with which I would not quarrel&mdash;running out at around £34 million.  I would not quarrel with that type of tax because it is an area, and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me, that lends itself to additional taxation.  However, the reality is that those who smoke, who take a drink and put a few bob on a horse or a dog will not stop doing those things and something else will therefore suffer.  By and large, people do not change their habits and consequently the inflationary effect of that taxation at this stage must be very nearly instantaneous and people will want more money for these things; certainly that section of the population which does these things regards them as necessities and they will be looking for more money either from the State or from employers elsewhere.  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, the more <Col N="1880" /> you increase wages in an inflationary cycle the more you increase inflation.</P>
    <P>The next item I am justified in throwing into this debate is the additional post office charges amounting to £30 million.  They were not that far back behind the budget as to be irrelevant.  Probably the Parliamentary Secretary sent out as many Christmas cards&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as many as in former years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not avail of the free postal facilities.  Now it is not that I want to be chiselling but every extra 50 cards sent out amount to something and therefore the overall inflationary tendency increases.  The £6 million in the transfer of social welfare stamps over to the employer and employee is something I want to take up with the Minister for Finance because he did something I think no Minister for Finance should do.  In his introductory speech he referred in a passing way to the fact that over the next six years the State's contribution to social welfare will be transferred to the employer and employee.  He made it sound like a triviality.  The total cost of the stamp to the Exchequer at the moment is in or around £30 million.  I assume, therefore, that what the Minister was really saying was that someone is going to pay an extra £6 million a year.  If it is the employer and employee we come back once more to the increase in the tax on petrol, on beer and on cigarettes.  If the cost of the stamp is increased the employee will look for more money in wages to meet that increase and the inflationary cycle will be increasing more and more.  I have a feeling that the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with me in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had there been a genuine effort to reflate&mdash;this was the idea given by the Government Information Services over the past couple of months and also by the Minister for Finance&mdash;<Col N="1881" /> one of the areas in which a significant change should have been made was in VAT rates.  One has to go back quite some time to see exactly what happened with value-added tax.  Out of the goodness of their hearts, and because they had promised it, the Coalition Government removed value-added tax from food.  The removal amounts to approximately £17 million.  But value-added tax on all other commodities was increased by between 20 to 28 per cent and the net result was that in the following 12 months the Minister gained an additional £45 million from increased value-added tax on commodities other than food.  This had its own inflationary effect on the economy.</P>
    <P>Despite all the arguments, inflation is not altogether engendered by outside forces.  Half of it is our own responsibility, starting with the Government.  If there had been a genuine effort to reflate the economy then a reduction in the high rates of value-added tax was a necessity.  I believe the increased tax on petrol was one of the Government's greatest mistakes.  If the price of petrol was considerably lower here than in the other EEC countries there were arguments in favour of a change.  I think the Minister used the argument that if our petrol consumption was greater our standing in the EEC would not be so good.  In introducing the additional 15p tax the Minister said the purpose was to reduce petrol consumption and thereby improve the balance of payments position by £3 million.  I believe the main object of the tax was to bring in a somewhat better budget; £27 million is not a small sum and, if one knows one will get an extra £27 million in the next 12 months, that helps to improve the budgetary figure.  If it was necessary to increase the price of petrol by 15p in order to reduce consumption the Minister should subsequently have reduced that figure to 7½p when his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, permitted an increase of 7½p in the price of petrol within a couple of weeks of the introduction of the increased tax.  Whatever arguments there may be for a uniform price in the UK and in the Republic there are <Col N="1882" /> very strong arguments in our economy against that type of increase in petrol in comparison with Britain.</P>
    <P>There is a social and employment effect that does not influence the British economy as much as ours. Probably we are weighted on the service side, that private transport is used more in employment here than in Britain.  In addition, our public transport service is not as adequate as the service in Britain.  Consequently, for a large number of people there was no alternative but to pay the additional petrol tax if they wished to keep their employment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the liquidity problem, I do not think the Minister is aware of the real seriousness of the inadequacy of the cash flow for manufacturing, wholesale and retail businesses.  The Minister suggested that those who need the money in order to stay in business should get it from the banks.  Leaving aside the problem that the banks may not wish to loan the money, there is also the danger when one considers the capital budget requirements that the banks may not have the money by the time the Minister is finished with them.</P>
    <P>In the Summary of the Capital Budget issued by the Minister, the 1975 estimates for borrowing show the nice round figure of £258 million. For the previous nine months that sum is broken down as follows: (a) European Investment Bank and World Bank, (b) other foreign borrowing and (c) reduction in liquidity of departmental funds.  The amount specified for item (c) is £28.8 million and we may well wonder how long this will continue.  There are bank advances of £14.2 million, giving a total of £189 million.  There is also an item of £85 million for commercial banks.  When one considers the Minister's reference that it may not be possible to borrow more than £100 million, I suspect he may find himself in the position of looking for more from the banks than ever before.  So far as business and industry is concerned it will depend on whether the banks are prepared to loan additional money to maintain businesses and, secondly, whether <Col N="1883" /> they have the money.  In addition, the commercial banks will have to take into account that the Minister for Local Government may again compel them to loan more money to the building societies in an effort to keep up the private house building sector.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the Government are sailing with the wind and that they are using inflation to some extent as a means to gather additional tax.  They have not set a good example for the people because so far as I can see there has been no effort to curtail unnecessary expenditure. In Wexford some weeks ago the Tánaiste said that Fianna Fáil were blaming the Government for everything and were saying that the world situation had nothing to do with us. We know the world inflation rate is affecting us but to a great extent the Government are hiding behind world conditions.  Because of this budget the domestic inflation rate will probably be higher.  This is due to the Government's policies, their lack of discipline, lack of single-minded decisions and good example.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the Minister made mistakes in dealing with our financial and economic system.  In his first budget speech he announced he was removing the provision allowing £70 tax free interest with the commercial banks but within three or four weeks he withdrew his proposal. That was the start of a series of mistakes made by him.  Perhaps it was done at the urging of his colleagues or perhaps it was due to inexperience and a lack of understanding of our financial system.  Capital is vital to a small economy but the White Paper on capital gains tax had the effect of reducing confidence in the future of the economy.  If this were the United States or Britain we could talk about such a tax without affecting the economy but as we are a small economy that is trying to grow to talk in this way can have a detrimental effect.</P>
    <P>Before the general election the Coalition promised to remove death duties.  That was a promise made to <Col N="1884" /> get votes but I have no argument against the idea of removing death duties.  We find now that on top of a capital gains tax and a wealth tax it is intended to introduce an acquisition tax.  What is really happening is that death duties are being removed but a similar tax is being introduced.  I have no argument against an acquisition tax if death duties are removed, but I am afraid that where the National Coalition have been misleading the people is securing votes on the basis that death duties would be wiped out and then reintroducing what amounts to death duties again.  I have not seen the Bill which will give effect to an acquisition tax but such a tax will affect the tax rate on property as if it was a death duty.  The Minister may be doing this in a more sensible way, but in my view it means that the promise made at election time to remove death duties was not a promise at all.  It was done merely to gain votes from certain people while the intention was to reintroduce a tax on property if property is transferred.  In my view that is what acquisition tax means.</P>
    <P>When it was announced that it was intended to introduce a capital gains tax the rate suggested was 35 per cent and this was later reduced to 26 per cent.  We have put arguments against the general idea of a flat tax and we believe these are valid.  The nature of Irish society is such that people should not be encouraged to get away with quick easy profit.  A sense of justice in Irish society suggests that those who make money overnight, or within a short period, should have to pay a higher contribution to the upkeep of society than those who put in from five to 20 years hard work.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Minister, and his Labour colleagues, did not know before this Capital Gains Tax Bill was introduced that the Labour Government in Australia was dropping a similar Bill.  It seems to me that the Labour Government in Australia were realistic enough to recognise the damage that was being done to their economy and to workers' jobs.  Unlike our Minister and his colleagues, it <Col N="1885" /> appears that they know the strength of their own economy.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the trade deficit.  When the Minister spoke on this last year he referred to an approximate £150 million balance of payments deficit.  This indicates his failure to study the position and to understand it.  The Minister can obtain the advice of civil servants and they, and the Minister, knew last April what the increased cost of oil, which worked out at about £120 million, would be. The Minister must have had a much better idea of what the balance of payments would be.  Certainly the Minister's advisers should have had a better idea.  But it is possible that the Minister did not want to know.  We all know that the balance of payments is working out at more than £500 million.  The fact that the Minister spoke of a balance of payments deficit of £150 million last April shows that he was not studying the position.</P>
    <P>I am aware that that balance of payments figure will be adjusted by capital inflow.  I should like to remind the Minister that capital inflow is made up of money invested here by industries attracted by the IDA and by people who may come to retire here&mdash;if these people hear about a wealth tax I doubt if they will retire here anymore.  The Minister should realise that capital inflow also includes amounts borrowed from banks and financial resources around the world, including the European Investment Bank.  I hope that, when the Department of Finance are issuing the net balance of payments figure, they do not take from it the money which is being borrowed to carry our capital inflow or an investment in ordinary terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in referring to the balance of payments problem, suggested that the amount that could be borrowed abroad during the coming year would be of the order of £100 million against £148 million between April and December of last year.  The Minister suggested this because the lenders will stop lending since we are reaching too serious a balance of payments position.  Last autumn.  I said <Col N="1886" /> that the Government's economic policy in trade and borrowing, particuarly borrowing overseas, was being seen in the light of a sale of our resources to foreign financial institutions&mdash;something which the Minister for Industry and Commerce used speak so strongly against in the past but about which we have heard very little recently.  Where is the old policy of self-reliance, of standing on our own feet, of achieving a greater degree of economic independence?  That was the policy pursued by Seán Lemass.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that to some considerable extent that policy has gone with the wind in the economic and financial confusion in which the Government find themselves.  This Government's performance, their lack of competence in financial and economic management, is generating a lack of confidence here.  That lack of confidence is not in the economy, it is not in industry or in the ability of industry to move ahead.  That lack of confidence in the Government's management of their own responsibilities.  The present policy, as it is being implemented by the Minister, is directed against&mdash;I am speaking specifically of this budget&mdash;rather than for expansion and employment.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to make a political comment.  I feel that the great disadvantage for Fianna Fail administrations in the past was that they had to remain in office for longer periods than might have been good for themselves.  There was no real choice for the electorate.  Unfortunately, the past year has shown that this is only too true at present.</P>

      <P>Budget day, in my way of thinking, is the stock-taking day for the nation.  It is the time when we look back at what we have achieved over the last 12 months and, more important, forward to what we hope to achieve over the next 12 months. This is the first financial year to start on January 1st.  Many other things should also start on January 1st such as income tax and social welfare benefits for women as well as men. As far as women are concerned the social welfare year starts on 1st July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year 1974 was a difficult year. <Col N="1887" /> The previous speaker said that 1974 was not a good year for us.  It was not a good year for Europe or for the world.  The main cause of that for us was that we are very much an oil importing country.  It was only in 1974 that we realised the real increase in the price of oil.  Nearly everybody knows that oil cost us an extra £120 million during 1974.  This increase has shown itself in many forms directly and indirectly.  Directly we saw petrol prices soaring from 30p per gallon to almost 70p per gallon.  Speakers on the other side of the House stated that all those increases went into the Exchequer, half of the increase of £120 million.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the price of petrol here is one of the cheapest in the EEC and also one of the cheapest in the world.  In Argentine the price of petrol is 95p per gallon.  In the USA it is 81p per gallon, and in Italy it is 82p per gallon.  At 68p our price is the third cheapest in Europe.  We must not underestimate the price we will have to pay indirectly for oil. Directly car hire firms, taxi owners and truck owners have been hit. Indirectly it has affected our exports and our imports.  Indirectly it has had a bearing on the dirty word &ldquo;inflation".</P>
    <P>The experts have agreed that our inflation rate has gone from somewhere in the region of 17 per cent to 20 per cent over the past year.  I have heard Opposition spokesmen stating time and time again that this Government were solely responsible for inflation.  We must realise that 58 per cent of our inflation has been imported.  People who have built houses or farm buildings over the past year or 18 months realise the terrific increase in the price of timber, steel, poultry rations and farm building prices generally.  It is encouraging that within the next four, five or six weeks it is estimated that meal prices will fall substantially.  There seems to be a terrific surplus of maize on the American market.  I believe the meal <Col N="1888" /> compounders are buying this meal at a much cheaper price.</P>
    <P>We have to learn to live with inflation.  We must try to have a lower rate of inflation than the other countries in Europe.  We have to keep down the prices of our goods. On 24th January, 1975, the <i>Irish Independent</i> did a survey of world prices.  In that survey Dublin ranked sixth cheapest of 31 capitals of the world, giving us an inflation rate of 17 per cent, just around the world average.  One encouraging aspect of 1974 was our 40 per cent rise in exports.  A rise of 40 per cent in our exports in such a difficult year is the most encouraging sign this country has seen for a long time.</P>
    <P>The big worry in the latter part of 1974 was the high rate of unemployment, which is reaching nearly 100,000.  When a Deputy on this side of the House speaks he should say what he really thinks and what he really means.  He should not say that everything in the garden is rosy. Everything in the garden is not rosy. Surely this figure of almost 100,000 unemployed is of grave concern to us all.  I submit that it is not as bad as the people in the Opposition suggest it is.</P>
    <P>They are comparing 1974 with the depression in 1956.  Admittedly we have 99,000 unemployed but we must remember that 8,000 are partially employed and this will be the case for a short period only.  It is also worth remembering that in 1956 41,000 people emigrated.  Thank God we have not got to live with the terrible plague of emigration now.  Over the past number of years the population of the Twenty-six Counties increased from 2.8 millions to 3 million.  That is no mean feat.  I do not think we can take all the credit for it, but every Irish man is glad that he can stay at home on his native soil.</P>
    <P>If inflation continues at its present rate, a man with two children now earning £40 a week will need to earn £500 a week in ten years' time.  We must try to keep down inflation.  Let us take an example.  If a man is earning £5,000 today, in ten years' time <Col N="1889" /> he will need to earn £100,000 to keep up with the present rate of inflation and to give him the same standard of living as he enjoys today.  Working on those figures, in ten years' time a pair of shoes will cost £70.  We must try to keep down prices and we must try to keep down wages.</P>
    <P>I was in Italy recently where they have this terrible problem of inflation.  It is probably worse than inflation here.  If you go into a shop and buy something for 150 or 160 lira they do not give you your change in coinage.  It is not worth their while because the lira coins are worth so little.  They give you sweets as change or IOUs hoping that you will come back to their shops again.  That is a fact of life.  It is happening in Italy today.  The scarcest thing in Italy is change&mdash;except for paper notes.</P>
    <P>It is also depressing to think that ten years ago we used to get 70 Austrian schillings for an Irish £ and today we get 38 Austrian schillings for the Irish £.  We cannot blame inflation for that.  This means that inflation here has gone up much more than in other countries.  The position in Italy is worse and in Austria it is better.  I do not have to tell the House about Germany.  Every couple of years we see Germany reflating and reflating.</P>
    <P>These are serious problems.  When talking about increases of 20 per cent or 25 per cent for workers and even for ourselves in this House, we sometimes wonder when we get these if we are really entitled to so much, even though we know we are entitled to a certain percentage.</P>
    <P>In the last few weeks footwear manufacturers have been crying about the depressed state of the footwear trade.  I see a Deputy opposite who is one of those primarily responsible for this.  I agree with what he was trying to do, but the footwear trade must bear a good deal of responsibility for the position themselves.  Before Christmas I tried to buy a pair of Irish shoes in a Twenty-six County town and I had to go to six shops before I could get them in my home town.  There is something wrong with <Col N="1890" /> the salesmen for Irish footwear when they do not try to sell their products. Admittedly, there are cheaper imported products.</P>
    <P>As regards the budget taxes and benefits, I think most people breathed a deep sigh of relief when the budget was announced.  Most people expected a tough budget and now I think everybody agrees it was quite a good budget when everything is considered.  The past year has been a difficult one and the prospects for 1975 have appeared a good deal rosier in the past few months.  The Minister had gone for an expansionary budget and a deficit of £125 million.  I was glad to hear Deputy Colley, the Opposition spokesman on Finance, saying that if he were in the Minister's shoes he would probably have gone for a higher deficit; but I think £125 million is sufficient, if not too much.  I heard others express the same view.  If things go well with us in the next 12 months, and especially in the last six months of 1975, we shall come out all right.  The Minister took a chance; I do not think he had any alternative because we must maintain employment and that is why he went for £125 million deficit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley's answer as to where Fianna Fáil would get the money was that they would take 4 per cent off VAT.  This sounds great from the Opposition benches but we must not forget that it was Fianna Fáil who introduced turnover tax and then wholesale tax even though at that time traders throughout the country were marching in this capital in protest against these taxes.  The Irish people have a short memory, but surely not that short.  It was completely hypocritical for him to mention taking 4 per cent off VAT; and if that is their only answer, it is just a laugh.</P>
    <P>The main beneficiaries of the budget are the social welfare classes, the ordinary taxpayers under PAYE, the farmers getting £2.2 million for the meal subsidy, the fishermen getting £1.4 million to buy boats and those who benefit from company tax reliefs. Fishing is one of our fastest growing industries.  I was disappointed when <Col N="1891" /> the fishery Estimate was cut and BIM were not getting their full allocation, but I would now like to compliment the Minister on ensuring that the fishermen will not be cut and that the full money has been allocated to BIM so that as far as capital expenditure is concerned there will be no shortage in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The £2.2 million voucher scheme for small farmers has been and will be a worthwhile scheme.  Medium and small farmers, especially in the west and north-west of the country, have suffered tremendously in the past 12 months due to the slump in the cattle trade and this is a small way of helping to tide them over the next couple of months.  Nobody doubts that cattle will be at a high premium in June, July and August.  We have already seen great increases in cattle prices, but it is the small man who has not yet benefited from the increases who needs help in the next few months. That is why the scheme is being continued.  Everybody must be encouraged, if at all possible, to hold cattle until May or June when prices will certainly be much higher.</P>
    <P>Many people in the past few months said we should never have entered the EEC, that it was no good for the farmers or the country, but in 1974 alone we benefited to the tune of a net £95 million.  Only for intervention where would our cattle trade have been last November and December? Intervention cost EEC £75 million but at least there was an outlet for our fat cattle.  Only now do we see the big stores moving and in a couple of months time the calves and small stores will be moving.  It has paid this country handsomely to be in EEC, and whether England stays in the EEC or not I believe we must stay in it.</P>
    <P>I am worried about one aspect of EEC, and so I think is anybody representing a western or north western constituency, and that is the farm modernisation scheme.  There are a number of little difficulties, such as where it is said that a man must get more than half his income from his farm and must spend more than half his time farming before he can be <Col N="1892" /> classed as a farmer.  These things must be teased out.  I believe a farmer should be entitled to a grant whether he works or not so long as he has a farm.  We have been trying to encourage small farmers in the west to work in industry during the week and to work their farms in the evenings and week-ends.  We must continue to do this and we must make sure that so far as EEC is concerned the small farmers, &ldquo;the other farmers&rdquo; as they describe them, will always get these grants.  There is no short-term solution for these farmers.  It is a long-term problem and everybody who has land has a right to work that land and, I submit, a right to get grants for that land.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly on the regional fund of the EEC.  We have heard Opposition spokesmen say that the regional fund of £35 million is very small, that the regional fund of £8 million for 1975 has not been up to their expectations.  But let us remember that the £8 million we are receiving is, as a percentage, more than we were promised, if one takes the other EEC countries into consideration. The amount coming from this regional fund must be devoted to the areas needing help most, which are those areas with small hill farmers on the north and north-west coast.  I was glad to see that the Department for the Public Service are trying to depopulate Dublin, moving some of the Departments into the country.  We must encourage people to remain and live along the west coast.  We talk about a just society.  There will be no justice in this country if we depopulate the west, leaving Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Dundalk and such areas overpopulated.</P>
    <P>The main problem experienced on the east coast is that people have not got services; they have not got land on which to build their houses.  There is plenty of land to be offered to people.  We want to see the benefits of this EEC fund accruing to the western areas and so establish the infrastructure within which to develop water and sewerage schemes, housing sites and establish industries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1893" /> Last year the Minister entered into a commitment so far as personal income tax was concerned: he said he would increase the personal income tax allowance in line with inflation in his future budgets.  He honoured that commitment.  The working-class public certainly deserve all the help they can get.</P>
    <P>There is one respect in which I feel we have been remiss.  That is in regard to the person who has to travel 20 miles or 30 miles to work and back each day and who receives no tax allowance in respect of that expenditure.  The Department should examine that question very carefully in future years.  I heard of a case lately of a gentleman in my area who has to travel 45 miles to work and back each day.  It is very easy to say: &ldquo;Why does he not live beside the factory where he is employed?&rdquo; The answer to that in this case is that that man married a woman 45 miles away who owned a house.  He was one of the lucky ones; he married one of those &ldquo;laying hens&rdquo;, as they are called down the country.  But it costs this man £8 per week on petrol, plus income tax.  When he gets home at the end of the week he says, and I quite agree with him, that he would be better to go on unemployment benefit.  There is no incentive whatsoever to that man to work.</P>
    <P>The other matter the Minister should investigate in the social welfare classes is the question of single women under 58 years of age.  Anybody representing a country constituency must realise that there are many such women who have cared for elderly parents for a considerable length of time.  While the parents lived, such people, first of all, were entitled to the dependent relative allowance and probably both parents were in receipt of a pension.  But when the parents died what it really meant was that that single person, under 58 years of age, at, say 40, 45 or 50 cannot then take up a job or engage in a profession.  Such people have practically nothing.  They have to humble themselves and seek home assistance.  I do not think that is right.  Any single person who has devoted a large part of his or her lifetime to looking after <Col N="1894" /> a household where there is no revenue coming in should receive automatically some form of assistance from the Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the huge increase he has granted in social welfare allowances.  I would mention particularly the old age pensioner, old people, needy people, sick and disabled.  Such people need all the help they can get.  We are delighted to think that in October they will be receiving additional benefit.  But we must face reality.  We must ask: &ldquo;Is it right that such huge increases should be given also to the unemployment and dole sectors?&rdquo; I spoke recently to a person working in a county council.  He was a married man with five children earning £28 per week.  That man would have been better off by £3 on unemployment benefit.  If we get away from the incentive to work there will be terrible repercussions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We have to examine this question again and say to ourselves: &ldquo;Right, people must get benefit, but they must not get more benefit than they would receive were they working.&rdquo;  I would advocate that stipulation, that nobody should be able to receive more money sitting at home idle than they would receive out working.  It is a hard thing to say, especially for a Deputy representing a country constituency, because one tends to rely so much on that type of vote.  But the day has arrived when we have to speak out.  Perhaps we have been giving too much to that category and we must now give more incentive to people to work.  Perhaps there could be implemented some kind of scheme such as the one they had in Germany about 20 years ago when everybody on the live register had to do at least two days' work per week.  That way one would be doing something productive, putting something into the country instead of constantly dragging out of it.</P>
    <P>But where shall we get all the money involved?  It is very easy to say we have given extra money to the social welfare classes; we have given the taxpayer so much; we have done this and that.  But the money must come from somewhere.  The Minister is reaping this money from taxation <Col N="1895" /> on cigarettes, drink and gambling casinos or slot machines.  I do not think anybody can crib about 6p extra on a packet of cigarettes.  A lot of us smoke despite the fact that we know it is not doing our health any good. Probably we started when we were young and we must now try to educate our children more and more in this respect.  I mean children in schools, youth frequenting sporting clubs and so on.  We must make them see that smoking is a bad habit. As far as drink is concerned, nobody would have any crib about the increase in the price of whiskey, stout or beer.  One can drink as long as one pays for it.  I feel not enough is being done by the Garda and the authorities to ensure that 18 year-olds are not given drink in pubs.</P>
    <P>Drinking has become a real problem.  It is very disturbing to note that in this poor country we drink more per head of the population than is the case in any other country in Europe and that we drink half as much more as our neighbours in Northern Ireland.  On the other hand we must realise that there is not much else for people to do by way of recreation.  It is unfortunate, though, that so many young people are drinking.</P>
    <P>Coming from a tourist area I have a special interest in the Minister's proposals regarding slot machines.  It is only right that the gaming licence in respect of these machines be increased to £100, but the fee will be less in respect of those machines used only for a three or a six month period.</P>
    <P>The important aspect in so far as these slot machines are concerned is to ensure that the stake may not be increased from the present 2p. limit and that the jackpot will not be increased to more than its present limit of 50p.  We must maintain strict control to ensure that a situation would not arise in which very high stakes would be played for.  In various parts of the country it is possible to find machines in which one invests stakes of 5p. and may win as much as £25.  This is a away from the <Col N="1896" /> amusement aspect and is heading towards casino-type gambling and that is something we must not allow.  I approve of slot machines so long as they are used as an amusement amenity.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is a company here at present who have been before the Australian courts.  This is a Chicago based organisation which operates a factory in Dublin in which slot machines are manufactured for use on a worldwide gambling market. This organisation has links with members of the Mafia and is financed by gangsters' money.  Such organisations are interested in a small country like ours only if there is the prospect of a wide-open market for gambling casinos.  We all know that fortunes are made by the people who operate such places.  That is why I say we must have strict control on the limits, both of the stakes and the jackpots, that are played for on these machines.</P>
    <P>There is the question also of the use of these machines in public houses that are not licensed for this purpose. I am aware of from between 400 to 600 such machines in these premises. I trust that the Minister will take measures to ensure that the proprietors concerned pay a licence fee for every machine installed.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on having doubled the grant to the IDA. This Government are correct in having as their first priority the policy of creating as much work as possible for our people, and to that end they are endeavouring to attract many new industries to set up here.  A special word of thanks must go to the IDA for the efficient and courteous way in which they conduct their operations. We often hear of the inefficiency of some semi-State bodies but such criticism cannot be levelled at the IDA.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the IDA have decided on two growth centres. Courtaulds are to build a big factory at Letterkenny and a site of about 65 acres has been purchased at Finner.  The whole idea is to make work available in factories for small farmers and also to make it possible for people to stay at home who otherwise would <Col N="1897" /> have to emigrate.  Some thought must be given to the setting up of a committee to deal with the whole question of the development of the west.  We have the Department of the Gaeltacht and SFADCo but there is a need for some sort of co-ordinating committee.</P>
    <P>One area of disappointment to me in the budget has been the absence of any help for the tourist trade.  Since the beginning of the troubles in the North five or six years ago the tourist industry has been hit badly.  One must live in a tourist area to realise how bad the situation is.  Those people who visited our resorts year after year are not coming now.  In particular we have lost the Northern tourists.  If ever an industry needed an injection of capital it must be this one, and it should have been given this injection.</P>
    <P>Recently, Deputies were circulated by the hotels federation with a suggestion that petrol vouchers be given to tourists.  This is one way of encouraging tourists to come here.  It is a system that would not be too difficult to operate.  It would cost very little, and would bring in much needed money to the country.  I would suggest that, say, 400 vouchers for petrol at 10p a gallon be issued to anybody from outside taking his car into the country and booking into hotels for two weeks.  The hoteliers, too, might contribute by issuing, say, 200 vouchers for petrol at this rate of 10p per gallon to people from Northern Ireland when they had booked into the hotels.  Let us assume that the average number of people who travel in a car here is four. I have estimated that each person spends an average of £100 per week here.  If, say, the vouchers cost about £30 per car, that is, £7.50 per person, we would be taking in a lot more than would be involved in the operation of the scheme.  I trust that when the Tourist Bill is introduced, it will contain some badly-needed incentives for this industry.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the increase in security is costing something in the region of £24 million.  This is a sad state of affairs.  This £24 million which is being spent to increase our Defence Forces.  Garda force and improve security directly and indirectly, could have been spent in many other worthwhile <Col N="1898" /> ways.  We could have increased old age pensions, built more houses, encouraged more industries and helped the tourist trade and western development.  In other words, we could have given a better standard of living to everybody with this £24 million.</P>
    <P>I wonder if these self-styled patriots realise what they are costing this small country?  Do they realise the harm they are causing to the tourist trade indirectly?  Do they realise the harm they are doing the IDA and others who are trying to bring industry here?  I believe they are out to wreck our economy. The ordinary people were concerned this morning when they opened their papers and read of a threat to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;too little too late&rdquo; has been overworked in recent times.  When one looks at recent budget proposals, this is only a factual description.  When discussing this budget it appears that we are only talking about one instalment.  Some months ago we had a mini-budget which raked in £14 million in postal charges.  The service did not benefit from that increase because the postal and telephone service are in a chronic state.  To collect this increase and not improve the service is not to be commended.  Before Christmas we had a second budget which was expected to bring in about £27 million from the increase in petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1899" /> One gets the impression when listening to Government speakers that they have not their hearts in their jobs.  They cannot justifiably claim that this is a good budget.  The last speaker seemed to think that petrol here had been too cheap and was due to be increased.</P>
    <P>A number of Fianna Fáil Deputies spoke on the second budget and drew the attention of the Government to the dangers inherent in that increase to the economy.  Some workers must travel long distances to work and it will also affect farmers.  The last speaker, having apologised for our cheap petrol, then suggested that we should subsidise petrol for tourists. It is very hard to reconcile these two trains of thought.</P>
    <P>In the latest budget, No. 3, there is a deficit of £125 million.  That would not be so bad if this was the end of the road but the Minister has given clear warning that he is only getting warmed up.  On his performance over the past few months we could expect to have a monthly budget.</P>
    <P>If a businessman wanted to borrow money his bank would expect him to give proof of his target&mdash;an achievable target.  Even small farmers are expected to set a target for their progress and make an effort to achieve it.  That is as it should be.  The keeper of the national purse has not set a target for this year.  The space for gross national product appears to be empty.  That is a fair indication of our present position and of the inability of the Administration to handle the problems.  If the Minister is not in a position to give a firm estimate for the 1975 gross national product, and he does not appear to be able even to hazard a guess at it, the only thing we can deduce from this is that the Minister is afraid to set a target.</P>
    <P>Perhaps he is more concerned than some of his colleagues in failing to deliver the 14-point programme. There is no doubt that the amount offered to the farming community is not alone too little but could not have been less&mdash;unless, of course, they got nothing.  In his speech the <Col N="1900" /> Minister made much play about the need to save jobs.  We all agree that jobs must be saved.  The Minister must realise that by helping farmers he is at the same time bolstering industry.  Our economy is not a series of separate compartments.  The industrial sector needs a healthy and prosperous agricultural sector.  The agricultural community have got so used to half measures and decisions that are taken too late that they would now be surprised if action was taken in time.  They have reached such a state of frustration that we now have a threat from the farming organisation of a grow no beet campaign.  While I, or nobody in my party, could justify a threat to kill a valuable industry the circumstances in which this threat was made must be kept in mind.  Farmers have lost faith in the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and in his ability to handle the situation either here or in Brussels.  Some of the problems of the Minister for Finance were created by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who over a long period could not make up his mind regarding the green £.  He eventually stumbled into seeking it, after being pushed by the Opposition and months elapsed before it was clear as to what we would get.  It was this period of the great silence that had such a damaging effect on agriculture.  The country has suffered a decline in the pig industry.  We have had the fodder shortage and the beef debacle. Farmers have suffered so much from the inaction and faulty action of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that for the Minister for Finance to have given adequate compensation would have meant a substantially greater budget deficit.</P>

      <P>I would just mention briefly the oil subsidy for horticulture, a sum of £270,000.  This allocation is of significance to only a very small number of growers in North County Dublin.  There has also been an additional £500,000 towards the cost of constructing and repairing accommodation roads and bog roads. While we welcome the increase in respect of the local improvements scheme we hope there will be a fairer distribution of the money to the various counties.  We had occasion to bring a deputation from Monaghan County Council to the Minister for Local Government.  We pointed out to him the imbalance in the allocation of money for the local improvements scheme.  Those schemes are very important.  We brought to the Minister's notice that County Monaghan had received something in the region of £24,000 while an adjoining county had received £82,000.  There was also an imbalance in the additional allocation made later on.  In that supplementary allocation one country received more than we originally received. While £500,000 might seem to be a worthwhile additional contribution, when one takes into account the extra cost of road materials, labour and machinery, one finds that very little additional work could be done.  The local improvements scheme is the most important scheme so far as the rural areas are concerned.  If the Minister can see his way in future years he should increase substantially the amounts under this heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we welcome the cattle feed voucher scheme we must say it is coming very late.  This scheme is being temporarily supplemented by money from the Exchequer but this money will be recouped by temporarily withdrawing the credit available to the registered buyers of cattle so that, in fact, this scheme <Col N="1902" /> will cost the Exchequer very little. We were lucky we had a very mild winter.  Otherwise we would have had animals starving.  There are many people who have not as yet, been told whether they have been accepted under the feed voucher scheme.  It is a pity the scheme was not made available earlier in the year so that farmers producing small cattle would have known whether they were actually getting the vouchers and the amounts to which they were entitled.</P>
    <P>I notice the subsidised loan scheme, which is for the purpose of assisting in the retention of young cattle, has been extended for ten months.  The provision under this heading seems to be £240,000.  I would appeal to the Minister that should the need arise, extra funds should be provided under this heading.</P>
    <P>The amount provided in the budget for agriculture is almost insignificant especially at a time when an injection into that industry was very necessary. We all hoped with the fall off in the use of fertilisers, because of the very substantial increase in the price, that some effort would have been made to ensure that farmers were encouraged to use them.  Some years ago when subsidisation of fertilisers was first introduced farmers made a great effort to ensure their land reached the highest possible level of fertility.  The drop in the use of fertilisers is the most serious aspect of our economy.  It has only been over the last ten years that farmers realised the potential of their land and realised that by proper husbandry, the use of fertilisers and proper programming, they could achieve their targets.</P>
    <P>The increase in the price of petrol, veterinary fees and veterinary medicine is creating a serious problem for farmers.  Many of them will probably fail to use some of the veterinary medicines necessary to ensure the health of their stock.  If a subsidy was provided for farmers who have a large number of breeding stock this would help greatly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Other speakers have spoken about the housing situation and appeals have been made to increase the maximum loans from £4,500, which is very low.  If this is not done it will have a very serious effect on the private housing sector.  The maximum income qualification should be increased from £2,350.  Many people are unable to obtain bridging loans during the interval between submitting their application for a housing loan and when it is approved.  It is the wish of most young married couples to own their own houses.  It gives them a stake in the country and gives them something to work for.  Their homes are their castles.  If the maximum loan is not increased many young couples will not be able to own their own homes. This amount is not sufficient when one takes into account the high price of developing sites and the cost of house building in general.  Many young men are faced with redundancy and with short-time work so that they have a drop in their incomes.</P>
      <P>Rural electrification is a serious problem in many areas.  Now that there has been a withdrawal of the subsidy many people are faced with having to pay £1,000 to obtain a connection. Some assistance will have to be given to those people who are building their houses in rural areas as otherwise they will not be able to have electricity.</P>
      <P>There has also been a withdrawal of amenity grants.  The Minister, in answer to a parliamentary question, gave us the reason why those grants were withdrawn.  Money was spent on worthwhile projects under the amenity grants scheme and the Minister should have given serious thought to the withdrawal of those grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money should have been provided for industry, especially for those facing difficulties at present, such as the shoe, textile and furniture industries.  The shoe industry was debated very extensively in the House.  Following our Private Members' debate steps were taken and I think there will be a curb on the importation of shoes.  There is also a serious problem in relation to the importation <Col N="1904" /> of furniture and wood products which are in serious competition with home-produced products.  I was on a deputation which met the Minister for Finance in relation to this matter.  The home producers felt that VAT should be levied at the point of import rather than the point of sale. I had hoped that the Minister would have examined this by now.  In view of the serious position in which many of these furniture factories are he should take a decision very soon in this matter.</P>
    <P>In the debate on petrol we pressed for some allowance for workers who have to travel long distances to work. That is another area the Minister might examine with a view to giving some relief to these workers.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the reliefs given in the budget by way of social welfare.  We naturally welcome these reliefs but they are not really giving anything additional to the recipients; they are merely going some of the way towards compensating for the rise in prices due to inflation.  The Minister should have made a greater effort to provide work for people because, while the dole is good in its way, it is short-term.  In the long term what is really vitally essential is the provision of jobs in either agriculture or industry and a greater effort must really be made to provide these jobs.</P>
    <P>Arterial drainage is of vital concern to my county and to the adjoining counties of Fermanagh and Cavan.  I had hoped that this year a great deal more money would have been provided for arterial drainage out of the special EEC fund for underdeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>Speaking about the EEC, a Deputy on the other side recently said that many people were against the EEC.  It was, of course, members of the Government he should have been addressing because we in Fianna Fáil accepted that the EEC was the best for the country and we did all in our power to persuade the people that that was so.  The people responded with a massive vote.  We still have confidence in the EEC and, if we have any criticism to make, it is that the Government are not taking full advantage of membership and fighting a hard enough battle in Brussels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I compliment the Minister on introducing such a budget at this very difficult time.  Many people were surprised&mdash;indeed, almost shocked&mdash;to find the Minister could produce such a budget in this inflationary era, which exists not only here but all over the world.  Never since 1932 have any Government faced such a difficult period.  There is rampant inflation.  We have a very costly defence bill and a very high cost of living.  Of course, people are better informed today than they were in the years 1932 to 1940.  With the mass media of communication everybody now knows the situation facing the Government.</P>
      <P>A good deal of hardship was suffered by the people in the west over the last year.  The hardship was not of their making.  Neither was it the making of the Government. Weather conditions were responsible to a certain extent but the worst contributory factor was the advice given by the so-called experts to the farmers to over-produce animals they could not feed.  The stock had to be got rid of at any cost and the farmers in the west suffered far more than did any other section of the community.  I saw these farmers outside Leinster House protesting.  One man sold three or four young cattle to buy a suit of clothes. The Minister has now helped them through the medium of increased social welfare.  Had these social welfare increases not been given these farmers could not have survived.</P>
      <P>The Minister has done a good deal for social welfare recipients generally but one category has been left out of consideration, the category that will be considered, I hope, in the Minister's next budget.  I refer to the widower who is left with a young family.  He is very hard hit.  I trust this category will be included in the social welfare net next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for increasing the allocation for local improvements scheme.  However, the provision made should have been increased by another £1 million because drainage in the west is a serious problem.  This applies in particular to my county and the neighbouring counties. <Col N="1906" />  To help solve this problem county councils should be allocated sufficient money to open the tributaries.  This would be a much quicker and more efficient method of draining the land.</P>
    <P>The cattle and beef sectors of agriculture have been going through a most difficult period.  This was due to circumstances outside the control of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries but everyone will admit that the Minister worked very hard for the farmers.  He must be complimented on his efforts in Europe where he was faced by much stronger nations.  However, there are people in this country who will never have to work again because of the benefits they obtained from the intervention price scheme. The people who bought cattle and sold them to the factories have made a considerable amount of money. These people should not get all the benefits.  The small farmers should have got the intervention grants but this did not happen in many cases.  I know of people who accumulated wealth but it is a sad situation that small farmers were held to ransom, were forced to sell their cattle at low prices to people who subsequently got the intervention price.  I know the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries could not do much about this because we have private enterprise here.  I have been a member of the IFA all my life but I cannot understand why Mr. Maher or his associates did not act in this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister for Finance has allocated more than £2 million for the cattle voucher scheme.  The people who have applied for the vouchers will get them in due course.  It will help the small farmers in particular because feed has been very scarce this year.</P>
      <P>I must compliment both the IDA on the job they are doing and the Minister for giving an increased allocation for the development of industry.  I think the Minister should check on areas where there is a considerable amount of unemployment assistance being paid.  Industries should be located in these places.  In my constituency and the border constituencies from Kiltimagh, Swinford, Charlestown, Ballyhaunis to the Roscommon-Sligo border an enormous amount of unemployment assistance is paid.  The IDA should concentrate on these areas when the question of establishing industries is being considered.  It will not be possible to cut out unemployment assistance until these people get work.  The IDA have done tremendous work in the Killala area and in two years' time there will not be an unemployed man in that area.</P>
      <P>There is no Member in this House who is anxious to see price increases but a Government must face up to their obligations and the services of the State must be provided.  In the present inflationary period the Minister for Finance had no option but to increase taxation.  Although we do not like the taxes on drink and tobacco we must support whatever Government are in power on this matter so that services may be provided.</P>
      <P>We are near the end of this period of crisis and next year the budget will be even better.  Our economy will have improved by then and the cattle prices, which are moving upwards, will have reached a good level.  I believe that we do not appreciate that we live in one of the nicest countries in the world.  It is only when we travel abroad that we realise the beauty of our country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the previous speaker, and other Deputies, that the cattle feed voucher scheme is merely a contribution from one farmer to another and it has nothing at all to do with a subvention from the Exchequer.  Deputy White mentioned the fact that small farmers were being encouraged to take part-time employment in industry, something we all agree with.  This was encouraged by the Fianna Fáil Government but I am afraid the Minister for Finance has failed miserably in this aspect because he has introduced a system of income tax for those farmers.  The result is that farmers who take up part-time employment are liable for income tax and this does not encourage them to take up such employment.</P>
      <P>I should like to talk about the question of leadership, particularly leadership that should be provided by the Minister for Finance.  In the past two years the Government told the people that the position was serious, that our financial and economic position was serious, and that our balance of payments was in an emergency situation. The Government accept&mdash;and this has been stated by at least two members of the Government&mdash;40 per cent of the responsibility for this which means that 60 per cent of the cause of this situation arose from outside sources.  I accept that 60 per cent of the cause of this situation is due to the oil crisis and other factors outside our control but the Government have done nothing about their share of the responsibility.</P>
      <P>This budget, which reflects the thinking of the Government and the Minister for Finance, demonstrates in a clear manner their attitude to the Irish people.  Nothing shows better than a Government speaking to their people in times of emergency when people expect leadership.  It is very difficult to realise why the Irish people are being treated as if they have less than sufficient intelligence.  The Government were given an opportunity of showing leadership, and honesty, in this budget but, in fact, they insulted our people. They have reneged miserably in all aspects of leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some months the Government <Col N="1909" /> talked of national partnership, something which was mentioned by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech, but we now know exactly what the present Government means by national partnership.  We had a demonstration of that meaning last week.  We had a demonstration of arrogance from the Minister for Education.  That Minister gave us a glaring example of how a Government will react to constructive criticism, of how they will treat any type of questioning of their policies, how they will treat any dissecting of their ideas.  The attitude of the Government can be summed up in this way, what is right for us is right for Ireland and nobody else has any worthwhile views.  This Government should realise that they are incapable of participating in a national partnership.  There is an obvious lack of leadership.  They should have learned in 16 years of Good Government while they were in Opposition that in a time of emergency, harsh but positive steps are essential to reverse adverse economic conditions in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>There is no point in putting off until tomorrow a situation which will worsen day by day in the months and the year ahead.  This is exactly what the Minister has done in his budget. He took the steps needed to correct the position to date, but he showed no foresight in planning ahead.  He said he was bringing social welfare recipients up to the position that pertained 12 months ago.  Having regard to inflation and the drop in the value of money, he may possibly have brought them up to date, but he certainly allowed no leeway for inflation.</P>
    <P>He attempted to hide from the people the emergency which must arise again and again throughout the year.  He will probably continue to adopt different approaches to remedy the situation in a piecemeal fashion. The increase in taxation on petrol some two months ago must be considered as a budget in itself.  How many more of these budgets will we see during the coming year?  The people would have accepted a straight package as an emergency measure if <Col N="1910" /> they knew it would be sufficient to carry them over until the next budget, and sufficient to deal with the financial and economic problems which will arise during the coming year.</P>
    <P>A large part of the Ministers dishonesty is shown by the fact that he did not tell the people some of the income which will vastly increase his revenue during the coming year through taxes other than the taxes in this budget.  He did not mention an estimated £30 million which will come from the vastly increased price of petrol.  He did not mention what will accrue to the Exchequer from the recent increases in the health contribution charges, which are estimated to bring in £4 million.  He did not mention the recently increased telephone charges and the postal charges. Above all, he did not mention the huge increase in value-added tax which will accrue to the Exchequer from all those increases, and all the other price increases over the past few months.</P>
    <P>As a further example of how the Minister treated the Irish people I want to quote a sentence from his speech.  He said:</P>
    <P>When I introduced my budget last April the economy was in a healthy state....</P>
    <P>This is far from what he told us last April when he introduced his £16 million deficit budget for the coming year.  We in Fianna Fáil warned him about this type of deficit budgeting in the economic climate which pertained at that time.  We said it was highly dangerous.  The Minister ignored our warning and now we have a consequent enormous deficit this year.  This must be regarded as hazardous and careless budgeting.</P>
    <P>A measure of the result of last year's budget is that we are now approaching a figure of 100,000 unemployed, and that figure is continuing to rise daily.  This involves 4,000 people or 5,000 people in severe economic difficulty, at a time when prices are being allowed to skyrocket, at a time when payments are enormous, at a time when the simplest loan <Col N="1911" /> facility costs in the region of 15 per cent to 21 per cent in interest charges. To my mind this is nothing short of criminal neglect on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>To compound that situation by not facing up to it this year and taking the economy by the throat is dangerous.  This Minister said:</P>
    <P>Moderation in income increases in 1975 is therefore imperative if we are to half the serious deterioration in employment.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say that.  What effort has he or have the Government made to control the prices which give rise to the need for these increases?  What effort has he or the Government made to economise in their own spending in the non-vital sectors so that our people who are pressed to the wall by price increases can be fairly told not to ask for more pay or more compensation for the increase in the cost of living?</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget speech referred to the large proportion of extra staff assigned for telephone development in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Wherever did they go? We have seen no improvement in the telephone service, which must be one of the worst in the world.  This Department, which continually brings in large sums in revenue is, I feel, robbed of it.  We can understand that money must be transferred from one Department to another but it is not a good thing to bankrupt any one Department, particularly the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which needs the revenue.  It is understandable that the Minister in charge of this Department, Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien, is far too busy dabling in other Departments to bother with his own Department and its development.  In such a situation the Taoiseach must find himself with a Government in which certain Ministers exercise no control over their Departments.  We might ask where the money accruing from revenue to that Department has gone.</P>
    <P>I now refer to a section of the community that is of particular concern to me because I live among farmers and <Col N="1912" /> know their difficulties.  The Minister's budget statement in this regard sounds very hollow.  He says:</P>
    <P>The Government have been very concerned about the problems of the cattle industry and have taken all possible steps open to them to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Saying that the Government have been very concerned is little consolation to the many farmers now facing bankruptcy because of the Government's indecision and their muddling in the past year in regard to the most important sector of the community.  The dairy farmer has seen the price of calves drop to rock bottom.  It was suggested at one stage that there might be an opportunity to export dropped calves to third countries but the Minister refused to apply to the European Commissioner for Agriculture for sanction for this notwithstanding that a transport subsidy would be available from the EEC to subsidise the export of these calves.</P>
    <P>Farmers depending on the beef section of the industry are faced with rising interest charges, non-availability of markets and stagnation of their farms because the Government cannot or will not act positively on their behalf.</P>

      <P>It is easy to blame the EEC for every ill we have.  Yet the EEC are able to make arrangements for other countries in the Community and I do not see why our Ministers should not apply to the EEC for some means of helping this country out of the present emergency.  When we in Fianna Fáil some months ago asked the Government to apply for the green £ the Minister <Col N="1913" /> for Agriculture and Fisheries kicked for touch for months on end and only at the end of that period did he negotiate the green £ when the farmers had their backs to the wall.  Here, again, we see the futility of this Government moving at the last minute and not moving far enough.</P>
      <P>Today when the Government are speaking of a national partnership, they have upset another section of the farmers to the extent that they are now threatening a no beet campaign.  The Government have said these farmers are acting unfairly and so they are faced with the prospect of not acting and going bankrupt. This section of the farmers has suffered grievously in the last 12 months.</P>
      <P>In addition to that the Government introduced in last year's budget, and continued in this year's budget this question of taxing farmers.  Of course that was done as a result of the constant nagging of their socialist minority partners.  Time and time again the farmers have declared willingness to pay their just share of tax but the Government could not wait for the opportunity.  Now they have imposed on farmers a system of double taxation, income tax and rates on their method of production and rates on their land.  This is certainly not in keeping with our European partners.  As far as I am aware, no other country in the EEC makes its farmers liable to double taxation.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to reconsider very carefully this suggestion of having it either one way or the other : imposing rates on their means of production or income tax on their income.  I would urge the Minister to keep that aspect of taxation of the farming community in line with other European countries because this system of double taxation is most unjust.  I would ask the Minister to amend this legislation.  Indeed the Government could not have picked a worse time for its introduction.  Not alone will the Government stand idly by and watch the farming industry go to the wall&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is well to hear it again and again so that at some time certain Ministers might be impressed and listen to reason.  It is a wonder they have not learned from their 16 years in Opposition to a good Government how emergencies should be dealt with.  But the Government are standing idly by now watching the farming industry go downhill.  They will give them a further push down the hill and tax them on their way down; in other words, tax them at their time of greatest need, and tax them doubly.</P>
      <P>Before the last general election the two parties which subsequently joined in Coalition had a bright new idea for a review of the entire taxation system. There was to be a great new departure in Irish legislation.  But when we got over the first hurdle we found what they meant was that they would slam new taxes on without regard to the existing system, or existing taxes, or without regard to the double taxation position in which the farmer now finds himself.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance referred in his budget speech to the question of national assessment.  He said that the intention was that that concession would be available to farmers as an alternative to an assessment on an actual profit basis.  How well he might say that.  Let us hope the farmers are not foolish enough to take him up too strongly on that offer.  The idea of taxation on a rateable valuation is as old as the hills and is as antiquated an idea of taxation as can be envisaged.  The imposition of tax in accordance with valuation of land has the same undesirable effect as the high rating system operating at present because it does not take into account the amount of profit the man may have in that year or indeed of the profitability of his holding.  When the Government speak of out-of-date taxes, they might well give consideration to the out-of-date system of rating from which farmers suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned in his <Col N="1915" /> speech the introduction, or should I say, the increasing of the Exchequer subvention to local authorities for the implementation of local improvement schemes.  Being a member of a local authority I welcome the Minister's contribution in that regard, one of the few worthwhile contributions made in his budget.  Many of us who are members of local authorities realise there are long waiting lists.  In Limerick alone there is a waiting list of two-and-a-half to three years for the implementation of such schemes because of inadequate finance.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government is listening.  I hope he will impress on his Minister the need for further subventions to that very important fund for the implementation of more of those local improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance took money out of one pocket and put it into another.  Might I refer&mdash;as has been done time and time again by speakers from this side of the House &mdash;to the decision of the Minister for Local Government to withdraw the amenity grant scheme?  It is a recognised principle of our State that communities, whether they be residents' associations, local communities or parish communities, must develop and live in harmony because, I believe, out of those communities emerges the nation as a whole. Amenity grants were introduced by Fianna Fáil, when in Government, to help those communities and they have been in existence for some time now.</P>
    <P>They ensure that such developments as these communities wish to undertake by their own decision are helped by the local authorities and by the Government.  Community development is most desirable and more necessary today than ever it was, with the change in our society from the old agricultural crossroads idea to the greater, urbanised area.  As Deputy White said earlier today, the withdrawal of these amenity grants means that there is no provision for the erection of community centres, that our young people, particularly boys and girls in country areas, have no place to go other than the local pub or lounge bar.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1916" /> In the urban areas, the built-up towns and villages, the areas adjacent to the larger cities, the community spirit is again beginning to prosper.  These communities are drawing together in their meeting places for the good of their area, and no movement deserves more praise than this.  But here we go again: the Government remove the amenity grants.  It is a serious thing when people suffer in their pockets and in their jobs, but it is even more serious when they suffer in their spirit. Their spirit and their willingness to fight against the pressures which surround us will be fostered first in their own community areas, and everything that can possibly be done to bolster this spirit should be done at community level.  Yet this Government have ignored this basic need of our society. Again I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to ask the Minister to have these grants restored.  In the course of his budget speech the Minister says:</P>
    <P>There is no room for pessimism. Defeatist attitudes that breed on themselves are uncalled for and dangerous.</P>
    <P>Here surely is hypocrisy, because the Minister's attitude stinks with defeatism and pessimism.  Like a man with his back to the wall he handles only what is absolutely necessary for today, with no thought for the future and no broad planning.  It is small wonder that the companies who thought of coming to this country and the companies already here will neither found nor expand, respectively, because there is no broad Government policy.  Every one of the Minister's proposals is a half measure. Honesty is completely absent from his speech and from his thinking.  Above all, in this so-called Coalition Government leadership is missing.  It is hard to blame the Taoiseach, the Leader of this mixed lot of Ministers of different views and different approaches.</P>

      <P>In their frantic efforts to remain in power this Government are trying to maintain an appearance of unity.  Therefore, in a sense we should be a little more compassionate with the man who leads our country at present.  However, I want to contrast this performance with that of Fianna Fáil when they were in Government. Fianna Fáil never lacked the capacity to act and to take emergency measures when they were needed at budget time. that is the reason they stayed in power, because the people appreciated this capacity to act forthrightly and to take desperate measures when desperate measures were needed and, indeed, be successful with them.  We never lacked leadership or unity.  Surely the time is near when this country must call on us again, because the people have no hope with this disunited semblance of a Government.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Richie Ryan, in his budget, showed a complete lack of leadership, a complete lack of planning and a complete lack of forthrightness with the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Begley) Michael Begley">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Begley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is fair to say, from meeting the common people of Ireland, that they have indicated in no uncertain way that this budget was a realistic one and also showed concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be in order for me to suggest to any Deputy the line he should take in his contribution to this debate.  Suffice it to say that the Opposition would have been better off complimenting the Minister on producing a budget such as this at this time rather than to indulge in the sort of criticism we have heard from their speakers.  During his term in office the Minister for Finance has shown a real concern and a sense of realism <Col N="1918" /> in the budgets he has introduced, a concern and a realism that, before, were absent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan's contribution was far reaching and, at times, off key. He put certain questions to the Department of Local Government and I am glad to avail of the opportunity to deal with some of the theories he put forward.  The Deputy expressed amazement at the abolition of the amenity grants.  Replying to a question here last week, the Minister for Local Government said there were other areas of higher priority than amenities.  At this time, when not only Ireland but the whole world is experiencing difficulties, we must have our priorities right. I am sure that every elected member of a local authority would agree with me when I say that it would be far better to provide housing for somebody who was unfortunate enough to be living on the side of the road or in a broken-down caravan rather than to make money available for amenities.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to prevent local authorities from providing money for amenities if they so wish.  In any county no more than 10p in the £ on the rates would be required to provide the type of amenities that Deputy Noonan has in mind.  The Minister for Finance expressed the hope that this world recession would be of a temporary nature.  In the meantime we must have our order of priorities right and so far as the Department of Local Government are concerned, our first priority is that of housing those people who are in need of housing.</P>
    <P>It is seen from the Book of Estimates that the grant for local improvements schemes is almost £500,000. Our Government are a Government of concern and in deciding on the amount of this grant they took into consideration the views expressed from both sides of the House and had no hesitation in including an extra £500,000 in the budget for local improvements schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputies Noonan and Leonard spoke at length regarding the varying allocations to different counties for local improvements.  There are reasons why this is so.  Have the Deputies endeavoured <Col N="1919" /> to ascertain the number of roads awaiting attention in the various counties or the number of applications from each county that are being processed and are with the local district engineers?  Kerry, for instance, is high on the list because there are more than 800 roads awaiting attention there.  It would be a worthwhile exercise in democracy for those Members of this House who happen to be members also of local authorities to find out from their local authorities what is the situation in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Minister increased substantially the allocation to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  As Deputies will be aware, since being elected to this House I have displayed a particular interest in fisheries and that at one time I was spokesman for fisheries for my party.  The increase to BIM this year, compared with last year, represents 41 per cent.  The discussion as to whether boats should be built here or abroad was apt in the wake of this increased allocation.  My personal opinion is that preference should be given to the Irish boatyards.  There are employed in these establishments craftsmen of exceptional talent, whose craft has been inherited down through generations.</P>
    <P>In Dingle there were 25 people engaged on boat building in 1972 but I am glad to say that the number increased to 40 in 1974.</P>
    <P>There is a substantial increase, too, in the allocation to the Gaeltacht areas.  I have no hesitation in availing of this opportunity to voice my concern in relation to certain aspects of this allocation.  I trust the Chair will bear with me if, in order to illustrate my point, I find it necessary to go into some detail.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that the Gaeltacht scholarship scheme is being abused.  It is wrong morally that any co-operative can make a profit of £34,000 on the running of these scholarships.  I am not worried as to who may be hurt by my saying this. This is money that would be better spent if given either to the mná tí who look after the children or in providing extra recreation and educational <Col N="1920" /> facilities for them.  The various groups who organise these scholarships should be compelled to make available their books for public inspection so that the profits involved would be known.  I have no hesitation in saying that out loud.  In my opinion, £34,000 profit was far too high for anybody to make out of Gaeltacht scholarships.  This money should go to the people and not to a specific group.</P>
    <P>In 1972-73 the public capital programme for housing was £46.16 million; in 1975 it is £101 million. These figures speak for themselves. Again, this emphasises the point I made at the start&mdash;we are showing concern for those who need it.  Housing is a first priority on our list.  If more money is given for the housing programme, the amount for sewerage and water facilities will also be increased.  To reinforce my argument I will give more figures.  In 1972-73 under Fianna Fáil £8.23 million was provided for sanitary services.  In 1975 we gave £16.75 million.  No matter what way you look at this, and no matter what your political affiliations were in the past, it must be admitted openly by every member of a local authority that there was never so much money available for housing, water and sewerage before.  These are official figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan criticised most severely the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The 1974 Estimate for this Department was £33 million; in 1975 it is £39 million.  The Minister is providing money to improve the existing telephone system, the automation of new telephone exchanges throughout the country and expanding the system to meet demands for new phones.  He is prepared to say that by 1978 he hopes to have 90 per cent of all subscribers to automatic dialling.</P>
    <P>The 1974 Estimate for Industry and Commerce was £40.9 million; in 1975 it is £61.63 million.  Again, that shows that the IDA, SFADCo and Gaeltarra Éireann are doing their work. It is wrong that snippets of criticism should be directed at these bodies because <Col N="1921" /> they are doing more than their share.</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial increase in the provision for Fóir Teoranta.  For 1975 there is a provision of £4 million.  This is to ensure that it will continue to discharge its functions in a proper manner.  Since April, 1972, Fóir Teoranta have approved financial assistance for 136 concerns employing 13,800 people.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Radio and Television for 1974 was £1.71 million; for 1975 it is £3.17 million.  On what is that extra money being spent?  It is to provide a second channel for the people in the country&mdash;Kerry, Cork, Waterford, up the west coast and Limerick.  This is money well spent. We are as much entitled to a separate service as the people living on the east coast.  This shows that the Minister's ear is to the ground.  He has listened to the volume of opinion expressed in the south west and the west. He said here that he would provide a second channel and he has provided the money to carry that promise through.  Again, this shows that the Government are concerned about the anomalies which exist between one side of the country and the other.</P>
    <P>Social welfare as a percentage of the gross national product in 1972-73 was 4.1; in 1973-74 it was 4.9; in 1974-75 it was 5.1 and in 1975 it was 5.6.  The Minister for Social Welfare and the Parliamentary Secretary have shown concern for the people who need help.  The budget provides a very substantial increase in all weekly rates, of social welfare.  Most notable, perhaps, is the £2 per week in the personal rate for old age contributory pension.  It also brought the rates for pensioners under 80 years up to £10.50.</P>
    <P>The increase in personal rates ranged from over 21 per cent to as much as 23.5 per cent, well above the rise in prices since July, 1974.  Again, that shows that the Government are concerned about the people who need help.  The qualifying age for a pension has been reduced from 70 to 67 years. The means tests for a variety of social assistance schemes has been eased by <Col N="1922" /> a further £1.  This means that a person can earn £6 a week and will still qualify for the full pension.  These facts cannot be forgotten.  They have gone down well in rural Ireland.  When the by-elections are over this will be shown by the people at the ballot boxes.</P>
    <P>The most notable feature of social welfare has been that the rate of weekly payments will be reviewed in the light of developments in the cost of living in the period ahead.  They will be increased again approximately next October.  The review is in line with the commitment contained in the Government's White Paper on the economic situation and is designed to protect the standard of living of all those depending on social welfare and related benefits in a period of continued inflation.  Those actions speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be no harm to reply to the criticisms of the dole.  The Fianna Fáil Party should come out and say, as it seems to be the farmers' dole that is bothering them, that they will abolish it if they get back into power.  That is the message that is coming loud and clear across the House.  When Fianna Fáil were in power they made an effort to abolish it but there was such an outcry, with some of their Deputies abstaining from voting, that they dropped it like a hot bun.  No matter how one looks at it there are small farmers who would be in very poor circumstances were it not for the farmers' dole.  If there are abuses it is for the Department of Social Welfare to find out where they are and remedy them.  To say one prefers to see a man working than drawing the dole is a lovely bald statement, but if a man is living seven miles up a mountain with nothing but two or three cows and a few mountain sheep where will he get a job?</P>
    <P>I know it is the concern of every Deputy to keep as many people as possible in rural Ireland.  Of course the criticism from the Opposition has come from the Deputies who live in the rich Midlands, the Deputies with the big farms.  When the beef subsidy scheme was introduced by Fianna Fáil the big farmer could buy up to 100 in-calf <Col N="1923" /> heifers and get the subsidy while the poor man up the mountain could barely carry one.  That was an indirect subsidy to the big farmer and there was no outcry about it.  This is a social problem and there are some farmers who would not be living in rural Ireland today if they were not getting the dole.  If there are abuses and if Deputies know of them it is only right that they should be corrected.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Minister also helped out the income tax payer and it is only right to put on the record that this is the second year in succession in which the Minister has done this.  The matter of income tax relief was left in abeyance by the Fianna Fáil Party for a number of years.  As in the case of the qualifying age for old age pension, it took the National Coalition to show concern in the areas where concern was needed.</P>
    <P>I will not bore the House by reading out figures because I see Deputy Gibbons over there and he is always a very reasonable man.  I would not like him to be left out of the debate so I will conclude by saying that some of the criticisms made by the Opposition were not substantiated by their contributions.  The Government are concerned with people.  As far as priorities are concerned, housing and social welfare are Nos. 1 and 2.  That is how it will be and that is how it should be.  I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhhairle, for the patience with which you listened to my contribution.  I know I strayed occasionally.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance began his speech with a reference to the fact that he had not the wealth or the wisdom of King Solomon and suggested that, but for those attributes of his, he would have been forgotten.  I suggest that the indiscretions of Solomon with the Queen of Sheba would have been remembered. Indeed I think a film has been made of this facet of his life.  I hope that as time passes the Minister will not be remembered for his indiscretions in the Department of Finance rather than for his wisdom.  At times one is inclined to think that this is how it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1924" /> Much has been made of what this budget has done for social welfare recipients.  It must be accepted that it has gone some of the way to compensate them for the inflation which has occurred over the past 12 months. Much is made of this fact by the senior partner in the Coalition Government. It is essential at times like this to remind the public that it was the Fianna Fáil Party and their policy that made the payment of social welfare in reasonably large sums acceptable to the public.  I, to a certain extent, am unfortunate in that I remember away back in the thirties when Fianna Fáil came to power.  This was one of the big things that had to be sold to the people who then had the wealth.  I remember well that the then Cumann na nGaedheal Party did not believe in social welfare to the same extent as the Fianna Fáil Party at that time did. Indeed it was only following the 1961 Election that Fine Gael realised they would have to get in on the social welfare aspect of government and so they published their policy on the just society.  For all practical purposes they were about 30 years behind the Fianna Fáil Party in the matter of social welfare.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest contributions which Fianna Fáil policy made to the development of this State was that gradually over the years they got the public to accept that there was an obligation on those who had wealth to divide it with those who did not have wealth.  The Labour Party, who opposed our entry to the EEC, are now taking credit for increased social welfare benefits.  But the resources from which those benefits are being paid were, firstly, made available from our own resources though the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government over the last 20 years and secondly, made available by EEC funds which were released to us through the Agricultural Vote.  If the Labour Party had had their way those funds would not be available to us.</P>
    <P>There is a gap in our social welfare system on which I should like to focus attention.  It is the situation of the sick wife who cannot avail of adequate rest or adequate medical treatment for her <Col N="1925" /> condition because it would be necessary for her husband to cease working.  I have tried to focus attention on this by questions both to the Minister for Labour and to the Minister for Social Welfare.  This gap must be filled by making it possible for a husband whose wife is ill to cease work for four to six weeks and a special social welfare payment should be made available to cover that contingency or if necessary have it made available by the employer.  As a doctor, I see this happening week after week.  It is one of the glaring inadequacies of the social welfare system.</P>

      <P>The use made of the call office telephone in the sub-post office at Dooagh is not sufficient to warrant provision of a kiosk there at present.  A silencing booth, which is being provided, may, however, lead to increased use of the call office telephone, and the position will be kept under close review.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that a business premises, where no acoustic facilities or no cover of any type is provided, is a suitable arrangement for a person wishing to make a telephone call.

      <P>The Deputy has made this point before.  I appreciate the point he makes but, of course, there is no way of establishing that the low revenue here&mdash;it is a low revenue, £31 for the year ended 31st December&mdash;is due to the lack of silencing facilities.  We are in any case providing silencing facilities now. This may lead, if the Deputy is right, to an expansion in traffic.  If it does, there might then be a case for a kiosk.  The situation will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware there are over 100 applicants awaiting the installation of telephones for some time and some of these are business people and builders?  The situation generally in the town is unsatisfactory and, if I understand the Minister's reply correctly, it will be a year before this equipment is installed.  Is that not a rather long delay?  Who has fallen down in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy the situation is unsatisfactory as, of course, was the situation for applicants who were without telephones for a great many years in many parts.  We are now making an effort to catch up.  The auxiliary exchange in this area, equipped for 1,000 additional subscriber lines, is on order. The slippages compared with the previous estimate given to the Deputy in April last is due to discussions with the contractor regarding technical design.  The existing exchange building in Tullamore is full and the Office of Public Works expect to provide additional accommodation for the extra 1,000 lines equipment by the end of the year.  Because of the large number of waiting applicants and the long period before relief can be given in the normal way it is proposed to use a mobile exchange, to be delivered later this year, to provide for some 200 private lines as an interim measure.  The precise number will depend on the amount of call traffic generated.  A mobile exchange does not require a building.  It is contained in a weatherproof structure which requires only a suitably prepared site. Allowing for priority needs until the 1,000 line auxiliary exchange is ready it is unlikely that the 200 lines will be sufficient to enable more than the 36 applications made in 1973 and some of the 1974 applications to be cleared immediately.  By &ldquo;early 1976&rdquo; I mean within the first three months.</P>

      <P>The only areas where RTE transmissions are available on the 405-line standard only are parts of counties Donegal and Monaghan.  The 405-line service there will not be ceased until after a 625-line service has been provided, probably in 1977.</P>
      <P>Elsewhere the television line standard used by RTE is 625 lines but a duplicate service on 405 lines is also broadcast from transmitters at Kippure, which serves most of Leinster, including the areas mentioned specifically by the Deputy, and parts of Cavan and Monaghan and Truskmore, which serves north Connacht and parts of Donegal, Longford and Cavan, and from a low powered transposer at Donnybrook.  RTE expect to cease the duplicate 405-line transmissions from Kippure and Truskmore in about 12 months' time and from Donnybrook towards the middle of 1976.</P>

The arbitration board is there to provide, where requested, an independent assessment of claims on which it has not been possible to reach agreement at conciliation level.  I am afraid it would be inappropriate to consider outside the scheme a general claim on behalf of postmasters on a matter that has been dealt with under the scheme.  However, it would be open to individual postmasters to make representations and to have them considered outside the scheme.  In the consideration of any general or individual claims, clearly regard would have to be had to the findings of the arbitration board.</P>

      <P>It would not be a matter appropriate to the committee.  The material supplied goes out generally and, in view of modern means of communication, naturally the more important bits reach the provinces by way of radio and television more quickly than by post.  The material provided by post is mainly useful to the papers concerned for record purposes, so that they may be able to consult past statements.  It often happens that as Government public activity is particularly marked during Dáil sessions this does not meet the provincial papers deadlines which may be in the middle of the week.  If a provincial paper has a problem in this area and if they wish to receive more swift information on a given day it would be possible for the paper to arrange a telephone collect service with the GIS before they go to Press. The GIS would be quite open on that matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is mistaken.  There are not two organisations.  The GIS have a particular purpose, which is to inform the public <Col N="1940" /> in general.  and in specifically informing the Press and the media.  Its functions are not mainly related to this House.  I am responsible to this House in this area by the Taoiseach's direction, and it is my duty therefore to answer questions raised in this House and by groups of Deputies who may consult me about wishing an improved flow of information on Government activity and policy.

Obviously it is part of the duty of the GIS to provide as good a service as they can to provincial papers.  Therefore they lend a very attentive ear to any suggestions they get from provincial papers.  Some papers have an inconvenient deadline in relation to the publication time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very broad question and it would take me some <Col N="1944" /> time to answer it.  I was satisfied that the rate of electricity growth demand prior to 1973 necessitated, in the long term, the establishment of a nuclear energy station.  Since then, as the Deputy knows, things have changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is frivolous.  In the long term nuclear energy will probably, as far as we can see now and we are looking a long time ahead, be the major source of cheap electricity supply.  That situation can change. The Deputy may have seen an announcement by the chief executive officer of the ESB recently to the effect that, because of the difference in demand, growth rate between 1973 and the current time they have put further back their decision on the establishment of a nuclear station. They still have not discarded it and I would not wish that they would do so. I would like them to go ahead planning for this station though without coming to a firm conclusion as to when it should be established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be quite some years anyway because the lead-in time for a nuclear station is seven years.  Even if we made the decision now to establish such a station it would be seven or eight years before it would be producing electricity.  That seven or eight years is now further back as a result of the ESB not seeing a pattern in the growth rate for electricity at present.</P>

Until that study has been completed no decisions can be taken about the main design parameters of this station.  It is likely, however, that the station would be designed for an average ash content of around 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>No contracts have been placed for coal but suppliers from Poland, Australia, South America, South Africa and Nigeria have expressed interest. The effect, if any, on the balance of payments will be determined by the relative costs of imports of coal and oil.</P>

It would not be economic to use the Arigna crow coal which has an ash content very much higher than 15 per cent.

      <P>On 26th June, 1974, the board were informed by the applicant that the terms quoted were acceptable but despite a further communication from the board on 19th July, 1974, payment of the capital contribution was not received.  On 2nd September, 1974, the applicant queried the amount of the capital contribution.  The board reiterated the terms quoted and on 1st November, 1974, wrote to the Deputy along similar lines.  Finally, on 27th November, 1974, in accordance with defined procedures, the board wrote to the person involved advising him that the area was now closed to subsidised supply.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Railways Acts, railway accidents must be reported by CIE to my Department and these accidents are investigated as necessary by the railway inspecting officer appointed by me under the Regulation of Railways Act, 1871.  CIE also conduct their own investigation into railway accidents and such remedial action as may be found necessary is taken by the board either on their own initiative or arising out of the investigation carried out by the railway inspecting officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statutory inquiries are held by the railway inspecting officer into the cause of any railway accident where the circumstances, in my view, are <Col N="1952" /> serious enough to warrant such inquiry, the most recent being an inquiry held on 20th December, 1974, into the cause of the collision of two passenger trains at Rosslare Strand station on 13th August, 1974.</P>
    <P>As already announced, I have also directed that an inquiry be held by the railway inspecting officer into the cause of the accident at Gormanstown station on 21st October, 1974, which unfortunately resulted in the death of two passengers.  This inquiry was opened in public on 5th February, 1975, at the Land Commission Court Room, Upper Merrion Street, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Decisions have not yet been taken as to the necessity for statutory inquiries into the causes of the other accidents listed by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the number of railway accidents which have occurred in recent times and while there is provision in the Railway Acts for a formal investigation, which is in effect a sworn inquiry, I do not consider that the circumstances of the recent railway accidents are such as to warrant this type of investigation.</P>

      <P>Since the establishment of the Gulf Oil terminal in Bantry Bay was first considered, close consideration has been given at all stages to the operating procedures and safeguards which the company should adopt so as to ensure safety of navigation and reduce the risk of oil pollution to a minimum.  When the terminal was opened in 1968 detailed operating arrangements to this end were indicated to, and accepted by, Gulf on whom the responsibility rested.  The adequacy of these arrangements has been the subject of frequent consultation with Gulf over the years and the arrangements themselves have been reviewed with the company from time to time in the light of working experience.</P>
      <P>Following the spillage from the <i>SS Universe Leader</i> in Bantry Bay in October, 1974, improved procedures for handling oil, recommended by my technical advisers, were accepted by Gulf Oil and put into operation.  These procedures relate mainly to inspection and control measures.</P>
      <P>Following the spillage in January, 1975, from the <i>SS Afran Zodiac</i> which, was due to defective fendering on one of the tug-boats in attendance on the tanker, I arranged, with the full co-operation of Gulf Oil, for temporary operating restrictions pending the provision of satisfactory fendering on the tug-boats These requirements were that&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) substantial supplementary padding should be provided on the <Col N="1957" /> tug-boats pending redesign of the tug-boats fendering;</P>
    <P>(b)  the tug-boats should be inspected before each operation;</P>
    <P>(c)  tug-boats operations should be carried out only in fair weather conditions.</P>
    <P>

      <P>I have said this umpteen times.  The Gulf Oil terminal, to my mind, is of benefit to this country.  I think the employment it gives in the area is very welcome.  But there are other people getting their livelihood from that area, fishermen and tourism interests, and their interests must be protected as well. There is no point in destroying the livelihoods of two sets of people because the conditions under which unloading of oil is carried out endanger it.  It is quite possible that they can live together and all progress together. But one of them cannot advance at the expense of the other two.</P>

      <P>I think if the Deputy thinks about that he will see it is a fallacy because one would have to give a basic ration, at one price, to every motorist in the country and anything over that would be at a very much higher price.  Therefore, the person using his car at the week-end to go to the sea-side for pleasure trips and so on would be getting the benefit of the cheap petrol, whereas the man who would use a lot of petrol during the week for his job, as a doctor, or a vet or to drive to work, would have to pay the increased amount.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Current plans for development at Dublin Airport provide mainly for the construction of a new east-west runway to the north of the terminal area as well as a second parallel runway to the south of this area when traffic growth requires it. Extensions to the apron and to an existing hangar are also planned.  A new control tower and air navigation services building will also be required.</P>
      <P>The acquisition of the necessary land for the proposed runways is in train and consultations are proceeding with the appropriate authorities about planning and related considerations.  It is not possible at this stage to state when construction work on the new runway to the north of the terminal area will commence but the indications now are that the runway will not be required before the end of the 1970s.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister no plans whatever for the use of the vast acreage of land owned by Aer Rianta for industrial development <Col N="1966" /> which could be based on the airport itself and which would encourage employment in the north county Dublin area, in view of the unemployment being created there because of the present recession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If anybody wishes to come to me with a proposition for such an industrial zone.  I shall be delighted to go to Aer Rianta with it. I cannot promise they will agree to it, because they have the responsibility of trying to foresee the future growth of that airport and having land available to cater for that growth.  There is at the moment, all over the world, as the Deputy will know, a turn back in air travel, and for this reason the expansion of runways at Dublin Airport is not envisaged until the end of the 1970s.  No doubt those lands will be wanted by Aer Rianta in the future for expansion of the runways, and if there were factories on them obviously they could not expand the airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there are many difficulties, but the question Deputy Burke has down asks about the Department's plans for the future development of Dublin Airport.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will consider the advisability of setting up a joint body embracing officials of his Department, the Department of Transport and Power, the manager and engineer or their representatives from Cork County Council, Cork Corporation and Cork Harbour Board and a representative of the Engineering and/or Geological Departments of UCC to investigate, to report on and to formulate plans in preparation for the changing economic, social and physical conditions which will take place in the Cork area as a result of the oil and gas finds off the Cork coast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the only commercial discovery of petroleum made so far off the Cork coast is one relatively small find of natural gas.  After taking into account a number of relevant considerations and consultation with interests concerned, the Government have, as already announced, taken a decision on the utilisation of this gas by NET and the ESB.  The arrangements to be adopted by these two organisations to give effect to this Government decision will of course be subject to the usual control by the local authorities and scrutiny by other interests concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developments which may follow <Col N="1970" /> from further gas or oil finds in commercial quantities off our coasts will be dependent on a number of factors including the location of the deposits, the nature of the petroleum and the projected levels of production.  I think it would be premature at this stage for me to take the initiative in forming a localised body on the lines suggested by the Deputy, as there is no precise evidence to indicate where future commercial discoveries of petroleum may be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the only company holding an exclusive exploration licence in our offshore area has reported a natural gas find about 30 miles off the Old Head of Kinsale with estimated recoverable reserves of one million million cubic feet.  This is modest by North Sea standards.  It has been decided, in principle, to allocate this gas partly to NET for the production of ammonia for fertilisers and partly to the ESB.  Discussions between the company and these two bodies are proceeding.</P>
      <P>During last year two wells drilled to the south west of the Kinsale Head field also showed hydrocarbons.  As already announced by the company the first produced oil at rates up to 780 barrels per day and gas at rates up to ten million cubic feet per day and the second flowed oil at 1,550 barrels per day.  Testing of the second well had to be suspended last autumn due to adverse weather and will be resumed this year.  Following this testing, additional drilling will be required to determine whether commercial quantities of oil or gas are present.</P>
      <P>In a further well drilled last year about 25 miles south of Ardmore Head encouraging signs of hydrocarbons were indicated by preliminary analysis, but here again drilling and testing had to be suspended due to adverse weather.  It will not be possible to evaluate the significance of the indications until further tests are performed later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding this and other factories along the Border, and since the concession of a two-year rent and rates free period is now four years old, would the Minister not agree that it is necessary at this stage to give further incentives in order to attract industrialists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters there.  The first is one of fact.  The advance factory was completed in May, 1973.  The concession could not be four years old until May, 1977. For the record it is a little less than two years old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>One could not give a blanket answer to the Deputy's question because the circumstances vary. For example, there is the question in that area of some cases being more intense than others.  It is correct that the IDA operate on the principle that the greatest effort must go to those cases in which there is the greatest need.  The determination of greatest need is influenced by considerations of alternative employment available.  The factory referred to here is within a fairly short distance of the Courtaulds project at Letterkenny and that concern will take up an enormous amount of labour when it is in production <Col N="1974" /> fully.  That is a relevant consideration. One does not want a blanket solution but solutions in areas of the greatest need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

      <P>The Geological Survey and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards are carrying <Col N="1978" /> out investigations.  My reply refers to &ldquo;a coal-like deposit&rdquo;.  This is not coal in the ordinary sense.  There seems to be a very large amount of inorganic material, of ash, in it.  The question of any viability is a very real one. There is also a suggestion that where it is now found it is there as a result of a slip and did not develop there. They are trying to find the place from where it originally slipped.  Therefore, I do not think one can anticipate investment or a firm decision in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The law does not require that a mark of origin should be shown on Irish manufactured goods on sale in Ireland.  Imported goods which carry a mark that could suggest Irish origin&mdash;such as the name of an Irish trader or an Irish place name&mdash; must, however, carry an indication of origin.  Specifically in relation to clothing imported men's and boys' outer garments, knitted and crocheted clothing and hosiery must carry an indication of origin.  I presume that the clothing to which the Deputy refers either was Irish made or, if imported, did not fall within the categories to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>I referred to imported goods on which there was no country of origin marked, and if the Minister was aware that there was an Irish brand name on them instead.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of matters involved here.  Enforcement is at two places: first, by the customs authority at the point of entry and secondly, there is no routine checking by inspectors of my Department but there is occasional spot checking.  This <Col N="1979" /> is carried out particularly as a result of information or complaint received or where there is an allegation of breaches of the Merchandise Marks Act.  We would be happy to receive this information because this is not done routinely.  In regard to Irish manufactured products the National Development Association have a stylised shamrock which indicates Irish origin.  I would urge Irish manufacturers to use this and Irish purchasers to insist on it because this is a voluntary mechanism of identifying the products.  The core of the answer may be that the products may lie outside the categories in which origins must be indicated.  I will be happy to investigate a particular case if the Deputy would communicate with me.</P>

      <P>An Coimisiún Dumpála announced on 10th January that they had initiated an investigation into the alleged dumping of footwear, textiles and clothing products including shirts originating in certain low-cost countries and invited representations from interested parties.</P>
      <P>In view of the scope of these investigations, I am informed that some time may elapse before the report of An Coimisiún Dumpála can be presented. I am assured, however, that the matter will be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The matter is not as simple as that.  We were faced with the real alternative that if An Coimisiún Dumpála find there is no dumping, the final position is worse than when we started.  In invoking this mechanism one takes a very real risk because the Deputy will be aware that though it is very unsatisfactory, dumping in <Col N="1981" /> its formal sense is very difficult to prove, especially in the case of goods coming from extremely low-cost areas. The decision to invoke the mechanism of An Coimisiún Dumpála is not automatic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say that on next Monday and Tuesday in Brussels I will be having meetings at a high level about it.  Commissioner Gundelach was himself in London ten days ago about them and it is really a matter of how rapidly and how much the British will move.  The position has been made clear both by us and by the Commission.  It is, I think, very much the Commission's opinion, and it is correct, that in contacts between member states on all issues <Col N="1985" /> like this the original contact is made through the Commission and not unilaterally.  That is a very strongly held Commission opinion to which we acceded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No complaints have been received in my Department about recent increases in the prices of meat dishes in hotels.  I should point out that there has in fact been an upward trend in cattle prices over the past few months.  While this would be reflected in the price of meat, cost increases under other heads, such as wages and overheads, would have a more significant effect on the cost of hotel meals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that cattle prices would reflect the price increases in hotels.  We did not notice this decrease when the price of cattle decreased.  Would the Minister like to make a statement on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I can simply say this. When the price of cattle diminishes the price of meat diminishes also, but there is a time-lag.  Last year I called for the pressure of public opinion to keep the fall in the price of meat in line with the fall in the price of cattle. It does not happen as quickly as it should and it takes the pressure of the public to make it felt.</P>

      <P>Representatives of the Federation of Irish Vehicle Bodybuilders were met in my Department in November last to discuss a number of questions concerning the importation of fully built-up bodies for <Col N="1987" /> commercial vehicles.  The present position is that built-up bodies for rigid commercial vehicles come within the scope of the Motor Vehicle Act and may only be imported by registered importers.  In practice the overwhelming majority of built-up commercial vehicles imported by the registered importers are brought in as chassis/cabs only, the bodies being constructed and fitted locally.</P>
      <P>Trailers and semi-trailers for articulated vehicles do not come under the scope of the Motor Vehicles Act and bodies for such vehicles may be imported by anyone on payment of the appropriate duty.  The duties on such vehicles are being adjusted in accordance with EEC commitments.  Reduced duty licences for such vehicle bodies are only issued when it has been established that the vehicle body in question or a suitable substitute cannot be supplied by a home manufacturer.</P>

      <P>I understand that at present imported sulphate of ammonia and high nitrogen compounds are available from suppliers, but that straight nitrogen in the form of CAN is in short supply, despite a 30 per cent increase in CAN production by NET this year.  The shortage is due to a fall off in imports and increased demand on the home market.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the percentage and date of each insurance premium increase for private cars since the 1st January, 1969; and whether the recent motor insurance increases are related to the basic rates which applied in 1969 for commercial and private motor vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase of 17½ per cent in basic insurance premium rates for private cars was sanctioned with effect from 1st June, 1970.  An increase of 10 per cent was later approved with effect from 1st November, 1973.  The recent 1974 increases were allowed in two phases.  Most insurers applied the first phase of 10 per cent from 1st August, 1974.  The second phase of 20 per cent, plus the compensatory increase of 10 per cent designed to compensate for reductions in loadings, has been applied at various dates since 1st November, 1974, depending on the date of implementation of approved loading reduction schemes.</P>
      <P>The recent (1974) increases are related to the rates obtaining before August, 1974, that is, to the 1969 basic rate levels for commercial and private motor vehicles adjusted by the increases in the intervening period.</P>

Their report will be published in a matter of days.

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to his question regarding designation of ingredients on prepacked foods to prohibit inadequate or false descriptions.  As I said in my reply to his earlier question, a false description of the kind he then instanced would be an offence under existing law.  The Food Standards Bill, which I mentioned in my reply to the earlier question, has in the meantime become law, on the 12th June, 1974. It enables the Ministers for Health, for Agriculture and Fisheries and for Industry and Commerce to provide by regulations for standards in relation to food.  The standards to which it is intended to give legal effect under the Act are principally food standards prepared by the EEC or under the <i>Codex Alimentarius</i> programme of the FAO and the WHO, in the preparation of which this country has been participating for some time.  The various <Col N="1995" /> standards as they emerge will be implemented under the Food Standards Act or other appropriate legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education when the Government approved of the amalgamation of national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>When introducing my Estimate on 23rd October, 1973, I gave a statement of policy in regard to the amalgamation of small schools.  This statement was circulated with the Official Report on 12th December, 1974, in reply to a question from the Deputy as to &ldquo;the primary consideration which governs the closure of national schools.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amalgamation of small schools, which had been a feature of the educational policy of successive Governments over the years was given an impetus in 1966, mainly as a result of the valuable OECD, Investment in Education report, which of course refers specifically to Ireland.  It is basically a sound policy from the educational point of view and in its economic aspects.  The implementation of an aspect of policy such as this does not demand specific Government approval.  It is, however, an <Col N="2000" /> element of approved Government educational policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the tabular statement the Minister issued he stated that three-teacher schools could be closed.  I should like an assurance that when the schools are closed in June the Department will not be silent about the matter.  What happens is that they send an inspector in August to tell the people that the school is to be closed.  That happened in my constituency last July and I want an assurance that there will not be a recurrence.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to be rather mixed up about what it is intended to do with regard to the closure of schools.  A school with five pupils has been opened but it appears to be the policy to close three-teacher schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to go into that matter with the Deputy. He explored it at some length on a previous occasion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Deputy to what the Minister said: that the same considerations that apply to one- and two-teacher schools apply to three-teacher schools where there is a declining average enrolment, and where there is the prospect that it will not remain a school of that size.  It does not apply in general to three-teacher schools but only where there is a declining enrolment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The people in my area are worried about the policy of the Department.  Since the Government <Col N="2001" /> opened Dún Chaoin school it seems they have decided to adopt the amalgamation policy not only with regard to two-teacher schools but also three-teacher schools.  I realise it is not the fault of the Parliamentary Secretary but the Minister tried to pull a quick one on me in December when he issued a tabular statement. He knew that he would be questioned in the House if he gave us the information. I want an assurance that three-teacher schools will not be closed until the management and the parents are consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>New schools may be divided into two categories: new buildings in replacement of existing premises which are no longer suitable for use as national schools, and new schools to serve areas of growing population where primary educational facilities do not exist or where such facilities as may exist are inadequate.</P>
      <P>In both instances the primary consideration is that there is in fact a need for a new national school and that, if so, a suitable site can be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the educational interests of the children the provision of new buildings for one-teacher and two-teacher <Col N="2002" /> schools is undertaken only in the most exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The overall primary consideration which governs the building of new national schools in this country is to provide within the resources available the best possible accommodation and facilities for primary education.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>My Department are satisfied that the Killenaule school has sufficient accommodation to meet its short-term needs.  In the longer-term it is proposed to provide new permanent accommodation.  In view of other more urgent building priorities it has not been found possible to proceed with a permanent building development. In addition a decision regarding the accommodation to be provided is dependent on the outcome of a review in 1976 of the operation of the senior cycle which was sanctioned on a trial basis for three years.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances and pending completion of the review in 1976 a meeting with South Tipperary Vocational Education Committee to discuss accommodation at Killenaule school would be of limited value.  If, however, a vocational education committee deputation wishes to see me before completion of the review I would be prepared to receive them.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter on the Adjournment to provide an opportunity of considering the future of these mines bearing in mind their serious financial difficulties and the Government's investment therein.  There was an unfortunate occurrence last night in the Minister's office when a deputation of local workers, there at his invitation, saw him make his exit and leave them with a hearty céad míle fáilte.  It is amazing to think that a socialist should treat honest workers in this fashion.  It is most lamentable.

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>These men came here on a deputation at the Minister's request and, having received them cordially, he made his exit.  The reason these men were here is quite simple. As good citizens and as good workers they are concerned about their future and the future of their families in the Avoca area.  In the past few months they have seen the work force in the Avoca mines drop from 430 to 190 men, and some of those 190 men are still under notice.</P>
      <P>It was no pleasure for them to arrive at this House.  They came here for one purpose only and we, the elected Members for the constituency, met the Minister for one purpose, that was, to vouch for their credibility. They came here to find out from the Minister what the future is for Avoca mines.  Bearing in mind the Minister's exit, one could ask is he the right man to make calm, calculated decisions under pressure, and the pressure last night was minimal, if any.</P>
      <P>We know that the State invested £800,000 in Avoca by means of guaranteed loans and that there was a guaranteed loan of £500,000 for equipment from the French.  Recently there was a guaranteed loan of £300,000 in two parts.  Part one is a Fóir Teoranta loan of £140,000 to offset pressing ESB debts and the balance is £160,000.  I know there was an understanding that this would be on a £1 basis and that this company would try to come up with money from the private sector to the tune of £300,000.  The company are having difficulties even though negotiations are going on at the present moment to secure another partner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are having difficulties because of a clouded situation with regard to <Col N="2012" /> mining.  We have seen the Minister dilly-dallying.  We have seen his failure to make a definite contribution to this important industry by coming to grips with the necessary financial arrangements which we all agree must be most advantageous to the people. There is no certainty here for the investor, and this climate has been created by dilly-dallying.  The industry is in difficulty.  There has been a failure to reach decisions on Tara.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  The difficulty is that the company have been asked to come up with a sum of £300,000 from another partner to see to the future of Avoca mines.  Any group coming in here must look at the overall picture, and the overall picture is not bright.  It is on that score that I raised that point, but I accept your ruling.</P>

      <P>The deputation last night said that the company state that they are aware of 47 million tons of ore capable of being mined.  This is the result of their drilling explorations.  The Minister does not seem to accept these figures. If he does not accept them, why does he not call in his own consultants? Has a survey been carried out of the potential in the Avoca area? The expertise of the Geological Survey Office is available to the Minister.  Why has he not called on them to acquaint him with all the facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These workers are very concerned about their future.  They came here not as union representatives but as a deputation of local workers who have been put off or feel they have been put off for the past three or four months by what they regard as the failure of the Minister to meet their union representatives.  As far as they <Col N="2013" /> can ascertain, the Minister is not refusing outright to meet their union but the time is not deemed suitable to meet them.  This has gone on for three or four months.  Meanwhile, the threat of closure still hangs over the mine and the prospect of it being put on a care and maintenance basis which might be just as expensive in the long run as an injection of capital.</P>
    <P>They have seen their fellow workers laid off: they know that the company, after making profits in two years, reinvested £2 million to make the mine viable.  The people who came here last night were people of standing among their own workers in that they included three shop stewards and one officer with the company. They came here to state the case and to ask the Minister to consider the situation in Avoca mines, to come up with some ideas for them. The Minister knows the circumstances in which they were invited here.  It is known that their anxiety reached such a pitch that they picketed Leinster House.  It is also known to them that they departed on the understanding that a meeting would be arranged.  A meeting was arranged and we, as representatives, a member of the Minister's party, another member of the Government and a member of the other House and I myself accompanied them to see them publicly insulted and humiliated.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of concern.  It relates to the future of these mines.  We know the reason and the circumstances in which they came here and there was no reason for the Minister to make a decision to leave.  Surely he knew after he had given this invitation to the deputation who these people were?  Why then was exception taken?  One can only say that the future of the mines in Avoca does not seem to be in very good hands when the Minister is responsible.  This is no way to treat men who wish to work, who do not want to be made redundant and do not want to have to live off the State, men accustomed to earning their keep.  One man there has a record of 20 years' work in the Avoca area and is a trade unionist. <Col N="2014" /> Another man was introduced as having been 16 years in the area. These men did not make the decision lightly; they gave it great thought and expected when they were received as a deputation an exchange of views and ideas would take place.  Regrettably, another action was taken and this by a Minister who purports to be a person involved in an open Government, an open Administration and, further, a Minister who encouraged another group lately to attack the &ldquo;gurus&rdquo; of a Department and to protest and make demonstrations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>These men came from the Avoca mines, good workmen from the area, solid stock of the county and this is what happened to them.  They made their protest in an orderly, peaceful fashion.  They came here because the future of the mines is in doubt.</P>
      <P>We can be grateful to the Minister for making this money available by means of the guaranteed loan but this will only keep the company solvent until the end of March, I believe. What happens then?  What of the future?  Why were these questions not teased out last night when this deputation came at their own expense from Avoca?  These are the things they wished to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if it is in order to suggest that the Minister should apologise to these people but he should immediately get on the phone to somebody in authority and invite this deputation back.  I have an inkling that this is being done and I hope a definite decision will be taken to meet another deputation and that some clarification of the unfortunate happening of last night will be given, when we had the unfortunate spectacle of a socialist making his exit <Col N="2015" /> from a deputation of four workers and four public representatives.  This, we are asked to believe, is an open Government consulting with all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Where is there a future for the people in Avoca if this is what will happen to them?  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity given to me.  I feel this matter will have to be considered in a broad spectrum because decision will have to be made as regards mining and, certainly, a company like Avoca mines will have to be concerned and involved in these decisions.  What happened was an exhibition of shabby treatment, treatment that I never thought I should witness here.  I have been scarcely two years a Member of the House but I did not think I should see that happen.  One wonders about the future, not alone of Avoca, but of all industry in Ireland.</P>

We have heard a good deal about mining recently but not enough.  We have heard a lot about looking after our own resources.  Here is an example where the State have an opportunity to intervene, where the State has been involved and is intervening.  This could be taken very readily as a criterion for what the Minister may be prepared to do in regard to other situations and how he will handle them.

In the long history of this House there is no record, as far as I know, of a case where the Minister walked out on a <Col N="2016" /> deputation, particularly a deputation of workers.  If he was piqued at the fact that they were demonstrating or protesting this would come very badly from a Minister of the Labour Party. I should like to be satisfied with the Minister's explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues. This Adjournment debate was on the future of Avoca mines.  With characteristic irresponsibility, Deputy Ciaran Murphy tried to turn it into an exacerbation of an unpleasant situation.  I recollect Deputy Molloy in similar circumstances with a difficulty in Galway &mdash;fishing in troubled waters, doing damage, intentionally or unintentionally, a characteristic, irresponsible, wrecking attitude.  In Deputy Murphy's case, replete with&mdash;I understand the word &ldquo;lies&rdquo; is unparliamentary&mdash;with inaccuracies which he knows to be inaccurate, that I suggested the people who came to see me last night were company pawns.  I denied it at the time he said it.  I deny it again for the record.  That is not true and he knows it.  That the deputation came at my request.  The deputation came at the request of public representatives more active in this matter than is Deputy Ciaran Murphy.  His record in the matter of Avoca mines did not bear much scrutiny until yesterday when he saw a chance of doing a little damage and when we had the unseemly spectacle last night, afterwards, of the cheerful, grinning, merry gloating of Fianna Fáil Deputies in this House over the damage they could do with this incident, and we have seen Deputy Ciaran Murphy trying to push it on now.  It is not true that they came at my request.  They came at the request of more vigorous, local representatives and he was brought in with those more vigorous, local representatives as a courtesy which he is now abusing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot even hear the Deputy, but I want to make my speech in my own way in the time available to me.  There was another inaccuracy, before we get to the nub of the matter.  He asked why have I not called in the GSO&mdash;the implication being that I have not.  The implication is untrue and the Deputy ought to be more responsible, even if he is new in the House, than to make implications which are untrue when he could find out the truth by asking, because, of course, the GSO have been and are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could go on with these things. But let me talk about the facts because, on 23rd October, I met representatives of Avoca.  First of all, let me dispose of what happened last night.  Let me be absolutely clear about the reasons and the circumstances. I have had a fairly large number of visits on the matter of Avoca.  I have been continuously involved in the matter of Avoca; indeed, it would be closed by now and I have a letter of thanks from Mr. Kilgour, the general manager, but for my interventions since mid-October. I have had requests from the trade union involved to meet me. I indicated in a letter to Mr. John Carroll that I would meet him.  I said, &ldquo;at an appropriate time&rdquo;.  What I meant by that was that I wanted to have the results of the decision of the Minister for Finance in regard to the extra £160,000.  I wanted to have the results of the investigation of the alleged 47 million tons of ore from the GSO before I could have a fruitful discussion.  I had a letter back on 23rd January, from Mr. John Carroll, acknowledging that I had made that offer.  On the following day I got a picket outside the Dáil from the Avoca workers.  It is entirely their right to picket; it is anybody's right to picket.  I wanted to talk with them about the situation in the mine. When the local representatives asked me to talk to them I was happy to <Col N="2018" /> accede to that request and they came in.  If one reads the text of what Deputy Ciaran Murphy says, one will see he suggested they were instantly put out.  In fact, I have three foolscap pages of notes of a calm and reasonable exchange of views we were in the course of having.</P>
    <P>I am shocked that Deputy Murphy should uphold the action in the way he has done.  I do not think a Minister would do it who has had the experience of having to try to govern.  When talking to the people who visited me I tried to get a clear answer from one of them, from a spokesman, as to why they had picketed.  They did not say it was to raise the matter of the future of Avoca mines, as was suggested by Deputy Ciaran Murphy.  The answer I got was they put the picket on to get in to see me.  Now their union had a letter the day before the picket went on saying that I would see them, and that was an acknowledged letter, &ldquo;at an appropriate time&rdquo;.  The day after the picket went on, not to make a protest&mdash;which is every worker's right and to which I have absolutely no objection&mdash;but to get in to see a Minister they put on a picket.  That is what I was told.  And the whole point of the issue, not an action in anger, not an action lightly taken, is that if we are to have pickets, 24 hours after letters acknowledging the right of access to Ministers from organisations to get in immediately to see Ministers, then the normal rights of deciding these things in a normal, courteous way, disappear and the whole principle of picketing disappears.  After a reasonable and courteous exchange of views&mdash;I emphasise &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;; Deputy Murphy was there&mdash;I am then told, to my total amazement, that the purpose of the picket was to get an appointment. Deputy Brennan has been a Minister and he knows that no Minister can yield to that sort of pressure for the sake of an appointment, for the sake of making a point; for the sake of getting an appointment at a certain time. No, that is no way in which we could carry on governing.  But when it was made absolutely explicit that the purpose of the picket was to get in immediately for an interview, then I <Col N="2019" /> had to say there was no way they could have an interview on that basis. I am, of course, happy to have conversations at the appropriate time, when I have the details I want, with the relevant people, as I have had at every stage&mdash;an exchange of telephone conversations, contacts with senior officials.  We have had an amicable situation about this.  I have Mr. Kilgour, the general manager, on record recognising that.</P>
    <P>The whole point of my feeling that I had to leave was to uphold the principle that a picket may not be used to force admission to a Minister at very short notice, especially in circumstances where I had an acknowledgment already that I had offered them access when appropriate and, &ldquo;when appropriate&rdquo; meant when the major financial decision was taken&mdash; because there is not much use my talking before that; that is not taken in my Department but in another&mdash; when I have some idea of the real validity of this claimed 47 million tons of ore, about which very active work is going on at present.  It would be appropriate to talk then.  It would not be appropriate to talk before that, that fact recognised in a letter from John Carroll of the Transport Union. Then the next day we had a picket just to open a door.  I regret the incident but that is not an admissible principle.   No man who was ever a Minister, who has to try to get through busy days and weeks, could admit that principle.  I am upholding the principle not merely for this Government or for myself but for all Governments at all times.  I hope Deputy Brennan will recognise that, because we could not run a Government in that way.  I regret the incident. But that is the reason and it seems to me to be a good one.  It seems to me to be an overwhelming reason.  However, we are off the real issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We can talk afterwards. <Col N="2020" /> But I want to try to say a few things in the few moments I have for the record.  The Deputy may certainly ask me a question afterwards.  I hope the subject of this debate was not to exacerbate a situation.  I think Deputy Ciaran Murphy did that.  I hope it was youth and it was not his intention, because we have difficult decisions to make about resource allocations.</P>
      <P>We got them £140,000, kept the ESB power on and kept the place running.</P>

      <P>We got another £160,000 now and that will go until 1st March.  That does not solve a problem, which is a very difficult one, because we have resource allocation. How much per worker does one spend on the mine if one could create industrial jobs, in the same area, of a stable kind, perhaps three, four or five jobs for each job one retains in the mine?  That is a difficult decision. Nobody pretends it is not.  I am not reminding people of the history of the mine and perhaps Deputy Ciaran Murphy is too young to know, but he might look back at previous Governments, I am not putting this on the record, about who closed it before and who opened it before, because if I wanted to make politics of it and have a little rub in that area, I could. But I do not want to.  I want that mine surviving, if it is appropriate and economic and that takes hard-nosed economic and geological analysis.  If I am satisfied that the economics about the price of copper are right and if the geology of it is right about the size of the claim for that ore body, there will be no more passionate defender of that mine than I will be.  But I do not guarantee that I will go on putting public money, the yield of all of Irish taxpayers. down that hole if it is uneconomic. If it is uneconomic and the figures come out wrongly, then we face a difficult decision that we can do something much better for that area and for those workers with that <Col N="2021" /> money than to keep something uneconomic in being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the result, not of my opinion or of Deputy Murphy's opinion but of careful analysis which is going on.  When I know the answer to that&mdash;I have bought the time for the analysis to be completed <Col N="2022" /> by the money we got&mdash;we will not throw money down a hole endlessly. I will know the decision to make and either way it will be a clear decision. It takes a little time to do it.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 11th February, 1975.</P>

      <P>Because of the number and variety of questions asked and the fact that the time spent in preparing replies is not recorded, it is not possible to give an estimate of average cost.  Some replies would cost relatively little.  Others would be quite expensive as they can entail a great deal of work in the collection, collation and analysis of material.  Any cost would have to cover a large representative sample and would have to be carried out at the time of preparation of the reply.</P>
