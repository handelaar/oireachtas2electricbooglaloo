      <P>Last night I said that in the present depressed state of the economy and, more particularly, because of inflation and rising consumer prices, it was both necessary and equitable to give the increases in social welfare that this Bill provides. If, as the Parliamentary Secretary claims, he is doing better than just meeting the increases in the cost of living for those concerned, then more power to him and he is to be complimented on doing that.  However, it is the recipients who will be in the best position to judge the real extent of the benefits conferred by this Bill against the outgoings they will have to meet in the present inflationary situation.  I hope these benefits will be advantageous for them but they will be in the best position to judge the advantage.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary is right in his claim and, if he is, I compliment him.  Apart from that, there is very little else that can be said on that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out last night, the full import of the Bill cannot be assessed without taking it in the context of current financial legislation of which it is a part.  Last night I had to recall the main consequences of various financial provisions for the current year and place the Bill in this context in order to assess its true value. To summarise the points that put this Bill in its proper perspective, it is part <Col N="491" /> of the series of transactions that started before Christmas with a resolution imposing taxation by increasing the price of petrol, postal charges and health contributions.  One could regard those as the first part of the budget.  In January we had the budget proper.  It increased taxation and it also gave reliefs.  It was a budget operated in more or less the traditional way and that particular part of the budget now is being implemented by the Finance Bill which gives effect to the taxation already imposed and to the reliefs contemplated.</P>
    <P>Next in sequence was the Capital Gains Tax Bill which will mean more taxation and then there was the Wealth Tax Bill.  This morning we gave leave to introduce the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill and, presumably, that will impose more taxation. In fact, some of the pessimists maintain that it will nullify the granting of reliefs with regard to death duties. Lastly, there is the Bill we are discussing now which provides for increased contributions.  Some of these measures are imposing taxation, such as the provision before Christmas, the Wealth Tax Bill and the Capital Gains Tax Bill while other measures provide reliefs.  It is difficult to balance the accounting but one must consider what the taxpayer is being asked to pay and what reliefs he is getting.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that every salary or wage earner is contributing to taxation but the number of people covered by this Bill is very small.  They are most deserving but it must be stressed that numerically they are very small.  The majority of the citizens are called on to pay the bill and it is as well to realise that all the benefits given by the State ultimately come out of the pockets of the taxpayers, either directly from the individual or through the taxation of corporations and businesses.</P>
    <P>The reliefs given under the Bill will cost the wage and salary earners more in their contributions in stamps.  It is true that these people have got tax reliefs from the Minister for Finance but now they will have to pay more <Col N="492" /> in their social welfare contributions and one is cancelling out the other. It may not be a precise cancellation but while there may be some little relief given in PAYE there will be an increased charge in the social welfare stamps.  It must be asked whether the wage and salary earners have gained anything.  Are the reliefs given a reality or does it mean the State is taking more and not giving a net relief?  That question will be answered by every wage and salary earner in the country and there is no use our belabouring it now in the House.  However, it is a point that must be considered.</P>
    <P>Last night I referred to the reliefs given to industry.  Taxation reliefs are most welcome to businesses at the moment because they will help them to survive economically.  They are socially necessary so that employment may be maintained but here we have a situation very much like the case of the wage earner.  The Minister for Finance granted reliefs in the January budget but in this Bill the Minister for Social Welfare has increased the contributions.  When it comes to the accounting of the individual company or employer, will there be a net gain or a loss?  We can be certain that the reliefs given will not mean there will be a net gain.  I am not going to say the contributions are in themselves a complete loss but it is necessary to subtract the increased outgoings from the increased reliefs in order to consider the net situation. That question can only be answered individually because it will depend on employment content and other factors, but we must query what is the net practical result.  Will it be a gain or a loss for industry?  I fear in particular for the industries we most want to help, those with the high employment content, because I think the net result will be a loss.  I hope I am wrong in this.  There are calculations I could advance to support the argument that it could be a net loss and that the gesture of the Minister for Finance with regard to reliefs is nothing more than a gesture.  The increased contributions required under section 13 to meet the current <Col N="493" /> employment situation will constitute a very heavy item of taxation.  There is no sense in fooling ourselves because certainly we are not fooling anybody else.  Irrespective of whether we call it a contribution or taxation, we are taking money from the wage and salary earners.</P>
    <P>Of course, I admit the Minister has to find the money.  I do not want to play the easy game, to say that we should give the contributions and then to crib at paying them.  I am not doing that.  I am taking this in the whole context of the financial legislation.  The Minister must do what he is doing and therefore the money has to be found. Taken in the whole context of financial policy at the moment I think there is a lot of illusion here and the Government's financial policy is not realistic and is not helping the economy.  I hope that is a model statement from this side of the House which an Opposition Member is entitled to make.</P>
    <P>Is there any real benefit?  The wage earner, the company and business people will judge for themselves.  We took in taxation about £50 million from increased petrol and postal charges before Christmas.  The list of charges in this Bill does not include health and redundancy charges on the stamp.  The cost of the stamp, or whatever way the contribution is taken, is a very sizeable proportion of the wage packet the wage earner gets and the employer will also have to make a sizeable contribution.  It is not a question of taking a few pence, like you take in a collection box outside a church door.  We are now taking substantial sums every week from both employee and employer.</P>
    <P>In relation to the pre-Christmas budget an increase was put on health contributions.  Petrol and postal charges were levied on all economic activities, which are shared by both employer and employee.  We have discussed the budget in which there are reliefs and taxation.  As far as I can sort out my figures something between £45-50 million is taken in taxation.  The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>On the social insurance side, the gross increase in expenditure from the social insurance fund is estimated <Col N="494" /> at £26.6 million to the end of December, 1975, of which £23.7 millions will be met by increased contribution income leaving £2.9 million to be borne by the Exchequer in that period.  The total cost to the Exchequer for the period April to December, 1975, will therefore be £25.3 million.  As I have already indicated, the Exchequer will, in addition, provide £7.1 million towards the cost of additional unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance claims.  The special contribution increase of 31p is intended to provide a further £7.9 million towards the cost of these additional unemployment claims.</P>
    <P>It is extremely hard to do accurate accounts.  The Parliamentary Secretary can correct me if I am wrong but it seems to me, taking those figures, that he will take £23.7 million more in contributions and in addition he will take the best part of £8 million for the special levy to meet additional unemployment claims.  I am at a loss to know if the £7.1 million which he mentions has to be provided or if it is accounted for already in what is taken in the budget.  On top of the £50 million taken in the pre-Christmas budget and the second £50 million taken in the January budget we have the £30-40 million taken now.  It seems in all this operation the taxpayer is being called on to pay a substantial amount this year.</P>
    <P>I now want to say a few words on the economic basis of the Bill, to which I already referred.  If I understood Deputy Hogan O'Higgins correctly she stated that there was a disincentive to a man being employed. The impression I got from what she said was that an incentive was being built in for people not to work.  I just want to recall that point and I will not labour the disincentive for people to work.  The whole approach of this is to tend to depress employment rather than increase it.  This is at a time when we are told a special levy has to be put on to cater for the increased claims because of the current high unemployment level, which, according to the last figure I saw, is 103,000. Everybody in employment has now to <Col N="495" /> be levied.  This is all right socially but it means that there is less money available to pay people in productive work. Employers have to tighten their belts, have to resist expansion and are tempted to lay off people.</P>
    <P>The whole tendency in such an approach is to restrict opportunities for employment not increase them.  It is intimidating enough to find that the unemployment figure has grown to the stage where we have to make such a special provision to finance unemployment benefits but it is more frightening when we realise that the logical consequences of that are that the opportunities for re-employing those people are being restricted by that very measure and that the reliefs which we were told were designed to help industry, to promote employment, are being taken away by the provisions of this Bill, necessary and all as they are.  The net effect is to discourage expansion in employment.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of grave concern for the House, too serious to indulge in political argument as to who is at fault.  We, both Opposition and Government, have to face it as a fact.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to take my remarks in that spirit.  He may ask: &ldquo;What is to be done about it?&rdquo; Having made my point that reliefs have been cancelled by increased taxation, the net result in the present unemployment situation of the financial policy of the Government, as I have attempted to summarise it in the short time available, is to depress employment and to aggravate the current economic depression which I have freely said on this and other Bills has been largely contributed to by factors which no Irish Government can control locally.</P>
    <P>That is all the more reason why we should do all we can to promote economic activity and expansion for employment.  My argument is simply, on a broad national scale, that the entire financial approach of the Government, in the budget and otherwise, has been depressive and not expansionist. I pointed out at some length that the Labour Party in the past co-operated <Col N="496" /> with Fianna Fáil's progressive proposals and that substantial headway was made.  I pointed to the first section of this Bill and I did not do so to get kudos but to try to draw a lesson from history.</P>
    <P>The measures I spoke about were effective because they were subsidiary and ancillary to a positive progressive policy of development and expansion. I do not intend to go into the distant past but I will go back to the collapse of the last Coalition Government in 1956.  They had got into the same kind of economic difficulties.  It was not entirely their fault&mdash;there were the environmental factors that I mentioned. They got into difficulties and Fianna Fáil came into office.  What had we to do?</P>
    <P>First of all, there had to be a positive programme for recovery, followed by two programmes for economic development and expansion, the Lemass programmes of the sixties. They brought this country into the modern era and developed us to the stage that placed us in a position to join the European Community and to be in the position that we were in yesterday, a proud day for all of us.  I am glad we on this side were able to congratulate the Taoiseach and his Government for the events of this week.  Although not taking credit for them, I have to say they were the culmination of a gradual historical process.</P>
    <P>What I am coming to is that the success of social welfare legislation in the past depended entirely on the programmes for development and expansion, what I call the Lemass programmes, because I think all sides of the House will acknowledge his contribution to the economic development of this country in the fifties and sixties. It was that which made social progress possible, because social progress is always based on economic progress &mdash;if the economic basis is not there, purely social action will not result in real benefit or a real increase in wealth or a real raising of levels.</P>
    <P>That is the lesson I want to bring home here at the highest level.  What we lack at the moment, and what must be got, is a progressive policy such as <Col N="497" /> we had after the recession of 1956&mdash; first the recovery and then the expansion on a planned basis such as the late Deputy Seán Lemass implemented, with the able support of his administration and the then secretary of the Department of Finance, Dr. Whitaker.</P>

      <P>I will finish immediately. Having said so much on the Bill, I commend the Parliamentary Secretary to action because otherwise he will be coming back looking for more levies to subsidise more unemployment. Instead of looking for extra money to subsidise unemployment, we should be looking for programmes to supply employment which would relieve the Exchequer and benefit the community at large.  Thank you for your indulgence and I apologise for trespassing on the rules of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I want to assure the House and Deputy Byrne that my intervention will be brief. Social welfare legislation and the Estimates generally attract a large number of contributions demonstrating the concern of all of us for the welfare of the people at large, particularly those in need.  This is what social welfare is all about.  It represents the best yardstick by which one can measure the social conscience of a Government. Progress in social welfare services is made not in response to pressure groups but rather through the genuine social concern of the Government <Col N="498" /> for the people and their problems.</P>
      <P>To that yardstick this Government have measured up very well. They have honoured their commitments to the people and have taken a big step towards redistribution of wealth by this Bill and the package of tax bills which we have been discussing. It can be said truthfully that the increases granted in this year's budget do not just keep pace with the rate of inflation.  They are not merely increases keeping pace with inflation. They are meant to represent real progress in the relative position of social welfare recipients <i>vis-á-vis</i> other sections of the community.  The maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> would satisfy none of us on these benches. Certainly, it would not satisfy me and I am more than certain it would not satisfy the Parliamentary Secretary because the record in social welfare since he took office has been a truly exceptional one.  Since then expenditure has increased from £92 million to £210 million, an increase of 125 per cent, which is nothing if not impressive. Generally, I am not impressed by percentages.  I have always held the view that to apply the same percentage increases to social welfare recipients or wage earners on £10 per week as one would apply to those on £50 or £100 per week is not justice.  But I am impressed by the real widening of the scope of the social welfare code and the improvement, in terms of real money, brought about as a result of the deliberate actions of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am impressed particularly by the introduction this year of a cost of living increase to become effective in October.  That represents a major change in attitude to those dependent on social welfare and serves to keep them in line with other sections of the community, applying to them the norm one applies to people better able to look after their own interests. It is in stark contrast to the attitude displayed towards social welfare recipients over the years, when increases were announced in the budget and became operative only some six months later when price increases and <Col N="499" /> inflation generally had more than taken their toll of the meagre resources of those people.  That is something about which we, when in Opposition, complained frequently. It is heartening to find that the Parliamentary Secretary has improved that situation considerably and we are grateful to him for his sympathetic attitude towards people in the low-income category.</P>
    <P>The reduction again this year of the age limit in respect of the old age pension and the easing of the means test has made life happier for some 156,000 of our fellow citizens, 11,500 of whom are new pensioners.</P>
    <P>We have brought into the social welfare net also adult dependants of non-contributory pensioners.  That was brought about last year and their lot has been made happier as a result of further increases.  One found it difficult to understand why it took so long to realise the existence of those adult dependants and have their needs met.  They are amongst those people whose lot has been made happier as a result of the action of the Government and of the Parliamentary Secretary last year and again this year.</P>
    <P>Substantial increases have been granted also in both non-contributory and contributory widows' and orphans' pensions and, indeed, in the deserted wife's allowance and unmarried mothers' allowances, the latter two allowances having been granted for the first time last year. They represent substantial increases and an improvement in the lot of those people.  The Parliamentary Secretary would be the first to concede that in this area there is no room for complacency.  There remains a vast difference between the living standard of such people and that of the majority of other citizens, indeed that of the majority of two-parent families.</P>
    <P>If that vast difference in the standard of living of one and two parent families is not apparent, very often it is because of extreme sacrifice being exercised on the part of the single <Col N="500" /> parent concerned.  Under the Bill the new non-contributory pensions will be paid at the rate of £14.75 or, if the single parent concerned earns a maximum of £6 per week will bring in a total income of £20.75.  If the pension is a contributory one, the total amount payable will be £15.80, which still falls short of the requirements of the home and family.  I am applying those figures to, say, a widow with two children or somebody in that category.  There is no gainsaying that overheads exist for such people and that none of the benefits or allowances available to older people, such as free electricity, free travel, free television and so on apply to them. I am not advocating that the ideal solution would be to extend such services to them.  Rather am I advocating that the requisite amount of money for such people properly to run a home still has not been reached. We have a long way to go before such people receive justice from their fellow citizens.  Indeed, if one accepts the principle of pay-related benefits, there should be a case for their extension to widows.  I have heard that case made and I think it is a valid one.  It is in keeping with the thought that a wife, on the death of her husband, should be facilitated as far as possible in maintaining the standard of living she enjoyed during his lifetime. I know the Parliamentary Secretary is very alive to the plight of such persons.</P>
    <P>The record of the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary as applicable to women generally, has been a fairly impressive one.  We have had quite an amount of improvements implemented in the social welfare code, as it applies to women, since the Government took office.  We have had the introduction of single women's allowances; for the first time we have had a deserted wife's allowance and an unmarried mother's allowance.  We have had the payment of children's allowances to the mother of the family for the first time, a move which eliminated a great deal of stress and concern in many cases.  For women workers we have had the retention of accumulated title to <Col N="501" /> social welfare benefit on marriage. There has been the continuation of disability and unemployment benefit for the first six weeks of widowhood. Working widows, already drawing money from the social welfare fund, receive only half the rate of benefit when they are ill.  There has been a concession made to them by the abolition of their contribution towards a stamp.  We have had the credited contribution for insured women, on leaving their jobs, to care for aged relatives, provided the aged relative qualifies for a prescribed relative's allowance.</P>
    <P>All of those were recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women, all of which were fairly readily conceded by the Government. There are a few areas outstanding but they are rather more complicated and not as easily implemented as the others I have enumerated.  There is still the special rate of benefit payable to married women which needs to be examined.  Indeed, married women should be treated the same as any other workers.  The special rate applicable to them must be examined. I think that rate should be abolished and the flat one applicable to other workers made applicable to them.  We still have the payment of a housekeeper allowance to single men and widowers, with dependants, during periods of unemployment or illness.  That housekeeper allowance has been extended now to single women and widows. Up to now there appears to have been the assumption that women could provide such services for themselves.  To draw such a general assumption that because one is a woman one can provide such services for oneself is to be discriminatory.  This is an area the Parliamentary Secretary is having investigated to ensure that that discrimination is eliminated as soon as possible.  I do understand that they are complicated issues; were they not they would have been eliminated already.</P>
    <P>The maze of social welfare legislation that exists&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary referred to some 60 Acts and 310 regulations&mdash;makes us realise <Col N="502" /> how involved all of this is and how difficult it is, with the best will in the world, to eliminate some of the glaring injustices which exist and which we have inherited in the social welfare code.  Down through the years we have clamoured for the codification of social welfare legislation.  The only people who are conversant with it are people like ourselves who deal with it from day to day.  It is impossible for the average person, who rarely in his lifetime has occasion to refer to social welfare legislation, to know what his entitlement is.  Therefore we welcome particularly the promise of the Parliamentary Secretary to codify and, we hope, simplify all these Acts and make them more readily acceptable and understandable to all the people.</P>
    <P>In this Social Welfare Bill there is provision for the increase in social welfare contributions.  Nobody welcomes increased contributions but improved schemes must be paid for, and part of the increase this year is to meet a special contingency, and we are heartened by the assurance of the Parliamentary Secretary that this is temporary.  Much of the criticism about contributions must come from those on very low wages, particularly women workers who are still on little more than half the wage rate applicable to their male colleagues although the work they do is very often equal and comparable.  I can understand their criticism about the rate of contribution. The Parliamentary Secretary in his brief referred to contributions proportionate to wages earned by various categories of workers. This is a good innovation and one which I hope will be put into operation without too much delay.</P>
    <P>There are certain benefits to which contributory workers are entitled the improvement of which might mollify those who complain about increased contributions.  For instance, adult dependants of an insured worker are not covered for dental, optical and surgical appliance benefits.  To find that their dependants are not covered for such benefits often comes as a surprise and a shock to many workers. This is a matter which I raised in the House by way of parliamentary question <Col N="503" /> a few times.  If dependants were covered for these benefits insured workers would feel they were getting a squarer deal than at present.</P>
    <P>One question which arises frequently in this House is that of the delay in payments.  If this was something that happened only this year I could probably understand it because the scope of these schemes has been so widened that there is a massive job in trying to administer them.  This complaint has been with us for many years and therefore I do not think I am being over critical.  I do not want to represent myself as criticising the Parliamentary Secretary, because his task is greater than that of his predecessors. However, delays in payments result in a great deal of hardship for the people in need of benefit.  One can imagine that, if a normal week's wages allows for the bare necessities of life, when one becomes sick or unemployed, it is of vital importance to the household that the social welfare benefit be paid regularly.  Yet we have the spectacle of people coming along to us as public representatives saying they have had to wait five, six or seven weeks for payment.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary is doing his best to eradicate this delay, but once again, on behalf of the people who I know are suffering, I would ask him to give this matter particular attention in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>I have a special welcome for the Parliamentary Secretary's plans for the future.  I note particularly his plans for incorporating self-employed people in the social welfare scheme. I know several self-employed people on a very small scale who cannot retire because no social security exists for them.  I also welcome the plans to codify the social welfare legislation.  I know that in the years to come improvements in social welfare will take place on a massive scale.  I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary and all those who are helping in identifying poverty.  It will take a concerted effort to eradicate it completely, an effort not confined to the Department of Social Welfare but involving many other Departments as well: Local <Col N="504" /> Government, Education, Justice and Health.  What causes poverty is very often lack of money but that is not the only cause.  Therefore the Government as a whole must be involved in the eradication of poverty.</P>
    <P>Once again I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on this Bill. I am confident that it is only one of many progressive measures envisaged to improve the lot of the weaker sections of the community.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy de Valera I welcome this Bill.  We have no intention of opposing the Second Reading but certain sections of it may require amendment.  The Parliamentary Secretary said at one time that the Government had concern in this matter.  I can assure him that every Member on this side of the House has great concern for the unfortunate people who have to live on social welfare.</P>
      <P>Were it not for the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department, there would have been a landslide against the Government in the last two by-elections. There was no policy except in respect of two subjects: the candidate and the amount of social welfare benefit being paid out.  I welcome this attitude to social welfare.  The benefits are good but they would be just as good if we were in power.  There are moneys now for social welfare that were not available in the past, and the need for social welfare is greater every day because of inflation.  The Parliamentary Secretary said he has given more than what is needed to meet the increase in the cost of living. But with the increases occurring every other day&mdash;bread now and something else tomorrow&mdash;I have grave doubt that he is only keeping in line with the cost of living and inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope my remarks on the Bill will be constructive.  I have always stood up for the lower income group and I am very worried on one score and I want to make this case particularly in respect of the people in the west of Ireland that I represent.  Many of them in my area are social welfare recipients. Deputy Desmond mentioned slowness but I do not attribute blame <Col N="505" /> for slowness because if every Deputy bothers the Parliamentary Secretary as often as I do and wrote as many letters, the staff in the Department would need to be increased.  I am embarrassed to have to write letter after letter, week after week, on social welfare matters.  This indicates the number of dependants on social welfare. So many in my area are dependent on social welfare that I am very worried.  It is not true that we want to live on social welfare.  If the people in the disadvantaged areas could get jobs or more land, they would prefer it to drawing social welfare.  I think the great increase in social welfare is in respect the small farmers and this is rightly the case because these people cannot exist unless they get it.</P>
    <P>In respect of this type of social welfare I again ask&mdash;and I am tired of asking&mdash;that the Parliamentary Secretary would seriously consider some way of assessing income other than on a poor law valuation basis which is a cruel system in some cases that I meet in my area where you have land valued at about half-a-crown an acre.  A man might have 100 acres of it and he may be able to draw social welfare while on the other hand an unfortunate man may have what is known as &ldquo;landlord's land&rdquo;.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take special note of this.  Long ago when the landlords owned the land of Ireland it was essential to have a certain valuation to get on the grand jury.  Some landlords applied for increased valuations and were successful. This type of land now carries a very high valuation and there can be a very poor person living on a £30 valuation farm.  He is excluded from small farm social welfare where another type of land may carry a very low valuation and the owner, who is pretty well off, is able to qualify for social welfare.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult problem to assess means fairly but certainly the poor law valuation is about the most unjust way of doing so.  We see this demonstrated down the country every other day.  I sympathise with people with poor holdings and high valuations. They are excluded from social welfare and from health cards.  They are <Col N="506" /> the people living in poverty at present &mdash;they can get nothing and must pay for everything while they have not sufficient land to make a decent living. A fair way should be found of deciding who is entitled to social welfare. Again, I emphasise strongly that we do not want to continue living on social welfare.  At present the Government are doing a good and necessary job.  I believe we or any other Government would do the same thing. Between petrol, postage and other taxation an extra £50 million has been raised since before Christmas.  The agricultural subsidies are covered because of our EEC membership and all this is being given out in social welfare.</P>
    <P>I may be old-fashioned, unlike present-day economists.  When I was young I was told that if I could not make ends meet at the end of a year I was going the wrong way.  Now, apparently, it does not matter if, after the year, you are down £90 million&mdash;I believe it will be £125 million this year.  I understood that if I borrowed money for productive purposes it was all right but if I had to borrow to get enough to eat, I was in danger. Apparently, there is that danger at present when we have to pay social welfare but if we are going into debt in order to do so I wonder where it will lead.  Perhaps it is all right but there is a big change in the way economists think today and the way they thought when I was young. Twenty years ago, if you were short a few million pounds you were at danger point.  Now it does not matter apparently and you can go as far as you like into debt.  Nobody seems to worry now if we go into debt for current expenditure but I wonder if eventually somebody will have to worry about it.</P>
    <P>On the question of payments to relatives, this benefit is only paid to the relative if the person is bedridden. Is it not harder for a woman to look after a person who may be very old but is not confined to bed?  A person confined to bed will not fall in the fire.  A young woman who has a husband, or if there is anybody else in the house, cannot get the allowance unless the old person is bedridden. <Col N="507" /> Nine times out of ten it is harder to look after the old person who is able to go around and has to be always watched and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this whole matter.  I find people coming to me asking if they can get an allowance for an aged relative who is not bedridden but is more difficult to look after and I have to tell them they cannot get it.  That provision should be altered.</P>
    <P>There is the question of widows who have no income, except a cache of about £5,000, drawing a non-contributory pension.  I believe that £100 is excluded from that and 5 per cent of the balance so that the person would be entitled to a full non-contributory pension of £7.30.  When that person qualifies for an old age pension all that is excluded is £25 which was known long ago as the &ldquo;funeral allowance&rdquo;.  In 1975 you would not buy one side of the coffin for £25.  The means of that widow is calculated on the £5,000 with deductions of £25 and 5 per cent of so much and 10 per cent of the remainder and she qualifies for only £5 old age pension.  There is something wrong when she cannot get the same amount as she got as a widow.  I am talking of a non-contributory pension. It is a different matter in the case of a contributory old age pension. This is a very serious matter and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give it serious consideration.  The £25 for funeral expenses should at the very least be £100 at present to cope with inflation.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider that very seriously.</P>
    <P>In section 5 the amount for a widow has been increased from £5 to £6 but if a person has investments which yield an interest of £1 a week she does not get the increase.  This section is a disincentive to old people to save a little money.  The £25 for funeral expenses is ridiculous.  Social workers have come to me since this Bill was published and they have made those points to me.  I have been a member of an old age pension committee for 25 years.  A person with <Col N="508" /> savings of £1,400 or £1,500 should be allowed the £6.  This is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>I must now refer to the increase in the contribution.  I have been talking to social workers about this matter too, and I have been told that this will be a severe handicap to a social worker who is trying to get, for example, an ex-psychiatric patient a job. Such people are not well paid but even so employers will be reluctant to take them on because of the increased contribution.</P>
    <P>In my area we go into the problem of social welfare because we are concerned. If there was a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Secretary sitting there I would make the very same speech because I do not believe in playing politics with social welfare.  I have never done that since I came into the House.  I am just pointing out what has been pointed out to me by people who have their fingers on the pulse of the question of social welfare.</P>
    <P>There is another problem in relation to old age pensions.  If a man with say, ten acres of land away from his house, which is not well stocked, applies for the pension the capital value of the land is assessed against him.  If he had it let, the letting value would be assessed against him and that would not be so bad.  If he had it well stocked, the stock would be taken into consideration and that would not be so bad but if it is just there with practically nothing on it the full capital value, with land prices as they are at present, will put him completely out.  We have had cases of this.  This is very wrong.  The capital value should not be taken into account, whatever about the letting value.</P>
    <P>This is how those things work.  Perhaps they may not come to the Parliamentary Secretary's notice but in a debate of this kind we should bring to his notice what we consider to be wrong with the social welfare system. I have been asked by people close to this matter to place those matters before him and get them changed. There is the question of the difference between widows in the assessing of their means; there is the £25 which should be increased to £100; the Parliamentary <Col N="509" /> Secretary should allow people to have at least £1,300 or £1,400 before cutting the £6 to £5 and there is the question of the piece of land, perhaps ten acres, which could deprive a person of the old age pension.</P>
    <P>In addition to the high price of the stamp, we got this morning, from the Minister for Labour, the Redundancy Contribution (Variation of Rate) Order.  This will mean an extra payment too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant but if you rule that it is not relevant I will not quote it.  This increase in the redundancy payment in addition to the price of the stamp will be a hindrance to finding employment for people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is indirectly associated with the type of people we want to get employed. There are only two paragraphs in it. It says:</P>
      <P>An employee's redundancy contribution shall be at the rate of five new pence per contribution week for an eligible male employee and four new pence per contribution week for an eligible female employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With those increased payments employers will be very slow to take people on and I am afraid we will have a good deal of redundancy.  People will think twice about employing these people.  If these social welfare recipients were allowed to take up employment they would not expect a very <Col N="510" /> high wage.  If they offer for employment they are told that, if they are employed, the employer will have to pay for the stamp and pay redundancy. This is putting more and more people on to social welfare.  I am worried about the cost to the Exchequer and to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>All are agreed with the increases given and the allowance for the single woman is a very good thing.  I do not agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that the increase will be more than enough to meet increased costs. It will be barely enough initially but, if inflation continues at its present rate, it will certainly not be enough eventually.  We all know the increases that are taking place at the moment on essential commodities.  I doubt if these increases will compensate for the increases in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out what I regard as snags in our social welfare system.  I hope my figures are correct.  I did some research on the figures.  My figures in regard to the widow are quite clear.  I do not intend to hold up the House because I believe that, whatever impact one makes at the beginning, if one repeats onself too often the inpact is lost.  We welcome these increases. Last year the Parliamentary Secretary described his Government as a Government of concern.  We are also concerned on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>In our organisation we are trying to get the small farmers off social welfare.  A great many are drawing benefit now who were not drawing benefit before.  The people did not want benefit when Fianna Fáil were in Government.  It was easy to live. It is not easy to live now.  I was worried during the by-election to hear a speaker say at a church gate all the social welfare this Government were giving.  This is not the proper approach.  The proper approach would mean there would be no need for social welfare.  I do not think the Government are heading in the right direction.  Some alternative must be sought.  I assure the Minister that any amendments we may table to this measure will be constructive amendments designed to improve the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>One is very pleased to see included in this legislation section 18 which deals with the anomaly which existed in the provision of school meals for children from urban areas attending schools outside the functional area of the urban authority. It is interesting to see this provision included so expeditiously in this measure.  It is most pertinent to the situation on the perimeter of the Dublin metropolitan area.  With the extension of the city many urban areas are now straddling the city boundary and children attending primary schools which are not within the city boundary are deprived of free school meals.  This section is, therefore, most welcome.  There was a good deal of agitation particularly since the building of the Ballymun satellite town.  I think it was this that brought the matter to a head.</P>
      <P>Last week I tabled a resolution in Dublin Corporation in anticipation of this section being passed to ensure that these children will no longer be deprived of school meals.  No Fianna Fáil speaker so far has adverted to this. Apart from Ballymun satellite town with over 3,200 dwellings, other schools in the area will also benefit.  The Dominican Convent in Ratoath Road, which provides school meals for most of the children in the Cabra West/Santry area up to secondary level, will also be able to avail of the free school meal system.  I am sure they will be extremely greatful to the Government for making this possible.  The provision in relation to this is very simple.  It means that if more than 50 per cent of the attendance at the school is from an urban area or from houses administered by an urban authority they are entitled to get school meals.  This is only part of what we are covering in this Bill.  We can also see that attempts are being made to provide for those children as they go through life after school, through married life and right up to the old age pension.  We are providing assistance in some form for every member of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to one or two sections of the Bill I am not in complete agreement with.  I should like to see greater <Col N="512" /> safeguard against abuse contained in the Bill.  One likes to see increased benefits made available in unemployment assistance and sickness benefits but there is a very high degree of abuse in regard to those allowances.  I should like to see the Minister for Social Welfare and the Parliamentary Secretary investigating this.  There are possibilities&mdash;I speak from experience &mdash;of abuse in relation to sickness benefit.  It is very disturbing to see how easy it is for this to happen and the blackmail general practitioners can be subjected to by people who wish to abuse this benefit.  We have always handed out increased allowances to people without putting in some penalty in the case of abuse.  In the United Kingdom they have increased the number of inspectors to inquire into the widespread abuse in relation to social welfare benefits.  We should also do that and we should make sure that the penalty for abuse is sufficient to act as a deterrent.  I believe the possibility of abuse is more widespread in largely populated areas because it is easier to shrink back into the darkness of society than it is in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that the benefits go to the people who need them rather than to people who do not want to work.  Under the present system people can be marginally as well off on unemployment assistance as they would in full employment. Everybody knows this goes on.  There does not appear to be an effort to dissuade those people from abusing those benefits.  If they were prevented there would be more funds available for those legitimately in need of benefit. I hope the fact that other countries have attempted but failed to eliminate this form of abuse does not deter us from adopting a new approach to try to eradicate the abuse in relation to unemployment assistance and sickness benefit.</P>
    <P>In relation to old age pensioners I make a plea to the Minister to investigate the possibility of having a more thorough meals on wheels system for those people.  I should also like to have a more widespread fuel voucher scheme for them.  We all know of the <Col N="513" /> recent huge increases in fuel costs. In an area I know well where the only form of heating is gas the bills of many old age pensioners have gone from £10 to £80 a quarter.  They cannot understand this.  The increase is greater than the increased benefit they are getting from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>During the Arab-Israeli war I asked the Minister for Transport and Power to give special consideration to the provision of oil to the Ballymun housing area where the only form of heating is gas or oil.  The Minister said he would give consideration to this.  The heating is available but the cost is astronomical.  It is part of the structure, whether it is an electric fire or gas central heating.  Those people cannot light a fire and cannot avail of the free turf because they have no place to burn it.  I heard there was a proposal to do away with fuel vouchers. I should like to see a scheme introduced to extend fuel vouchers to the aged, the widows, deserted wives and all deprived families.  These vouchers might be used against fuel bills where the free turf cannot be availed of because the houses have no fireplaces.</P>
    <P>I have here a note I received yesterday with regard to fuel costs.  The person concerned pays £4 for gas and £6 rent and recently he got a bill amounting to £70 for back payment of gas.  In that household there are ten people depending on one man's wages. The previous speaker mentioned that people are less well off nowadays and this is true.  Heating costs have risen very considerably and a person must earn a good salary before he can provide heating for his home.  Many people are unable to pay their fuel bills and the supplies are disconnected from their houses by the ESB and the gas company.  Sometimes the local authorities are involved when oil-fired central heating is concerned.  I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government is present because I am sure he is interested in this matter from the point of view of future planning.  It is no use building houses if people cannot afford to heat them.</P>
    <P>It is quite on the cards that once <Col N="514" /> again people will end up in debtor's prisons.  They may eventually find themselves in Benburb Street or Keogh Square because of their failure to pay for their fuel costs.  In Ballymun and in the high-rise flats in Kilbarrack the fuel costs are part of the rent and if people are unable to pay it they may be evicted and put into substandard accommodation under the control of the local authority.</P>
    <P>This situation is somewhat similar to the approach of the Arabs with regard to oil; it is a form of blackmail and the weaker sections suffer as a result.  In connection with the fuel crisis it might be possible for us to trade livestock or agricultural products with the Arabs for fuel or, alternatively, we should do more to develop indigenous fuels.  Another possibility is that students from the oil-producing countries who come to Ireland for third-level education might have their fees adjusted in the light of the present fuel crisis.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister for Social Welfare for the increases granted but I think those granted to widows could have been somewhat greater.  I am glad to note that if inflation continues at its present rate it is possible that next October people will receive a further increase.  We should emphasise that fact so that people may not be too frightened at the rising cost of living.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that when unemployment assistance or any other aid is given the family of the recipient gets the benefit.  In many cases the wife and the children are forced to go to the home assistance officer for help because the husband has spent the benefit on drink.  It might be possible to devise a system so that a percentage of the benefit is paid to the wife.  Certainly the regulations should be re-examined because at the moment many families are not getting any benefit from moneys paid by the State. Home assistance should be more flexible, particularly with regard to the payment of fuel bills.  The recipients should be told that home assistance is not an allowance to which they are automatically entitiled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> The children's allowances are good. We would like to see food and other subsidies introduced for everyone but we realise that any money we have left over should go to the most fragile section.  Instead of giving subsidies for heating and for food to all sections they should be restricted to the categories mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Opposition will welcome increases in social welfare benefits, but directly related to these payments and increases this year is the failure of the Government to deal with internal inflation which directly affects the value of the benefits.  Social welfare increases are not of much use to the recipient if he is losing the value of the increases in a short space of time because of the effects of inflation.</P>
      <P>In this sense, the Government's policy can be seen to be operating against the interests of the social welfare categories.  Therefore, this Government are becoming known as that which rested on inflation.  The transfer of the increased cost of the stamp to the employers and employees at a level of £6 million in this year is a hidden tax form.  It is a rather frightening situation that a Government would impose in the budget a tax of this nature on employment and development in order, in effect, to cover up their own extravagance and their failure to balance their own accounts.</P>
      <P>As a result, we find the Minister for Social Welfare saying that they are increasing social welfare benefits when the real position is that the Government are depending more and more on the industrial side of the economy while their own policy is putting people out of employment.  It seems to me that the eventual outcome will be similar to that in undemocratic countries where consumers pay more and more for goods than they have money to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real policy of the Government is inflationary and determental to the interests of those depending on social welfare payments, because if the value of such payments is to be maintained the Government will have to face up <Col N="516" /> to their failure to provide adequate means to reflate the economy.  This is directly related to social welfare benefits because, lacking a determined policy to reflate the economy so as to keep even those currently employed in their jobs so that a proportion of their earnings will contribute to the support of the social welfare categories, in effect the Government, simply by increasing social welfare payments, are merely getting involved in a vicious cycle in which the recipients, in three to six months, will be back where they started.</P>
    <P>That is the real dilemma facing the Government, caused by their budgetary system which has lowered the value of social welfare payments to the recipients.  As far as one can see, inflation is prevailing at a higher level. This is not just an Opposition comment. It has been said in the past couple of months by a number of competent European people that we have been failing to deal with our internal inflationary situation, the part for which the Government through their fiscal policies are responsible.  In so far as the Government have failed and are failing to provide a reflationary input into the economy they must be held responsible for the effects of inflation on social welfare beneficiaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, with one exception I should like to thank the Deputies who contributed for the constructive and thoughtful way in which they discussed the Bill.  The exception is Deputy Dowling who came in like a volcano and was just as constructive.  If I were Fianna Fáil Whip I would see to it that my Deputies came in and kept to the script that was provided for them. Deputy Dowling did not contribute very much to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, we had some thoughtful, constructive comments, particularly from Deputy Andrews whom I take this opportunity to welcome on his first appearance as spokesman for social welfare.  I should also like to take this opportunity to express appreciation of his predecessor, Deputy Faulkner, whom I always <Col N="517" /> found to be constructive and courteous in the dealings I have had with him.  Deputy Andrews, as many Opposition speakers did, welcomed the Bill.  They welcomed the provisions under which substantial increases are being given to the various categories catered for.  They also welcomed the element in the Bill that I am particularly pleased to see there, the innovation of a review of these in October to ensure in this time of inflation that social welfare recipients of benefits and assistance will maintain the full value of the increases provided in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some doubt&mdash;I am not sure whether it is as a result of political scoring or misconception &mdash;whether or not the increases granted in the Bill constitute a genuine increase in the standard of living of the beneficiaries.  I speak now not of my own opinion but of a statistical fact published by an impartial source giving a true picture of exactly how much social welfare recipients have benefited.  It is not merely compensation for an increase in the cost of living.  There have been substantial benefits granted and there have been increases in the standard of living in recent times.  If one examines the cost of living increase from July last year to April this year, one finds it amounts to 15 per cent.  In July last there was an across-the-board increase of 18 per cent granted to social welfare recipients. This Bill provides for an across-the-board increase of from 21 per cent to 23 per cent.  One does not have to go into the realm of higher finance, as did Deputy de Valera, to realise that on the basis of those factual figures there has been a substantial increase in the standard of living of those people.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for one moment that many people in receipt of social welfare benefits&mdash;and particularly assistance&mdash;are, as yet, adequately provided for.  I realise there is quite a substantial difference between the family who have to live on social welfare benefits, or particularly on assistance, and another fortunate enough to have the main breadwinner earning a proper industrial wage. <Col N="518" /> There is a very substantial difference between the standards of living of those two types of families.  It is wrong and dishonest to suggest that there has not been substantial improvement, even if there is room for further improvement, which undoubtedly, there is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews and others posed some questions to me with which I shall try to deal.  Deputy Andrews spoke about the role of various voluntary organisations, the desirability, indeed the need, to support those voluntary groups engaged in such work and I agree fully with him in that respect.  Over the past 18 months or so we have endeavoured to involve voluntary organisations to a much greater extent than heretofore; indeed, to try to relate and co-ordinate the activities of statutory bodies and voluntary organisations because, if we are to be successful in attaining our goal and the direction in which we wish to progress, it is essential that the community and people be involved and contribute towards their attainment. As yet, unfortunately, there does not seem to be full realisation on the part of some people, and indeed on the part of some people in this House who contributed to the discussion on this Bill, of what the actual facts are with regard to certain people within our society.  There seems to be a reluctance which I fail to understand, or a refusal, to see what is so obviously around us would we but take the trouble to open our eyes.  In fairness, I should say that most of that lack of realisation seemed to be on this side of the House rather than on the other.  Deputies who can stand up and say that in their opinion there is no such thing as real poverty in our community bewilder me.  I cannot understand them.  I cannot understand how any thinking person would not realise that not only have we poverty but we have it in fairly serious proportions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews asked the number of people who will benefit under this Bill.  The total number of adult beneficiaries is 498,100; adult dependants 140,900, child dependants 282,100, giving a total of 921,100 persons, plus <Col N="519" /> 656,800 children's allowances.  Excluding children's allowances the number of people who will benefit from the increases provided for in this Bill is approximately 30 per cent of our population.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews and other speakers mentioned the increase in the cost of the insurance stamp, implied that it was a tremendous burden, would disrupt the whole economy of the country and in fact constituted a crippling increase on workers.  Were one to stray into this debate with no knowledge of the social welfare scheme or previous Acts, one could be forgiven &mdash;particularly having listened to Deputy de Valera&mdash;for thinking there never had been an increase in the price of the stamp, that this was an innovation, that the Government were, for the first time, increasing the price of the stamp.  The implied suggestion that this was a new departure was ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Over the years the practice has been that the budget is announced on budget day by the Minister for Finance. He enumerates the various increases granted, giving some details of the social welfare increases provided in the budget.  The amount of stamp contribution is a matter for this Bill which gives legal effect to the provisions of the budget.  Deputy Dowling suggested that there was a con game being engaged in; that last January the Minister for Finance would not state what was the price of the stamp, that we were engaged in this con game on the whole Irish nation.  Had Fianna Fáil been in the position where they could determine when the price of the stamp was to be made known to the Irish people, I wonder would they have done it three days before the by-election in Galway.  Most certainly not.  We had nothing to hide about the price of the stamp.  The normal procedure was operated and the only departure that I could possibly see was that we announced it and circulated the Bill with all the details in it before the by-elections, because, be quite sure of this, in the field of social welfare we have nothing to fear from the electorate, including the price of the stamp.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> However, I am not suggesting for one moment that the financing of the whole of the social welfare services is satisfactory.  In fact, this system has grown up over the years without any serious thought having been given to it.  Social welfare over the years has been used as a political expedient and there has been no planned approach. No one has sat down and looked at the whole sphere.  No one has determined what we want to provide and what steps are necessary in order to provide it.</P>
    <P>I questioned the financing of social welfare in the Estimate speech last year.  As far as I know&mdash;and I have done a considerable amount of research into it&mdash;the first time it was ever questioned was on that occasion. I have again raised the matter of financing in introducing this Bill.  We have started an investigation and examination into the whole financing of both social welfare and health services. Deputy Eileen Desmond mentioned this morning&mdash;and I agree with her&mdash;that if you have a flat rate of contribution, the lower paid workers in our society must come off second-best. I do not believe that the way we are now financing it is the most fair and equitable that we can devise.</P>
    <P>When you come in and find something that has been established and, apparently, accepted over long years, it is not possible to tear that down and do away with all the elements in it that you do not like, that you do not think are right, unless you want to be totally destructive.  It is necessary to put something in its place, to build a proper structure, before you tear down the old one.  We are in the course of doing that, and I shall refer to that a little later.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews also asked about the operation of the Poverty Committee and wanted to know what was happening at EEC level and what was happening here at home.  As the House knows, the Poverty Committee was formed of very eminent people, people who had established a reputation over the years for their concern and their knowledge in this field.  I should like to take this opportunity of thanking those people for the very <Col N="521" /> dedicated way in which they have gone about their work.  All of them are very committed.  All of them have very many duties to perform other than that, but they have given a very large part of their time and talents towards devising schemes which will be to the benefit of the people who fall into that category.</P>
    <P>That is at the home level, but irrespective of what happens in the EEC, the committee will go ahead with the operation of four schemes, and they have been allocated £200,000 to enable them to do that. We are very hopeful that the schemes will get the backing of the EEC.  We have the approval of the Commissioner, Dr. Hillery, and I should like to express my appreciation to Dr. Hillery for the work he has done and the interest he has shown in relation to poverty schemes at EEC level.</P>
    <P>The schemes the committee have devised&mdash;three of them have been submitted to the Commissioner&mdash; are: (1) to monitor the effects of the revised Home Assistance Bill which will come before the House in the near future; (2) a campaign about welfare rights to ensure that everyone knows what their entitlements are under the various Acts in the previous social welfare and social services generally, and to ensure that they can take up these benefits with the least possible difficulty to themselves; (3) community action; and (4) the promotion of social service councils.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that these schemes are going ahead irrespective of the decision of the EEC, because the Minister for Finance has provided sufficient money for the operation of four of these schemes.  But I am hopeful that in June, at the next scheduled meeting of the Ministers for Social Affairs in Brussels, approval and ratification of financial assistance in the operation of these schemes will be obtained.  We believe this Irish initiative will be beneficial not only to many of our people but to the people of the Community and, indeed, to the Community itself.  I think it is fair to say that it lacks the human face that <Col N="522" /> was talked about at the Paris Summit.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have commented more or less on pay-related benefits and in recent months I have noticed very much an image coming across of the unemployed as a huge number of layabouts who do not want to work and will not work if work is offered to them.  Unfortunately, this image was portrayed in the House and to some extent in the media.  I recall a particular item during a news broadcast on television when a gentleman, who was described as a leading industrialist, claimed and gave figures to bear out his statement, that a particular worker was better off financially not working than if he were working.  When I examined those figures and made the appropriate calculations it was quite clear that the figures given and the assertions made were totally inaccurate.  But once something like that is publicised it is nearly impossible to get the true picture across.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan </NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey </NameTxt>
      <P>If these people would take the trouble of examining the pay-related scheme they would see that there are safeguards which make it impossible for the situation to arise which they claim is widespread.</P>
      <P>I did not agree with some of what Deputy de Valera said&mdash;indeed I have completely opposite views in some cases&mdash;but I should like to say that his was a serious contribution of the type I like to have.  To a large extent, we have had it in this debate and it is necessary in regard to social welfare if we are to achieve what we want to do in this area.  There is no way in which poverty can be eradicated unless the people first face the fact that it exists and to a considerable extent and accept that it cannot be solved unless the 80 per cent, approximately, who are fortunate enough not to experience poverty conditions are prepared to play their part and not merely give lip service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> I heard poverty discussed from Fianna Fáil benches in a serious way for the first time during this debate. That is a very encouraging sign. Deputy Andrews assured us that Fianna Fáil are about to produce an extensive policy document on the whole area of social welfare, particularly in relation to poverty.  I very much welcome that development, belated though it is, because I did not discover or invent poverty; it was there and has been there, and it has grown because of the operation over many years of our social and economic system.  The problem can never be solved by sweeping it under the carpet and refusing to acknowledged its existence.  If we are to succeed in solving it, we must first ensure that its existence is acknowledged and try to get the commitment of the community as a whole&mdash;not excluding workers who are in relatively much better circumstances.  Some of the double talk on the matter of poverty &mdash;Deputy Andrews cited the Simon Community&mdash;reminds one of the itinerants, or indeed, the Simon Community; everybody agrees with the work that is being done and pays lip service to it; they talk of the dedicated and devoted workers but their attitude is : &ldquo;By God, do not put them near me.&rdquo;  That is the public attitude which we have seen over and over again. That must change.  We have a responsibility as a society to the less fortunate and we must live up to it.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the point, an old time socialist in the 1930s was talking about socialism and saw a man listening at the back of the crowd.  This man did not look very prosperous and the socialist speaker said : &ldquo;Tell me, friend, if you had two houses would you begrudge one to a neighbour?&rdquo;&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said the man.  &ldquo;If you had two bicycles, would you begrudge one to a neighbour?&rdquo;&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the man.  &ldquo;If you had two greyhounds would you give one to a neighbour?&rdquo;&ldquo;Not likely,&rdquo; said the man.  &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the speaker. &ldquo;You would give one of your two houses or one of your bicycles.&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the man replied, &ldquo;but I have <Col N="524" /> two greyhounds.&rdquo;  That seems to be the attitude of a large number of our people&mdash;they are prepared to solve the problem at the expense of somebody else.  It cannot be done like that; It must be done by those who have a little more being prepared to give something.</P>
    <P>It is not fully realised&mdash;I am confirmed in that belief by some of the views expressed here&mdash;how pay-related benefit and, indeed, unemployment benefit in general operate.  Personally, I am very glad that I was associated with the introduction of pay-related benefit because it is very closely linked with poverty in this way.  There are two types, the people who are permanently unemployed and others who because of periodic, economic difficulties become unemployed, are employed again and again become unemployed.</P>
    <P>The average worker spends what he earns on his wife and family providing a reasonable standard of living for them but very few, if any, are able to put by money week by week.  If that worker is hit by unemployment, as many are now hit in this country, the family is immediately faced with severe difficulties which force them to go into debt.  I have seen people unemployed through no fault of their own for prolonged periods and they and their families were put into the poverty-stricken category from the beginning.  The poverty lasted, if the unemployment was prolonged, for a very long time and it took a long time to recover and repay the debts accumulated during unemployment.</P>
    <P>Pay-related benefit does not give a worker more than he would get if he were working but it keeps his head above water and keeps his family in reasonable comfort during that prolonged period up to six months.  It also saves him from the situation of being in debt for two or three years after resuming employment&mdash;and I have known such cases.  Before people condemn or distort the working of the pay-related benefit scheme and its effects they should think very carefully and examine for themselves how it operates and what it is designed to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> Social welfare has grown up in a very haphazard way, with bits put on here and there.  Undoubtedly, some moves were dictated by immediate and obvious needs and some by political expediency but I believe no serious consideration has been given to the overall structure and overall operation. In this country we have to face many difficulties that are not shared by other EEC members in the social welfare and social security area.  For instance, we have a very large number of self-employed people who have no social welfare cover.  They amount to 31 per cent in Ireland compared with 7½ per cent in Britain.  That 31 per cent poses a very serious difficulty in trying to create an all-embracing comprehensive social welfare system. Some of them are not covered by PAYE&mdash;actually none of them.  Their incomes fluctuate.  Some have more than one job but when it comes to cover we find there is an element missing and that is the employer.</P>
    <P>We have also considerably more people in the non-active age groups &mdash;that is to say under 14 years of age and over 65 years of age&mdash;than many other countries.  Our percentage in these categories is 42 per cent compared with 36 per cent or 34 per cent in some other countries.  That posed great difficulty in trying to structure a comprehensive social welfare system but I believe we are now on the road to achieving that.  If one looks at what has been done, what we are in the course of doing and where we hope that will lead us eventually, one will see that this Government on coming into office sat down and made a serious survey of the whole area of social welfare and, having done that, decided first of all what was wanted, in what direction it should go and what steps had to be taken in order to get there.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the first phase one sees that the most immediate need was increasing substantially the rates of payment to recipients.  That undoubtedly has been done.  The second essential and urgent step was to extend the coverage.  We did that by abolishing the income limit, by bringing in such people as unmarried mothers, <Col N="526" /> deserted wives, prisoners' dependents and single women; we did it also by lowering the age for qualification for old age pensions.  We reduced very, very substantially the means test which operated for qualification for many social welfare benefits.  Those immediate actions which we took in the first, second and third budgets have brought a large number of people within the scope of the social welfare system.  This has been a very significant start to getting where we want to go.  At the moment we are trying to deal with the reform of the home assistance scheme of which Deputy Andrews was very rightly critical.  I agree with him because I believe the way the home assistance scheme operates at the moment is a reflection on us who call ourselves a Christian society.  I am glad in the very near future a Bill will be brought into the House to reform the operation of the home assistance scheme.  That will be a very major contribution towards the reform and the development of a comprehensive social welfare and social security scheme.</P>
    <P>I referred to pay-related benefit which a person can now enjoy if he is unemployed or sick but we are also in the course of trying to introduce a system of pay-related pensions for the self-employed.  As I stated earlier, a discussion paper will be introduced in the middle of this year on these two aspects of further development of the service with a view to putting before interested people and groups various alternative ways of catering for those obvious needs.  I emphasise it is a discussion document.  It is one which the Government will put before the people.  We have already invited many interested persons and groups to make submissions on these subjects. When the paper comes out we hope it will give rise to constructive discussion in those two areas which will enable the Government to proceed with legislation along the lines that would be most beneficial to the maximum number of people.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies very understandably commented on the very complex nature of Bills dealing with <Col N="527" /> social welfare.  I said in my opening remarks that not only does it provide great difficulty for a Deputy trying to do research in order to make a constructive contribution on legislation which comes before the House but it is the cause, in my opinion, of a lot of hard, laborious, non-productive, time-consuming work for the officials of the Department who could be far more usefully employed in other areas.  It also provides a great deal of difficulty for the very many people who, in a voluntary or in a professional capacity, are engaged outside the Government service in this particular area.</P>
    <P>In the Department we have initiated work to try to correlate the various laws and regulations covering this area but as Deputies who have any knowledge of this matter will appreciate it is a very long, complicated and difficult task.  There is no question of this consolidated Bill being produced next week or next month.  We will be extremely fortunate if we have it this time next year.  However, I can assure the House it will be proceeded with as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>We hope with the work that has been done, which I have outlined, the work under progress at the moment in relation to home assistance, self-employed pay-related pensions which will be completed in the not too distant future, as well as income-related pensions and insurance for the self-employed, there will be a new and more equitable financing system for social welfare.  Work is in progress at the moment on that aspect.  We hope to move towards the creation of a single assistance system.  I believe with those developments we can have a comprehensive approach.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I appeal to Deputies and other interested parties to realise if we are to build the type of society which we could justifiably be proud of, with regard to how we cater for our old, sick, injured and deprived, there must be a knowledge of what the actual situation is and an acceptance of the realities of that situation.  There must be a commitment.  I can assure the House that a political will exists in this Government to eradicate this <Col N="528" /> evil from our society.  I sincerely hope every Member of this House will give this the necessary support, not only by going through the lobby in divisions but by ensuring that there is a commitment among the 80 per cent of our people who do not belong to this particular category.  It is undoubtedly a difficult task to eradicate it.  I think we have managed to alleviate it to some extent.  Even though it is a long and difficult task there is no question but that it can be done but it can only be done if we are committed to doing it.</P>

      <P>We are entirely in favour of the pay-related scheme but in the nine months up to 31st December, 1974 £8 million was collected under the pay-related benefits scheme and a sum of £3 million was paid out. I asked what happened to the £5 million or what is being done with the balance that has not been spent.  What figure would the Parliamentary Secretary consider a minimum standard at which people might live, in other words, the poverty line?  I do not necessarily expect the Parliamentary Secretary to have the figures off hand but if he has, perhaps, he would answer those two questions.</P>

      <P>I do not know what it is so I would have to examine that first.  With regard to the question of the minimum income, that is a very serious question and I know it was asked in a very serious way.  One of the great defects I found in Social Welfare when I went into it was that there was absolutely no provision for research within the Department.  We could not undertake research in any field.  There was not one penny provided under any heading.  We have now managed to set up and get finances for the operation of a development research section which can undertake research.  This is one area into which I believe we could very usefully do research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area in which we are doing research is to find out how effective are the benefits that are already being provided in certain areas and for certain <Col N="530" /> categories.  It is not possible for me to give the Deputy a figure of what constitutes the poverty line.  Some people have attempted to do it.  I personally do not think there has been any scientific approach to establishing the proper figure but I believe we are now equipped and financed in the Department to undertake this type of research.  The lack of it in the past was in no small way responsible for what was the rather haphazard development of our social services over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a lot of research done outside the Department over the years and there is quite a large volume of literature on the subject.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I had covered the interests we have in Europe and the advantages we have there.  Since then some major factors have come to light which compel me to go back on some of them. The agreement that was reached here over the past few days, whereby Britain has succeeded in getting an extension of the time for the purchase of agricultural products from New Zealand, leaves us in a worrying situation in view of the fact that the British market has meant so much to us in the past and must still be one of our major markets if Britain remains within the Community.  It is unfortunate that bigger members of the Community can bring pressure to bear and do what suits their own interests.</P>
      <P>We experienced difficulty when Germany and other countries were allowed to purchase meat from countries outside the EEC and this affected our cattle trade.  We will have to keep a close watch on our imports from Britain because much of the material comes from countries who have not the same kind of labour conditions as we have here.  We must be realistic about the situation.  As we are in the EEC we should be able to get all the benefits of membership.  We should impress on member states that this kind of back-door entry of materials and goods is not in the best interests of the Community or of our country.  We must not forget that we wield a quite considerable influence in the Community and we should not hesitate to bring this matter to the notice of the other member countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disappointing that the money we will get from the regional fund will not be given directly to the fishing industry and to help turf production. This kind of aid would give maximum help in an area where employment is badly needed.  More important, it would <Col N="532" /> give employment to people who are not able to work in industry; in this connection I am referring to middle-aged people who have always been engaged in outdoor work.  It is vital that these people be given employment in their own environment and in the kind of work they are used to and any money we get from the EEC should be allotted for this purpose.  Earlier this year I attended a meeting of the central development committees in Athlone and I was amazed to hear the agricultural experts from Brussels who attended that meeting.  The bulk of the FEOGA funds were channelled into projects for vast milking parlours, for concreting big yards and for huge grain silos.  We are getting these funds because of the underdeveloped areas along the west coast but the interests of the people in that area are not being considered.  The Government should urgently consider this question.</P>
    <P>I understand that out of the entire FEOGA funds only a small amount has been allocated for a pier at Caherciveen, minor improvements have been carried out to a pier in Valentia, a small sum of money was allotted to County Clare and a further amount was given to a fish processing plant in Dublin.  That is the extent of the benefit the west got from the fund.  We hear a lot of talk about development by various spokesmen; they tell us they are trying to help the western areas but nothing practical is being done. The money is being channelled to other spheres.  Perhaps the people of the west are somewhat to blame because they have not applied pressure on the Government. In the last 50 years they have given up hope of being helped to any extent.  We should try to ensure that they get a decent livelihood and that those who have emigrated are given the chance to return.</P>
    <P>If we had anything to gain from the EEC it was the development of areas such as the west.  I am given to understand that a director of the regional development organisation in Brussels was brought to this country recently by the Cork Chamber of Commerce &mdash;I think the Tralee Chamber of Commerce were involved in this also. The official came to Dublin and was <Col N="533" /> received by the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Finance.  Afterwards he went to Cork and was taken by the chamber of commerce around Cork harbour and was also taken to the vicinity of Kanturk to see the underdeveloped areas.  Nobody would hold that Kanturk is an underdeveloped area.  It is quite convenient to Cork and there is full employment there, the bulk of the people being employed in the city of Cork.</P>
    <P>A German gentleman flew in.  He visited Connemara but apparently nobody told him about the conditions that obtain in most of County Kerry, in Clare and in west Cork.  This has been the grievance for a long time. For instance, there was a fishery meeting in Dublin during the week but the people who should have been there were not and we had no support.</P>
    <P>Going back to the German's visit to Cork, neither Cork nor Kerry County Councils were informed of his visit and the Cork Regional Development people&mdash;I am a director of the board &mdash;knew anything about his visit until he was on his way out.  The secretary of the development board told me he knew nothing about his advent.  I cannot understand how the Departments of Finance and Industry and Commerce did not inform us of his visit.</P>
    <P>The Tralee Chamber of Commerce have been trying to get money for the development of Fenit pier and Farranfore airport.  I cannot see the logic in having the pier and airport developed before we have the means to develop the production that will make them viable.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs is here and I hope he will take a particular note of what I have been saying.</P>

I came into this House to try to improve the lot of the people among whom I live, to try to bring about the day when they can get work in their own areas.

I managed to get three substantial industries for my own town and I have tried to get development beyond it as well.  We have a large number of middle-aged people existing on the dole who are all the time looking for productive work.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion I explained that turf production can be a major factor in our balance of payments situation.  It is a different proposition now from 1942-50 because of improved machinery.  There is a very useful portable machine which has been used in Cahirciveen.  It has been hired out in Roscommon.  There is a vast area of bogland in Connemara, Mayo, mid-Roscommon and Kerry which, if developed could yield up to 2 million tons of turf, the equivalent of 500,000 tons of coal.  Coal is being sold at £40 per ton and the turf we could put on sale at £8 per ton&mdash;excellent hard turf&mdash;would make turf production an excellent business.  Many people in my area who had installed oil burning equipment have now gone over to an excellent new turf and wood burner. There will be an excellent market for our turf in many areas as far east as Mullingar and Athlone.  Apart from providing an excellent native fuel it would save us the worry and concern of having to find currency to pay for oil and fuel imports.</P>
      <P>The turf production machine I mentioned extracts 18 per cent of the moisture.  In former days, in the weather conditions we have, it took three to four days to extract that amount of moisture.  Once 18 per cent has been removed the turf dries very quickly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where some of the money should be going.  Our <Col N="535" /> bog roads and drains have been left unattended for 20 years.  The message I want to get across is that if some of this money were set aside&mdash;and I think this is the intention&mdash;to develop our natural resources, which would have a large employment content, that would be a very worthwhile exercise.</P>
      <P>May I revert again to give an illustration of what I saw and studied in Cahirciveen?  A young lad there came home from England six or seven years ago.  He bought one of those turf machines to supply the ESB station in Cahirciveen and for the workers there.  He had as many as 75 men employed on and off for a period of six months.  That was a very useful industry and afforded some workers the opportunity of getting something for their stamp money.  They were men who would normally have been on the dole.</P>
      <P>We do need money and I raised this matter, in writing, with the Minister for Finance before in an endeavour to get separate induction money into the county councils, if necessary, with which to open up the drains, bog drains and streams and have roads resurfaced.  It does not take a large amount of money to resurface a bog road but a certain amount has to be expended each year to keep it passable. That was the experience we had during the war when every year there was expended £50 or £100 to strengthen the weaker parts of the roads.  Possibly we are too late to have it implemented this year but there is a great future for employment in the areas most in need of it and for the people who can undertake it.  It saves the payment of unemployment benefit, gets such people into the type of healthy employment they need, giving them the feeling they are serving a purpose in the community and that they do not have to go with their hands out to the labour exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There does not appear to be any overall co-ordination between the different Departments working towards development.  Much of the energy and ability being expended is wasted by overlapping of Departments or through gaps between them not being filled.  In the past when we were <Col N="536" /> trying to develop our energies in order to get the good things of life perhaps the &ldquo;stop/go&rdquo; method was necessary in that step by step development.  But today we are a viable country, except for the underdeveloped areas of the west.  But there is no co-ordination between the various productive Departments which should obtain in our present position.  In order to pinpoint this I might say that four or five years ago a substantial grant was given for the development of the pier and harbour in Cahirciveen.  The Board of Works were handling the matter but, for some reason, they were unable to get started within that financial year.  By the time they got round to doing it the following year, the costs had increased considerably. We had to go back to the Departments concerned to have the increase santioned, with Kerry County Council contributing, and by the time all that had been done again the Board of Works were not ready to commence work.  That had the result of delaying the work a further year.  Now, after four years, we are still in that position.  If I might use a local Kerry term: there has been no stroke struck in the start of this work in Cahirciveen. In my younger days when somebody referred to a project that went on too long, getting nowhere, they would say: &ldquo;That is going on as long as Cahirciveen church.&rdquo;  It took many years to build and the steeple intended for it was never built.  I am afraid we now have a good competitor in Cahirciveen pier.  At present it looks as though it will be going on and on because, wherever the fault lies, it is taking so long to make a start, when they are ready, the costs will have gone haywire again.</P>

      <P>I am not pin-pointing Cahirciveen, as such.  I am trying to make the case that there is no co-ordination between the Departments involved in development here. If some Department is found unable to stand up to its commitments, whatever may be the reasons, it must be within the power of human ingenuity to have it solved.  If there is a Department not fitting into modern progress, put it out of the job altogether and get somebody else to do it.  By way of illustration I pointed out that four years ago we passed the moneys for Cahirciveen harbour works and still nothing has been done.  That will remain the position unless there is a change of approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with the political aspects so much as the facts.  I have given my time to the country since my very early days by coming into this House.  Indeed, I have met with many frustrations in my time.  Had I known what I would be up against perhaps I might never have come in here but I am not sorry for having done so.  I think I have succeeded in doing the job I set out to do in my immediate area.  I try to do my best for Kerry, and in so doing, I feel I am doing it for the country as a whole.  I am following up the question of getting Valentia harbour developed. It is one of the finest fishery harbours in Europe.  In years to come we could have employment there for 5,000 people and have exports out of that port valuing £20 million, or anything up to that, per annum of fish products. <Col N="538" /> I hope to see that at least on the road to development before I step out of this climate altogether.</P>
      <P>Those are my ambitions and I know them to be possible of achievement.  I have followed up the fisheries interest throughout Europe and have seen the way people work.  We have the ability, brains and energy to do it here.  That is a wealth we should be bringing in. As I said before, we get excited about the millions of pounds worth of oil we are supposed to have off the Cork coast which will be brought in at colossal cost.</P>
      <P>We have a continuing inflow of wealth along our west coast.  All we need to do is rake it in.  This is the sort of thing into which the money we are getting from Europe should be channelled&mdash;the development of modern piers for the modern trawlers of 120 and 160 feet.  This would enable us to bring in loads of materials from 50 to 100 miles off our coast, thus bringing untold wealth to our people, giving the kind of employment along our entire west coast which would keep our people at home, bring back many of them who are outside, increase our population and give a way of life to all our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his first contribution to the House in his capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It was an appointment that was well merited.  The only regret I have is that he is not acting in a permanent capacity, because the Minister for Foreign Affairs is grossly overworked in his office, and, in view of our membership of the EEC, that Department needs a full-time Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather disappointed with the speech of the Fianna Fáil spokesman, Deputy O'Kennedy, who seemed to be trying to downgrade the Minister, which brings no credit on himself or his party.  It is well known abroad that our Minister for Foreign Affairs is a very able man.  He has a very high standard not only in Britain but throughout Europe and in America. <Col N="539" /> I do not know why Deputy O'Kennedy decided to attack him; certainly he overplayed his hand.  I do not think that matter arises.  If our Minister is capable of leading the European Economic Community in certain directions for the benefit not only of Ireland but of the EEC, I think he is entitled to do so, and good luck to him.  If we want to become fully involved in European politics and in the development of Europe, I do not think, because we are a small nation, we should play only a small part in such development.  On the contrary, I think we have a great deal to offer Europe.  If we have a Minister who wants to throw himself into the pool, so to speak, and try to lead Europe into prosperity, I think we should give him our full support, and I would say the criticism levelled at him by the Opposition spokesman was in bad taste.</P>
    <P>We have had our Dublin Summit&mdash; I do not think we want to call it &ldquo;Summit&rdquo; any more, but a meeting of heads of State.  We have had the political performance of Mr. Wilson who came over as an actor rather than a politician in order to get certain extra benefits for Britain so that he could go back and tell his Parliament and his people that they may now stay in the EEC.  I never believed at any time that Britain's withdrawal was to her advantage.  Unfortunately the British Prime Minister was playing politics with the whole question of Europe.  Reading Mr. Richard Crossman's diaries in <i>The Sunday Times</i> one gets the distinct impression that Mr. Wilson was in favour of Europe as far back as the mid-sixties. However, I am not interested in the British position, but I am glad that our position was clarified inasmuch as if Britain withdraws we shall not follow suit.  I do not believe the British people will withdraw from Europe, because a policy of isolation for Britain at this point would be disastrous for her economy.  I do not believe the £ would survive nor do I believe British industry would be able successfully to overcome the trade barriers which would be erected against <Col N="540" /> it.  I am sure the British people will give a clear-cut decision in favour of staying in Europe when the referendum takes place, and this is something I would personally welcome.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency of drift within the EEC.  The slight malaise was brought on by the high level of inflation and by the critical employment situation throughout Europe which developed after the oil crisis.  There has been a tendency to doubt the strength of Europe.  I believe that the Dublin Summit will have served as a launching pad for another economic takeoff in Europe, a restarting, if you like, of our economic engines.  With the anti-inflation policy which has been pursued by Germany and now being pursued by France, I believe that within the next 12 months there will be a return to a satisfactory growth pattern throughout the Community which, of course, will be of great benefit to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Everybody admits we are going through a hard period of unemployment here.  It is difficult to pinpoint how it happened.  A certain amount can be attributed to the oil crisis, but it is not easy to forecast when we shall come out of the valley period. I thought a few months ago that we would have started a solid economic recovery early in the New Year, but I am now inclined to think that we shall see a substantial reduction in unemployment in the next few months.</P>
    <P>There should be a great debate concerning a vital matter, that is, the value of the Irish £.  We are in an unprecedented state of inflation.  Last year the consumer price index increased by 20 per cent and this year it is expected to increase by a similar amount.  We have two problems: are we going to preserve the value of the £ as we know it now or are we going to put employment as our first priority, pursue an anti-inflation policy and thus rejuvenate our economy.  I have not heard many arguments put forward by economic experts, who should evaluate the alternatives that face us.  We are living in very unusual times.  There are great social changes coming.  This upheaval of the last year <Col N="541" /> will mean a restructuring of our society which may benefit us as a country in the long run.</P>
    <P>The question of whether we preserve employment or the value of the £ as we now know it is a very interesting one and I should like to see it aired more in public.  The establishment of a regional fund was a step forward, something we sought.  We receive £35 million over a period and I hope this will be increased in coming years.  It would be interesting to know in what areas this money will be used.  Will a particular area be treated as an underdeveloped area or will the fund be used over the whole of Ireland? Will it be used for specialised industries or to improve the infrastructure of the country, such as roads, harbours, piers and so on? These questions are not yet answered but they deserve to be answered and discussed here.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the present situation is unfortunate.  The Dáil gets a twice yearly report on developments in the European Community, and the one now under discussion is the fourth report. This is quite proper and it is fair to give credit to those who produce the report which is an informative document covering various policy fields within the Community.  It gives us an opportunity here of airing our views on any area of the EEC.  We hear many voices, the farmers through the farm organisations and the industrialists through the Confederation of Irish Industry, all giving their own pronouncements on EEC developments. But what I miss is a voice from the universities where we have many able people but they seem locked up in their ivory towers.  The universities, with their specialised facilities, should have produced a paper discussing the development of the EEC, the institution and the various policies and effects on our society.  The universities should be seen as an independent, neutral, expert body and I am disappointed to have heard so little from them on the EEC and its effects here.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a university forum &mdash;if you like&mdash;I suggest that money be provided for the establishment of an Institute of European Studies <Col N="542" /> which should be a non-political, expert body, not a massive institute but capable of employing or commissioning experts to produce papers on various aspects of EEC policy.  This would fill a gap in our information on EEC development.  Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas receive &ldquo;cart-loads&rdquo; of documents weekly from the EEC in large, brown envelopes. I admit I put them aside rather quickly and I do not think I can be blamed for that because they are very technical, specialised documents. There is a gap in our appreciation and criticism of the EEC which since it is not being filled by the universities could be filled by the establishment of the institute I have mentioned.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary's comments on this.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the development the EEC are undertaking in association with outside countries and also in the various agreements undertaken with what is, perhaps, described as the Third World, the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, the agreement in Lome.  I agree that Ireland has a part to play in providing assistance to Third World countries but there are some countries relatively well off.  In the case of any trade agreement which develops between, say, New Zealand, Australia, Canada or the Argentine &mdash;especially New Zealand and the Argentine which are strong competitors of ours on the European meat market&mdash;we should voice our opinion clearly that the Irish provision should be protected.  At the Dublin Summit one of the problems which emerged from the British position was the situation in relation to cheese and butter exports from New Zealand.  I am not very interested in developments in New Zealand but I am interested in the protection of the European market, if at all possible, for Irish products and I object vehemently to any importation of meat from the Argentine or any other source, into European countries.  The greatest advantage the EEC offered us and which we accepted was the advantage of a high-priced European market for our meat and other products.  Every step should be taken by our Ministers to protect <Col N="543" /> our interests and we should fight very strongly against opening the European market to imports of meat products from these other countries.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the matter of agreements with countries outside Europe I believe we should not be too interested in developing trade with countries from which we import substantially more than we export to them.  We should, where possible&mdash;and if we are strong enough, it should be possible&mdash;concentrate on bilateral trade agreements ensuring that we export to various countries amounts similar to what we import from them. I am talking particularly about the East European bloc.  Our imports from them are substantially greater than our exports to them.  Also, although we are members of the EEC we should not neglect the American and Canadian markets which can be very strong markets.</P>
    <P>Assuming that a policy of open international trade is pursued, and that a protectionist policy does not emerge in those countries, we should keep our eye on those markets, and make sure that all our eggs are not in one basket.  We should be aware of the advantages which lie in America and especially in Canada which is a developing, strong, industrial nation.</P>
    <P>Dumping of goods from Far Eastern countries, such as Taiwan and Japan, in the EEC has come to my attention.  There is the perennial question of the definition of dumping, but I am satisfied that goods are being sold in Ireland from those countries at uneconomic prices, at prices which are damaging to the development of certain industries, such as the leather industry in Ireland. We should put our foot down. I do not see why we should allow these cheap imports to come in from Taiwan and Japan.  We owe nothing to those countries.  We owe it to ourselves to protect and develop and foster our own industries where at all possible.  I understand that there may be technical reasons within the EEC agreement which make it difficult to stop this dumping.  Stronger steps <Col N="544" /> should be taken to protect ourselves from Far Eastern dumping.</P>
    <P>The political developments within the EEC are interesting.  As a member of the Council of Europe I am familiar with the question of Cyprus. The Turkish invasion of Cyprus was an act of war and of aggression.  Unfortunately, it was allowed to happen because the American Government and the British Government stood idly by.  This was most unfortunate. The situation now emerging in Cyprus is that the Turks have literally drawn a border across the island and intend to annex the prosperous northern part of the island for use by Turkish Cypriots.  This will lead to a long-term war-like situation on the island because I do not believe that the Greek Cypriots who are to be pushed to the south will live in peace under those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I voiced my opinions very strongly on the Political Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe when this question was discussed.  I did not get very far because the big nations did not want to upset what looked like a short-term settlement.  The long-term prob-terms which will emerge from the existence of the border, and which we in Ireland would perhaps be more aware of than many other nations, will be a constant source of aggression and trouble in that area.  I do not believe the EEC did enough to avert that situation. I have been watching it quite carefully in Europe.  The big powers have done nothing.  They just let the situation slide and, in the meantime, the Turkish forces have entrenched themselves even more solidly on the island.  Because of the distance from Cyprus to Greece Greek forces are not in existence, nor can the Greek Government bring any influence to bear on the situation.</P>
    <P>The guarantor powers did nothing. The British did nothing and they should have done something.  The position of the Americans on the whole problem of Cyprus is very much open to question.  I was in Greece last December on an official visit from the Council of Europe.  The Greek people are satisfied that American involvement was quite strong in the overthrow of the Makarios Government, <Col N="545" /> and they think that perhaps the CIA assisted in the assassination attempt on Makarios.  The Americans are in pretty poor standing in Greece.  That is not the only place where they are in poor standing, but I saw it there at first hand.  The question of Cyprus is a sad one and the EEC did very little about it.  They are to be condemned for not trying to avert this situation which has led to the creation of another border.</P>
    <P>The political situation in Portugal is giving concern.  The overthrow of the dictatorship was welcomed.  The forces of the left which are very evident in Portugal now are skating on thin ice.  There is no doubt that the existing ruling parties in Portugal, even though they are facing an election in a few weeks' time, intend to hold on to power.  This gave rise to the abortive attempt earlier this week at a <i>coup d' état</i> by certain forces within the army.  The democratic situation in Portugal is very delicate and I doubt very much that the coming elections will be successful.  They are in for a difficult period in Portugal. Again I get this awful feeling that the EEC are not that much interested in getting involved with the situation in Portugal, any more than they were interested in getting involved in the Cyprus situation last year.</P>
    <P>On the question of Greece which was also referred to in the report, the association the EEC had with Greece, which was suspended in 1967 when the dictatorship took over, has now been restored.  The re-establishment of democracy in Greece has been welcomed. I witnessed this at first hand. I was <i>rapporteur</i> on behalf of the Council of Europe on the readmission of Greece to the Council of Europe and I was over there with a delegation last December.  The Greek people have come through a very dark period. The torture centres were very evident. The people who were tortured are very happy that that period is over. The re-establishment under Karamanlis of a conservative Government has been welcomed in a country which is quite active politically and which is quite used to having confrontations between the left and the right.</P>

It was a very good example of how a nation can fight a dictatorship, overthrow a dictatorship, and successfully get back to a system of democracy.  There will be changes in the Greek democracy.  Political patronage was rife under the old pre-1967 Government.  Karamanlis is a very brave premier.  He is trying to establish a sound parliamentary system and a sound system of democracy in Greece.  He deserves our support.  The EEC welcomed Greece back as an associate member very soon after the Karamanlis Government took over.</P>
      <P>There is not much point in my starting to speak about the EEC-Arab dialogue because I want to deal with it at length.  It is very interesting that a number of countries are now very rich in money terms, very wealthy in terms of money, but very poor in terms of natural resources apart from their golden egg, the oil.  We should now ensure that whatever business we can do with the Arabs is done quickly, efficiently and effectively. Whether the Department of Foreign Affairs can undertake this mission or not, I do not know but certainly there should be some Government agency there trying to establish bases, trying to establish channels of trade.  There is no point in developing it further now as the debate will be adjourned in ten seconds' time.</P>
      <P>In regard to the general political situation in Europe, we are now coming out of a dark period of unemployment, of stagnation, if you like.  We have regained confidence in ourselves as a community and we have regained confidence in ourselves as a nation. We can look forward to the next few years as a period in which there will be further economic development, further social development within the Community.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

Statutory responsibility for the promotion, assistance and development of exports rests with Córas Tráchtála and the planning and organisation for participation in international trade fairs is primarily a matter for that body.  With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report a tabular statement listing the major international trade fairs andli = "1"onal events involving Córas Tráchtála participation this year.</P>
      <P>The question of trade representation on the Irish stands is a matter for the industry concerned.  I am not in a position to say whether these representatives would all be Irish nationals.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that any native coal resources which are capable of being worked economically in the present circumstances should be fully developed.  The potential of the Leinster and Connacht coalfields was thoroughly explored in the course <Col N="551" /> of extensive diamond drilling surveys carried out between 1959 and 1963. These surveys indicated considerable reserves of minable anthracite but the limited thickness of seams, coupled with their depth from the surface, discouraged colliery operators from undertaking development. The potential of the Sileveardagh coalfield has also been fully investigated. Every effort is being made to draw the attention of potential operators to these reserves and every incentive possible is being offered to encourage expansion in further exploration and development.  I would, of course, welcome applications from competent enterprises for facilities to work available State-owned reserves, if considered viable in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduced growth in manufacturing output in 1974 compared with 1973 is attributable to the downturn in world economic activity which became evident towards the end of 1973 and intensified throughout 1974.  The world recession coupled with the impact in particular of higher oil prices has led to a fall-off in consumer demand at home and abroad and a consequent reduction in manufacturing activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a shortage of trained personnel to carry out non-destructive testing in this country.  However, in anticipation of offshore industry and because of developments in the petrochemical industry, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards are making such a service available. Initially, it will be in Dublin and later in Cork.  Skilled personnel are being recruited at present and as the needs expand further personnel will be recruited and trained.  I do not consider that there is a need to set up a special institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Parliamentary Secretary to say on behalf of the Minister by way of reply that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards will provide an active service rather than provide a service for training personnel for such a service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is approximately what I said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the institute proposes to enter into this <Col N="553" /> field in competition with private enterprise firms who are already operating in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The institute propose to make this service available if industry wishes to avail of it.  It is not, I think, anticipated that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards will in any way become the major supplier of this service but it is nonetheless necessary in view of the importance of such a service that there would be a State body which is taking an interest in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that what is lacking and what will become increasingly lacking as the offshore oil situation develops is trained personnel and that it is no solution to the problem for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to purport to provide a service and simply make demands on the existing scarce pool of personnel rather than inaugurate some system of training to provide increased personnel either for a service provided by them or for the private enterprise firms who are already operating in this field?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the institute is prepared to do both.  It is prepared to provide the service initially by the recruitment of skilled personnel itself and in due course will undertake the training of unskilled personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said the opposite of that a moment ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  The Deputy appeared to be suggesting that I had not said that IIRS would provide a direct service and I wished to correct that misunderstanding.  They will provide this service but will also in due course provide training which I understand is something that takes some time to complete in this very complex area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that at present the only agency providing training for this type of personnel is situated <Col N="554" /> abroad and that the real need in this country now and for the future is for a training centre to provide personnel to staff a service, whether that service be provided by private enterprise or by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary accept that the role of the institute in this area should be to provide training for personnel and not to be simply going into the business of providing a service for which trained personnel do not exist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fairly obvious that trained personnel exist somewhere in relation to this matter.  It is a question of recruiting the personnel.  Some of them come from within the country while others come from outside. As I have indicated, the institute are preparing to engage in the training of personnel as well as in the provision of a service.  The Deputy is not correct when he says that there is no private firm within the country providing this service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there was such a firm.  My whole point is that there is a private enterprise firm providing this service but that they cannot get trained personnel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce when taxi drivers in Dublin and Cork will be compensated for the rise in petrol prices; and if it is proposed to retain the meter system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently received an application for an increase in taxi fares from the Cork Taxi Association.  The application is being submitted to the National Prices Commission and a decision will be given as soon as possible following receipt of their recommendations.  No application for an increase in fares has been received recently from taximen in the Dublin taxi meter area.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister for Local Government proposes to retain the meter system.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that up to now taxi fares in Dublin and Cork have been fixed by the local authorities for these areas and that, apparently, there is no action by the Government to compensate for increased petrol prices?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary indicate whether there will be a speedy decision in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations made to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Finance by the Irish Taxi Federation regarding delays inherent in the existing fare fixing process and the resolution adopted by Dublin City Council resulted in the decision by the Minister for Local Government to make the Road Traffic Public Service Vehicles (Amendment) Regulations, 1975.  These came into effect from 24th February last and mean that the fixing of maximum taxi fares in the Dublin and Cork taxi meter areas is no longer the function of the local authorities in those areas and that application for future increases in fares will be made direct by the taximen's associations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have indicated that one application which has been received&mdash;that from the Cork Taxi Association&mdash;has been referred by the Minister for Industry <Col N="558" /> and Commerce to the National Prices Commission.  I presume that a similar procedure will be adopted in relation to any other application which may be made to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I realise that the Parliamentary Secretary is answering on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, consequently, I do not wish to press him too hard on this issue but would be agree that the recent increase in the price of petrol has made life exceedingly difficult for the ordinary taxi driver who is endeavouring to make a living from his vehicle?  Indeed, the increase has made it almost impossible for him to survive.  In these circumstances I wonder whether the Minister would give favourable consideration to making available some fairly substantial quantities of petrol to registered taxi drivers at a reduced rate of duty? In other words, would the Minister be prepared to consider a rebate of duty in the present difficult circumstances?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, as a result of the recent increase in motor insurance premiums, he is satisfied that the companies to which the increases were awarded are now open to receive applications for new motor insurance premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied, from the close watch which I am keeping on the situation, that companies are now, much more so than in the past few years, ready to consider applications for new motor insurance cover but there is still room for improvement, and I expect this to come about within the next couple of months by which time the rationalisation of the rates of all the motor insurers will have been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary accept that there are still people who cannot get insurance and, if they complain to his Department, is there anything that can be done about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say definitively that there are not some people who still cannot get insurance but I can say there has been a very definite improvement in the situation.  The Department have been keeping a close watch on the situation and have sought statistics from companies on the amount of new business since the beginning of 1975. Nine of the 15 motor insurance companies were in a position to supply the Department with some figures of their intake of new business since January.  These figures show that the nine motor insurers issued in excess of 16,500 new policies; five of the nine <Col N="562" /> were in a position to show that their business increased by amounts varying between 100 per cent and 400 per cent over the corresponding period 12 months earlier.  It will be clear from these figures that there is a general opening up of motor insurance and the figures are all the more impressive when it is remembered that sales of new motor vehicles have dropped considerably in the same period.  It is felt that the full impact of the Minister's decision on the motor insurance market situation will not be evident for about another two months by which time all loading reduction schemes will have been implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have information which indicates that the number of complaints received by the Department of Local Government in relation to insurance matters has declined very rapidly.  In the period January, 1973, to February, 1974, a total of 377 complaints were received; in the period from June, 1974, to February, 1975, only 108 complaints were received. That indicates a significant improvement although it does not indicate that there are not still people who feel they have cause for complaint.</P>

      <P>Would it be possible for the Paliamentary Secretary to request his Minister for Industry and Commerce to make it quite clear to the public in some way, first, what companies are in fact entitled or cleared to increase their premiums and, secondly, where they have been allowed to increase their premiums what compensatory benefits by way of non-loading and accident free bonuses are made available?  The whole thing at the moment seems to be one where we know there are increases and we can find the increases but we can find nothing to compensate for them, as we were promised when the Minister was negotiating these new deals with these people.</P>

I am concerned about owner applicants who were given to understand, in a vague sort of way, that certain companies, unspecified, were entitled to increase their premiums six months ago by as much as 30 per cent and I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary whether it would be possible for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to set out clearly for the public in general and motor owners in particular just what companies have produced schemes acceptable to him, the details of those schemes and, in addition, to the 30 per cent increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Not to leave the public in the position in which they are at the moment, would he make known what the details of the whole set-up are because the position is most obscure?  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of the fact also that the reduction in the number of complaints as to the non-availability of insurance does not answer the question really and does not deal with the overall situation.</P>

Following an examination by a specialised <i>ad hoc</i> motor premium advisory committee of the National Prices Commission the Minister agreed to an increase in premiums with the companies <Col N="564" /> concerned.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say.  I presume they all are.  I have no reason to believe that there is any company exempt from these arrangements but I will have it checked.  It was in two phases and in effect it gave a 30 per cent increase on each company's previous rates plus a further 10 per cent in return for a balancing reduction in the company's loadings.  All companies effected the balancing reduction so that the net effect is an increase in the basic rates of 40 per cent with reductions varying from company to company in loadings and, as I indicated in an earlier reply, these loading reductions schemes have not yet come fully into effect with all the companies.  They are not likely to be equally in effect for a further two months and this may account for the difficulty to which the Deputy is adverting but, if he waits for a further two months, he may find the situation has improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>A number of directives dealing with harmonisation of company law are at various stages of progression with the EEC Commission or the Council. Progress in finalising them is a matter for the Commission or the Council as the case may be, but Ireland is playing its full part, as a member state and currently as holder of the Presidency, in promoting progress.</P>
      <P>The system of two-tier boards modelled on the system in some continental countries has been proposed in the draft Fifth Directive and in the draft Statute for a European Company. It is not possible to say at this stage what the provisions of the draft directive and the statute will ultimately be, as the proposals are subject to change before adoption by the EEC Council of Ministers.  The draft Fifth Directive will be applicable to national law.  It would be premature to propose any change in the law regarding boards of companies until the provisions of the draft directive are finally settled.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has made a regulation entitled the European Community's Companies Regulations, 1973, the purpose of which is to give effect to the first Community directive on company law? Is he further aware that the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Community have reported to the Oireachtas on that particular regulation and have recommended that it be amended?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been specifically drawn to my attention but I will have the matter looked at.  In relation to what Deputy Lemass said I should explain that the fifth directive which deals with worker participation has certain proposals which are being considered in detail at the moment. These proposals have not yet reached the Council of Ministers so the Irish Government are not yet in a position to do anything within the Council to have the fifth directive or a directive along similar lines adopted more quickly.  The second, third and fourth directives have reached the Council of Ministers but it would obviously be wise for this country not to introduce amendments in company law affecting worker participation in advance of the fifth directive because such changes in company law introduced in advance would have to be subsequently altered to take account of the terms of that directive.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education when it is proposed to replace the prefabricated buildings in which An Scoil Lán-Ghaelach, Sráid Maolbhríde, Baile Átha Cliath, is accommodated at present with a permanent structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>I received a deputation from the principal teachers of the three schools in question last December in connection with the existing state of the school buildings and the question of the provision of new premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained to them that I did not feel in a position to give an undertaking that new premises would be provided for the schools in that present location.  I pointed to the fact that in the last few years new all-Irish schools had been established in the suburbs and I stated that I was very much in favour of that form of development.  The opening of these new schools had been paralleled by a falling off in the numbers enrolled in the schools in Marlborough Street.  I <Col N="571" /> suggested that it might be desirable that thought should be given to the matter of the transfer of the schools to a new location in one of the suburbs of the city.  The question of the amalgamation of the three schools into one school in view of the decline in the enrolments was also raised and this matter is to be further considered.</P>
    <P>Two of the three schools have been transferred from unsuitable permanent buildings and are at present housed in prefabricated classroom accommodation. This accommodation, which was newly erected in 1973 is regarded as suitable and adequate for at least a number of years.</P>
    <P>I have already conveyed my views in relation to this matter in a letter of 29th January, 1975, to an Cathaoirleach, Coiste Thuismitheoirí Scoileanna Gaeilge, Sráid Maolbhríde.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>Are we to take it from what the Parliamentary Secretary has said that An Scoil Lán-Ghaelach, Sráid Maolbhríde is to be closed?  Is it the end of the line for the school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That seemed to be indicated from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Minister suggested the possibility that they might wish to move to another location.  When a survey was carried out it was found that only 27 of the 326 children were living in the immediate locality of the school and it was considered it might be better located elsewhere.  The Minister has made an alternative proposal, namely, that the three schools at present on this site could be amalgamated into one national school which could be accommodated in adequate buildings. I think this suggestion is being considered and it would probably be the answer to the immediate problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two supplementary questions.  First, is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that pending any long-term development with <Col N="572" /> regard to this school, there are considerable grounds for complaints by parents regarding the inadequacies of existing facilities?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary be prepared to look at the existing facilities and amenities in the short-term?  Although I would not expect him to be totally aware of this, perhaps he might consider looking into the great history and tradition of this school and realise that, in proportion to its size, it has one of the most distinguished records of past pupils in the country.  In any planning intended for this school, would he keep that great tradition and history in mind and realise that in the minds of many people it occupies a very special cherished position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted what the Deputy has said in the latter part of his supplementary question.  In relation to the precise question of accommodation, one of the results of the possible amalgamation of the three schools would be a rationalisation of the accommodation.  This would mean that the overall standard of accommodation in the amalgamated school would be better than that presently enjoyed by the children in the three schools at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I gather from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply that if the amalgamation took place what would be available would not be pre-fabricated accommodation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary state why the Minister thinks the place is not suitable for a school, apart from the reason given which, in any event, was not a valid one?  Deputy Haughey quite rightly has referred to the tradition and history of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the prefabricated buildings that are on the site and which would be made available for the school as a whole in the event of amalgamation are of a good standard.  This provision would be a sound interim measure to deal with the problem.</P>

      <P>The position is that the NCEA is autonomous in order that its decisions in relation to the validation of courses can have a standing which is not subject to political pressure.  The Deputy will appreciate that if political pressure is exercised on the NCEA, either to make a particular decision in relation to a particular <Col N="580" /> course or to unduly hasten a decision in relation to a particular course and, as a result, not do all the investigations necessary, its decisions on the validation of courses will not have the standing, national and international, which the students deserve. It is fair to say that, when the students took up this course and when the course was set up, everybody was aware that the course was not at that stage validated by the NCEA and that that matter would have to be gone into subsequently.  That matter is now being gone into and there is no question of this matter having been dealt with in an improper manner.  If the NCEA and the RTCs were set up prematurely, or without advance planning having been made in relation to them, that was a decision taken by the previous Government.</P>

Would he also tell them that the NCEA was killed on the 16th December, was revived since then, under pressure and would he tell them what kind of state it is in at present?</P>

      <P>I have had representations from the school managerial authorities indicating that certain schools are experiencing financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The financing of private secondary schools must be viewed in the overall context of the moneys which have been placed at my disposal for the funding of educational services generally during the current financial year.</P>
      <P>I am of course, concerned that appropriate financial provision should be available for these schools and I am having a review of the position made. It is too early to say yet however what steps, if any, I will be in a position to take to alleviate these difficulties having regard to the constraints of the present budgetary situation.</P>

      <P>The National Youth Council proposed an award scheme to the Department of Education in 1972. It was discussed by my predecessor and while general approval in principle for the scheme was expressed, I can find no evidence of specific commitments being given, or of the necessary financial arrangements having been made.  On taking office, I also met the National Youth Council and had the whole scheme studied by a panel of advisers on youth policy which I had set up.  I concluded that, while the scheme had considerable merits, it was too difficult to assess its likely results in practice to warrant an immediate commitment to a national scheme which could become very costly over time.  My preference is for a local pilot scheme or schemes to try out the basic ideas involved, which would be rigorously assessed and could form the basis for a wider decision.  Arrangements for this will, of course, have to be made in the light of the overall financial provision for youth services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, 1924, prohibits, in general, the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;off&rdquo; licensed premises to persons under the age of 18.  One of the exceptions to this general prohibition is the sale or delivery of intoxicating liquor to a person over the age of 15 in a corked and sealed vessel containing not less than one reputed pint.</P>
      <P>I have no evidence that this particular exception is a significant factor in the social problem of under-age drinking or that, if the exception were removed or modified, any young people who may now avail themselves of the provision could not easily find other ways of getting drink.  If, however, real evidence that this provision creates a significant problem is supplied to me, I shall certainly consider the matter.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the amount of under-age drinking is a matter of concern in various parts of the country, but as I said on previous occasions the community have the remedy in their own hands by bringing to the notice of the Garda information concerning those who are making these sales to under age people.  This would be the most effective remedy.  The question of identity cards has been raised from time to time and I have examined it in some detail and I have <Col N="591" /> come to the conclusion that if these were to be feasible it would have to be for the general population over the legal age rather than for those under age.

I do not disagree with everything she said <Col N="593" /> and neither do I necessarily agree with all that she said.  Before I came in for Question Time a letter signed by the chairman of Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital and also chairman of the catering committee of that hospital was brought to my attention.  It is a letter published in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which he refutes many of the suggestions, allegations or comments made by the lady in question.  I think the Deputy would agree that prescribing treatment is primarily a matter for the doctor, who would do this in consultation with the dietitians and catering officers.  I do not think they should have the exclusive right of determining a diet because the doctor is the person who treats a patient.  He may decide on a low protein or a high protein content in the meals provided for patients and then, I assume, the catering officer or the dietitian would decide what type of food would be provided.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of deep dissatisfaction over the inadequate salary scales obtaining in the catering and dietetic services of hospitals.  The officers concerned have access to the conciliation and arbitration scheme for local authority and health board officers in respect of such of their number as is employed in the hospital services of the health boards and those working in the voluntary hospital services have access to the Labour Court when direct negotiations fail to resolve any disputes that may arise in regard to their level of remuneration and other conditions of service.  The full provisions of the national pay agreements have been applied to these and, of course, all other grades in the health services and their salary scales would not appear to have fallen out of line with comparable salaried staff.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, I recently received a report of a working party on the training and employment of handicapped <Col N="597" /> persons.  It recommended a national structure of training centres and sheltered workshops and I have, in general, accepted its scheme.  I intend asking the National Rehabilitation Board to examine the various proposals that have been put forward, including that for a centre at Ballindine, and to decide whether they are in accordance with the principles of the working party report.  As it will first be necessary to strengthen the board's technical staff, I cannot yet say when decisions are likely to be made; but I am most anxious to push ahead with the improvement of rehabilitation arrangements for the handicapped as soon as personnel and financial resources permit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that the National Association of Disabled Drivers are a very active and progressive organisation, that they have embarked on a programme of providing themselves with a headquarters and a training centre at Ballindine at a cost of £200,000, and that out of their own efforts they have succeeded in collecting £50,000? Apart from his examination and pending his decisions on the general rehabilitation programme, in view of the enthusiasm and the activities of this association would the Minister be prepared to make a grant immediately available to Ballindine since it is already under construction and, no matter what decision the Minister ultimately comes to, Ballindine must fit it into his decision somewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that they are a very active organisation but, at this stage, I would not be prepared to commit myself to giving a grant until the matter has been investigated by the National Rehabilitation Board.  The Deputy is probably aware that this building was started without the knowledge of the Department of Health.  I had discussions with some representatives in May, 1974, and recently the programme manager from the Western Health Board had discussions with them with regard to the whole structure and the purpose for which the structure will be used.  The association have some reservations as <Col N="598" /> to what type of persons should be trained there.</P>
      <P>The National Rehabilitation Board, in accordance with the report of the working party on the training and employment of handicapped people, took the view that people other than those physically handicapped should be included, but there were very strong objections from the association. I think the Deputy will agree that there should not be any barrier or any segregations in regard to any handicap physical or mental.  The Association of Disabled Drivers at Ballindine have rejected to date, so far as I know, any proposal that there should be integration of all those who are physically handicapped.</P>
      <P>Apart from that I think the Deputy will also agree-and I do not want to decry the efforts of these people&mdash; that this institution is not located in a particularly suitable area.  It is ten miles from the nearest big town, so far as I remember, and four miles from a smaller town.  It does not seem to have the facilities and amenities which would be in a larger area, or a built up area.  It appears to me that it would be difficult to staff the centre properly in view of its distance from Tuam which is ten miles away.  I would be very reluctant, as one of my Fianna Fáil predecessors was not, to row in with a project to the extent of giving money for a project of which he had no knowledge whatsoever until the structure was up to a certain level.</P>

Having regard to the very nature of their disability, the fact that they are self-reliant and anxious to help themselves to the greatest possible extent was responsible for their deciding to go ahead with their own training centre and their own headquarters.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, I have recently, with the approval of the Government, set up a health education bureau.  Its functions include <i>inter alia,</i> the drawing up and carrying out of programmes of health education at national and local levels in accordance with agreed national priorities.  The nutritional education programme envisaged by the Deputy would fall within such functions.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the value of a programme of nutritional education and when I was reconstituting and expanding the food advisory committee recently I included in the membership specialists in the nutritional aspect of food.  The address made by my Parliamentary Secretary at the inaugural meeting of the committee specifically highlighted the importance of nutrition.</P>
      <P>The committee has decided to establish a special sub-committee on nutrition.  I understand that the sub-committee will be asked to consider on a broad basis what action is now desirable in this section in the public health interest.  The recommendation of this sub-committee will be considered by the main committee who will, in turn, report to me.</P>
      <P>If the committee recommend that a nutritional education programme requires priority, I shall bring their recommendation to the notice of the health education bureau.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.  It appears from the inquiries which it has been possible to make in the time available that the question relates to employees of a shirt manufacturing firm in Buncrana which, I understand, has been in receivership since September last.  A substantial sum has been claimed by the Department from the receiver in respect of social insurance contributions due by the firm for 1973 and 1974.</P>
      <P>In the meantime however the outstanding contributions have been treated as paid in respect of affected employees in order to protect their right to benefits.  This has enabled unemployment benefit to be paid to all but one of those women workers who were laid off subsequent to Christmas last, many of whom have now returned to the same employment. The number of women workers concerned who are still in receipt of unemployment benefit has dwindled to 11.</P>

      <P>When the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1973, becomes law it is my intention to carry out a comprehensive review of the exempted development regulations made under the 1963 Act. The size of house extension which is exempted from planning control and the position in regard to septic tank installations will be specially examined. In the meantime I have issued very definite guidelines to planning authorities in relation to flexibility in planning control.  In particular I have advised them that, in my view, applications for minor extensions to existing developments and for septic tanks should be dealt with in a liberal way.</P>
      <P>I might mention that the 120 square feet limit mentioned by the Deputy applies only to a single-storey extension; in the case of a two-storey extension, the limit is 90 square feet on each floor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A hallway of 120 square feet would be an enormous one.  The <Col N="608" /> Deputy knows that, as a rule, hallways are well under 60 square feet or 70 square feet.  Anything up to 120 square feet is in order.  That is not what is causing the trouble.  What is causing the trouble is when somebody builds an extension at the rere of the house which might be 130 square feet or slightly over.  Even if it is not quite in accordance with the regulations if local authorities used their discretion in regard to these matters it would save everybody a lot of trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service whether he proposes <Col N="610" /> to apply parity to public service pensions as at the date of increases in the relevant public service salaries; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan) Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the policy announced in the 1974 budget, public service pensions are revised each year with effect from 1st July by reference to rates of pay in force on that date.</P>
      <P>The grant of pensions parity to public service pensioners by way of an annual review is more generous than the practice in occupational pensions schemes generally.  For that reason, and because more frequent adjustment of pensions would add considerably to the cost and difficulty of administration, it is not proposed to change the present arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the intention in this regard was to grant parity of pensions and that, for administrative reasons, it was decided to operate it from a particular date in the year.  The situation in the last year or so has changed inasmuch as there are three, and sometimes four, increases in a year in serving salaries.  Under the national pay agreement at present being negotiated this position will continue and, perhaps, there may be more numerous increases having regard to that fact and the fact that the rate of inflation is 20 per cent plus.  Pensioners are losing out heavily as compared with their position a few years ago.  Administrative convenience is not now a sufficient reason for imposing this hardship on pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view it is an exaggeration to speak of this situation as one of hardship.  It is also wrong to assume that the current rate of world inflation is going to continue at the rate which the world experienced in recent times.  Having regard to the more normal and much to be hoped for resumption of normal pay adjustments it would be wrong to make any alterations which would be trimmed to adjust to the present, and we hope temporary, situation.  Even if we take the present situation it is not one in <Col N="611" /> which immense loss arises in the earlier part of the year because the increases are small and they are staged. The particular arrangement under which complete parity is given once a year is, as the Deputy knows, more generous than what is normal in non-public sector pension schemes.  I think we must maintain a relationship, otherwise we will be developing a feeling of envy on the part of people who are in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever may be said about the relative advantages or disadvantages of public service <i>versus</i> private service pensions, is it not a fact, having regard to the changes that have taken place in the last year or so, that the parity which was granted to pensioners has disimproved and that the position is worse for public service pensioners than it was two or three years ago?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am afraid I could not accept that.  The lag has been reduced in recent years, most recently under the budget of 1974.  The date on which pensions were automatically increased was brought forward to 1st July.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  I admit that Aer Lingus, like every other airline in the world, are finding it extremely hard to come out on the profit side.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of Euro-Arab dialogue is obviously an important matter to the European Economic Community.  When I spoke previously I expressed satisfaction with the proposed establishment of the joint Euro-Arab Commission. Immense problems have arisen because of the action of the Arab states in drastically increasing the price of oil and it is very important from our point of view that the massive funds which will be transferred to the Arab states by European countries are properly recycled&mdash;in other words, that the funds just do not arrive in the Arab states and are buried away in their banks with dead interest.  In fact, they should be recycled to the western European countries as much as possible.  We are at a disadvantage in that this problem suddenly arose and there was no builtin method of dealing with it.  The establishment of the commission is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can do a considerable amount of trade with the Arab countries.  As a nation we have not taken enough action to represent ourselves to the Arabs in relation to trade.  I know this cannot be done overnight and certainly there has been some activity in this area recently.  However, we <Col N="623" /> should send a high-powered team to those nations because it is well known that they have shown an interest in this country and have bought a substantial amount of goods from us. We should make use of the lack of resources, other than oil, of these countries and I foresee a time when we could have a very prosperous exporting business of agricultural-based products.  Quite apart from our membership of the EEC, as a nation we should take individual action in this area.</P>
    <P>The east-west détente negotiations are of interest.  Possibly this problem did not concern us so much when we were not in the EEC but now it is one of the many areas in which we must have a policy and let our voice be heard.  One of the most interesting aspects is the position concerning refugees, those people who are living in the eastern bloc, and who wish to leave but are not allowed to do so. This is an important principle so far as we are concerned and we should do what we can to get the authorities in the eastern counties to accept the right of people to leave if they wish.</P>
    <P>A free Press is totally absent in the eastern bloc and we should support any move towards liberalisation of opinion in those countries.  They have their own quality of life and we can learn from them as they can learn from us.  We should not attempt to dictate to them about the quality of life as we see it.</P>
    <P>These two points are of vital importance to the people in the eastern countries.  From the speeches I have heard in Europe it is obvious there is a desire within these countries to have a liberalisation of the movement of people and a greater freedom of the Press.  We have not discussed these matters to any great extent; indeed we have very little information about them.  However, we should try to ensure that what is accepted here as a basic human right and a civil liberty is granted to people in eastern European countries.  We have an embassy in Moscow and there is a Russian embassy in Dublin.  We should point out to their ambassador that these freedoms <Col N="624" /> exist in western European countries.</P>
    <P>The question of NATO crops up in Ireland every few years.  There are queries whether Ireland will become associated with the NATO forces, how this would affect our neutrality and how does Ireland stand in the event of aggression.  The question of aggression from the east or from any other source does not arise in the foreseeable future.  In the last few years there have been moves to ease tension between the major powers and to reduce the danger of aggression.  Nevertheless, the question remains: where does Ireland stand with regard to NATO?</P>
    <P>It is a question that arises more particularly with regard to the development of a common defence policy within the EEC and perhaps this is more real than the NATO issue.  There is a tendency in Europe to be independent militarily and if a common defence policy emerges we will have to make up our minds where we stand.  We remained neutral in the second world war but what we would do in the event of a future act of aggression is a different matter.  If our national approach and philosophy is one of complete involvement with Europe and all its ideals, if we establish a common <i>esprit de corps,</i> it appears to me that if Europe develops a common defence policy in conscience we would be obliged to be part of that policy.  It is a question that should be discussed in the House so that we would get the views of all Members and so that public opinion might be made known if that were necessary.  If a common defence policy emerges within the EEC we should be part of it.  Not to do so would be returning to a kind of isolation that would not be beneficial to us in the long term.</P>
    <P>The question of a common energy policy, which is linked with the oil crisis, is an interesting one.  I should like to congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce on sticking to his objective concerning the mining issues here.  The previous Government reneged on their responsibilities by not examining the question fully.  However, I think many people in this <Col N="625" /> House were educated in geography on a book by Eleanor Butler and one of the basic premises of that book was that we had no minerals of any value in Ireland.  As we know, this is not true.  We are lacking a proper mining exploitation authority which would be able to examine the potential mineral deposits and which would examine the question of offshore oil exploration and similar matters.  Admittedly, these matters have come to notice only in the last few years but they are of vital interest.  We should not play politics with them, we should not be content merely to say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was right or wrong or that Fianna Fáil were right or wrong.  It is a question of policy in regard to research facilities, personnel with expertise in the mining and exploration fields and so forth.  We should ensure that Ireland does not miss out in this sphere.</P>
    <P>The question of the fishing industry was raised by Deputy O'Connor among others.  I think we should be a bit more dogged than we have been in this respect.  I admire the attitude of the Icelandic Government in extending their limits to 50 miles and I can understand their anxiety to have that extended further to 200 miles.</P>

      <P>During Question Time today we had a number of Parliamentary Secretaries deputising for Ministers, which is quite in order. In the course of his reply to Question No. 17 dealing with the attitude of the Minister for Education towards Deputies, I regarded the reply as unsatisfactory and not in accordance with fact.  I found either no reply to supplementaries or unsatisfactory replies.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education also <Col N="626" /> stood in for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am sure this is permissible, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I was granted permission to raise with the Minister for Education the subject matter of Question No. 17.  In my opinion the Parliamentary Secretary is not capable on behalf of the Minister, to give the reasons for a ministerial decision and the factors which caused that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the subject matter of the question.  The Deputy is dealing with another matter.  The Deputy will have another opportunity to do what he is now doing.  I want him to deal with the subject matter of Question No. 17 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister is not here but is replaced by his Parliamentary Secretary, with whom I was dissatisfied earlier in the day, I ask leave to have the Question on the Adjournment postponed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be quite irregular.  The Deputy must proceed now to deal with the subject matter of the question.  If he wishes to withdraw, that is another matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands when the Land Commission expect to divide the Cunningham and Cahill estates at Killanera, Caher and the Tuohy estate at Faha, Caher in County Clare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> I understand that proposals for the allotment of the Tuohy holding are at present being formulated and it is hoped that the lands will be alloted this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that the balance of the Cunningham holding (21½ acres) <Col N="622" /> will also be allotted before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As regards the Cahill lands it is envisaged that plans for their allotment will be prepared in conjunction with those for the nearby Brody holding which is also in possession of the Land Commission but it is unlikely that allocation will take place before next year.</P>
