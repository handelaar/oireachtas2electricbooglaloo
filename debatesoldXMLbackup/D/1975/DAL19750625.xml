      <P>During the brief time I was speaking last evening I commented on the high level of the debate on this stage of the Bill.  As I have said on a previous occasion here, if we are to tackle seriously the problem of poverty, we must first acknowledge openly that poverty exists in our society on a fairly wide scale and that it is not something imposed by God on the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> Poverty is created by the activities of people in our society.  Consequently, its solution lies in the hands of society. Someone said here yesterday that we must not accept the concept of the poor being with us always.  I have never believed that that phrase referred to those who are poor in the material sense but that, rather, it referred to those who are poor spiritually.  Into this category I would put people who might be described as the get-rich-quick poor, those who become rich regardless of the cost to their fellow Irish men and women.  Not all the exploiters in this country are imported. Unfortunately, many of them were born and bred among us.  These are the people who, ultimately, are the poor because they lack something which is essential for any kind of enrichment of one's life, that is, a reasonable concern for the rights of their fellow human beings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews said that this Bill only provided money and did not go any way to meeting the requirements that were necessary for reforming the Home Assistance Act.  Nothing in my opinion could be further from the truth.  Anybody who even glances at the Act and has a quick run through the Bill before the House will see that there is in this Bill a remedy for all the major criticisms of the whole operation of the Home Assistance Act over the years.  Undoubtedly that was degrading.  No one has stood up in this House to try to defend the Home Assistance Act.  To say that the Bill only provides monetary relief is to distort what the Bill is designed to do.  Undoubtedly it gives additional money.  A recent survey showed that under the Home Assistance Act a single person received on average £4.91 per week.  That was not of right but purely on a discretionary basis.  If was on the discretion of a particular health board or local authority. Under the terms of this Bill a single person can claim as of right £7.35. An adult with an adult dependant on average got £9.11 under the old scheme.  Under the terms of this Bill he will of right get £12.80.  Some of the major objections that have been voiced over the years are removed or <Col N="1563" /> repealed under this Bill.  The Home Assistance Act is being replaced.</P>
    <P>We talked about there being no right to assistance.  That provision is gone under the provisions of this Bill. In the event of one being refused assistance there was no redress for the person involved.  That has been rectified now.  If a man or woman applies for social welfare supplementary allowances and is refused he or she has the right to appeal, just as recipients of other social welfare benefits have.  The payment level also remains flexible over and above the basic that is provided for in the Bill. This is an essential part of the operation of such a scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a scheme with a set of basic rules and rates.  It replaces a situation where anyone, from one authority to another and even within one local authority, could find that a particular person has been awarded a different rate from his or indeed has been refused assistance without any redress whatever open to him.  Under the Bill there is a single means test.  It provides an effective link with the community services which are operated by the health boards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews said that all that was provided under this Bill was more money, and not great sums of that.  I accept that the basic sums under this Bill are not all that I would like to see but they are a considerable improvement on what was there before. They take into consideration the dignity of the people applying under the scheme.  The assistance is theirs by right.  When introducing the Second Stage of this Bill I said:</P>
    <P>The problems of those who will need to avail of these allowances will, in most cases, be of a nature calling for more than a mere cash response.  Social services, social work support and genuine community care are also needed which can help the recipients to cope with the situations in which they find themselves and to find a place of dignity and full integration in our society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> The realisation that money alone would not cater for the needs of these people did not come only from Deputy Andrews.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews did us a considerable service when he concentrated most of his remarks on the subject of poverty.  There are different definitions of poverty.  The Deputy spoke of a particular situation where an American billionaire came down to breakfast feeling very depressed because conditions on the Stock Exchange were not good.  He told his wife he felt lousy and that he felt like a million dollars.  I suppose, relatively speaking, that could be defined as poverty by some people, although not by me.  The poverty which we are concerned with and which is under discussion in the House at the moment is the type of poverty which was discussed in very understanding terms by some Deputies on the other side of the House.  They showed a general knowledge of the plight of some of their constituents and concern to see that some form of social justice should be applied in this area of hard core poverty, not a man just feeling like a million but a man wondering where the next meal will come from, a man wondering how he will provide sufficient food, clothing and shelter for his wife and children.  That is the form of poverty that we in Ireland are faced with.  Figures have been given, which nobody has contradicted, so one must accept them as being authentic, that that situation applies to from 20 to 24 per cent of the people of this nation.  I look forward to the day when we will be able to speak about relative poverty.  I sincerely hope we will have a full discussion here on some private person who has to put up with black and white television because he has not got coloured television.  That would be a nice situation to be in.  There are Scandinavian societies where that type of discussion is going on, but it is a little early for it here.  That is not the type of poverty, unfortunately, we are faced with.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of definitions of poverty.  I have one, which came out of discussions in the <Col N="1565" /> EEC as a result of the implementation of pilot schemes to combat poverty, which I am glad to say was passed by the Council of Ministers on Tuesday last week and which will come into operation not only in this country but in other member countries of the EEC.  Their definition is that a person is in poverty if his command over his resources, including money, social services and community services, is so far below the normal standard of the community that he is in effect excluded from normal integration in that community. I do not think there are many who could put up an argument in our circumstances against that definition. There are many people amongst us who quite clearly fall into that category.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews made quite a thing about a number of inequities in our social service system.  He was particularly concerned about what he described as discrimination against women in some of our social services. As a matter of fact, looking at him from this side of the House, it seemed to be the only thing in the Bill which he could bring himself to get very excited or concerned about.  I would accept anyone being concerned about inequities and discrimination against any group or individual, but I got the impression that he had gone through the Bill rather hastily and picked out this particular point because it was a political point, because you could throw the rest of the Bill aside and here was a bit of a stick with which you could beat the Government in political terms.</P>
    <P>This is women's year and there is a lot of discussion and comment on the media and elsewhere about the rights of women.  We are all genuinely concerned about any form of discrimination, but this Government in two years and three months have done more to eliminate discrimination and inequities in social welfare than the previous Government, of which Deputy Andrews was an office holder, did in all their years in office.  They not only did that but a large number of difficulties in this particular area are a direct result of legislation which <Col N="1566" /> was introduced and supported by the previous administration.</P>
    <P>In the report of the Status of Women Commission there were a number of points in which it was stated in the field of social welfare that discrimination occurred.  Since that report was published the majority of those unjust aspects have been removed by this Government.  It is not possible in two years and three months to rectify the accumulated neglect of 16 consecutive years in any area and particularly in the area of social welfare, but we have managed to remove most of them.  Dr. Beere, who was the chair person of the particular committee, publicly acknowledged that very considerable progress had been made in the field of social welfare.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Andrews that we will continue to make progress as rapidly as possible in this particular area, not because he will use it as a stick to beat the Government but because we believe it is the right thing to do.  We will not do it piecemeal to meet the political pressures of any particular day or hour or to run in front of a political campaign some people think they can mount.  We will do it properly and we will do it when it is possible to do it.  I feel confident that we have done enough to have the confidence of the people who are genuinely concerned in this area to know that progress will be made as rapidly as it can be made to eliminate all forms of discrimination or injustice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan, Deputy Bermingham and others were concerned about the transfer of the scheme to the health boards.  They felt it would be administered through the county councils. They were concerned lest, under the health boards, the operation of this scheme and our approach to its implimentation would be lost.  I can assure Deputy Ryan, Deputy Bermingham and others that this has been considered. One can realise that men concerned about this area would have doubts about its being transferred from the immediate control of the county councils.  But we are endeavouring under this scheme not merely to provide <Col N="1567" /> money but to provide that which is essential if the cycle of poverty is to be broken, that is, a comprehensive, back-up service capable of dealing with the total needs of an individual, family or group of people who find themselves in this category.  That can best be done by a link up between the officers who administer the scheme and the community care programmes operated by the health boards.  Under the terms of this Bill there is a direct link between them and it will be possible for them to call on expert advice and assistance in many disciplines, to help in the rehabilitation of a person or family back into the mainstream of society.  That is an essential component of our approach to this problem. Therefore, the transfer to the health boards is both necessary and desirable.  I can assure Deputies who voiced concern that the overall administration of this scheme or responsibility therefor is being retained by the Minister. Indeed, on many occasions, he has expressed his concern with the building up of community care programmes. When they fall to be operated and administered by the health boards I can assure Deputies they will not be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>It was rather sad to hear Deputy Faulkner say in this House yesterday evening that the only reason this Bill was not before us was that it had to be put through the House before Thursday's budget.  I was saddened by that remark because Deputy Faulkner had been the Opposition spokesman on social welfare prior to Deputy Andrews and I had always found him to be constructive and genuinely concerned in this area.  I find myself wondering in what circumstances he came in here to make that remark.</P>
    <P>The intention to introduce this Bill was announced some time ago.  Deputy Faulkner mentioned our having a budget on Thursday next and I should like to say this: it is no secret that our economy is in difficulties; it is no secret that, for any Government, these are fairly rough times; the amount of money available is scarce and the pressures on a Government in times such as these from various Departments and <Col N="1568" /> external agencies are very heavy indeed. Therefore, it is with very considerable pride that I am here now putting this Bill through the House; pride in the Coalition Government; pride in the fact that the men in the Cabinet, in times such as these, can still adhere to the priorities they set for themselves in 1973 and provide the money necessary for the introduction of this Bill.  It is not so much a question of availability of money.  No matter what Government may be in office the money does not dramatically become available or dry up.  Rather it is a sense of priorities and, God knows, the difference between the priority given to social welfare and the poor under this Government, as compared with the previous Administration, is so obvious as not to warrant any comment from me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan and others spoke about the financial aspect of the Bill. Apparently they were very concerned that 40 per cent will be sought from local authorities.  The fact is that, up to now, the local authorities have borne the full cost of the operation of the home assistance scheme.  This Bill provides for a grant from the Exchequer of 60 per cent of the additional cost, and that taking 1975 as a base.  Apart altogether from the financial considerations involved in that operation, many speakers in the course of yesterday's discussions, and indeed many from the Fianna Fáil benches said that without local involvement and awareness this type of scheme could not be successful.  I agree.  It is essential, if we are to be successful in this fight, that local people be aware and involved.</P>
    <P>I do not believe ratepayers would voice an objection to paying 40 per cent&mdash;indeed, it is only a proportion based on 1975 expenditure in this area&mdash;towards feeling involved and making a positive effort to eliminate this problem and to restore to these people what is rightfully theirs, their sense of dignity, their sense of belonging and their sense of belonging by right.  I do not take seriously the objections which have been raised on that aspect of the Bill by Fianna Fáil <Col N="1569" /> speakers.  It is like their sudden concern after 16 years in office for the rights of women.  It seems a possible political approach to the Bill, something which is perfectly legitimate, but I do not give it much hope of getting off the ground as a major political debate here or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Some Members raised good points in the course of their contributions and showed an awareness of how the previous home assistance scheme worked.  They were in a position to indicate how it humiliated and degraded people who had to resort to it.  These Members obviously gave a considerable amount of thought to the operation of a home assistance scheme and how it could be improved. One of the best contributions I heard on this subject in this House was made by Deputy Esmonde.  His insight into the problem was very good.  He showed a great awareness of the problem and a fine sense of concern and compassion for the people who have to resort to the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham spoke about some of the practical difficulties experienced by people seeking assistance under the scheme.  He pointed out that a person in receipt of a social welfare benefit was not notified in advance if his eligibility under stamps was running out.  The first warning bell such a person gets is when his cheque fails to arrive on the appointed day.  He spoke of a woman in such a predicament having to go to a home assistance officer on a Friday evening.  Because of the approach of the weekend that officer was not in a position to ascertain whether or not the person involved was giving a factual account of the position.  The officer had no way of providing immediate assistance to that person.  Deputy Bermingham suggested that we should introduce a system so that when a person was approaching the end of his or her eligibility for a particular benefit he or she would be notified at least two or three weeks in advance.  That is a sound suggestion and it could go a long way towards avoiding hardships.  I can assure the Deputy, and the House, that the suggestion <Col N="1570" /> will be examined sympathetically to see if it can be implemented.</P>
    <P>The question of people having to queue for home assistance was referred to by a number of Members.  It was pointed out that the fact that people had to queue was the cause of many of those in rural areas not seeking home assistance, not wanting to be identified with anything to do with the scheme.  Members felt that if the assistance could be paid by cheque it would remove a lot of the difficulty in this regard.  This is a good suggestion.  As Deputies are aware the administration of the new supplementary allowance is being transferred to the health boards.  Discussions will take place with the health boards for the handing over of staff and property associated with the old scheme and we will go into this aspect with the boards to see if it will be possible to pay recipients by cheque.</P>
    <P>I made some inquiries late last night into this matter and I was informed that it would be possible to do this in the vast majority of cases.  If it is possible it will be done because I accept that it would help considerably towards encouraging people to avail of what, with the passage of this Bill, will be their right.  The home assistance officers were referred to by many Deputies.  At the outset I paid tribute to these officers who had to administer a defective and objectionable scheme. In my opinion these officers did a tremendous service to our society.  They are recruited without any particular knowledge or expertise required in this area.  There is no training provided for them to deal with this delicate and sensitive area.  However, they managed to perform their duties within the confines of the law as it stood with compassion and concern.  In fact, these officers were to the fore in seeking the reform now before the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews and others referred to a seminar on poverty held in Kilkenny and I wish to quote two passages from a contribution to that seminar by Mr. Dick Doyle, Superintendent Assistance Officer in Waterford, which was published in <i>Social Studies,</i> August, 1972.  He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> Poverty is a way of life.  In the home assistance service we meet with poverty many times each day. We talk to those directly affected by it and are conscious of the tensions and strains under which they live. We visit their homes and meet their families.  We see their needs and are aware of how terribly inadequate our service is in treating the long-term disease that poverty can be.  Poverty is a many-sided thing. It is relative to the accepted living standards and to the area and time in which people live.</P>
    <P>He went on:</P>
    <P>The service in which I work, the public assistance service, must be given a new character.  It is a scandal that to this day no training has ever been given to assistance officers or those who supervise them.  In my view, social care at the poverty level requires a strong specialist organisation parallel with the medical aspects of community care provided for in the structure of the regional health boards.  Social care in this generation, properly planned and developed to meet the special needs of this country, is an essential if ever-greater problems are to be avoided in the years to come.  A way must be found to lead this community at all levels to its Christian duty to involvement and so make our country an example of Christianity in action that other countries might envy.</P>
    <P>That is the calibre of person whom we have been extremely fortunate to get to work in our home assistance schemes.  I say &ldquo;fortunate&rdquo; because, God knows, it was more by luck than by design that we got people of the calibre of the author of that contribution into our services.  The only people, over quite a considerable time, who were concerned in this area, who were vocal about the need for reform, were a few nuns and priests, a few social workers and home assistance officers and other people who were grouped together in many people's minds and described as, at best, dogooders and, at worst, fringe head <Col N="1572" /> cases.  Their concern and their persistence has led to what we had yesterday, a debate in our Parliament on poverty.  That is very considerable progress.  It has now brought us to what I consider to be the starting point of doing something positive about eliminating poverty.  These people deserve the thanks and appreciation of all of us for their dedication and persistence in making us as a society, as a nation, open our eyes and acknowledge that this problem exists and that it will not go away of its own accord.</P>
    <P>In regard to the transfer, discussions are taking place between the Department of Health and the trade unions catering for home assistance officers, and a training programme will be drawn up for the officers who will implement this new scheme During those discussions I hope a proper career structure can be drawn up for these officers.  Their method of recruitment left very much to be desired, some of it not particularly on merit, I am sure, because of the set up of the whole scheme.  I wonder if the reason why we have so many of these officers dedicated to their work is that, irrespective of what your view might have been beforehand, once you find yourself in the front line, once you find yourself doing what this man, the Superintendent Assis tance Officer, does &ldquo;meeting with poverty many times each day&rdquo;, no matter how cynical you might be commencing that operation, within a very short space of time you become committed and aware of the misery involved for men, women and children; you come to realise that it is man-made and that it lies within the power of man to cure it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan&mdash;I just mention this and I do not wish to be controversial about it&mdash;talked about the considerable number of men and women who are registered as unem ployed but are, in fact, unemployable. There is a lot of truth in what Deputy Brennan said.  He suggested it might be well, in the interests of these people, to consider removing them from drawing unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance <Col N="1573" /> to put them on some other form of benefit and try to cater for their overall needs.  What is not fully realised by many people is that if a man is forced to be unemployed for a considerable period of time, something can happen to that man, not physically, not something one can readily perceive, but something can happen so that after a prolonged period of enforced unemployment a man can become unemployable.  It is something psychological.  I cannot explain it but I have seen it happen.  It might be a good idea to go a little closer into the suggestion made by Deputy Brennan to see if something can be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan mentioned that factor.  I do not know whether it is geographical or not but Deputy White, who is also a Donegal Deputy, also mentioned it.  I am sure it applies to many other places.</P>
    <P>Various definitions of poverty were given in the course of the debate.  One of the best definitions of poverty is one that I quoted before in this House.  It is the definition given by the New Zealand Government in a publication some two years ago.  They defined poverty as follows:</P>
    <P>Every citizen should have a level of income which enables him to belong and to participate so that no one is to be so poor that he cannot eat the sort of food that citizens usually eat, wear the same sort of clothes, take a moderate part in those activities which the ordinary citizen takes part in as a matter of course.  The goal is to enable any citizen to meet and mix with other citizens as one of them, as a full member of the community, in brief, to belong.</P>
    <P>That is the best definition of poverty that I have heard.  I do not think there is any doubt that there are a very considerable number of people in Ireland today who cannot participate, who cannot feel that they belong.  The responsibility lies with us to ensure that they can belong and that they can belong as of right.</P>

      <P>Some are very small. I can think of one or two that I shall not name.  The population of one that I can think of is about 700 or 800.  Is the Minister satisfied that it is right to enable a very small local authority like that to employ wardens when parking problems in such towns are usually not at all acute?  Is there not some danger that town commissioners might look on this as a potential additional source of income rather than as a traffic regulatory system, particularly if the towns are very small and there is not normally a parking or similar problem?</P>

      <P>I do not agree on two counts.  First, while it is true that there are some very small town commissions there are also very large ones.  I have mentioned Mullingar, and Balbriggan is another that comes to mind where there are serious traffic problems. There are serious traffic problems in Mullingar and in a number of other places.  It would be unreal not to include those.  Secondly, as regards making it a revenue-raising function rather than anything else, I think it is unfair that this should be repeated so often because town commissioners are elected representatives.  They are not sadists and will not go out to punish somebody.  As I said on the Second Reading, we are dealing only with people who deliberately break the law.</P>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner, and I think Deputy Andrews originially, mentioned the question of how much discretion traffic wardens should have.  We must accept that traffic wardens must have a certain amount of discretion.  If any of us parks a car at present in a restricted place and either a traffic warden or a garda comes along as soon as we stop for a second and threatens to prosecute, we become annoyed.  But that does not happen as a rule.  A person who parks like this may be told: &ldquo;You cannot park there; move on.&rdquo; I assume this sort of thing will continue; but if somebody deliberately parks a car and leaves it where it is causing traffic jams, it is right that some action should be taken.  Both sides of the House will agree on that.  Unfortunately, this applies in the area of town commissioners just as it applies in urban or larger areas.  Therefore, we must include town commissioners : if we do not, we will leave a loop hole in the Bill which would be used by certain people.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  A local authority may, subject to the approval of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> (a)  make arrangements for the carrying out of the functions specified in subsection (2) of this section in the functional area of the authority and</P>
    <P>(b)  employ a person or persons to carry out such functions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During my Second Reading speech I said that the main concern I had was in connection with section 3 (1) as then drafted, and I am glad to note that the Minister has taken heed of the points made then.  There are some further objections and I have submitted a number of amendments which I think will help, including this amendment.  I should like it to be noted that the amendments do not contain any material relating to qualifications or training of traffic wardens: I assume that the Minister will deal with this matter by regulation.</P>
    <P>The main reason for this amendment is that I felt it was undesirable to remove the control at present exercised by the Garda Commissioner under existing legislation.  The Minister does not seek in the Bill to repeal the legislation, and I contend that the standard of appointment and control should be no less under this Bill.  No case has been made by the Garda Commissioner, so far as I know, that he finds the work in regard to this matter too onerous.  On the other hand I have received a number of objections from members of the gardaí, some senior members, to this subsection as it stands.  The Minister stated that he did not receive any objection from the gardaí except a letter which he received just prior to the ending of the Second Stage of the Bill.  I would assume that representations had been made by the gardaí to the Minister for Justice and that the Minister has since received from his colleague some indication or information in regard to the protests which I have no doubt the Minister for Justice received in regard to the section as it stands.</P>
    <P>The section as it stands requires the local authority to consult with the Garda Commissioner.  This is rather futile because the local authority can ignore with impunity what the Commissioner <Col N="1578" /> may suggest, even any valid objections he may have.  On the grounds that the functions now exercised by the traffic wardens and those which will be handed over to them under this Bill are garda duties I feel that the wardens now should have a direct relationship with the Garda Commissioner as they had under the previous legislation.  I think the service operated very well under the previous legislation as regards the relationship between the traffic wardens and the Garda Commissioner and it would be well worth while making the amendment we suggest here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In my Second Reading speech I quoted the recommendation from the Conroy Commission Report that &ldquo;the traffic warden system should be divorced entirely from the Garda Síochána and should be the sole responsibility of the local authority&rdquo;.  I was under the impression that this had been accepted by my predecessor and the former Government and that as a result, they were prepared to introduce a Bill to that effect.  I cannot understand their line of reasoning now.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that some of the gardaí are objecting to this.  I did mention that I had received a letter, and it is true that there have been discussions with the Minister for Justice, but there is a very important principle involved here.  This is my personal view: if we get the gardaí to vet legislation of a punitive nature such as this is before passing it through the House we are doing something which we, or somebody in the future, might regret.  It is not in order, I believe, that the matter should be dealt with in this way.  For some strange reason those who made the representations were under the impression that the matter was just as Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Andrews had stated on the Second Reading, that the Bill was introducing a new element and that traffic wardens would be controlling traffic in every way.  As I have explained, the warden's duty will be in relation to parking, tax discs and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be confused.  He referred to what our <Col N="1579" /> amendment states, &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;.  That is the wording in our amendment, not in the Minister's amendment or in the Bill.  What is in the Bill, and what presumably the Minister wants to retain is, &ldquo;may, after consultation with the Commissioner&rdquo;. There is a difference of degree only but it is a fundamental difference.  It is important to the extent that the phraseology in legislation, such as &ldquo;after consultation with&rdquo;, which is frequently used, simply means that the Minister or the local authority has to inform the Commissioner of what it is proposed to do and, having informed the Commissioner and possibly having been told by the Commissioner that he disapproves of the proposal, the Minister or the local authority can go ahead and put the proposal into effect.</P>
      <P>The amendment that Deputy Faulkner and I have put down is different from the subsection as drafted only to the extent that in addition to consultation of the nature I have described, it insists that the actual approval of the Commissioner would be obtained to the proposals of the local authority.  I do not think it is unreasonable to ask for that.  It is a modest request and we think it should be there to safeguard the overall position in relation to the appointment of traffic wardens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traffic wardens come into contact with the public to a very great degree from the time they begin work in the morning until they finish in the evening.  During the time we have had them they have had brushes with the public, and the nature of their job is such that there should be some basic overall supervisory position held by the Garda.  The most important aspect of the traffic warden in this context is the question of his appointment.  Normally, if a person is appointed to a job like this unless he seriously abuses his powers he will not be dismissed.  Therefore somebody who is appointed as a traffic warden, to all intents and purposes, will be in that position during the rest of his life.  It is important then that the Commissioner, acting through <Col N="1580" /> his local officers in the different areas, should be in a position to say in relation to a particular appointment that he has reason to believe it would be unsuitable.  The Garda Commissioner frequently has reason to believe that somebody is unsuitable though he may not make it public because of his desire to be fair to the person concerned.  He may have reason to doubt the suitability on one ground or another of a proposed appointee and he should be in a position to stop that appointment. He can do so in relation to a lot of other matters.</P>
    <P>Therefore, rather than simply have consultation with the Commissioner as subsection (1) provides, the appointment should be subject to his approval. It is taking the matter a small but an important step further.  One could have the position, particularly in the case of a small local authority, where the local authority would wish to appoint a certain person or type of person whom the local officers of the Garda would not regard as suitable for this rather delicate job which entails such a high degree of contact with the public.  It is, therefore, not unreasonable for us to ask that simple consultation with the Commissioner, whose advice could be disregarded, is not quite adequate and that the actual approval of the Commissioner to the proposed appointment should be forthcoming.  I am not suggesting that every local authority would disregard the Commissioner's advice, but in legislation we must cater for the awkward cases and for the possibility that, perhaps, one or two small local authorities might take it on themselves to try to force their views locally against the wishes of the Commissioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley is correct that I may have misquoted his amendment, which is so similar to the subsection.  There are a couple of mistakes in his argument, though I agree he made a fair argument for his case. However, responsibility for staffing does not lie with the elected representatives of local authorities but with the managers of local authorities.  We are not talking about somebody being appointed at local level by the members. We are not talking about a <Col N="1581" /> situation where the town commissioners might go out and appoint, say, a petty thief who would go round imposing on the spot fines all over the place. That is what could be understood from the arguments advanced.</P>
      <P>The local authority manager or a person delegated by him is the person who has responsibility for staffing. We have evidence of how traffic wardens are at present appointed. For instance, when a vacancy occurs in the Dublin area, Dublin Corporation advertise and among the qualifications are good health, physical fitness, good character and so forth. I expect that to continue and that these people would have to be of good character to be appointed.  If the manager consults the Garda Commissioner and, after consultation, makes the appointment, I cannot see the danger that Deputy O'Malley talks of. One important factor is, as the Conroy Commission suggested, that the responsibility for the appointments should rest with the local authorities so that we could not say we were accepting the Conroy Commission if, at the same time, we were to say that while the local authorities are responsible for these appointments, Big Daddy must decide whether any person can be appointed. If the Commissioner should be aware of any reason why a man should not be appointed, that matter, no doubt, would be brought to the notice of the manager who could then make up his mind.  If the Garda Commissioner were a one man appointments commission for the whole country I expect he would soon tire of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection states that:</P>
      <P>(1)  A local authority may, after consultation with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, make arrangements for the carrying out of the functions specified in subsection (2) of this section in the functional area of the authority by persons employed by the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I read into that was that the <Col N="1582" /> local authority would consult with the Garda Commissioner in relation to a scheme for traffic wardens rather than to relate it to the appointment of traffic wardens.  However, the Minister has suggested now that the local authority&mdash;in this case, the manager&mdash;would consult with the Commissioner regarding the appointment of traffic wardens but it does not appear that that is what is intended in the subsection but that what is intended is that the local authority would devise a scheme relating to traffic wardens and would consult with the Garda Commissioner in that regard but that this would have no bearing on the appointments.  I took it that, having consulted with the Garda Commissioner in relation to the scheme, they would make the appointments without any further reference to the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Because the duties of traffic wardens are the same as those performed by the Garda in the past and as the Garda Commissioner had a direct say in the appointment of traffic wardens up to now, I do not see why we should change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>A local authority may, with the consent of the Minister and after consultation with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, make arrangements for the carrying out in the functional area of the local authority or any part of it by persons employed for that purpose by the local authority (who shall be known, and are in this Act referred to, as traffic wardens)...</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Deputy O'Malley suggesting that any local authority would proceed to do this without the consent of the Minister?  Is he saying <Col N="1583" /> that he is prepared to withdraw his amendment and have included the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;?  Surely the consent of the Minister is accepted as being a prerequisite in all these matters</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In any of the local authority Acts, the local authorities operate with the consent of the Minister. Deputy O'Malley is trying to throw in a red herring.  I am telling him what the Opposition suggested when they were in Government and what they had prepared to put before the House.  They were right then and we are right now.  There is very little difference except that the local authorities will have the responsibility to make these appointments.  We must insist on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that this was something that had been approved by the previous Administration but it must be pointed out that no such proposal came before the House, that two-and-a-half years have elapsed since then and that, if we find there are aspects of this which we would not regard as suitable today, we are entitled to make those changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will agree that had the Bill to which he is referring but which I regard as being irrelevant since we are dealing with another Bill, come before the House there is no knowing what amendments would have been accepted or what changes would have been made before it became law. Therefore, there is no point in referring to something which the Minister says, was approved two-and-a-half years ago.  Irrespective of what was in that earlier Bill, the Minister had a certain power in previous legislation, power to which nobody, so far as I know, objected.  It is our opinion that this power should be continued in this Bill particularly since the matter under discussion relates to duties which were performed previously by the Garda.  The general public would be very much more satisfied if they <Col N="1584" /> knew that the terms under which traffic wardens were appointed were continued in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner is suggesting that traffic wardens should continue to be employees of the Department of Justice.  The whole concept of this Bill is that that will no longer be the position and that traffic wardens will be employees of local authorities.  This was one of the Conroy recommendations which was accepted by our predecessors and which is accepted by us.  There is no point in Deputy Faulkner's saying that the Opposition are now taking a more responsible view in this regard.  It is a matter which must have been given the usual very tight scrutiny.  I cannot see why a change should be considered necessary now.  The whole principle of the Bill is involved in this amendment. Either we agree that the local authorities have the responsibility of appointing traffic wardens or we agree that the Department of Justice continue the responsibility.  We cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>There is an unnecessary argumentative tone in the Minister's contributions on the amendment which I do not think warrants such a view.  However, that is a matter for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that our amendment does not, as suggested by the Minister, seek to make the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána the appointing authority.  We accept in principle that the local authority should make the appointment but we feel that a safeguard is needed and the appointment should be made subject to the approval of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  In practice he has to approve every appointment to the public service. Every appointment to the Civil Service or the Local Appointments Commission is approved by him.  The name <Col N="1585" /> and the address of a proposed appointee has to be submitted to the Secretary of the Department of Justice and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána expresses his opinion in relation to each one.  If the Commissioner disapproves of someone that person is never appointed.  Many of the jobs are of little importance.  They relate to people who will not be in contact with the public.  The posts of traffic warden may not be important financially but they are important from the point of view of the people holding them being constantly in contact with the public in a situation which can give rise to disagreements and possibly arguments.  We all know that people rightly or wrongly sometimes feel aggrieved when approached by a traffic warden or on receipt of a ticket.</P>
    <P>People appointed as traffic wardens need considerable discretion.  The best people to judge the discretion of potential employees would be the local officers of the Garda Síochána through whom the Commissioner works.  There is no question of the Commissioner being the appointing authority.  If our amendment is accepted and if a local authority drew up a list with the names of a number of people on it these names would be submitted to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  In 99 cases out of 100 the Commissioner would have no objection to making the appointments but there may be one case in 100 where he would have an objection and that objection might be a valid one in the public interest.  If he has an objection the person concerned should not be appointed to a junior although not very important post of this nature where contact with the public is so great that conflict can arise through misunderstandings, valid or otherwise, and where feelings of grievance in relation to the activities of the traffic wardens can be aroused.</P>
    <P>We are merely suggesting that the Commissioner should approve of those whom the local authority propose to appoint.  The Commissioner should be in the position of refusing to approve of someone whom he regards as unsuitable. Why should anyone be <Col N="1586" /> appointed to this service, where there is a considerable possibility of conflict with members of the public, against the wishes of the Commissioner?  As the subsection stands the appointment could be against the wishes of the Commissioner.  Consultation does not necessitate agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would be unlikely that the local authorities would take steps if the Commissioner did not approve?  The Garda know the position in regard to traffic in large towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely that the larger and more responsible local authorities would do so but all local authorities are involved in this.  Why should this House be asked to pass legislation which would permit abuses by one or two local authorities if they so desire?  We want to pass legislation to ensure that a local authority, if their members were bad-minded enough, would not be able to abuse their appointing powers?  We know that most local authorities will not do anything wrong but why leave it open to one local authority to do something wrong?</P>
      <P>Leaving such a situation in existence leaves holes in the legislation. Deputy Faulkner made the point that under subsection (1) as it stands the local authority after consultation with the Commissioner may make arrangements for the carrying-out of functions described in subsection (2).  It does not make it clear that the local authority after consultation may actually employ the people.  It seems to refer only to the functions specified in subsection 2.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the problems.  There should be a provision in subsection 1 to enable the appointments to be made.  Under the existing legislation the appointments are made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  The Minister may defeat his own purpose if he does not specifically enable the local authority to make the actual appointments.  The <Col N="1587" /> existing appointing authority under the 1961 Act may well be carried forward. In spite of the desire of the Minister and ourselves that the appointments be made by the local authority we could end up with a situation where because they are not specifically given the power, the existing appointing power would be carried over from the previous Act.  That would be the Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>

Our desire is that the appointment should be made by the local authority and that they should be given specific power as set out in our amendment and that the actual appointment should be made with the subsequent approval of the Commissioner.  That is a reasonable approach to the situation. We would thus get over the problem which may exist that there is not an existing appointing authority in this Bill.  This refers only to the functions specified in subsection 2. They do not specifically include appointments as such.</P>

      <P>The reference is as follows: it is a letter from the Secretary of the Department of Justice to the Secretary of the Department of Local Government relevant to the legislation about which we are speaking.  I am sure the Department of Justice have not changed their views and, therefore, <Col N="1589" /> I assume it to be very relevant.  He says&mdash;and the Minister was, at that time, Deputy O'Malley&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister is opposed to the continuation of the provision in the 1968 Act whereby the Commissioner may appoint &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo;. Retention of the provision would, in his opinion, be likely to lead to disputes in regard to which kind of service (warden or &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;) should be provided and he thinks it clearly preferable that the onus of providing the service in a town should be fairly and squarely on the local authority concerned.</P>
      <P>That is very definite.  This is the view of the Department of Justice now and apparently was their view when Deputy O'Malley was Minister.  In fact Deputy O'Malley says it should not be placed fairly and squarely on the Department of Justice but should be left with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  I agree with Deputy O'Malley that perhaps we are spending a lot of time on something not terribly important.  But I believe the Bill is important: either we are going to have the local authorities making the decision or we are not.  By local authorities, I mean the county managers in consultation with the Commissioner of the Garda&mdash;who I assume will not be the Commissioner but somebody acting for him.  If Deputy O'Malley is suggesting that there is in this country a county or city manager who, having received from the representative of the Commissioner of the Garda a report that a particular man or woman is not a suitable person to act as traffic warden, will continue to appoint that person, then he does not know the calibre of people appointed to jobs as city and county managers.  We should not continue this debate any longer, and I am quite sure that Deputy O'Malley will accept the justice of that argument.</P>

      <P>I thought I had made it clear but, unfortunately, even though I may have, the experience that other Members of the House have found is that the Minister for Local Government will blatantly, in the face of all the facts, make statements which he must know, if he reads the amendment or whatever is in question, are not so.</P>

      <P>The only abuse heard here this morning&mdash;and it is regrettable that there should be any on a Committee Stage of a Bill such as this, when the whole House should be endeavouring to improve the Bill&mdash;did not come from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Our amendment reads:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  A local authority may, subject to the approval of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána (a)  make arrangements for the carrying out of the functions specified in subsection (2)  of this section in the functional area of the authority and (b)  employ a person or persons to carry out such functions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Could anything be clearer than that? It is the local authority&mdash;as I pointed out rather painfully before&mdash;that is envisaged as making the appointment. Apparently that is contained in the letter which the Secretary of the Department of Justice wrote some years ago to the Secretary of the Department of Local Government.  I may or may not have been aware of what was in that letter; the probability is that I was not aware.  Nonetheless, as it happens, I agree fully with it and that is precisely what is enshrined in our amendment.  The Minister or anybody else has merely to read it: a local authority may make arrangements and employ a person or persons to carry out such functions.  What the point is of trying to allege that that means something else I do not know.  But, unfortunately that is the practice that arises with this Minister at present.  I do not propose to push it any further than that.  I do not think any further argument is likely to be fruitful.  If the Minister wants to close his mind to what is down in black and white in front of him, clearly I cannot change that, but there is provision here that the local authority shall employ the person or persons and that they shall do so subject to the approval of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> Deputy Faulkner and I made the point that subsection (1), as it stands, does not give the employing or appointing authority specifically to the local authority.  We feel it should do that because, if it does not, the existing appointing authority will be carried over, and that is the appointment by the Commissioner.  We feel that is wrong and should be changed to the local authority.</P>

      <P>By implication one could argue that that seems to envisage that appointment being made but it gives no specific power to do so.  One could argue from that, by implication, that it probably was the intention of the Legislature to give that power.  Now that our attention has been drawn to it, the Legislature should avail of this opportunity to make it specific that the local authority has the power because, if there is doubt about it, the appointing power or authority will be the existing one, carried forward, on the basis that the Legislature does not change the law unless it makes it clear that it is so doing.  As I have said, that appointing authority would be the Commissioner, which I think is wrong in spite of the Minister's efforts to try to allege that we want the Commissioner to remain.  In fact what we are trying to do here is ensure that he does not remain.  For those reasons I would commend to the Minister a careful reading of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has been speaking about a careful reading of the amendment and of being careful about everything.  I am very careful about anything I say here because <Col N="1592" /> I am conscious of the fact that I can be misrepresented.  Deputy O'Malley has made a charge here.  He asked if I knew&mdash;perhaps I was aware of the fact&mdash;that public service appointments are submitted to the Department of Justice for vetting.  Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.  That is not so.  Deputy O'Malley made the categorical statement that this is so and I want to place on record that it is not so.  This is the sort of thing that can cause a lot of trouble in other places.  There is no truth in it whatever, and it is quite misleading and incorrect to suggest that all public service appointments are submitted to the Department of Justice before appointments are made.  As Deputy O'Malley may also be aware, there may be occasions on which representations would be made that appointments should not take place.  That would be a very rare occasion.  But to say it is the general practice is not correct and takes the whole ground from beneath Deputy O'Malley's argument, that traffic wardens also should be included in these public service appointments and that they also should be vetted by the gardaí, when in fact there are no arrangements made to have that done at all.  Deputy O'Malley says he does not want to proceed any further with it.  I am quite satisfied that the section, as amended, and with the amendment I propose later on, will do exactly what we want done.</P>

      <P>3.  In page 2, to delete lines 27 to 33, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The functions referred to in subsection (1) of this section are&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already indicated, in reply to the Second Stage, that I would have the question of eliminating any ambiguity which Deputy Faulkner felt there was in the text of this section looked into.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this amendment which is precisely on the lines advocated by Deputy Faulkner and other Deputies from this side of the House.  This is as the Bill should be.  Potentially the Bill as it was gave power to traffic wardens to deal with every possible offence under the Road Traffic Acts.  That would have been unthinkable to our eyes.  They clearly should be confined to matters relating to parking and the stopping of vehicles and matters related to the display or non-display of tax discs. This makes a major change in the Bill which we welcome.  We are glad the change has been made because if this had not been done we could not have supported a Bill which would have purported to give power to traffic wardens to deal with serious offences such as drunken driving or dangerous driving causing death which carries a penalty of three or four years' imprisonment.  The matter is now made clear by this important amendment which was suggested by this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 42, to add a subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  A traffic warden appointed under this section may be dismissed by the Chief Superintendent for the Division in which such warden is employed whenever, after consultation with the manager of the local authority, such Chief Superintendent is satisfied that such dismissal is warranted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána, at various levels, have expressed a considerable disquiet about aspects of the Bill and about the fact that traffic wardens who are dealing with the public in a sphere in which arguments and conflict could arise did not appear to be subject to any form of discipline other than the <Col N="1596" /> normal type of discipline which would apply to public servants generally.  For that reason we feel that if a traffic warden has shown over a period that he is unsuitable for the position he holds the Garda chief superintendent for the division concerned should be in a position, after consultations with the manager of the local authority who appointed the man, to dismiss the traffic warden if he is satisfied that such a dismissal is warranted.  In the case of the Garda Síochána, who, apart from Dublin and perhaps other cities, have been dealing with traffic regulations up to now, if any member of that force were in any way to abuse his position or his powers, there is adequate machinery within the Garda force, due to the hierarchical nature of the command there, to ensure that that man is, in the first instance, advised not to abuse his powers, and, if he persists in doing so, taken off that type of work or some form of discipline applied so that the abuse of his powers comes to an end.</P>
    <P>With the traffic warden set-up as proposed in this Bill, where the appointment is being made by local authorities, it is essential that more than just the normal local authority or public service non-Garda discipline could be applied because of the possibility that in some cases there might be an abuse of powers by traffic wardens.  In the last resort we believe it should be a matter for the chief superintendent of the division concerned to take these disciplinary actions if they were not taken by the local authority.</P>
    <P>The manager of a local authority may well find himself in a difficulty in practice, in that people who are appointed as traffic wardens would, I presume, join a trade union, as they are entitled to do.  Members of the Garda Síochána, of course, cannot by law, join a trade union, for good reason.  If all the traffic wardens in the country or in a particular local authority were to join a trade union, the manager could find himself in a weaker position in regard to them than he would otherwise be in.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the wardens would not be entitled to <Col N="1597" /> join a trade union.  I am saying that, as a matter of probability, that is what they will do, as is their right.  The imposition, therefore, of discipline on people who are carrying out functions that are exactly the same as those carried out by members of the Garda Síochána at the moment could, in those circumstances, be prejudiced, and the manager of the local authority, with the best will in the world, might not have the type of control over them that he might wish to have, and when I say &ldquo;over them&rdquo; I mean only such a traffic warden, if any, as might be found over a period to abuse his powers.  In the last resort, if that situation were to arise, a chief superintendent should be in a position to protect the public interest by being able to step in and impose the ultimate disciplinary action if lesser disciplinary action had failed up to then.</P>
    <P>I do not envisage that a power such as this would frequently have to be used.  I would envisage that it would have to be used very rarely indeed, if ever, but the fact that that power is there might in itself be a very good reason for its not ultimately having to be used.  For these reasons I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that when the last amendment on which we voted had been defeated the Opposition would withdraw this one.  The effect of this amendment would be to keep the involvement of the Garda Commissioner in the warden service.  The Bill provides for the establishment of the service by local authorities and, as I said before, this is not another police force, and I am surprised that this has not been understood or apparently has been misunderstood by the Opposition.  The Bill provides for establishment of the warden service by local authorities, subject to consultation with the Garda Commissioner. Recruitment, pay, discipline and so on would be matters entirely for the local authority.  It would be impractical therefore that dismissals should fall to be dealt with by the chief superintendent of the division in which such wardens would be employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dublin area the existing service <Col N="1598" /> is run entirely by the corporation and that includes recruitment, pay, discipline and so on.  Garda functions are confined to recommendations as to what beats wardens should serve. Minor breaches of discipline such as late for duty, caught off the beat and so on are dealt with by the corporation. The wardens' rights will be adequately protected.  As Deputy O'Malley says, they will almost certainly become members of a trade union, as indeed wardens in Dublin are, and supervisory staff also operate in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the local authority are not capable of running their own warden service as is implied in the amendment is unfair, and I am quite sure the local authorities will, as they have, in the case of so many other far more important services where employment dealing with the public is concerned, perform this function satisfactorily.  Therefore I do not think it would be in order to have somebody from the Garda Síochána, such as a chief superintendent, coming in for the purpose of dealing with some unspecified offence which would result in the dismissal of a warden. Just imagine a warden being dismissed and the case being taken to either a rights commissioner or the Labour Court where there would be a certain amount of publicity and the only evidence would be that of the chief superintendent.  How would he give his evidence?  This is the sort of thing that should not be allowed.  If they are employees of the local authority, the local authority should be responsible for dismissal, if dismissal is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, unfortunately, has a habit of attributing to people remarks which they never made.  I never suggested in my remarks&mdash;and the record will certainly bear this out&mdash;that the local authority would be unable to run the service. What I said was that, in matters of discipline, the city manager, as I suppose it would normally be&mdash;in some instances it might be the county manager&mdash;would find himself inevitably in a difficulty in relation to disciplining a particular traffic warden.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have already explained this.  If there is a conflict of opinion, for example, as to whether or not the activities of a particular traffic warden are improper or excessive or an abuse of his powers &mdash;and there may well be a <i>bona fide</i> conflict of opinion between the city manager on the one part, and the trade union to which the warden belongs on the other part&mdash;the manager may find himself in a difficulty in which the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána would not find himself if some conflict of opinion were to arise between himself and his officers, on the one part, and some member of the force, on the other part.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that Dublin Corporation, under the existing scheme, have been recruiting and supervising the wardens there; of course, the local authorities have not done this in any other part of the country; it has been done by the Commissioner with the wardens operating out of Garda stations.  I would like the Minister to give us some idea how, in fact, Dublin Corporation have got on in this regard, because I would not have, and I suppose no Deputies would have, any knowledge of how these aspects of the employment of wardens by Dublin Corporation have gone.  In particular, I have in mind the disciplinary aspect of it, whether any problems have arisen in relation to Dublin and, if so, the manner in which they have been resolved, because if the experience there was genuinely satisfactory, I would feel less need to push this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell Deputy O'Malley that, strange as it may seem, there are no problems between the corporation and the wardens.  The person who is aggrieved need not pay the fine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is, but it does not mean that there has to be a dispute. They can go to court, as Deputy <Col N="1600" /> O'Malley is aware.  There has been no difficulty such as he has envisaged with the employment of the wardens or need for dismissal of them with Dublin Corporation.  There have been no disputes of that kind.  Cork Corporation have employed 13 wardens recently for the purpose of their new ticket parking system and they employ them themselves.  It is a relatively new thing.  As far as Dublin is concerned, there has been no difficulty. I could see extreme difficulty arising in the event of an employee of a local authority being dismissed by somebody other than that local authority.</P>
      <P>If a dispute does arise there is the necessary legislation which has been in existence for many years whereby they can take it to court, the Labour Court, or to a rights commissioner. The matter can be dealt with in the normal way that these things are dealt with.  It would be an extremely dangerous thing to have somebody who had no connection with the local authority having the right&mdash;I assume from what Deputy O'Malley said the same right as with the guards&mdash;that he could just dismiss somebody if he felt he should be dismissed even though the manager felt that he should not be dismissed, because this is the only place where it would arise. If he should be dismissed the manager would take the necessary action and that would be the end of it.  He would go to the Labour Court or he would accept the dismissal.  What Deputy O'Malley is suggesting is, I assume, unless I am misunderstanding him, that in the case where this did not happen, where somebody, a chief superintendent of the Garda felt that somebody should be dismissed it would be right that he should dismiss him whether the manager thought that that was right or not.  I could see extreme difficulty in the administration of it.  So far, there have been no difficulties in the administration in Dublin.</P>

      <P>In subsection (3), line 25, there is provision for the affixing of a notice to a vehicle where <Col N="1603" /> an alleged offence has been committed and the wording is:</P>
      <P>Where a traffic warden has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence to which this section applies, involving the use of a mechanically propelled vehicle, is being or has been committed, he may affix to the vehicle a notice....</P>
      <P>In practice, what happens is that the warden finds a car parked somewhere where it should not be or parked in a place for longer than it should be and he affixes a notice.  That is fair enough. The offence there is being committed but the clause immediately after that is &ldquo;or has been committed&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It was a clearway for a period and it has been cleared and the car is still there, it has been committed. The car has been there during the period.  The disc was affixed to it immediately afterwards.  The Deputy will agree that it is necessary to tie up all the points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, subject to this: in my view there should be some form of time limit because the words &ldquo;or has been committed&rdquo; could mean six months ago or it could be a week ago.  It could even be the previous day. You could have a situation that a car was parked wrongly on a double yellow line, or something of that nature.  No notice is affixed but it is noticed by the traffic warden who, for one reason or another does not affix the notice.  The driver drives it a mile or two away and parks it outside his home.  The traffic warden can affix a <Col N="1604" /> notice to it there in relation to an alleged offence which has been committed. That is wrong.  I am not saying it is likely to happen very often but the fact that it is not likely to happen very often is no argument for having in the Bill a provision that would enable it to happen.  It is wrong because there is no time limit of any kind.  The only situation, I would suggest, where a notice can be affixed to a vehicle other than where the offence is being committed is in the very type of situation that the Minister mentioned himself.  The offence has been committed because the circumstances had changed but the vehicle had not been moved, from where it originally or previously committed the offence by being there.  If the vehicle had been moved, in my view it would be an abuse of the powers of the warden to affix a fine on the spot notice.  A much more appropriate procedure in the kind of example I have given would be for the Garda Síochána to proceed by way of summons.  It would be quite inappropriate in the circumstances outlined for a warden to use his powers in affixing a notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question but that a person always has the option; that is not in dispute, but if an offence were committed by a vehicle some hours previously, and <i>a fortiori,</i> some days before, that offence that may have been committed in the past should not be proceeded with by affixing a ticket, as it is called, but should be prosecuted by the Garda by summons. No time limit is established here; it could be as long as six months. Probably in practice this is not likely to happen very often but in a small locality you could have a situation where, if a warden had noticed an offence at a certain time when perhaps he was not on duty or did not have any tickets with him, but goes to the person's house the following day, finds the car parked there and then affixes a ticket in relation to the alleged offence of the previous day. That would be unsatisfactory.  It should <Col N="1605" /> not be open to a warden to do that. Under the phraseology of subsection (3) I fear it would be open to the warden to do this.  Therefore, although we have no amendment as of now, I think an amendment should be put down either by the Minister or by us with his agreement for the Report Stage which would limit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not forget anything. Poor Aunt Sally is getting a terrible bashing today.  As the Deputy says, the possibility of this happening is very slight and it is existing law for both guards and traffic wardens that is involved.  We have no complaints of anybody going about looking for somebody against whom he has a grievance and putting a ticket on his car six months after he was alleged to have parked in a restricted area.  This is necessary particularly because of clearways.  Possibly, the Deputy says, a time limit could be imposed.  I do not know if this is necessary and it does throw the whole matter of the validity of this provision into question. If it had to be amended now, one would probably end up with a court case.  If by any stretch of imagination what the Deputy suggests did happen, I do not think anybody would accept a ticket put on his car six months, or even a week after it was alleged to have been parked somewhere.  I believe such a person would go to court and I am sure the matter would be dealt with pretty quickly.</P>
      <P>As of now, I cannot see any merit in the Deputy's suggestion but if he is prepared to accept this I shall have the matter fully investigated in the Department and see if (a) there is merit in it and (b) if it has merit, is there a way in which it can be dealt with.  I am prepared to consider putting in an amendment for the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The amendment could be a very simple one, to insert after the words &ldquo;has been committed&rdquo; words such as &ldquo;within the last six hours&rdquo; or &ldquo;four hours&rdquo; or &ldquo;two hours&rdquo;, whatever period would be considered reasonable.  The fact that this provision in this form is in the existing law is no argument for perpetuating it.  There are many things in many Acts which, on reflection, everybody probably agrees should not be there and, in practice, these are frequently discovered to be unsatisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fairly sweeping statement.  The Minister would probably not be in a position to know if it has caused a problem.  One reason why it has not caused any widespread problem very probably is that, for the most part, the law up to now in relation to these matters has been administered by the gardaí rather than by traffic wardens and the general experience of the public who come in contact with both is that the Garda Síochána have a higher degree of discretion and tend to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister hear me out?  I am saying that the gardaí are well known to believe to a greater extent in the application of the spirit of the law rather than the strict letter of the law.  Part of the reason why there may not have been complaints about this in the past is that the gardaí would not, after any interval at all, affix a fine-on-the-spot notice.  They would proceed by way of summons if they thought it appropriate or necessary to prosecute.  It is not open to the traffic wardens to proceed by summons in matters like this. Their only power would be to affix a notice.  I am satisfied that affixing a notice after a significant interval has <Col N="1607" /> elapsed is wrong.  Unfortunately, it is open for that to happen here.  I think the situation should be changed and this could be done by a very minor amendment&mdash;and if the Minister would agree it could be taken now&mdash; to insert after the words &ldquo;has been committed&rdquo; some words to the effect of &ldquo;within the past three hours&rdquo; or whatever period is considered appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I assume that when the measure was being introduced it must have been considered by the legal sections of the Department of Local Government and the Department of Justice that this was the proper way to do it.  That being so, I cannot see what is wrong with it.  I could understand the argument if this was something likely to cause trouble and while, as Deputy O'Malley says, I have no way of knowing that trouble has not been caused, I do not think that a person appointed as a garda or a traffic warden would be so vindictive as to go after somebody and put on a ticket on his vehicle hours afterwards.  The whole matter of the discretion used <Col N="1608" /> by traffic wardens is something local authorities should provide for when appointing traffic wardens.  I have read several excerpts from Dublin Corporation's advertisements.  Dublin Corporation have training sessions where they advise wardens what should be done in certain circumstances. A warden guilty of putting on a ticket hours after the person had left the scene would find himself in very serious trouble with those who employ him.  I do not think we need to worry too much about this for the reasons I have given.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 12, after &ldquo;a traffic warden&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in uniform&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I pointed out at Second Stage the reason why I should be moving this amendment.  Subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P>Where a traffic warden requests or demands information of a person under this section, the person shall not be bound to comply with the request or demand unless the warden produces, if requested by the person, official identification of his identity.</P>
      <P>I pointed out earlier that this leaves it open to any person to request this information from the traffic warden.  If a member of the public is not aware of his rights and does not know he is entitled to request the warden to show his identification, a very strange and difficult situation could arise, one which we should not tolerate.  This amendment would overcome that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  The effect of the amendment is to ensure that traffic wardens would be in uniform in the course of their duties.  It is not considered advisable to specify in the Bill that wardens should wear uniforms.  If &ldquo;uniform&rdquo; is to be included, the exact type would have to be specified&mdash;we would have to give a detailed description of colour, type, length of jacket and so forth.  This would lead to an unnecessary cumbersome procedure.  At present the colour of uniforms worn by wardens in Dublin and Cork is brown but some local authorities may wish to use a different colour and it may be advisable to have a uniform colour throughout the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be different opinions on this point.  Under the conditions of their employment in Dublin, it is stipulated that wardens must wear uniforms while on duty, and what can be done administratively by one local authority can be done by others.  In any event, it is considered undesirable to specify &ldquo;uniform&rdquo; in the Bill.  It is a matter entirely for local authorities and I should be surprised if any local <Col N="1610" /> authority would not have a particular arrangement.  I am sure local authorities will ensure that wardens will have some kind of identity.  Some local authorities may not be in a position to provide full uniforms.  They might decide on an arm band or something like that.  Of course the public are protected by the right of a person to request identification from a warden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid this leaves the legislation rather loose. Would not the Minister agree that the vast majority of those who commit traffic offences would be unaware of the fact that they could request official identification from the persons who ask them for their names and addresses? As the Bill is, people who are not traffic wardens might, perhaps for undesirable reasons, go around asking people for their names and addresses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When traffic wardens were established they were not dressed as they are now.  In some places they had simply a cap and jacket.  There are numerous people in important jobs of protection duties who wear arm bands and caps.  If local authorities, particularly small ones, are to set up warden services I am sure they will not be anxious immediately to start talking about providing full dress uniforms for them.  Some local authorities might employ only three or four.  Some wardens might be small, might leave their jobs, and the local authority would be forced to buy more uniforms for bigger recruits.  I think we are over-playing this.  If we <Col N="1611" /> leave it, ultimately it is a matter which will settle itself as it has in Dublin and Cork.  I do not think we should make it compulsory as Deputy Esmonde has so rightly said.  We do not have to be terribly well up to know our rights.  We will not give our names and addresses to a person unless we think he is entitled to have them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister put forward the practical point that some of the uniforms might be big and some might be small.  The uniforms do not all have to be the same colour, nor is that what Deputy Faulkner is requesting.  He is requesting a standard. I would hope that a uniform as such will be used.</P>
      <P>In the course of their duties the Garda wear uniforms with numbers which make them readily identifiable in case a member of the public wants to issue a complaint.  This is the case in the cities.  In the country people would be likely to know who the wardens were.  In the cities where they would not know them personally, there should be some way of identifying them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I see Deputy O'Kennedy's point.  The only thing a traffic warden can do is put a ticket on a car or ask for a name and address.  If the person is dissatisfied, he can go to court.  It does not cost him anything until he goes to court. I agree with what Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Faulkner have said.  My personal preference would be that all traffic wardens should wear the same uniform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it would be better if all traffic wardens were dressed the same so that when people saw them they would know they were traffic wardens whether they were in Galway, or Dublin, or Mullingar. Before a traffic warden can be employed a supply of uniforms must be available.  I should like to see this Bill in operation pretty quickly.  I have had <Col N="1612" /> experience of unnecessary traffic jams in the past few weeks caused by people who persisted in parking illegally.  The only people who will be affected by this are people who break the law deliberately.  This would hold up the whole idea of instituting a traffic wardens' system for a longer period.  I should like to see the Bill passed as it is.  I am quite sure that provision will be made by local authorities to ensure that their wardens are identifiable.</P>

      <P>I will be giving instructions to the local authority as to how they should operate this Bill.  The question whether there should be a stipulation that they must all wear a uniform could be considered.  I do not think it should be insisted on from the start.  Possibly it could be insisted that they should wear an arm band or a cap or something like that which would identify them.  I would agree that possibly this would be of assistance and I would be prepared to consider that.</P>

      <P>From the point of view of presentation and regularity it would be more effective in relation to public reaction that they should wear a uniform.  A person with an arm band or a cap, and the proper authority under this Bill, could present himself and the public reaction to such a person might not be what the Minister would wish.  We would all like to see our public officials properly presented.  Apart from hygiene and presentation, this would guarantee the proper public reaction.  The argument about external identification by numbers particularly in the cities is a question of the individual's right.</P>

      <P>These two amendments are very important in spite of what the Minister says.  &ldquo;A person who obstructs a traffic warden acting in the course of his duty shall be guilty of an offence...&rdquo;  The Minister said a person is entitled to demand official identification.  In practice, the demand will be too late and the offence will have been committed. Obstruction of a traffic warden usually consists of some remark being made to him when he approaches a motorist.  In practice what will happen is that a traffic warden not in uniform will approach a motorist and say something to him to the effect that he should not be parked there, or where is his tax disc, or why did he not pay his tax, to which the reply will be: &ldquo;What the hell has it got to do with you?  Go to blazes&rdquo;, or words to that effect.  The traffic warden then announces for the first time that he is a traffic warden.  The person asks for identification.  He gets it presumably, but the offence has been committed and the person is liable to conviction.</P>
      <P>It is elementary to ask that traffic wardens on duty should wear a uniform particularly if you are creating the offence in legislation of obstructing a traffic warden.  It is totally unreasonable to create that offence in relation to a warden who is not in uniform and people are not in a position to know he is a warden. I said several times that it is not enough for the Minister to say he will tell the local authorities to ensure that he wears a uniform.  That is not legislation.  Legislation is what is here in front of us.  If we pass this Bill as it is, there is nothing to compel a local authority to put any of their wardens into a uniform and offences can be committed by unsuspecting members of the public who would not have committed them if the traffic wardens had been in uniform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering a matter such as this we have to think of the rights and interests not just of Irish citizens and Irish residents but of foreigners as well.  The variety of uniforms of one kind or another which they may see is <Col N="1614" /> extremely confusing to foreigners.  If every local authority are to have different uniforms for their traffic wardens foreigners, in particular, as well as many Irish people will be totally confused.  If some local authorities are to have no uniforms at all, what chance have foreigners, whatever about local residents, of identifying them?  What is the attitude of tourists likely to be in a situation such as that?  It is quite unreasonable that this type of situation should be forced on them.  It is very elementary that the simple words &ldquo;in uniform&rdquo; should be added on the two occasions in this section where they arise after the words &ldquo;A traffic warden&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I pointed out to the Minister that the offence of obstructing a traffic warden or, under subsection (3), of refusing to give the name and address, will have taken place before the citizen had the opportunity, even if he knew all his rights, of discovering that the man he obstructed or allegedly obstructed during the course of his duties was a traffic warden and was on duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>But would the same situation not arise with a plain-clothes member of the Garda Síochána?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As he approaches the person he produces his identification, as he is bound to do.  If he is on duty he must say he is a member of the Garda Síochána on duty and produce his identification.  You have then the situation that the warden has to be acting in the course of his duty and, if he is not in uniform, it will be very confusing indeed for the average motorist, whether Irish or foreign; the motorist will not know, first of all, whether or not the man is a warden and, secondly, whether or not he is on duty.  Surely a simple provision that he be in uniform before this offence of obstructing is committed is a basic one and I would recommend it strongly to the Minister.  His argument about uniforms not being available is just not good enough because presumably no local authority will order a whole pile of uniforms before recruiting these people.  The wardens will have to be measured.  The uniforms will not be <Col N="1615" /> available for two or three weeks, or whatever time it takes to make uniforms, and they will not be ordered, I hope, before these people are appointed.  Each uniform will have to be made to measure.</P>
      <P>The Minister's arguments in relation to the problems that would arise are equally valid in relation to the Garda Síochána.  Certain members are not expected, or are not allowed in some instances, to wear a uniform while other members have to wear a uniform when on duty.  Before a person is put in the position here of committing an offence by obstructing there should be a proviso that traffic wardens must be in uniform.</P>

      <P>I shall not labour it but it is my personal opinion that there should be some visual method of identification.  If I were to write into the Bill that traffic wardens shall wear a type of uniform two of the Members <Col N="1616" /> across the way would have great sport in the courts arguing as to whether or not the uniform was or was not of the type laid down in the Bill.  What I propose to do is instruct local authorities that there must be some type of identification worn and there must be a number worn to ensure the traffic warden is identifiable.  I assume local authorities will eventually have standard uniforms but I am not prepared to accept an amendment writing into the Bill that a uniform will have to be worn because, following on that, we would have to say the type and so on. I do not think this is reasonable.  I am giving an assurance now to the House that I will instruct local authorities to have some method of identification. That is as far as I am prepared to go.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Faulkner and his colleagues that I will give this instruction about some form of outward identification but I will not provide what that identification must be because that again might give rise to arguments in court as to whether or not the identification was sufficient. There could be all sorts of difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's word but, as I listened to Deputy O'Malley, I became more convinced than ever of the need for what he and Deputy Faulkner are proposing.  I am thinking particularly of tourists.  It is important there should be standardisation in this area.  We must do all we can to avoid difficulties.  You could have 20, 25 or 30 different types of uniform and that would certainly not help the tourist who might unwittingly break the law.  If that is ensured against then I will be satisfied.  The reason for having uniforms is for the purpose of standardisation.  There is a later section under which the Minister can make regulations and I cannot see why the Minister could not prescribe by way of regulation that there should be a specified standard type of uniform. That would be more effective and expeditious from the point of view of what the Minister wants to do.  There <Col N="1617" /> might be a few weeks delay.  I would certainly hope there would not be different types of uniforms or different identification from local authority to local authority.  Compare this with the position in European countries and you quickly see the arguments in favour of a specified uniform throughout the country are quite overwhelming.  I accept the Minister's word but it is not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared under the section mentioned to try to tie this up but, quite frankly, I am still not convinced we should stipulate in the section that there must be a type of uniform because this could cause trouble.  Regulations can be made. My personal preference is, as I said, for a uniform uniform.  In the meantime it may be necessary to have a cap and armbands and a number until we get fully away.  With large authorities there would not be much difficulty but there could be extreme difficulty with small authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree it is undesirable a person would have authority to interrogate someone else without having some identification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the traffic warden is wearing a cap and armband that should be sufficient identification and I propose to deal with that under section 6.  We are dealing here with section 4.  Deputy O'Malley is anxious to keep this debate going as long as he can.  If his two colleagues are prepared to accept something as reasonable I do not see how he can find is so unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I have not, as a matter of principle, ever taken part in Committee Stages on Bills dealing with the Department of Local Government.  One of the reasons for this is because of certain things I have been told.  Rather tragically, <Col N="1618" /> on this unimportant Bill, I have found that what I have been told is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I object profoundly to these remarks.  My record in this House is better than that of the Deputy's.  I can get on with anybody here so long as he is reasonable.  I have proved that today by accepting reasonable amendments, but I do not want any smart alec remarks from the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Every word uttered underlines more strongly what I was told.  Therefore, for the course of this Dáil, I shall not deal with any further Committee Stage business concerning the Department of Local Government.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that under section 4 a person can commit the offence of obstructing a traffic warden who is not in uniform, without knowing that that person is a traffic warden.  That is unreasonable and unfair to the average citizen or non-citizen.  There is no obligation under this section that the traffic warden should wear a uniform.  The Minister says he will instruct them to wear uniforms and I have no doubt that he will do so but they are not necessarily obliged to comply with such a direction.  It may happen that some traffic wardens may decide not to comply with the direction but they would still be within the terms of the section.  A citizen could be charged with the offence of obstructing a traffic warden without ever having had the opportunity of knowing that the person concerned was employed in that capacity.  It would be too late for identification to be demanded and produced subsequently because the offence would have been committed, and committed unwittingly and unintentionally.  That is wrong, and the fact that the Minister proposes at some subsequent date to direct the warden to wear uniform is of no value to the person charged with the offence of obstructing one of those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been discussion as to the advisability of having a certain type of uniform for the whole country.  This is not relevant.  All the amendment seeks <Col N="1619" /> is to insert the words &ldquo;in uniform&rdquo;. What that means can be covered subsequently by regulation, but it has to be a uniform of a type that would make it easy not only for Irish people but for foreigners also to identify a person as a traffic warden.  The Minister has spoken of the possibility of some traffic wardens wearing caps and armbands.  That would be totally inadequate. It would be little better than no uniform.  A person who, to many motorists, will appear as an ordinary private citizen, may approach them and make remarks which will cause motorists, in replying, to commit the offence of obstructing a traffic warden. That remains the position and it is immaterial that the Minister may, under a subsequent section, advise local authorities to ensure that traffic wardens wear uniform.</P>
    <P>There is no obligation under section 4 (1) for the traffic warden to wear a uniform so that the offence of obstructing one of these people can and, presumably, will take place by citizens who are not in a position to know that they are speaking with a traffic warden. If we are to create offences which people can commit, it is elementary that the people concerned should be put in the position of not committing the offence unless they know clearly that the person is a traffic warden.</P>
    <P>If somebody obstructs a garda who happens to be in plain clothes, it is accepted frequently by the court as a valid defence that the defendant did not know that the person he was obstructing was a garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that each local authority could, unless the Minister instructed them to the contrary, <Col N="1620" /> have different uniforms but at least these would be recognisable as uniforms. It is not a question of whether everybody wears the same type of uniform.  It is a question of it being wrong that any citizen or non-citizen be allowed to commit an offence in circumstances in which he would not have known that the person he was obstructing was a traffic warden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, the courts would have a field day in attempting to define what was a uniform. Deputy O'Malley knows well that attempts have been made here and elsewhere to define what is a uniform but that these have not been very successful.  In response to what Deputy O'Kennedy said, I have indicated my preparedness to stipulate that traffic wardens must wear some outward evidence which identifies them specifically as traffic wardens.  However, I am advised that if I were to include this in the Bill, it would be necessary to specify what that uniform should be.  I am prepared, when giving the instruction to the local authorities, to stipulate (1) that traffic wardens wear apparel which is outward evidence that they are wardens and, (2) that they will have a distinct number by which they can be identified.  I cannot go further than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put my own position clearly on the record. When I suggested that section 6 would allow the Minister to make regulations by order I was thinking of the nature of the uniform.  The principle is still the same.  That is the principle enunciated clearly by Deputy O'Malley&mdash;that traffic wardens wear uniform.  I accept what the Deputy says.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In relation to the Minister's remark as to the courts having a field day, Deputy Esmonde or any lawyer can tell him that in relation to a phrase such as &ldquo;in uniform&rdquo;, the courts will give it its ordinary meaning.  It is not necessary to define in an Act what is meant by &ldquo;in uniform&rdquo;.  It is a term in standard usage and will be interpreted by the courts as such.  What is being sought <Col N="1621" /> by Deputies O'Malley and Faulkner is reasonable.  It would be for the Minister subsequently in the regulations under section 6 to deal with the matter as suggested.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 31, after &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;, save that offences under section 3 (5) or section 4 of this Act shall not be prosecuted without the consent in writing of the Superintendent of the Garda Síochána in whose district the offence is alleged to have been committed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Might I refer, first of all, to section 3, subsection (5).  My first inclination in relation to this was to move the deletion of the subsection because, in my view, this power can be properly exercised only by the Garda Síochána.  As it stands it seems to me to be completely unsuitable to this Bill.  It would be worthwhile contrasting the subsection with the other subsections of section 3.  If this is done it will be clearly seen that it stands out on its won, apart altogether from the scheme of the Bill. The other offences, apart from this one and the related ones in section 4, are in relation to parking offences and to tax discs.  The offence outlined in section 5 refers to quite a different offence.  I feel that the safeguards we are asking for here are reasonable.  I believe what we are proposing will bring the matter into line with the existing legislation, particularly section 103 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.</P>

      <P>Liability for prosecution for offences by local authorities is not new in local government law.  Under the Housing Act, 1966 and the Planning and Development Act, 1963 housing or planning authorities may prosecute for offences under these Acts.  For this reason I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by the Parliamentary Secretary has no validity whatever.  It is a joke to come in and make that point.  We all know that local authorities have been able to prosecute.  They have been able to do so as far back as the Public Health Acts of the 1860s and the 1870s and, perhaps, even before that.  That is no answer to the argument at all.  We object to saying that they shall be entitled to prosecute for offences that are <Col N="1627" /> not simply parking offences or tax discs offences but are quasi-criminal offences, such as the ones set out in section 3 (5), the removal of an affixed notice and the two offences under section 4, obstruction of a traffic warden and refusal of a name and address.</P>
      <P>These are, at the very least, quasi-criminal offences.  They are the sort of offences which should not be prosecuted without the knowledge and approval of the Garda.  The Garda, because they are criminal or at the least quasi-criminal offences, should be consulted about them and should approve of the prosecution being taken.  I would prefer to see the Garda actually take part in the prosecution of the offences afterwards in court.  Even if they did not any prosecution for such a criminal offence as obstruction, refusal to give a name and address or removing notices, should certainly have the imprimatur of the local officer of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>These are not just trivial matters where the person can pay £2, if he wants to, or, if he does not, go to court.  These are not just technical matters, whether or not an offence is committed and there is no great question of <i>mens rea</i> or anything of that nature.  These are criminal or quasi-criminal charges and it is not right that they should be prosecuted by a local authority without the consent and imprimatur of the local officer of the Garda Síochána, who would be the superintendent for the district in which the offence is alleged to have been committed.</P>

      <P>There is the fisheries code under which prosecutions are brought up without consultation with the Garda authorities and for which there can be quite serious penalties.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is an assault the normal procedure is for the State to prosecute.  Deputy Esmonde must be aware that fishery boards, particularly the bigger ones, have considerable experience of these matters and <Col N="1628" /> they employ solicitors who advise them on the propriety or otherwise of the particular prosecution.  There is no proviso for that here.  The warden can bring the prosecution in the name of the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice that is always done, but solicitors will not be involved on behalf of local authorities who prosecute in relation to those petty offences.  Those offences are far too trivial to warrant that.  If there was some proviso that the local authority solicitor would have to approve of the prosecution that would be all right with me, but assuming solicitors are not being brought into it the very least that should be done is that the local officer of the Garda Síochána will give his approval.  He may not subsequently take part in the prosecution. I would prefer if he did but that would not be necessary and presumably would not be done.  At least he should give his authority to the bringing of a prosecution, not for the trivial offences of parking and tax discs, but for the criminal or quasi-criminal offences of obstruction, refusing to give name and address, removing notices and things of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That proposal would surely run contrary to what this Bill attempts to achieve, that is to alleviate unnecessary and burdensome duties of Garda Síochána officers.  As the Deputy knows, as a practitioner going into the district court, these come in as rafts of petty offences and charges and they are dealt with rather like cases of no lights on a bicycle.  It is ridiculous tying up officers of the Garda Síochána in that type of work. This view has long been held by the legal profession and the Garda authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Esmonde understands, as I made it clear, that we are not talking about the rafts of petty offences but about the occasional serious offences.  I <Col N="1629" /> made it clear that there is no question of the superintendent being consulted about prosecutions for, as the Deputy rightly says, the rafts of trivial offences, such as tax discs, parking and that kind of thing.</P>
      <P>Section 5 and the amendment to it apply only to offences under section 3 (5) or section 4.  There are only three offences we seek to cover in this way to protect the citizen.  They cannot arise very often.  Some local authorities might perhaps have only one or two in a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect of this, which might be read into the Deputy's amendment and his approach to it&mdash;I do not think the Deputy intended this&mdash;is that a district justice who would be trying the matter is a rubber stamp and a pro prosecution individual in relation to matters like this.  If the Deputy says these have a certain element of seriousness I would imagine they would require exact proof.  I would imagine a district justice would know what to do in the circumstances.  Even though it was brought by a traffic warden, some local authority or whoever brings the complaint it would have to be proved accordingly.  As the Deputy knows the general attitude of incumbents of the benches is that if there is a serious aspect in a case it is dealt with on a serious basis and requires very strict and proper proof and investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two distinct categories of cases.  There is one which is not proved to the satisfaction of a district justice and is, therefore, dismissed.  Naturally one assumes and expects that a district justice would dismiss a case that is not proved.  The district justice has to do it but there is another category, the case that should never have been brought.  The Garda superintendent or the local authority solicitor would be in the best position to judge whether or not a case should have been brought. From time to time cases are brought before a court which should never have been brought.  Needless to say they are dismissed, but that is not enough.  A citizen is entitled to protection against a prosecution in circumstances <Col N="1630" /> that he should never have been prosecuted.</P>
      <P>If a man of experience like a Garda superintendent is involved in these matters he knows when not to prosecute. It is not enough for the citizen simply not to be convicted.</P>

      <P>I am in a peculiar position in relation to this amendment.  As a member of a local authority I can envisage situations where traffic wardens will have a great deal of consultation with the law agent of a local authority in future.  I can envisage some chaotic confusion emerging.  Nevertheless, I wonder does Deputy O'Malley want to put Garda superintendents in an invidious position in relation to this section.  My view is that the Bill is there.  I look forward to the day when my constituents will be asking me to make representations to the law agent to have prosecutions deferred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is why, as a member of a local authority I have expressed my unhappiness about sections of the Bill.  I am not so sure at this stage of the Bill that Garda superintendents will be desirous of having under the Bill to give consent for the prosecutions in the limited areas envisaged.  As public representatives we all know of the enormous complexities of prosecutions in relation to obstruction and in relation to fracas between citizens and gardaí over parking or other traffic offences. One can envisage an appalling burden being placed on the Garda superintendent where not only has he to give his consent but he has to do so in writing.  In effect, I can see a double-barrelled system being set up of tremendous bureaucracy and complexity. I should like to know how many superintendents, bearing in mind the implications of certain sections of the Bill, would be happy to tell the traffic wardens that it is their privilege and to consult with their law agent.  Having had certain responsibilities removed from them the Opposition would be unwise to impose other responsibilities on Garda superintendents.  This is a personal reaction but it is one the Opposition should seriously consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In putting down this amendment our main objective was to ensure that the prosecutions brought by the local authorities would be confined to parking offences and offences in relation to tax discs. The other offences in the Bill are different, and these should be dealt with by the garda authorities rather than by the local authority.  While we accept that the local authority can prosecute we are asking that the consent in writing of the Garda superintendent should be obtained prior to arriving at a decision to prosecute. This is reasonable because the purpose of the Bill is to deal with traffic offences.  We should only be concerning ourselves with prosecutions for <Col N="1632" /> this type of offence and not broadening the scope as envisaged in the Bill. I know there are similar situations in other walks of life where local authorities can prosecute but it does not necessarily follow that it is the best system.</P>
      <P>On many occasions today arguments were put forward that certain sections in this Bill were taken directly from other legislation but, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, that does not mean that those sections were as good as they might be or that they were necessary.  The case made by Deputy O'Malley is a reasonable one and, to some extent, it was accepted by Deputy Desmond.  Deputy Desmond mentioned that the Garda superintendents might not be anxious to have these extra duties, but I am not sure that that is so.  Our aim should be to ensure that the prosecutions by the local authorities should be related to the offences which deal with parking and tax discs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out again that the decision to prosecute lies with the authorities, subject to consultation with the Garda.  Deputy Faulkner omitted to mention that the Department of Local Government can institute prosecutions.  The side note to section 67 of the Housing Act, 1966 says a housing authority may:</P>
      <P>affix notice of serving repairs notice, making closing order or demolition order...</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) reads:</P>
      <P>A person who defaces a notice affixed under this section, or who, without lawful authority, removes the notice, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds.</P>
      <P>Section 116 of the same Act states that an offence under the Act may be prosecuted by the housing authority. We cannot accept the amendment because it implies that the local authorities are either incapable or irresponsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are grateful for the Parliamentary Secretary's intervention. He does not intervene as <Col N="1633" /> often as his Minister, but nevertheless I cannot feel that the points he has made bear any great analogy to the matters under discussion here that are covered by this amendment.  He talks about prosecutions which local authorities are empowered to bring, and they have been, as I pointed out earlier, since the 1850s and 1860s, empowered to prosecute in relation to various public health, housing and similar matters, and it is not just in the last ten years.  However, in every such case the prosecution is brought by the local authority on the authority of the manager in consultation with the local authority solicitor, and there is little or no fear of any abuse of the prosecuting system in that way.</P>
      <P>Here it is a different matter altogether. Here there are wardens who will operate at a comparatively low level in the local authority hierarchy and who will not go to the manager for sanction or, apparently, to the local authority solicitor for guidance in every prosecution they take, because there would be hundreds of them.  But there are certain categories where it should be written in that either they get the consent of the superintendent of the Garda Síochána or, alternatively, of the city manager or the local authority solicitor.  I am not just confining it to the Garda Síochána superintendent.  What we want to ensure is that someone responsible and in a senior position and with experience of these matters would authorise the prosecutions not for the trivial things that arise out of this Bill but for the three serious or reasonably serious things which arise under it and which are quite different from the local authorities prosecuting for breaches of orders or something of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but as I pointed out the city manager or county manager will not himself make a decision in relation to each one of these things.  The warden sends out a summons in the name of the mayor, aldermen and burgesses, or whoever it <Col N="1634" /> is.  The manager presumably will not deal with 500 or 1,000 or 1,500 parking offences in Dublin every morning. If he does, he will have no time to do anything else.</P>

      <P>Could I direct attention to the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; which leaves the position that the general Garda supervision is not excluded? It says: &ldquo;the local authority may&rdquo;. My reading of it is that if a warden is obstructed in the course of his duty, which Deputy O'Malley says is a serious offence&mdash;we might have different views on that&mdash;it is unlikely that a warden will take that upon himself. He will go along to the local authority solicitor and say: &ldquo;I have been obstructed.&rdquo;  This is different from the normal parking ticket case. The warden will soon find out that if he goes in and does the thing on his own he will come off worst.  He would be far better off to get advice before he moved in a matter like that.  I am sure Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Faulkner know that obstruction can take various forms: it can be a belt of a fist or a kick of a boot or just a few words telling him what to do with himself.</P>

      <P>Where a prosecution is to be brought by a local authority it is inevitable that substantial and detailed arrangements will have to be made so that every traffic warden of a local authority is not left to go off half cocked and institute obstruction prosecutions against people who fail to give their names and so on and a fracas develops.  There will have to be very rigorous procedures, bearing in mind that traffic wardens will not be well versed in the extremely difficult area of the law we are talking about.  The city and county managers trying to implement this will have to have some proper guidance, otherwise there will be widely differing interpretations by the traffic warden corps of each different local authority as to what will constitute an offence under this section.  Deputy O'Malley is in a very honourable profession and I have no doubt that, with Deputy Esmonde advising him, it will probably be a lawyers' paradise.  However, this is a paradise people have earned for themselves.  This is one matter on which I can see great difficulty, but I should not like to see written consent of a superintendent of the Garda Síochána being dragged into the proceedings at this stage.</P>

      <P>If I have no power in relation to the appointment of traffic wardens and if I am consulted, why should I have to proceed in relation to an offence which a traffic warden wishes to institute? Why should I have to have a separate office virtually, with my inspectors busily interviewing traffic wardens, getting written statements relating to alleged obstruction, alleged offences on the three grounds that have been alluded to here?  Inevitably, you will get the county manager who will tell each traffic warden: &ldquo;Go down and see the local superintendent and see if he is prepared to have a prosecution instituted.&rdquo;  It may all add up to that in the long run, but I am just wondering about the value of the amendment at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Desmond is in general terms in support of the amendment.  The case, very briefly, that we have made is that the offences are of very different natures.  We are concerned with confining the offences to be dealt with by the local authority to the traffic offences.  The Parliamentary Secretary was adamant that he would not accept the amendment but he has not given us any particular reason.  I am sure he appreciates what we are trying to do.

In that speech I made no reference to a cut-back in the finance to be made available for local authority housing. On the contrary, I stressed the unprecedently high level of authorised capital expenditure on this service in the current year, which will, of course, also rank for the new, greatly increased, subsidisation from central funds.  The speech underlined my commitment that areas like Dublin city with relatively urgent housing needs should get greater, rather than less, financial aid for their public housing programme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply to Question No. 40 of 29th October, 1974, I indicated the steps I had taken to assist householders whose houses have no fireplaces and are heated by means of central heating only.  It is open to them to apply for reconstruction grants to install in their houses fireplaces or solid fuel burning appliances.  Tenants of local authority houses may, with the consent of their local authority, avail of these grants. With the supplementary grant, the total grants may come to two-thirds of the cost of the work up to a maximum grant of £400 in each case.  It is also open to health boards or county councils, if they consider that the need <Col N="1650" /> exists, to provide financial assistance towards heating costs to persons on low incomes under their home assistance schemes.</P>
    <P>The question of providing subsidy towards fuel costs is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the Tolka Valley area there are 19 families who have no form of heating?  I understand that each of the families concerned owes more than £400 in respect of heating.  If they cannot pay these bills, how can they possibly pay for any other form of installation or fuel?  Would the Minister not accept that wherever lies the responsibility, some effort must be made to help those people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy says.  He has told me personally that there are a number of people in this area in very bad circumstances, that they owe a lot of money which they cannot afford to pay. However, as Minister, I have done everything possible to try to alleviate the position for people who are placed in this situation.  Unfortunately, there is nothing more I can do at this stage.  I have no authority to request local authorities to pay fuel bills for their tenants.  I know this situation is widespread and I sympathise both with the people concerned and with those who are attempting to represent them but there is nothing further I can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate what the Minister says, he will accept that, for instance, in the case of the ESB or the gas company, there is no social commitment but there is such commitment so far as the Department and the local authority are concerned. Think of a situation in which a husband is drawing the dole and in which £400 is owed by the family for heating. It is all right now but what will be the position during the winter months?</P>

There are people who should never be put in that position.  I would suggest that, perhaps, the local authorities be approached with a view to ascertaining whether they can think of any way in which assistance can be given.  I have gone a long way to meet the problem of people who are placed in this awkward position but there is nothing further I can do.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals before my Department for the making of regulations.  Local authorities are already empowered to take action.  I encourage local authorities to operate proper water wastage control arrangements and surveys which will ensure there is no avoidable waste.  In effect, what I am saying is that it is up to the local authorities themselves, if there is excessive water wastage&mdash;and there will be some no matter what one does&mdash;to carry out a survey to find out where is the excessive waste and take preventive action.</P>

      <P>If there is a leakage of water in, say, a town in Kerry, surely the responsibility for it rests with the urban or county council to ensure that it is stopped, and that would have nothing to do with say, Dundalk, Carrickmacross or anywhere else.  Therefore, it is idle to start talking about guidelines to be laid down because they know what are the guidelines.  They should stop the leak, and they can do so easily enough if they want.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not possible because all such schemes would have to be submitted to the Department and my engineers would have to approve of them as being necessary before they would receive assistance in carrying them out.  I think Deputy O'Leary would agree with me that the proper thing to do is to have the people running the local authority take the necessary steps to prevent any wastage of water occurring as far as they can.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>I am only too well aware that because of the inadequate capital provision made available by the previous Government over many years for sanitary services works, much greater investment is now necessary&mdash;not only to provide for our growing towns and new industries, but also to remedy the inadequacies of many existing sewerage systems and treatment works.  The Report on Water Pollution published in March, 1973, estimated the cost of remedial and improvement works to systems causing pollution at £35 million, including £15 million attributable to sewerage treatment works.  These works are being tackled as part of the expanded sanitary services programme which is now under way and a further survey would scarcely be warranted at this stage.</P>
      <P>Industrial and agricultural wastes also contribute substantially to water pollution and considerable investment in these areas will also be necessary. The public and private sectors will have to bear appropriate shares of the costs of anti-pollution measures but many things need to be done.  To advise me on these, I have established the Water Pollution Advisory Council and I hope also for advice from the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Environment.  In addition, the new Water Pollution Bill now being drafted will greatly strengthen the legal machinery for the control of discharges to waters and the prevention of pollution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital allocation of £962,000 for 1975 notified to Donegal County Council on the 16th May was intended to cover expenditure on schemes which had been approved and for which loans were sanctioned as at <Col N="1664" /> the date of the allocation.  In accordance with normal practice additional allocations will be made in relation to any further loans that may be approved over the remainder of the year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the allocation of £962,000 mentioned a sum of £19,000 was allocated towards the financing of works being undertaken by the council under their &ldquo;small schemes&rdquo; programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give an answer to Deputy Cunningham on that at this stage.  All I am saying is that very substantial increases in the amount of money for this type of work have been made available to Donegal County Council.  Like every other local authority they could use a great deal more but they will have to take a share of a very big cake which is being divided between them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation given to them was related to their assessment of their capital requirements out of loans already sanctioned for the financing of works already approved and having regard to the total capital provided under the capital budget.  Any additional loan sanctioned between the date of the local authority estimate and the date of the allocation was also taken into account.  On this basis an allocation of £962,000 for 1975 was notified to Donegal County Council. Over the last four years the position was in 1972-73 they got £450,000, in 1973-74 they got £271,000, in 1974, for nine months, they got £631,000 and this year they got £962,000.  I agree that Donegal County Council could probably use a lot more as could many other county councils but Donegal <Col N="1665" /> cannot expect to get all the money available in the State.</P>

Deputy Calleary did this, and my answer was: &ldquo;I have not&rdquo;, and I further said that no such request had been received and it was confirmed with the county council that no such request had been made; in fact, Mayo County Council in 1972-73 got £107,000 but only spent £74,000 of it.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital allocation of £1,324,000 for 1975 notified to Cork County Council (South) on the 16th May, 1975 was intended to cover expenditure on schemes which had been approved and for which loans were sanctioned as at the date of the allocation.  The question of making additional allocations out of loans recently sanctioned is under consideration having regard to the total resources available to me and the competing needs of other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the total number of schemes applied for sanction to his Department is in the region of £4,500,000 and, in view of that, does he realise the inadequacy of the allocation to Cork?  Furthermore, when can we expect a further allocation and can he indicate the size of the allocation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not possible. I am aware that something around £4,000,000 is required but, as I said earlier, it is not possible to carry out all the schemes in one area in this year.  This was recognised by my predecessors over the years, and all I can say is that there is a very substantially increased amount of money being given all round, and we should give as much as possible to areas which really need them.  However, it is not possible this year to find £4,000,000 for the Cork area the Deputy represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask that such a figure would be made available, but I did ask for a substantial increase over and above the figure already allocated, and I also asked if it was not true to say that details of the schemes covered by <Col N="1676" /> that figure have long ago been received by his Department and that sanction for proceeding with them has been received but that adequate money is not being made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

This means that the 1975 allocation is an increase of more than 40 per cent in the 12 months.  I do not know what they expect, unless some Deputies think there is a Midas cave where a great deal of money can be found to cover any particular area, because if the Deputy's area gets this money some other area will be short.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the amendment was not accepted we are still of the opinion that the special offences which are created by this Bill&mdash;by that I do not mean the ordinary parking and tax disc offences but the special offences such as obstructing a traffic warden, refusing to give a name and address, and removing notices&mdash;should not be prosecuted simply by the traffic warden himself but should be prosecuted only with the consent of the superintendent of the Garda Síochána in whose district the offence is alleged to have been committed; or, alternatively, if that is not feasible, we would have no objection to the city manager or the local authority solicitor authorising the prosecution.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out on the amendment, these prosecutions are for offences which are not just trivial, day-to-day matters on which the question of <i>mens rea</i> does not arise, but they are criminal or quasi-criminal matters in which it would be much more preferable that the prosecution should not be brought without the consent of somebody who is experienced in adjudicating on matters of this kind.  I do not want to be taken as alleging that any individual traffic warden would abuse his powers in this respect, but nonetheless, one has to face the fact that traffic wardens, as things stand and presumably in the future, are virtually untrained in the prosecution of offences.  These are not trivial or minor offences but are serious offences which, if somebody is convicted of such an offence or even charged with it could have quite a serious effect on his future career or prospects.</P>

    <P>For these reasons we are not happy with this section which allows traffic <Col N="1687" /> wardens to prosecute in the name of the local authority for these quasi-criminal offences in exactly the same way as they would prosecute for parking and similar offences which are comparatively trivial.</P>

      <P>This provision is not new.  It is not creating a new offence. It is in a number of other Acts, for instance, the Housing Act, 1966, and the Planning and Development Act, 1963.  Housing or planning authorities may prosecute for offences under these Acts.  It is the very same thing. The Local Government Planning Act, 1963, section 81 (3) says that any person who obstructs the entry approved of by order shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine, and so on. To suggest that these are new is wrong.  I suggest that this amendment should be allowed through.  There is not anything new about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the amendment is defeated, of course, but I want to ask a further question.  We are dealing with the section now.  I would like to know whether it is intended that the law officer of the local authority will be responsible for the prosecution.  I mentioned in my Second Reading speech that the law officers of local authorities were at the moment overburdened, that there were complaints very often about the slowness in dealing with certain matters, for example housing loans, and so on, and I would like to know what the Minister has in mind now in relation to the taking of prosecutions, whether he expects the prosecutions to be taken by the law officer or whether any extra assistance will be available to the law officer, whether the council will have permission to employ extra solicitors to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows and as I mentioned earlier, law officers in the local authorities, generally speaking, have too much work to do.  At least, the work is done relatively slowly and I am not blaming them because legal matters are difficult to deal with. <Col N="1688" /> Nevertheless the danger is that if this is loaded on to the law officers to deal with it will defeat its own purpose. Perhaps the Minister might let me know what he intends to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It will be the county manager who will make the decisions for the local authority.  I agree with Deputy Faulkner that a number of the law agents appear to be overworked.  I assume that what will happen is that there will be outside legal assistance obtained.  The one thing that everybody seems to overlook in this, and I tend to overlook it myself, is that we are talking about protection of the motorist and protection of the public.  Here we are attempting to put something in to protect the warden.  I think it should be received a bit better than it is. The warden is entitled to protection. Recently we had a case where a warden was attacked.  We should have a way in which this can be dealt with and, as I say, if the law agent of the local authority is overburdened, as some of them are, then naturally the advice or assistance of somebody other than him will have to be taken. This happens in many other instances. It will happen in the question of the traffic wardens.</P>

      <P>May I ask in relation to section 6 does the Minister make regulations prescribing any regulation to be made under the Act and regulations as appropriate may be laid before the House?  Has the Minister considered that, because of the sort of relationship which will emerge and is already there, between the Garda Síochána and the local authorities that <Col N="1689" /> it may well be appropriate and desirable that he may make these regulations following consultation.  I would suggest, to establish some national uniformity, with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána?  One could envisage a situation where the departmental staffs may draft regulations and lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas. We go through the usual either enactment or annulment procedure and the regulations may and conceivably could be contradicting the regulations and rules laid down by the Garda Commissioner in relation to comparable offences.  I would have thought that the Minister might consider either at Report Stage or in the Seanad introducing a mechanism of consultation in relation to section 6.  I have a concern about the matter because as a member of a local authority I can see myself being asked by constituents to write to the Minister asking him to amend regulations relating to parking offences and so on and eventually the Department may redraft the regulations at the behest of particular local authorities. Remember here one is talking about, say, town commissioners who could finish up making representations to the Minister regarding the content of specific regulations.  Town commissioners in different parts of the country, as the Minister knows, indeed, can be rather contrary, no more or no less contrary than bodies as august as, say, Dublin County Council.  We all have our views in relation to the unique traffic situation in our particular local authority areas.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary because, naturally, any particular representations which are made by the Garda Commissioner would be considered but once the order is made the order is made.  I cannot envisage a situation that Deputy Desmond seems to envisage where somebody at local authority level would find that the regulations as made were operating against him and ask him to make representations to have them changed. If that could happen it could happen in many other things.  Regulations are made and they are in fact O'Kayed here and that is the end of it.  The doubt which Deputy Desmond was talking about just does not exist. There is no clash.  The Minister for Local Government makes both.  My predecessor made the other one.  I am quite sure he consulted the Garda authorities before they were made, and he can be assured that before this is done the Department of Justice will have their say.  If they feel that there is something that they want put into it then this House will be able to decide if it is what we want.</P>

      <P>Will there be any training for these wardens under the Garda Síochána?  The Garda Síochána have handled things and are better able to deal with people and they are experienced over the years in handling the public.  A man coming in raw is handed a uniform.  Without the backing of experience, he may be inclined to abuse the powers that he thinks he has.  We are starting off on the wrong foot.  I would like to see greater co-ordination between gardaí and these proposed wardens.</P>
      <P>As the previous speaker said, different areas have different views on this, so I think that in the application of any rules and regulations the local gardaí should be brought into the picture because what applies in Dublin need not necessarily apply in Cork, Waterford or Galway or in tourist areas.  Many people in the west, for instance, depend on tourism and gardaí have in the past been slightly lenient with tourists, which has an effect on our tourist potential.

      <P>I should like to see a certain amount of flexibility in the different areas because in tourist areas you could have a tourist who might not understand the law.  Tourism is the bread and butter of the west.  That is why I suggest the local gardaí should be brought in to give guidance to these wardens.  The gardaí over the years have a good deal of experience in the application of law and in keeping order and they could play a big part in helping these wardens in the proper execution of their duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a pity that the amendment is out of order but I am sure the Minister might be amenable to accepting the idea underlying the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his Second Reading speech, said that he will have power when this Bill is passed to make grants towards expenses under it to local authorities.  He pointed out that this grant would be made available only in very special circumstances and it follows logically from that statement that each local authority will pay their own staff either out of the fines collected or from the rates or from both.  I think there is some danger here that the county manager might, for example, put certain pressures on the traffic wardens to collect as much money as possible from fines sufficient to pay them, so that no debt would incur to the rates.  The Minister might say that is an extreme case but the fact is that it is possible that the manager or whoever is responsible in the local authorities might feel that it was his duty to ensure that no burden would fall on the rates and might be anxious to get in as much money in fines as would pay the wardens. This is not a desirable situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also visualised an additional burden falling on the rates.  It is generally accepted that rates are not a very equitable type of taxation and we should avoid, as far as possible, adding to the rates.  In the amendment we were putting forward a suggestion which would on the one hand avoid any reason for the manager putting on pressure in relation to the collection of sufficient money to <Col N="1694" /> pay the wardens and on the other hand avoid adding a burden to the rates by suggesting that the Central Fund would make available the difference between any loss incurred in paying the wardens and the amount collected in fines and returning to the Central Fund any money over and above that necessary to pay the wardens. I think it was a very reasonable suggestion.  I wonder if the amendment could be expressed in different terms to come within the rules of order and whether the Minister would then accept such an amendment which would outline the same attitude that we suggested in our amendment.</P>

      <P>On the Second Stage I stressed that point.  I am uneasy about the human element coming into this.  Not alone might they be asked to justify their existence, so as to pay their way, but it would be no harm if the word was passed that they could be actively employed as expert tax collectors for the local authorities.  I would be very worried that they would be over-vigilant because they would know that if they did not pay their way they would probably be reduced in numbers. I would prefer if some kind of an amendment were put in by the Minister on the lines of the amendment which was ruled out of order.  I suggest that any deficiency between their wages and the fines collected would be paid by the Central Fund.  I am very worried that a warden would say to himself: &ldquo;If there are not enough fines coming in, my job is in jeopardy&rdquo;. He might get a little overvigilant. This is the only time I have spoken on this Stage, and I should like to add my voice to what Deputy Coogan said about training.  I would ask the Minister to take a look at the question of training.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister to indicate the circumstances in which it is thought likely it would be appropriate, convenient and necessary for the Minister, with the permission of the Minister for Finance, to contribute towards the expense account in relation to traffic wardens.  Are these circumstances anticipated or is this section there to provide for circumstances which <Col N="1695" /> might never occur?  I would be concerned, too, as Deputy Callanan has mentioned, about the danger that the county manager or the officials could indicate to the wardens at a given time that they were not paying their way, and because of that there might be a danger to their employment.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to say, too, whether in the preparation of the amendments, indeed of the Bill, the hypothetical case was considered of there not being need for the wardens, the situation where we would all become, because of the cost, most law abiding and these wardens would become redundant.  Is there a situation where they might be diverted elsewhere? I do not think there is.  I think that there will be, under this Bill, continuing pursuit and harassment of the motorist.  I personally know to my own grief that a judge imposed a fine of £8 on me for parking, doing my local authority work.  I think that he had probably got an indication that money was scarce and perhaps he could do something towards contributing to his salary.</P>

I think it is strange that in the last month fines of £8 have been imposed on motorists in the city of Dublin.  I do not think it is because they have been told there is plenty of money available and that they need only impose a fine of £1 or £2.  What I am concerned about is, as Deputy Callanan said, and as I want to express it as a motorist and on behalf of the law abiding motorists in Dublin, that this Bill might mean there is to be a continuation of the harassment that exists already.  There is a budget, as we know, coming tomorrow and it is anticipated that additional taxes will be put on motorists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about a parking offence which I want to contest, because of the fact, and this is all relevant to the Bill, that the local authority could indicate as a clearway an area on which simultaneously they have parking meters and where anybody at the time must not park.  If a member of the local authority was not familiar with the regulations I suggest it would be fairly difficult for the ordinary motorist to be familiar with them, when you are invited to park on a clearway, and where in small print there are words to the effect that after 5 o'clock it is no longer a clearway. If you park at 4.50, assuming you are going to have one hour, and you return to your car at five past five, the warden has come along and put a parking ticket on your car.</P>
      <P>I was anxious to contest that on behalf of the motorists and because of the fact that I was ordered, as other people were, to go to Galway for a by-election, I wrote indicating that I should like to have the case postponed, and the thanks I got was a fine of £8.  I am not the only one who was fined £8.  I might say that I am contesting this further.  I can afford to pay £8 but other motorists might not be and most of them are contributing enough at the moment. The purpose of my rising was to ask if the Minister would indicate the circumstances in which he would think it necessary or feel obliged to contribute a grant towards the local authority and seek the permission of the Minister for Finance so to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting puzzled here.  I do not want to mention Deputy Tunney's case.  It is <i>sub judice,</i> he is appealing and bringing it further so I do not want to comment on it. We have an extraordinary situation. We had here some weeks ago Deputy Haughey saying he did not think any laws would be any good, we were better off without them.  We had Deputy Lemass saying the driving test is not any good&mdash;it was not saying any lives&mdash;that it was a waste of time introducing the driving test.  We now have a situation in which people fined for parking are saying &ldquo;this is wrong, <Col N="1697" /> it is wrong that people should be harassed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to make it very clear that the Bill only deals with people who break the law, minor or major, minor offences where they parked where they should not have.  At normal times people can get caught and it is more than likely that they will be dealt with in a reasonable way.  There are major offences where they obstruct traffic and cause endless chaos because of the fact that they park indiscriminately just because they do not care two damns about anybody but themselves.  People who do not park carefully, who do not pay their tax, or do not display their tax discs usually because they have not paid it, are not committing a minor offence in my book.  I think someone who does that is committing a very serious offence, and because of that we have decided to introduce new parking attendants.</P>
      <P>What do we get?  We find it is suggested that not alone is it wrong to bring these people in, because in theory they are supposed to be interfering with the gardaí and they adopt police duties, which they do not, but also that the people who already observe parking regulations are wrong. A number of Deputies have said that existing parking attendants are doing a great job.  We also had the opposite point of view.</P>
      <P>I must repeat that it is only right that the people we are trying to harass, if you like the word, those who deliberately break the law and do it consistently should be dealt with and for that reason we are introducing this system.  It applies in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere.  We are now suggesting it should apply anywhere it is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner made a suggestion as to how the money should be allocated. If we did not have the section in the way it is and a local authority consulted with the Commissioner who said: &ldquo;You do not need traffic wardens in your area at all&rdquo; and if the local authority went ahead and appointed the traffic wardens, is it suggested that the State should meet the bill and pay for those people even though they are not needed?  The <Col N="1698" /> point in putting it in this way is to ensure that if that happens the local authority in making such an appointment are aware that it will cost the ratepayers more money.</P>
    <P>If it is agreed that they are needed and there is a loss, there is the right to give compensation from the State funds to local authorities.  I am sorry Deputy Callanan is not here because there is one point he is missing&mdash;may be I did not explain it clearly enough&mdash; local authorities do not have to appoint traffic wardens but if they wish to they may, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner.  If they do not wish to, they do not have to.  This is very important. The Bill visualises that any surplus in the service would be applied to road or traffic purposes in the area. I ask Deputy Faulkner to take note of this because it specifies &ldquo;in the area&rdquo;. This is common procedure in operation at present in respect of surplus funds which accrue on parking fees.  To put the excess income into the Road Fund may mean that local road or traffic projects would be denied immediate benefit coming from income derived in the area.  There would be no guarantee that moneys put into the road fund by a local authority from excess on warden service would go back to that same local authority.</P>
    <P>I want to encourage maximum local responsibility and freedom in local matters.  One final point is the question that has kept recurring here.  It is the suggestion that somebody will say to the traffic warden: &ldquo;You shall not have your wages next week unless you go out and catch a large number of motorists.&rdquo;  Firstly, that is a very bad reflection on the local authorities; secondly, the suggestion that it will be done is ridiculous in view of the fact that nobody can be caught except those who break the law; and, thirdly, the person who gets a ticket has the right to go to court and, therefore, cannot be imposed upon.  So, under those three headings, there is not the slightest trouble at all.</P>
    <P>We have achieved what Deputy Faulkner thinks should be achieved in the way in which we phrased this. If the local authority need traffic wardens, consult the Garda Commissioner, <Col N="1699" /> appoint traffic wardens and make money on their efforts, this money goes into the local fund.  If they lose money they can apply to the State and they may have it reapportioned. If they apply to the Garda Commissioner and he says: &ldquo;No, we do not think you can do it.  The gardaí are doing an adequate job there and we do not require traffic wardens.&rdquo; That is all right but if they go ahead and appoint traffic wardens and lose money, they must know what that will cost them.  Without that provision there could be no grant towards areas where traffic wardens were needed but where money was lost because of the expense involved.  The fears that have been expressed here are not reasonable ones and we should let the section go through as it is.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows as well as I know that some local authorities are determined to build empires and can be somewhat perverse.  The Minister indicates that a local authority who persist in the appointment of traffic wardens contrary to the advice of the Garda Commissioner would have to bear any excess loss.  I know of some who, for prestige purposes alone, are capable of having one or two traffic wardens.</P>

      <P>The Minister and I are old friends.  Would he not consider that in the Seanad or at Report Stage or, indeed, under power of regulation that he has here&mdash;and the general provisions are quite substantial in terms of regulatory powers of the Minister&mdash;he should insist that the employment of wardens by a local authority be subject to Ministerial sanction.  It is necessary that he have this power.  I am acutely aware of the fact that in, say, Dublin County <Col N="1700" /> Council there are a number of new towns going up, Tallaght and so on, and there will be acute pressure on the five local councillors out there to institute a system of traffic wardens. The Garda Commissioner may have severe difficulty in releasing sufficient men to supervise general traffic control in the Tallaght area but one could find a situation where Dublin County Council, bearing in mind that in Tallaght there is a population of 30,000 and that it may well be a catchment area where sufficient revenue can be generated from prosecutions, would be under pressure to employ a number of wardens.  If that were the criteria for employing wardens it would be a very dubious situation.  On that basis, perhaps the Minister would consider taking to himself pretty stringent powers to insist that no couple of town commissioners could go off and devise a lovely uniform for a few local men who might be in great need at the height of the tourist season but who might find themselves on the local employment exchange in the winter.</P>
      <P>I make the point because I am acutely aware that in Dún Laoghaire. for example, there are no traffic wardens.</P>

      <P>The Minister has to some degree shifted his ground since the Second Reading.  If I were to just look at the section which reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make grants towards the expenses under this Act of a local authority.</P>
      <P>I would assume that the Minister meant that whatever expenses were incurred in addition to the income derived from fines would be paid by the State, but the Minister in his Second Reading speech stated specifically that the grants would be made to the local authority in very exceptional circumstances.  This is quite different from the case he is making now where he mentioned that where a local authority, having consulted with the Commissioner who advised them that traffic wardens were not necessary, and who proceeded to appoint traffic wardens would be refused expenses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister, again, to his Second Reading speech.  Perhaps when he replies he will quote what he said because I have not got it in front of me but my recollection is that what the Minister said was that only in very exceptional circumstances would the grants be paid by him to local authorities.</P>
      <P>One other matter which he raised and which would disturb me a little is more or less on the lines of the case we were making earlier, that is, where he said that the local authority, if they have a surplus, will get the money for use in their own area whereas if it went back to the Central Fund they would not necessarily get it for the area in which it was collected.</P>
      <P>The problem I see&mdash;and this is exactly the same problem as we have been discussing for some time&mdash;is that there would be an incentive for a local authority to pressure the situation to ensure they would get a surplus. The problem, when discussed previously was concerned mostly with holiday resorts where the wardens, if they so wished, could possibly have a field day and ensure that the local authority in that area would get a surplus but which would be very much against the development of tourism in that area.  Our amendment, which was ruled out of order and which I do not propose discussing, would have so changed the situation that there would be no benefit to the local authority in the fines collected and, on the other hand, that the Central Fund should contribute towards the rates.  I should like the Minister to explain the difference between my recollection of what he said in his Second Reading speech and the type of case he has made now in regard to the occasions on which money would be made available by him to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I must repeat what I said on the Second Reading but, as Deputy Faulkner says, perhaps it is important.  Under the heading of &ldquo;Financing the Scheme&rdquo; I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> The fact that it is at the option of the local authority to adopt and continue to operate a scheme is very important in regard to the financing of a scheme.  It is primarily a local scheme and the decision to start or continue it should be taken locally.</P>
    <P>At the present time, the fines-on-the-spot are payable by offenders at a Garda station and the money so collected accrues to the Road Fund. The costs of the existing warden service are met from the Garda vote, towards which the Road Fund is contributing about £1 million this year.  The Department of Justice in turn pays to the local authorities, who are at present administering the scheme in Dublin and Cork, the costs incurred by these authorities.  This is an unnecessarily cumbersome system of administration. The previous Government agreed that in future, when a warden service would be directly administered by the local authorities, the fines-on-the-spot would be paid to the local authorities and retained by them.  I fully agree with this principle, which is included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I expect that a local authority which operates this service will have a surplus on their operations.  They will be free to use the surplus for road traffic purposes in accordance with regulations to be made by the Minister.  This is an exact parallel of the system which applies at present to income derived from parking meters and from disc parking (as operated in Cork).  No question arises of my paying a subsidy in such cases.</P>
    <P>As I said, the responsibility of deciding to operate a warden service will rest with each local authority, after consultation with the Garda Commissioner.  It could happen that the Garda for good reasons do not agree that a warden service is necessary in a particular area&mdash;they might, for example, be in a position to control parking arrangements without the necessity for wardens.  It would be inappropriate that, in such circumstances, I should be statutorily obliged to pay the cost of an unnecessary <Col N="1703" /> service and this is the one about which Deputy Faulkner was doubtful:</P>
    <P>On the other hand, circumstances could arise where the Commissioner agreed with the proposal of the local authority to appoint wardens, the scheme is being operated satisfactorily in the interests of traffic, but causes a significant loss to the local authority.  It is possible that some contribution might be justified in that case towards the costs incurred by that authority.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why the section is worded in that way to allow that to be done.</P>
    <P>I think I have illustrated that this is a complex problem in which the position of the Minister must be kept flexible.  I propose to make the position clear to all local authorities when the Bill becomes law, to assist them in their decisions whether or not to operate a warden service.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is no secret at all about it.  All of us agree that the proper method of handling the funds, if funds accrue at local level, is that they should be spent.  Otherwise, the way of doing it would be so complex it would cause endless trouble.  I think this section of the Bill has been very well drafted and I ask that it be left that way.</P>

      <P>The aspect of this question of expenses and the sums which will be collected under this scheme which worries us somewhat is that of the excess being used locally. I can see certain advantages in it, in certain circumstances, but, on balance, I am doubtful if it is wise&mdash;I have in mind the town commissioners, and I think I am on the very same lines here as Deputy Desmond&mdash;to allow the very small local authorities to utilise locally whatever excess they succeed in obtaining after they have paid the expenses of their wardens and so on.  With the very small local authorities&mdash;and I stress that the danger does not exist to the same extent with the larger ones&mdash;you might have an incentive, on the part of a clerk or manager of a very small town, to encourage the wardens to try to increase the revenue for the local town commissioners, or urban council as the case might be.</P>

      <P>No, not by encouraging people to park in the wrong places but by encouraging wardens at all times and in every circumstance to prosecute people.  It may be that the Minister is one of these very fortunate people, that he never finds it <Col N="1705" /> necessary to park for longer than, say, one hour at a particular place.  He never goes into an office or meeting intending to come out in half an hour and finds that he is delayed for an hour-and-a-half&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And thereby commits an offence, although it might not be his wish so to do.  But it happens to other people.  We have heard of unfortunate Deputy Tunney who, through no fault of his own, was delayed at some local authority meeting which cost him a great deal of money. One has only to go through this city, or any other city on any day&mdash;and the Minister must know this if he is reasonable&mdash;to find cars that are technically illegally parked but are not really interfering with the flow of traffic or causing any other problems. If wardens are to get instructions that any and every infringement must be subjected to a fine, I think that is wrong.  We propose to put down an amendment on the Report Stage which would get over the difficulty that apparently ruled Deputy Faulkner's amendment No. 10 out of order which we hope would be within the rules and might be taken.  We would then urge the Minister to consider it at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I pose a question to the Minister&mdash;when he says &ldquo;the local authority&rdquo; who are the local authority for the purposes of this Bill?  Are they elected members? Are they just the managers who will &ldquo;rubber-stamp&rdquo; what is the regulation? When he says &ldquo;uniform&rdquo;, will it be uniform throughout the country in regard to the proper emphasis? Another point is the power of the wardens.  They can seek to see tax licences on cars.  Do I take it that the Garda will give up looking for licences?  The Garda have a 24-hour job but these wardens are merely 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock men.  In other words, at night the boys could come into town, cowboys can come in and have a great night of it and need not have a tax disc up at all.  That is what <Col N="1706" /> I would like to be clear on.  There are the questions of the implementation of the regulations and of temperament. How does the Minister know the kind of man he is getting?  Will he have one of these morning grouches who will pounce on a man one minute after the starting time?  There is a lot to be said in regard to the implementation of the duties.  Another matter is what should the power of a warden be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is something radically wrong.  A man who is given authority and sees a man get into a car, drive off and perhaps kill a person should have the power of arrest, which I understand is there. The traffic wardens should have these powers because a lot of gentlemen are getting away with happy moments at the wheel.  They are a great danger to the public.  If the Garda are to be helped by these wardens they should be helped in every respect.  These regulations are for the benefit of the public at large, the safe management of traffic.  You will not have much safe traffic with a drunken driver.  I would like if the Minister could see if anything could be done in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The Traffic Wardens Bill covers wardens who will be appointed to do a specific thing, that is in relation to parking, and at the same time will be responsible for inspecting tax discs on parked vehicles.  That is the only power they have.  Deputy Coogan asked two questions. One is who is the local authority, the members or the manager?  The manager is responsible for staff. Deputy Coogan also asked when the warden is not on duty at night who will look after those who have no tax discs?  This is, was, and will remain a matter for the Garda as they always <Col N="1707" /> do when the wardens are off duty or indeed when the wardens are on duty. The Garda have not been stripped of any of their powers.  They can continue to do the same work as they always did.  Let me pay a tribute to the Garda who, in fact, are doing a tremendous job under very heavy pressure.  This is an effort to try to take some of the back-breaking work off them, the question of parking and of trying to regulate parking by taking dangerous parking out of some of our towns.  It is very necessary and it is just too bad that we have to allocate men, who are very busy doing important national work, to stop cars to see whether the cars are taxed or not when the same cars can be found with a shilling in a meter parked anywhere around the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can remember, when I was speaking previously on amendment No. 61, in the name of Deputy Haughey, I said that I felt that the same principle should apply here as applies in the case of vexatious appeals to the Minister. It is not too likely, as I said before, that there would be anything like the same number to the High Court as there would be to the Minister but nevertheless it is only fair that if a person can show reasonable cause that the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;<Col N="1709" /> should be added so that persons who could not be said to have a reasonable cause would not be in a position to proceed with applications to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The section enables a planning authority or any other person to make application to the High Court for a prohibition order.  The amendment could be said to pre-empt the function of the court by confining &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; to one who can show &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo;.  A court will not make an order unless the applicant can show &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo;.  On the contrary, the application would probably be dismissed with costs and costs would be awarded against the applicant and this should be sufficient safeguard against nuisance applications.  The trouble about the amendment is that it postulates that the court is going to act in a frivolous manner.  On second thoughts I am sure the Opposition would agree that this is not what they want to do. I believe it will be fairly dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I suppose the fact that costs are involved would be a deterrent.  The fact is that in relation to appeals to the Minister where the costs are not to any worth-while degree involved, a vexatious appeal in relation to an appeal to the Minister would be more likely.  Could the Minister say what the position is likely to be in a case where a person appeals to the High Court and who has what he would consider a reasonable case, but nevertheless loses it? Does he pay full costs or would that be taken into consideration?  Can legislation ensure that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not have that because everybody goes to court with the impression that he has a great case and is going to win.  The trouble is that if one wants to say that somebody has a good case, one is, in fact, deciding the case before it comes up.  If somebody wants to go to court the court must decide whether the case is good or not.  If it is a good case he will win but if it is not good enough he will not win.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is making a case for free legal aid for people which would be outside my bailiwick completely.  Quite honestly, it is not possible to say if somebody has a good case that even though he loses it the costs should be paid or something like that should be done.

      <P>I move amendment No. 62:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 40 and 41, to insert after subsection (1) the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Where any development authorised by a permission granted under Part IV of the Principal Act has been commenced but has not been, or is not being, carried out in conformity with the permission because of non-compliance with the requirements of a condition attached to the permission or for <Col N="1711" /> any other reason, the High Court may, on the application of a planning authority or any other person, whether or not that person has an interest in the land, by order require any person specified in the order to do or not to do, or to cease to do, as the case may be, anything which the Court considers necessary to ensure that the development is carried out in conformity with the permission and specifications in the order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 23 is to enable the High Court to prohibit continuance of unauthorised development or use and the addition of the new subsection will enable the court to act also in a case where development is not being carried out in conformity with the relevant permission.  The last day we were discussing this a case was made by a Deputy in regard to such a matter and he felt it should be dealt with.  In fact, we have already added an amendment to deal with it. If there is non-compliance with a condition or a departure from approved plans the court may order the appropriate person, normally the developer, to do or to cease to do whatever is necessary to conform with the permission.</P>

I should like to ask in relation to a private person who believes he has a sound case but has not got the money to go ahead with it, is there any likelihood in the event of the planning authority being convinced by him of the justice of his case, that the planning authority would take the case to the High Court?</P>

      <P>Section 25 introduces a limitation of duration of planning permission which we on this side of the House would agree with, but I would not agree with applying this limitation retrospectively.  In other words, if a person had obtained planning permission four years and 11 months before the Bill is passed, one month later, that permission dies.  Is that not the position?  I will give the Minister a chance to explain it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it might be as well.  Section 25 provides for the expiry of permission after a period of five years from the grant of permission or, in the case of permission already granted, five years from the date on which the section comes into effect.  Deputy Molloy questions the application of retrospection, and the amendment he sees as a remedy.  In fact it is not needed.  The section does not have the retrospective effect claimed.</P>

      <P>You may have a case where outline planning permission was granted for a housing scheme.  If after the passing of this Act application for full planning permission was refused, then is there not a contradiction here?  In other words, by the refusal of full planning permission one negatives the provision of this Act in cases where definite outline planning permission was given, where the number of houses was decided, the sewerage lay-out, the water supply and roads planned. Could the Minister protect such cases where the considerations which permitted <Col N="1714" /> the granting of outline permission would be the same considerations for the granting of full planning permission, and that full planning permission would be given unless there were other extraneous features coming in which would normally rule it out anyhow?  In other words, application for full planning permission after the passing of this Act would not be negatived in cases where outline permission was given before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what Deputy Cunningham is actually getting at.  The outline permission would still run for five years.  All permissions would run for five years from the passing of the Act.  Therefore what I think Deputy Cunningham is saying is not affected at all.  They will be in no worse a position than those who would be applying for full permission on that very day.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 65:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 27 and 28, before subsection (3) to insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  a development has been completed to an extent described in subsection (2) of this section and a condition attached to the relevant permission is not complied with, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a development has been so completed and there is attached to such permission a condition requiring something not to be done, or</P>
      <P>(c) a development has been completed save for compliance with a condition attached to the relevant permission, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> (d)  a development has been completed but there is attached to the relevant permission a condition requiring something not to be done, </P>
    <P>then, unless a notice (in this section subsequently referred to as a waiver notice) stating that the condition need not be complied with is issued under this section, subsection (1) of this section shall neither be construed as affecting, nor operate to affect, the obligation of any person to comply with the requirements of the condition.</P>
    <P>(4)  A planning authority may, if they think fit, issue a waiver notice on an application being made in that behalf.</P>
    <P>(5) Any person who is aggrieved by the decision of a planning authority on an application for a waiver notice may appeal to the Board within the period of twentyone days, beginning on the date on which the planning authority notify the applicant of their decision.</P>
    <P>(6) Where an appeal is brought under subsection (5) of this section, the Board may&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  in case a waiver notice has been issued by a planning authority, confirm or annul the notice, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in case a waiver notice has not been so issued, confirm the decision of the planning authority or issue a waiver notice.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>Under section 25, permission for development would expire after five years.  However, it was necessary to provide in subsection (2) that this would not apply in the case of a single building which was itself completed to the ancillary or incidental works necessary for its use.  Similarly in the case of a housing scheme only partly built.  It was necessary to provide for completion of roads and so on serving the houses built.  The fact that the permission remains alive for such work means that the planning authority can still take enforcement action if necessary.  The new subsections (3) to (6) which have been <Col N="1716" /> brought in by amendment No. 65 are designed to avoid the possibility that, where a condition is attached to a permission the developer would be able to evade his responsibilities by claiming that the condition expired with the permission.  I am sure everyone will agree that this is very important. Subsection (3) requires compliance with the permission unless a waiver notice is obtained.  Subsection (4) provides for application to the planning authority for a waiver of a condition.  There must be some machinery to waiver conditions which in the particular circumstances were quite inappropriate.  Subsection (5) enables an appeal to the board against the decision of the planning authority.  Subsection (6) gives the board power to deal with such appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 66.</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 28 to 36, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) Where&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  a permission has been granted under Part IV of the Principal Act for development and the development to which the permission relates is commenced but is not completed before the permission ceases to have effect, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the relevant planning authority are satisfied that a dispute has arisen as to whether or not&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  a particular part of the development was completed before the permission ceased to have effect, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> (ii)  a particular part of the development consists of the provision of any one or more of the following, namely, a structure mentioned in subsection (2) of this section, works, roads, services and open spaces so mentioned,</P>
    <P>that authority, if they are satisfied that the part of the development was so completed or so consists, as may be appropriate, may, on payment of the prescribed fee (if any), issue a certificate (subsequently in this subsection referred to as a development certificate) to that effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that amendments Nos. 66, 68, 69 and 70 should be taken together.  The purpose of amendment No. 66 is to clarify the circumstances in which it might be necessary to issue a development certificate. Subsection (3) as provided in the Bill was intended to provide a means of settling any dispute as to whether development was completed in time or whether outstanding works could be completed under subsection (2). However, the drafting was done in such a way that the subsection had a wider effect.  Solicitors acting for purchasers of new houses or other property, and building societies and other bodies dealing with applications for loans, might have felt that it was incumbent on them to obtain development certificates.  This would have created a vast amount of new work for planning authorities and inevitably would have caused delays in property transactions.  In order to avoid such a situation the amendments propose a more specific provision on the lines originally intended.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (7) provides that it is only where a dispute arises that a certificate may be issued.  The dispute may concern the extent of the development completed in time or the further works which can or should be done under subsection (2).  Normally, of course, there should be no difficulty in getting an extension of the five-year period but, if, for some exceptional reason, this is not possible, the following are examples of the sort of disputes which can be <Col N="1718" /> resolved by the issue of a development certificate: (a) in a scheme of 100 houses, 70 are clearly completed but six are at various stages of construction. Normally the planning authority would allow these to be finished off but if they did not or if there was any dispute subsequently, application could be made for a development certificate and, if necessary, the decision could be appealed to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>In the same circumstances, the builder might dispute the necessity to complete a road as planned originally to give a second access to the estate. The planning authority could issue a development certificate and would then be in a position to institute enforcement proceedings unless the developer appealed successfully to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>If permission were granted for a shop and store but only the shop was erected before the permission expired, a dispute might arise as to whether the store was necessary for or ancillary to the completed building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not very clear.  Would the Minister explain more slowly the actual development or what, in fact, it means and the circumstances in which it would arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (3) as provided in the Bill, it is intended to provide a means of settling a dispute as to whether development was completed in time or whether outstanding works could be completed under subsection (2).  The Deputy understands that.  However, solicitors acting for purchasers of new houses or other property and building societies or other bodies dealing with applications for loans might have felt that it was incumbent on them to obtain development certificates.  The vast amount of new work for development authorities inevitably will cause delays in property transactions.  So, in order to avoid such a situation the amendment proposed a more specific provision on the lines originally intended.  Now this is the point.  The new subsection (7) provides:</P>
      <P>It is only where dispute arises that a certificate may be issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> Now, understand that: only where a dispute arises as to whether or not.  It is a simple provision.  The dispute may concern the extent of development completed in time or the further works which can or should be done under subsection (2).  Normally, of course, there should be no difficulty in getting an extension of the five-year period provided the work is in progress or if, for some exceptional reason, this is not possible the following are examples of the sort of disputes which can be resolved by the issue of a development certificate.  The idea of the development certificate is to allow for the continuation and completion of the works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it mean anything in relation to payment, for example?  I thought that it had some reference to payment in the sense that if a certain amount of the work is done and the developer then gets a development certificate, would that not mean for him that that much of the work was completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the object. The object is that if he had a certain amount of the work done and he wanted more time to complete the balance of it, he would get a certificate to say that he had a certain amount done and that he had to complete so much and say specifically what the extra works were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what is involved but I also thought that it had some bearing on, possibly, a builder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I know what the Deputy is talking about.  He is suggesting that some builder might say: &ldquo;I now have 60 out of 100 completed and have got a certificate to prove it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exactly, to some extent, but the opposite point is in my mind that if he had not completed the work in accordance with the specifications laid down in relation to the whole scheme he might not be entitled to the grants and loans and so on, and part of whatever money was to be paid to him by the local authority.  What struck me was that in the event of his <Col N="1720" /> having two-thirds of it done and that was certified, that would overcome any problem in relation to payment, say, by the local authority or a relationship like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He might try to use the certificate for something like that but that, most certainly, is not the object of it and it is not intended to have any bearing on it.  Is Deputy Faulkner satisfied?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not moved 68 but it might be as well if I did, so that we would be able to cover it as suggested. Subsection (7) of the Bill provided for an appeal to the District Court. Amendment No. 66 in the joint names of myself and Deputy O'Brien proposes to substitute the Circuit Court because of the complexities which may arise in particular cases. By virtue of amendment No. 69, subsections (8) and (9) are being replaced by new subsections (12) and (13) which contain the necessary consequential provisions.  It would be much better if we tried to relate them.  I am sure everybody understands what section 25 refers to.  This is a bit complicated to those who have not got the section before them.  If Deputies read through the section I am sure they will find it easy enough to understand.</P>

      <P>The reason I put down the amendment was that I come across cases quite regularly.  The District Court is just not capable of dealing with the complex planning laws. The amount of abuse in the way the <Col N="1722" /> District Courts are used to violate the planning laws is disgraceful.  I come across it time and time again.  I do not believe they are capable of dealing with them.  It requires more expertise and the Circuit Court is the place.  You might think they are very small things but, particularly in the Dublin area, you are talking about vast developments, and violations of our planning laws, particularly in the No. 6 area of Dublin which occur day after day.  These people employ firstclass legal experts and they can drive a coach and four through legislation in the District Courts without any bother whatever.  They are getting adjournment after adjournment and in my view they are prostituting the District Courts.  I believe that this matter should go to a higher court to get more expertise and in my view a better job done and it is important that this amendment would be a reason for it.</P>

      <P>There is another reason apart from the costs why these decisions should be taken in the District Court.  Apart from all the administrative work, there is the time factor, particularly in rural areas where the Circuit Court sits three to four times a year and there is a long list of law cases.  This applies even in children's cases.  Parents may have to wait for two years to get their cases on and unless there is a great degree of urgency about it the result will be postponement.  I think that on the time factor alone the District Court would be more satisfactory than the Circuit Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be in certain places but certainly not in Dublin. Because of this time factor there is sometimes an interval of three to five years and as Deputy Moore will know that in his constituency where the District Court is in use purely and simply for criminal business the appeal would lapse before it could be listed.  This is where cases involving big money are involved.  They can employ the best counsel and they could play ducks and drakes in the District Court because you have not got expertise in the District Court.</P>

      <P>When I saw this amendment I was rather surprised and felt it must have implied that possibly the District Court might not be able to deal with matters of this kind.  The Minister possibly has got legal advice in relation to this, but I am concerned about the question of time.  I would agree with Deputy O'Brien that we should try to speed up this type of case but I am not convinced that it is likely to be any quicker in the Circuit Court than in the District Court, though it may be possible that in Dublin it would be a more expeditious way of dealing with them to bring them to the Circuit Court.  I do not know, as Deputy O'Leary has said, whether this would apply in the rural areas, but of course the Dublin Deputies can only speak for themselves.  Perhaps there is some legal problem involved.</P>

      <P>There is not a legal problem involved only in so far as our legal people feel that the matters could be better dealt with by the Circuit Court.  The complexities which are most likely to come up would be better dealt with in that way.  We have a waiting list in the District Court, as you know, and it is mostly because there was an increase in the number of appeals.  A number of Deputies have referred to the fact that it would be better to have more senior courts than the District Court dealing with them.  I have been trying to find out whether there is any possibility of having two sections, one dealing with the footling ones as Deputy Cunningham refers to the small ones, in the District Court, and the bigger ones to be dealt with in another court.  It will not be easy to define because usually it is the money value that will decide which is which, and this will be difficult.  We may have to find another way of valuing which would make the matter even worse.  If Deputies would like to leave it and let me have a look perhaps we can deal with it on Report Stage, but I am anxious to facilitate the House on this.</P>

      <P>I speak for an area where it operates in the District Court. If you consulted the law agent of the corporation, and it would be worth consulting him on this because he is a man who has to handle these cases in the District Court, I think he would come out on the side of the Circuit Court.  I have read through some of these cases, the technicalities and the expertise that are involved in them, and the district justices are just lost, it is way above their heads, they are not able to cope and in many cases then they will make bad judgments because of the fact that they have not got the knowledge to do it.

      <P>I maintain that we should try to counter what the Deputy is saying.  He is making the case that monied people are able to drive the proverbial coach and four through the Act at District Court level.  If that is so the situation at the District Court should be corrected.  We must have a thought for the non-monied person who would and who has the right to appeal.  Are we going to drag him through the costly Circuit Court procedure because there is some abuse of the court through which he would normally have recourse?  You must take that side of the coin with the other and if, as the Minister indicated, he is prepared to have another look at this and guarantee that the position of the non-monied person would also be borne in mind and that for him or for her obviously the better court is, for many reasons including those mentioned by Deputy O'Leary, the District Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy should take time off and go down to have a look at the activities of the District Court and the way that cases have been allowed to drag on for years, getting postponed and postponed because they were not able to cope.  We will then see a very good reason why something should be done.  Maybe the District Court situation should be looked at.  As it has been up to now, it certainly is increasingly incapable of dealing with these cases.  There is no <Col N="1725" /> doubt about it that in different areas where big developments are going on and where there is blatant violation, these people do not mind spending quite large sums of money in meeting court costs.</P>

      <P>Where the court directs that a development certificate shall issue for part of an estate that they deem to have been completed, would the Minister not consider it appropriate that a direction should also be given that the local authority should pay for roads and services in charge?  The Minister will appreciate that this has been one of the greatest causes of contention among residents in new housing areas where developers have <Col N="1727" /> left the site without completing their development according to specifications, according to the permission, and the local authority reluctantly have refused to take over these roads and services until they are satisfied that they are completed properly.</P>
      <P>If the court deems that a development is completed and that a certificate shall issue to verify that it is completed to the satisfaction of the authorities, surely in such circumstances it might be appropriate in order to strengthen the law in this case that a direction should also issue that in such circumstances when a development certificate is issued the local authority should take these services in charge?</P>

      <P>I am afraid this would be too complicated.  The giving of a development certificate does not mean that work has been completed.  If there were 100 houses, 60 of them might be completed but they might not all be in sequence.  We could have a situation where we would have ten houses and 30 or 40 yards away the road in front of other houses would not be done. Then in the next street the houses might be done.  There is a section dealing with the taking over of estates and I would prefer to try not to complicate matters by including this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 70a:</P>
      <P>Before section 26 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The planning authority, by exercising their powers under section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, may decide to grant a permission or approval even if the proposed development contravenes materially the development plan or any special amenity area order relating to the area of the planning authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very briefly, the intention behind the <Col N="1728" /> amendment by way of a new section is to overcome a difficulty that I have knowledge of being experienced by councillors in certain areas.  The elected county councillors form the planning authority.  They are the body responsible for adopting a development plan for their area.  We are assured from official sources regularly that the elected members are the planning authority.  Only they can adopt a plan.  Yet, the elected members also have power under the City and County Management Act, 1955, section 4, to direct the manager in certain matters to perform certain things as the councillors wish.</P>
    <P>One of those things that they can so direct is that a planning permission be granted.  I have knowledge of situations where councillors in assessing a planning application made to their local planning authority seeking permission under the development plan that they adopted, having been informed previously by the manager that it was the intention of the local authority or the council to refuse, they not being in agreement, a certain number of members directed that the permission be granted.  When such matters come before special meetings thus convened it has happened that the manager stated that in his opinion granting of this permission would contravene the development plan adopted by that authority and that in those circumstances he cannot comply with the directions just given and is obliged to submit this application to the Minister for a decision.</P>
    <P>This is a device that is being operated by certain county managers to circumvent the rights of elected local authorities to exercise section 4 of the 1955 Act.  The amendment that I propose would make this position very clear.  I am informed that some county managers do not read their powers and their responsibilities in this area in the same light as others and that there is an inconsistency in the approach between one local authority and another.  Lest it be said that I favour a wholesale use of section 4, especially in planning matters, I certainly do not.  I am <Col N="1729" /> aware that the section has been abused in some areas but that is a matter of opinion.  If this House is sincere in claiming that the elected members are the planning authority, surely they are entitled to make a decision regarding a planning application made under that plan and in the exercising of their rights under section 4 of the management Act.  I would like to have this loophole being used by managers sealed off.  I am suggesting that this is a way of doing it.  I am sorry that Deputy Callanan is not here.</P>

      <P>Very often it is difficult to know what is considered fair in planning matters.  The amendment in its present form is unacceptable.  It cuts across a fundamental principle of the 1963 Act that where a development plan is made or varied the public should be afforded an opportunity to comment, make representations or submit objections.  The plan has a binding effect when adopted.  Section 22 of the 1963 Act imposed a duty on planning authorities to take steps to secure the objective contained in the provision of the plans.  Section 26 required the planning authority to have regard to the provision of the plan when considering an application. Accordingly, the plan serves as a guide to developers and affords protection to property owners.  A plan cannot anticipate every eventuality and there must be some provision for flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minor departures are permissible and a material contravention may be allowed with the consent of the Minister under section 26(3).  But even at that stage, there is a procedure laid down for the giving of public notices, for the making of objections and for the consideration by the Minister of such objections.  Section 26 (3) expressly <Col N="1730" /> forbids a planning authority to give permission for development which would materially contravene the development plan or any special amenity order save with the consent of the Minister.  The amendment does not deal with the existing statutory provision and is, therefore, objectionable on legal grounds as well as on principle.  However, I am not opposed to the intent of the Deputy's amendment. I propose to consider, before Report Stage, whether it would be possible to substitute a new procedure for section 26(3) which would enable elected members to authorise material contraventions subject to consideration of any objections by members of the public or prescribed bodies.  A number of sections in the 1963 Act will have to be examined.  But, if the drafting difficulties can be overcome, it might be possible to bring in the amendment on Report Stage.  I trust that this will meet the Deputy's wishes.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Local Government to increase substantially financial investment in the building industry, with special provision for the private housebuilding sector, in view of the serious decline in the numbers employed in the industry over the past twelve months and the urgent need to create jobs to cope with the high level of general unemployment in the country&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was speaking on the unemployment in the construction industry, and the official figures&mdash;and I emphasise official&mdash; given show that from April, 1974, to March of this year there has been an increase of 6,300 men unemployed. Even though the Minister may say that the housing part of that industry is 40 per cent only, nevertheless there are 6,300 men more unemployed now <Col N="1731" /> than there were in April, 1974, which must have a very serious effect on output in the industry.  If one adds the rising number of unemployed, the tremendous rise in costs in every facet of housing, they all tend to put the purchase of a house beyond the reach of any person seeking an SDA loan with its ridiculously low limit of £4,500.  Young couples especially are giving up in despair and are now seeking rented accommodation for which they have often to pay £10, £12 or more pounds per week because they cannot save sufficient money for the deposit on a house.  I am told that the average house in the SDA bracket now would be around the £7,000 mark in the Dublin city area.</P>
      <P>We look forward to tomorrow afternoon when the Minister for Finance introduces what he calls his Financial Resolution, in other words, a Budget.  Our people are looking forward and, indeed, demanding that the Government should come to their senses, provide the necessary capital to revitalise the construction industry so that unemployed men and women may go back to work and help to produce those thousands of dwellings needed and give some hope to the many people seeking proper housing accommodation.  I quoted the Minister's speech at Dungarvan, though the Minister thought I misquoted him. I quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> of the 6th June, 1975, the heading &ldquo;Council Seek Too Much Aid: Tully's Housing Cut Back&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister will refute his statement at Dungarvan that there is a threatened cut-back, because any cut-back on the present housing situation will only bring forward the day of chaos.  Therefore, we look forward to the Minister asserting his authority on the Government and demanding that adequate finances be made available for the building of houses or flats and the provision of SDA loans and grants.  In general, we want a firebrigade action taken in the housing Department to save it from complete collapse because that is where it is heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the number of unemployed increases for the coming year at the same <Col N="1732" /> rate as they have in the past year the construction industry will grind to a halt.  The Government have a chance tomorrow to stop the rot in the industry by the provision of adequate finance.  Therefore the Minister's speech in Dungarvan may have been merely to frighten us a bit.  Tomorrow afternoon when the Minister delivers his Financial Resolution and we see the size of the injection of money into the construction industry we will know the Minister was not too serious at Dungarvan.  If the Minister refutes that statement tonight I will be very glad indeed because the report of what he said was that some local authorities would not need the money because they may have over-estimated.  That is not terribly serious, but what is serious is that local authorities be not deprived of any money they need to build the houses and flats.  It is the Government only who can ensure that the money will be put at their disposal. We have all a duty to housing, to do whatever we possibly can to help in the provision of houses and all types of dwellings for people who need them. Those of us in this city have gone out, searched for suitable sites, come back with those sites and have given them over to the Corporation whose planners and officials have budgeted for the building of dwellings on these sites. We cannot do any more, but we cannot stand back and watch the Government allow a great industry to almost die. This is what is going to happen.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks I am exaggerating, I will direct his attention to official figures from the Central Statistics Office on the growing rate of unemployment in the construction industry, which showed that from April, 1974 to March, 1975, the increase in unemployed men was 6,378.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Fianna Fáil speakers here yesterday evening and Deputy Moore this evening talk about the building industry.  Apart from the fact that they seem to have two things in mind, one, that they will try to make out that the building industry consists entirely of house-building&mdash;which of course, they must know is wrong&mdash;and, secondly, the fact that the house-building <Col N="1733" /> industry, as such, is doing fairly well in the country, they were trying to denigrate it.</P>
      <P>What surprises me is that some people who should know much better do not seem to either take the trouble to check or, if they do take the trouble to do so, they use selective figures for the purpose of trying to knock down the Government's success in the house-building industry.  When we took office we said that we would aim at building 25,000 houses per year.  The facts are that, not alone have the 25,000 houses been achieved once and, if you remember, the first year we were in office the whining and the moaning of Deputy Molloy particularly over there about the fact that the building industry was falling flat, that the 21,500 houses which he claimed to have built the previous year could not be reached by any stretch of the imagination, lo and behold, we built 25,365 houses.  He remained quiet for a short while.  Then in the middle of last year the same moaning started: we will all be ruined, Deputy Molloy said; the house-building industry has gone; everybody is being made unemployed; everything has gone wrong and the Government are doing nothing about it.  He was so impressive that even the Press took up the story.  They started on the same thing, some of them doing the harmonising for him, again, people who should have known better.  They proceeded to make predictions as to what was likely to happen.  He did it once but it cannot be done a second time. This was the clarion cry from some of the Fourth Estate.  What happened? Not alone did we do it a second time but the builders of this country increased the number from 25,365 to 26,639.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a while afterwards there was silence again from the Fianna Fáil benches.  We are coming on to a time now when the crescendo should rise and off it goes again and it will be away up again, &ldquo;everything is ruined, the country will be ruined&rdquo;.  If it is not the weather it is something else and we hear about the shocking thing and that the Government have made no money available.  I mentioned that the Press have done it.  We have now <Col N="1734" /> got the radio coming in on the act. They had a balanced programme today, I understand, when they had a member of the Federation of Building Industries and they had Deputy Faulkner who were both prepared to stand up and in a completely unbiased way, give both sides of the picture and talk about the state the building industry was in.

In fairness, I will say there are a number of Deputies here who may only read one side of the coin and therefore they do not know what is happening on the other side.  As Deputy Faulkner said, there is no point in giving figures.  I agree with him.  There is no point in giving facts to some people because they do not want to hear them.  It only confuses them.  We have reached the stage here where, having listened so much to the other side and the Parliamentary Secretary having given a certain amount of unpalatable statistics yesterday to those on the other side I want to hit home into the records of this House some statistics which are a little nearer home than the rest because it appears that certain people want to talk particularly about Dublin, Dublin county, Dublin city <Col N="1735" /> or Dún Laoghaire Corporation.

In 1971-72, Dublin County Council got £1,537,000; 1972-73: £3,348,000; 1973-74: £2,584,000, then nine months of 1974, £4,003,000 and for 1975, the period during which Deputy Burke was prepared to get headlines in the <i>Evening Press, Evening Herald</i> and <i>Irish Independent</i>, we gave £8,500,000 for local authority houses, for this year as against a measly £1,537,000 in 1971-72.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputies not cod themselves?  Those are the facts and there is no question of inflation eating up from £1½ million to £8½ million.  House purchase loan and supplementary grants, 1971-72, Dublin County Council, £1,150,000; 1972-73, £1,100,000; 1973-74, £4,750,000; 1974, the nine-month period, £7,950,000 and for this year £7,500,000.  Dublin County Borough, local authority housing, 1971-72, £5,200,000; 1972-73, £6,500,000; 1973-74, £8,560,000; 1974, the nine-month period, £8,500,000 and this year £11,500,000.  Deputy Burke gets headlines for saying that &ldquo;you are starved of capital try to digest those and Dublin city&rdquo;.  House purchase loans and supplementary grants, Dublin County Borough: 1971-72, £335,000; 1972-73, £880,000: 1973-74, £1,753,000; the 1974 nine-month period, £1,360,000, and 1975, £1,680,000.  The total for Dublin County Borough has gone up from £5,535,000 to £13,180,000.  Those people have the cheek to talk about money not being made available and about the building industry not getting the support in the Dublin area to which it is entitled. <Col N="1736" /> Dún Laoghaire Corporation, 1971-72, Local Authority Housing, £180,000; 1972-73, £397,000; 1973-74, £295,000; the 1974 nine-month period, £938,000 and 1975, £1,500,000.  House Purchase Loans, supplementary grants, the same local authority, 1971-72, £115,000; 1972-73, £62,000; 1973-74, £50,000; 1974 nine-month period, £30,000 and this year, £30,000.  The total has gone up from £295,000 to £1,530,000.</P>
      <P>Sanitary services is not really in this debate but it was introduced by some people who wanted to talk about it. Dublin County Council sanitary services allocation was £1,034,220 in 1971-72 and £2,776,000 in 1975.  Dublin Corporation allocation rose from £290,000 in 1971-72 to £950,000 in this year.  The road fund similarly rose from £1,539,830 to £1,891,900 for Dublin Corporation and from £745,600, for Dublin County Council to £2,173,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Dún Laoghaire Corporation, £111,320 to £156,340.  An additional £224,000 for sanitary services is earmarked for Dublin County Council for urgent schemes for housing.  This will bring the total allocation for Dublin County Council for 1975 to £3,031,000.  This brings the total allocation for the Dublin area for 1975 to £3,981,000.  Will those who are squealing about the fact that Dublin is being starved of capital, try to digest those figures and then realise that Dublin has been getting a very handsome return? I am not apologising for giving it to Dublin because while we have local authorities throughout the country who, for the last two years, are making desperate efforts to try to catch up on the many years of money starvation&mdash; some of them have done a tremendous job&mdash;there are a few big areas, particularly this city area, where all the money that could be got from any source whatever could be spent on housing and we still would be only housing those in a pretty high housing category.  It is a disgrace and a shame on those who went before us that this situation was allowed to build up.  I am proud of what I have done and what the Government have done with regard to providing money but I am <Col N="1737" /> sorry that we are still not able to make the money available, which we should be able to make available, because of the type of money required to make up on a long backlog, where people just sat back and felt that anything at all was good enough for people living in bad conditions, after all most of them were only workers so it did not matter about them.  I am sorry that we are not able to catch up on that.</P>
      <P>The other thing is with regard to house standards.  Before this debate finishes, I want to make it very clear that those who were responsible for setting up the house standards for local authority houses in this country have a sin to answer for and that sin will be round their necks for the next 20 years, which is about as long as the houses they built will last.  They built a disgraceful type of house.  The Fianna Fáil Government decided that it was wrong to continue building houses to last 100 years.  They said that 20 to 25 years should be long enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Pa O'Donnell is dead many years.  The people who were in charge of finance and housing are here now and please God will be alive for many years but every time they pass one of these dog boxes I hope they blush with shame because the houses which were built for working class people should never have been built.  The proof of it is that they <Col N="1738" /> attempted to sell at a very high rate the houses which they built to last 20 to 25 years on a 35 year purchase scheme.  The nerve of people who do a thing like that is beyond the beyonds.</P>
      <P>Let nobody in Fianna Fáil tell me that they do not know of the houses I am talking about.  First of all they decided that they would put central heating in them only.  Then we had a very decent Deputy of this House who is doing his best, Deputy Tunney, today asking me what assistance I could give to paying bills of £200, £300 or £400 which some of these unfortunate people in Deputy Burke's constituency have to pay because of the fact that the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke may have his name on the motion but Deputy Tunney made an effort to ensure that something might be done. The situation is that it is not my responsibility.  The previous Minister was responsible for the erection of those houses, for the installation of the central heating and there is no way in which I can help these people except with what I have done.  I have offered to make available grants and I suggested to local authorities that they can help out in many cases with loans to try to introduce the solid fuel type of heating and cooking which they are used to and which they can operate.  However, I am not going to carry the cross which has been placed there by somebody else. With regard to the housing scheme in Cork we are now getting on top of the bad conditions there.  Even with houses which were terribly cheap to erect they were not able to build more than 4,500 local authority houses per year&mdash;14,600 of an average.  Deputy Faulkner does not like averages.  We have averaged the two years we have been in office and it is approximately 26,000 in each year.  The situation is that Fianna Fáil have a sin to answer for and they have a hard neck coming in here and telling us that we are responsible for destroying the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1739" /> It is only right that I should again put on record that in 1971-72, the Fianna Fáil Government provided £64.16 million in the public capital programme for building and construction. In 1972-73 the amount was £81.71 million, an increase of 28 per cent. Two years later, in 1975, the present Government are making £168.56 million available, more than double the amount in Fianna Fáil's last year of office.  That cannot be denied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Has not inflation helped that figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is gabby talk.  I do not wish to anticipate the proposal which the Minister for Finance will lay before the House tomorrow but on our past record the Dáil will know that if a need for an even greater level of investment this year is established, then additional money will be forthcoming.  We made it available last year; we even made it available this year.  Deputy Faulkner wanted to know what happened the extra £4 million for local authority housing. He did not notice the £3 million which we got.  The £4 million is available now and is being used at the present time.  Deputy Faulkner will find it in the next returns.  The figure mentioned was £7 million and £7 million is being made available on top of £51 million which is by far the largest amount ever made available for this purpose. The decision, of course, will be made on the basis of the Government's continuous monitoring of the position affecting the industry and the economic importance of this form of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing allocations which totalled £45 million in 1972-73 are more than £105 million this year.  Sanitary and environmental services have risen from £10 million to £19.5 million. Schools and educational buildings from £16 million to £26 million and hospitals from £6.63 million to £10 million.  The allocation for other general buildings and construction was £4 million in 1972-73 and is £9 million in 1975.  I do not deny that inflation has resulted in a reduction but even the most blinkered Deputy <Col N="1740" /> opposite would hardly suggest that there has been 100 per cent inflation since 1973.  A huge increase since the change of Government in State investment to the various sections of the construction industry has been due not to inflation though its influence could not be avoided but to the acceptance by the present Administration of the national social and economic importance of this form of investment.</P>
    <P>The money has been put in and is being used.  It is true that there are people unemployed in the building industry.  It is true that a number of office blocks are not being built. That is so.  The industry throughout Western Europe, and throughout most of the world, is suffering but this country has done a lot better than any other country, not alone in Europe, but in the world and that is not excluding Japan.  We have come off remarkably well.  The Government's planning has produced results.  I would not worry if Fianna Fáil had been over here as to what they would do.  I know they would do as they always did. They let the workers carry the brunt and then they would say: we will weather the storm, there is prosperity around the corner.</P>

Do not forget that when I took over as Minister there were 14,500 unemployed in the building industry.  When we talk about 18,000 or 19,000 unemployed now&mdash;</P>

When we talk about that we are talking about an extra 5,000 unemployed in the entire building industry only 40 per cent of which is the house building industry. I wonder whether or not the Fianna Fáil Party believe some of the things they have been saying.  Do Fianna Fáil believe that if they were in office <Col N="1741" /> they would now be building 25,000 houses and over per year in view of what they had been doing over the years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Do they believe that they would continue to be allowed to build the type of dog box which they built?  Do they believe they would get away with that or what would they have done?  The cost of the improvement in the standard of local authority housing has to be taken into consideration as well as the additional houses which are being built.  Of course, we have had Fianna Fáil telling us that they would make an immense amount of money available. Would Fianna Fáil answer me one question?  If the 25,000 houses we intend to average over the years is not enough, and if the tremendous amount of money which we have been pumping into the building industry is not sufficient, will Fianna Fáil say where they would get the extra money?  Where would they find the hundreds of millions of pounds which they talk about in Opposition but which they were very quiet about when they were over here?  It was easy enough talking to Fianna Fáil when they were on this side of the House because they knew better than anybody else that one just could not get it out of the air and proceed to spend it.  It had to be found, it had to be earned, it had to be borrowed. While all of us might have a different point of view when we were in Opposition to what we have here it grieves me that ex-Ministers of this State are not well-enough aware of what the facts are to be able to state what the real situation is.  In 1972-73 local authorities had a capital allocation of £25.38 million and they completed 5,784 houses and flats.  A sum of £27 million was allocated for their work in 1973-74 and because of inflation &mdash; if that had not been invented by the National Coalition Government &mdash; this would have been sufficient to produce only 5,400 dwellings the following year.  When we took over <Col N="1742" /> we increased the allocation to £32 million.  We completed 6,539 houses and flats in 1973-74.</P>
      <P>I heard on a number of occasions both the present spokesman for Local Government and his predecessor talking here about what they proposed to do and the number of houses they had planned and were in progress when Fianna Fáil went out of office. I want to state categorically that the number of houses would have been well down from the figure of 21,500 which they have been claiming because they made no provision for more than 19,000 to 20,000 houses. They cannot get away from that because the figures are there, even with the amount of money which would be available to spend and if inflation had not taken hold.  Fianna Fáil must know this is true.</P>

      <P>The rising costs were not affecting the situation here. Fianna Fáil had no intention of building more than 4,500 local authority houses the year they left office.  We are coming up quite close to the 8,000 local authority houses now.  I know Fianna Fáil do not like that.  I have heard their spokesmen and I noted some of the slanted questions which they asked here today and which as much as suggested: how much have the local authority houses cost by way of subsidy; sow it in the minds of the people that it is costing too much to house these workers.  Do something else with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned, we will continue to provide houses for the workers and will continue to subsidise their cost.  Those houses will stand four square with any grant-aided houses in this country.  I <Col N="1743" /> am proud of them and to be part of the Government who are responsible for having put them there, well-built, well-planned houses that will be there in 50, 60 or 100 years.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that it should be necessary for me to refer again to one of the effects of the Fianna Fáil policy in denying services and providing an inadequate amount of capital.  I brought the matter to the attention of the House on a number of occasions but evidently the message has not registered.  Last night Deputy Faulkner mentioned that in 1972-73 a total of 21,647 new houses were completed, representing an increase of 36 per cent over the 15,931 houses recorded as being completed the previous year.  The facts of the situation are that the money provided by the previous Administration in 1971-72 to finance private housing grants was much lower than was necessary to pay the grants promptly when they fell due.  In consequence, a liability totalling £626,000 had to be carried forward into 1972-73. In other words, more than 2,000 new house grants, which should have been paid in 1971-72 because the houses had been fully completed before 31st March, 1972, were not paid until the following year, 1972-73.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <P>They were recorded in the last year in which Fianna Fáil were in office.  I only went in on 14th March and from that to 31st March 21,500 houses were produced, but 2,000 of those had been built for over 12 months.  When I hear some of the pundits talking about carrying houses from one year to the other for the purpose of boosting them up, there is a typical example of how it is done.  We have not done it since because we said we would build 25,000, and we built 25,365.  Does somebody suggest that we carried forward a couple of thousand houses so that we could have 26,639 the next year, or that we are carrying forward a couple of thousand more so that we can go over the 25,000 mark again next year?</P>

      <P>Deputy Faulkner came up with a lot of nonsense last night and he is now getting his reply and he does not like it.  The trouble with most of the people on the Fianna Fáil benches is that they are good at dishing it out and they have not been getting it back so hard.  They are going to get a dose of their own medicine tonight, because I am sick and tired of people who have such a bad record on housing as Fianna Fáil have, having the hard neck to come in here and talk about their housing record or the record of the Government in which they participated and indeed in which some of them were Ministers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner was somewhat critical of the slight increase in completions in the year ending 31st March, 1975, as compared with the preceding 12 months.  Might I remind the Deputy and the Dáil that the commitment at the moment is not to accomplish an increase in the housing programme but to accomplish a steady output of approximately 25,000 new houses.  This means that in four years we will have completed 100,000 new dwellings, or more than the total completions in the last seven years of the Fianna Fáil Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer particularly to what I was supposed to have said in Dungarvan. I was speaking in Dungarvan at the opening of a very beautiful and well-built housing scheme.  I feel it is necessary in this context to put the record straight in relation to that speech which I made in Dungarvan. Some of my remarks on that occasion in connection with the allocation of capital for local authority house schemes have been misconstrued.  Deputy Faulkner's reference to the matter last night gives an indication of this.  I would like to explain as follows.  A record £51 million was provided under the public capital programme in February for local authority houses.  Within weeks of the budget the Government announced that steps were being taken to make a further £7 million available, because an examination of claims submitted by housing authorities showed <Col N="1745" /> that more money would be needed to maintain the programme at its current high level.  It is necessary in this regard to differentiate between the amount of money claimed by housing authorities acting individually who naturally want to start and build as many houses as possible and the total amount that was allocated under the budget.</P>
    <P>Housing authorities usually seek in the aggregate far more capital than any Government could provide, bearing in mind the current economic situation and the amount of finance which can reasonably be raised by taxation or State borrowing and the many essential services competing with local authority housing for a share of that finance.  What I said was that I would proceed to give the money to the local authorities but the local authorities who asked for a lot more money than they could hope to spend this year would not get that extra money.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he was sick and tired of listening to criticism.  I see the Minister leaving the House.  I have some figures here that the Minister might be sick listening to as well.  If there is any sense of decency left in the Coalition Government, a figure of 20,000 unemployed in the building industry would make any Labour Minister with responsibility for Local Government and the building industry sick.  We heard much chat about houses and dog boxes but we did not hear much about the 20,000 people unemployed in the building trade who were not unemployed when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For well over a year, we on this side of the House have been consistently advising the Government, and in particular the Minister for Local Government, that unless they took some remedial measures the building industry and those employed in it were in for a very difficult time. On all occasions, and again tonight, we were told by the Minister that we were being mischievous and scaremongering. We in the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1746" /> Party were approaching this question as a very serious subject affecting the whole economy in this country.  We went so far, in February last, as to place a Motion before this House outlining specific steps which we thought would help in the crisis that we saw at that time developing.</P>
    <P>In speaking on the Motion on the 5th February, the Minister gave the clear impression that everything in the building industry was fine.  When I speak of that motion it might do no harm at this stage if I quoted it.  It was proposed by Deputy Faulkner, and many of us on this side of the House had the honour of signing the motion which proposed:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that in view of the crisis in the private sector of the house building industry, provision should now be made for (a) an increase in the local authority maximum new house loan limit to £6,000 and in the income limit to £3,000; (b) a 50 per cent increase in new house grants; (c) the abolition of liability for income tax on interest paid by building societies on deposits up to £5,000; (d) the granting of trustee status to building societies and (e) the charging of fixed interest rates on building society mortgages.</P>
    <P>I, for one, am quite satisfied that if the Government had accepted the Fianna Fáil motion rather than voting against it on that Wednesday night on the 5th February we would not be in the mess that we are in now &mdash; and &ldquo;mess&rdquo; is the only word that can be used to describe a situation where in mid-March, 1975, there were 19,887 building workers unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Minister, a couple of minutes ago, denied that there were 20,000 unemployed.  The figure was 19,887 if he wants to quibble about it being brought up to 20,000 &mdash; fair enough. There were 19,887 building workers unemployed in 1975 in an industry which the Minister had the gall, a couple of minutes ago, to tell us was doing well.  The total unemployment figure at that stage in the country was 102,924.  There were 73,800 <Col N="1747" /> people employed in the building industry at that time.  The level of unemployment of building workers was, therefore, over 20 per cent of the building workers who were unemployed at March, 1975, in an industry which the Minister tells us is doing well and could not be doing better. This figure is approximately twice the general unemployment level.  These figures relate to people who are directly employed.  Of course, another 30,000 people are employed by people who manufacture and distribute building materials.  Many of these workers have been laid off or are on short time because of a fall in demand for building material.</P>
    <P>One group of workers, together with their employers, a firm that employs many men from the Minister's own constituency as well as from mine, felt so strongly about the danger to their livelihood that they took a full page advertisement in <i>The Sunday Press</i> of the 9th February, 1975, and I should like to quote from it.  It reads:</P>
    <P>Ireland's building industry has only two options &mdash; drawing bricks or drawing the dole.  There is no doubt about the country's desperate need for more housing.  Let us get building going again.  &mdash; Issued jointly by Wavin Pipes Limited and Wavin Pipes Works Council.</P>
    <P>The workers' council in the factory were so concerned about their jobs that they went together with their employers and asked the Government, for God's sake, for help.</P>
    <P>How can the situation be as bad as it is at the moment or how could such a crisis have come about if the picture were as rosy as that painted by the Minister?  It is only when one examines the output of the building industry <i>in toto</i> that the true picture begins to emerge.  I should like to quote, at this stage, from a press release of the Building Material Federation on the 19th June.  The Building Material Federation is a division of the Confederation of Irish Industry and the release is headed: &ldquo;The Building Industry; Problems And Solutions,&rdquo; and I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1748" /> The Department of Local Government has now issued its &ldquo;Review of Outturn for 1974-75 and Outlook for 1975.&rdquo;  This document is useful in that it gives us a picture of what the present state of the building industry is and also indicates what changes are planned for the current year.  The following is a condensed picture of the information contained in tables I and II of the document: Output of Building Industry.</P>

      <P>I got this document from the Library in the Dáil this afternoon, and surely I am entitled to quote any figures from a document I get from the Library of the Dáil.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has any objection he is depriving the Dáil of the view of the Confederation of Irish Industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the reference.  I can understand why the Parliamentary Secretary might be sensitive about the figures because I know that he will not like to hear them.  The document gives the output of the building industry as follows: In the private sector, factory building and workshops in 1973-74 were £43.60 million; Housing, £153.10 million and the rest of the sector £104.59 million. The total in the private sector was £301.29 million and the public sector was £77.15 million, a total of £378.44 million.  In 1975 the same figure, the official estimate of the Department of Local Government, is £537.99 million which, on the face of it, is quite impressive. But when you take it at constant 1968-69 prices the relevant figures are for 1973-74 £208.25 million and the official estimate of the Department for 1975, £195.14 million. These official estimates show that the output of the building industry is expected to decline for the second year in succession, i.e., down from £208.25 million in 1973-74 to £205.18 million <Col N="1749" /> in 1974-75 to £195.14 million in the current year (1968-69 prices).</P>
      <P>We have the Minister coming in here and telling us about the marvellous sums of money he is spending. Here are a few figures which might just soften his cough.</P>
      <P>A closer examination of the figures suggests that the decline in output of the building industry is greater than the £28 million (current prices) estimated by the Department of Local Government.</P>
      <P>Once again, to quote the figures, there is in real money terms (1968-69) a decrease in 1973-74 to £208.25 million, 1974-75, £205.18 million, and the estimate for 1975 is £195.14 million.</P>
      <P>I can appreciate the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary might not like those figures.  If I were a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister responsible for the building industry I would not like the figures.  These figures clearly indicate the magnitude of the problem facing the industry, the problem brought on by the lack of investment and lack of remedial action when difficulties were seen on the horizon by this Government.  It is not that they were not warned of the problems by Members of this side of the House.  Of course, every time we warned of problems we were told we were scaremongering and that we were being mischievous.</P>
      <P>Another barometer is cement sales. They have always been, by their very nature, seen as a fair barometer of the health of the building industry.  The Department of Local Government recognised that fact in its Review and outlook document which states:</P>
      <P>...cement sales generally maintain a fixed relationship with building and construction work carried out by contractors...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cement sales were down by 12 per cent for the first five months of 1975 compared to 1974.  It seems fair enough, therefore, to assume that the real downturn for 1975 would prove to be 12 per cent rather than 5 per cent estimated by the Department. <Col N="1750" /> But we still had the Minister in here, half an hour ago, telling us that everything was fine; the building industry was booming and everything was going well.  We had the Parliamentary Secretary last night telling us the same thing. Fair enough, the man has a job to do, to defend his corner.  If I was in the same situation I would probably be doing the same thing.  But I would not be in that corner.</P>
    <P>The Department's estimate for housing output for 1975 is 25,000 houses. This figure includes 16,100 grant-aided houses.  The Estimates for Public Services from 1st January, 1975 to 31st December show that only £5 million has been allocated to the Department of Local Government for grants for new houses.  This £5 million will be sufficient to pay only 13,300 grants, compared to the 16,100 houses piously hoped for by the Government.  On 31st March, 1975 the amount of SDA loans on hand amounted to £58 million.  In contrast only £37.5 million has been provided for SDA loans.  I could go on and on quoting figures which would further prove the problems facing the building industry and those employed in it.  The fact that there is a major problem is self-evident.  It is evident to everybody other than the Minister and that side of the House.  The unfortunate state of the economy is such that all sectors are facing the same tale of woe.  We in Fianna Fáil, recognising the problem, are attempting to force the hand of a static and destructive Government into taking some action.</P>
    <P>Our motion, if accepted, will have the effect of tackling the three main problems facing the Irish economy in 1975 &mdash; unemployment, inflation and the balance of payments deficit.  Of course, there is the fourth problem facing the Irish economy, and that is the presence of the present regime, because if they were to leave and hand over to a Government that could once again instill confidence in the community generally we might get out of this mess before it is too late.  But, unfortunately, it is unlikely that they will take the honourable course and get out and let the country be ruled by a one-party Government again, rather than a house divided against itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> We have unemployment running at 10 per cent, inflation running at between 25 and 30 per cent and a balance of payments deficit of around £200 million.  It is no harm to mention the motion tabled by Fianna Fáil because we had a speech for half an hour from the Minister for Local Government and not once did he refer to the motion.  He did give a list of figures.  The terms of the Motion are:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Local Government to increase substantially financial investment in the building industry, with special provision for the private house-building sector, in view of the serious decline in the numbers employed in the industry over the past twelve months and the urgent need to create jobs to cope with the high level of general unemployment in the country.</P>
    <P>If the Government take the action suggested by us in that motion they will be helping the economy generally because the building industry is a labour intensive industry for those employed directly and there is the spin-off effect for those in subsidiary industries.  The building industry requires very little imports and most of the materials used in the industry are home-produced.  This, in turn, will help our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>We had appeals from Government Ministers recently, from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for patriotism on the part of the workers and the people of this country.  I would appeal to the elected Government to be patriotic, to forget cheap political manoeuvring and to look at the country and the state of its economy and the social effects of there being over 100,000 people unemployed and to take the decisions which are necessary.  The necessary decisions are referred to in the motion.  Tonight the Minister and the Government will have the opportunity of voting with us on this side of the House.  Forget the narrow political view.  Let the Government admit <Col N="1752" /> failure and give the building industry in particular and the economy of the country in general, the injection of cash it so badly needs.</P>
    <P>Where are they going to put this cash and how can it be to the greatest benefit?  It can have the greatest effect if the Government take the advice we gave them in the Private Members' Motion in February last, if they increase the SDA loans from the present limit of £4,500 to £6,000 and the income limit from £2,350 to £3,000.  We had an argument against this last night put up by the Parliamentary Secretary who said that if this action was taken it would result in builders increasing their prices. Deputy Molloy, when he was Minister for Local Government, brought in a regulation which controlled and restricted the price of houses under a reasonable value certificates order. Every house must go to the Department of Local Government for a reasonable value certificate.  This automatically contradicts the argument put up by the Parliamentary Secretary that if you increase the SDA loan it will automatically increase the price of the house.  This does not hold water.</P>
    <P>On the figures admitted by the Department of Local Government, the cost of a new house is roughly £7,500.  The maximum SDA loan is £4,500, a difference of £3,000.  To qualify for the £4,500 an applicant must be earning less than £2,350.  If he is earning less than £2,350 he is expected to find, in the mind of the Government, the balance between £4,500 and £7,500 &mdash; £3,000 of a difference, plus solicitor's fees and there are a fair few too.  How is any young man, trying to make a home for himself, expected to save £3,000, if he is earning less than £2,350?  I emphasise that is only on a deposit on the house.  He also has the other expenses such as furniture and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in speaking on our motion on the 5th February last, said that he, in his time, had increased the figures on SDA loans by 18 per cent. I would remind the Minister that since <Col N="1753" /> May, 1973 &mdash; and nobody has to be told about the inflation rate since May, 1973 &mdash; not one halfpenny extra has the Minister given on SDA loans or on income limits.  All you get is pious speeches handed out at openings of housing estates most of which were initiated under Fianna Fáil, the planning of them and so on.  One way that the Government could help is by increasing the SDA loan from £4,500 to £6,000.</P>
    <P>The other part of the suggestion made in February, which still holds good and which I hope the Minister for Finance will bring forward tomorrow in what we hope will be an injection of capital into the building industry, and there and then the lie will be nailed, is that if money is put into the building industry tomorrow, despite what the Parliamentary Secretary said last night and despite what the Minister said tonight, it proves the point that we have been making all along that there has been a problem, there is a problem and it is getting worse.</P>

We have more unemployed than workers the way it is going.  You have nearly 20,000 unemployed in the building industry as at March, 1975&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;19,887 as at March, 1975.  Deputy Desmond, as a Labour Member, does not like to hear these figures.  I would be embarrassed if I was a Labour Member in this <Col N="1754" /> House supporting a Government that would have such figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They should have taken the line that we suggested as far back as last February when we were told by the Government that there was no problem in the building industry, when we suggested a 50 per cent increase in new house grants and supplementary grants.  This would give young couples anxious to buy homes an opportunity to buy them and would generate interest in the building industry and development within the building sector rather than recession.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Desmond wants to talk about recession in the building industry all he has to do is look at a review of 1974 and the outlook for 1975.  We also suggested the granting of trustee status to building societies and we were told on 5th of February by the Minister that trustee status was coming.  The Minister for Finance announced it and so it was going to happen.  When is it going to happen? Is it just another Press announcement, another promise or another commission?  As one Labour member mentioned, they are a great Government for commissions, reports and promises but they are slow on the action.  We have not got this trustee status which would be helping the present situation.  The abolition of liability for income tax and interest paid on building society deposits up to £5,000 would have helped also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This could and would have helped the situation but we have had one continuous record of failure.  Building accounts for roughly one eighth of the nation's gross national product.  Hence, what happens to building is very important to the economy.  We want more money devoted now to building.  I have spelled out the various areas in which the money could be spent but there are other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention one of them that the Minister emphasised <Col N="1755" /> when he opened his remarks.  I must have been hitting a sensitive chord in the Minister for some considerable time because he spent about the first five minutes attacking the speeches I have made at the Dublin County Council.  I will give the Minister a figure from the Dublin County Council. The estimates for sewerage and water works to be carried out by the Dublin County Council, prepared by the Dublin County Council's engineers as being necessary works in the year ahead, amount to £6 million.  We got a report back from the Department saying that they would sanction £3 million.  To build houses you need an infrastructure.  You need proper sewerage and water.  You need proper roads.  Without these you cannot have development or build housing schemes. We got exactly half of what we were looking for, which means that our whole programme of development within County Dublin, which would allow further increases in local authority houses, in the private houses and also in the industrial sphere, is to be cut by half.  In fact the work will be stopped because most of the work that the £3 million will cover is already in hand.</P>

      <P>We have the situation that we have a Government divided against themselves and within themselves &mdash; against themselves from various parties and within themselves from various individuals.  We have the Minister for Local Government in the very embarrassing situation that for 18 months he has been telling us that everything in the garden is rosy with regard to the building industry.  We will see that lie nailed to the mast tomorrow.  If we do not and if the Government are afraid to take the action which is necessary by injecting capital into the building industry all we will see is a continuation of the ever-increasing number of unemployed in that sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want and hope to see is that this Private Members' Motion, which is all embracing, will be accepted.  It <Col N="1756" /> would help in the immediate way the building industry but in the long term will also help the general economy.  We all know that in Irish economic life the building industry is a great barometer of how the rest of the economy is doing.  If we check that barometer we are going backwards instead of forwards. We are not even standing still. Let the Minister and the Government accept this motion.  Do not put it to a division.  Let the Minister for Finance come in tomorrow and give this necessary injection of money to the building industry.  This money should have been pumped into the building industry 12 months ago.  We want that money pumped in tomorrow.  When it is, I assume that the Parliamentary Secretary will eat the words he spoke last night and that the Minister will do likewise with the words he spoke tonight.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if this country is to prosper or come out of the depths of the depression it is in and go again on the path of steady progress we saw under successive Fianna Fáil administrations, the one way is for this Government to take this advice even if it is coming from this side of the House.  Be big about it.  Be national about it.  The Coalition Government are good at calling for patriotism from the workers. How about a bit of patriotism from the Government elected by the people?  Do this and there might be some slight hope of a recovery within the economy, that is assuming that the Government drop all of the other mischievous legislation on such things as wealth tax and capital gains tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, we have heard from the Opposition for the last two years since we took office saying that we would not attain our target of 25,000 houses.  We have attained that and this year we have built 26,380. That to me is a clear indication that there is no crisis in the building industry. I am not saying there are not problems with regard to office development. There have been cut-backs in that as there have been in most other aspects of our economic life but that situation is not peculiar to this country alone.  To talk about house-building <Col N="1757" /> programmes and to compare them with the performance of the Opposition while in Government is of no significance.  As chairman of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation I am aware that there was no programme of house-building when we took office but the then new Minister for Local Government appointed a housing co-ordinator so as to try to put some semblance of order into what was a shambles.  As a result, this year, we have increased our output from an average of 1,064 houses annually to 1,500 and, next year, as a result of this planning, we hope to reach 2,300 or 2,400.  This is a significant increase.  The chief housing architect in Dublin Corporation told me he did not think he would have the staff or the building contractors to cope with the type of programme he is undertaking.</P>

      <P>There is no censorship on this side of the House.  All I am saying is that from the time the Coalition took office, there has been organised propaganda from the other side of the House in relation to the building industry.  For the first time, the local authority housing situation is being tackled.  It was not alone neglected but the houses that were built were, as the Minister said, ones that you would not put dogs into. They were substandard.</P>

      <P>They will be a monument to the party opposite for as long as they stand but I believe they will not stand for too long.  We are building the type of house which we believe people should have but Fianna Fáil sneer because they do not have to live in the substandard houses.  When we look at the overall figure we find that we have averaged in our two years 26,000 houses.  If we take that for the four-year period we will have built more than 100,000 houses at the time of going before the electorate again.  Fianna Fáil are confused. Every time they put down a motion they indicate how confused they are and they come out badly because they have not done their homework and have not considered the type of money that is going into the building construction industry.</P>

      <P>The disappointing feature in this motion is that the Government, judging by the speakers they have put before us both last night and tonight, have not yet realised that there are serious problems in the building industry.  This was the purpose behind this motion and no amount of statistics &mdash; whether they be confused statistics such as those meted out by the Parliamentary Secretary or any other &mdash; or whether it is the vulgar abuse that we got from the Minister for Local Government tonight, would hide the plight of the building industry, an industry that ranks next to our agricultural industry and which accounts for one-eighth of our GNP.  It is an industry that has been the barometer of the health of our economy for long but two members of the Government spent much time talking during this debate although they had nothing concrete to say.  I shall not even refer to the last contribution in which there was absolutely no content whatsoever. No reference was made to the loan situation and to the desirability that is well-known even among the backbenchers of the Government, for <Col N="1760" /> an increase in the SDA loan limit, nor indeed for the increase in the qualifying income limit.  No reference was made to the necessary increase in grants nor indeed to relieving the tax burden on the mortgage payments from the building societies.  These were the positive points put forward last night by Deputy Faulkner when he asked that even at this late stage the Government realise that there is a serious problem in the building industry and that the badly-needed injection be provided for in tomorrow's budget.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke emphasised in adequate detail that the amount of money available this year is lower than it was last year, if we consider the constant price factor.  There is one very relevant point I should like to make, that is the employment and the pattern of employment.  It is time that our Ministers in Government and indeed the Government parties generally forgot about blaming other sources for the situation, forgot about referring to what might have been the cause of this or that but began to realise that a problem exists, that there is massive unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure of 20,000 unemployed in the building industry has been mentioned here many times already this evening.  The pattern which emerged from April, 1974 to March, 1975 should have been a warning to the Government that the situation was worsening rapidly.  If one looks at the figures: in April, 1974 it increased by 188; in May, by 403: June, 472, July, 665.  It began to jump in August to 1,342; September, 1,988; October to 2,343; November to 3,009; December to 3,280; January to 4,661; February to 5,841 and March to 6,378.  The reason I emphasise that is to point to the warning signs being given there and to illustrate that no positive action was being taken particularly if one considers that the building industry and allied trades are probably those that react to stimulants more quickly than any others.  Imported raw material used is less than 25 per cent in that industry.  Consequently, we have the material products for the most part here at home.  Any injection, even <Col N="1761" /> at this late stage, of this late appeal to the Government tomorrow, would be a welcome one.  But we must be critical and are entitled to be critical of the performance and the way it has been handled to date.</P>
    <P>I have given the figures of the downturn in employment.  If we look at the various factors&mdash;and there is no point in anybody trying to confuse an issue with too many statistics, because members of the Government are just as aware of the situation as am I; if they go through their own constituencies, they will see that, in the builders' providers' premises, the staff is lower, the volume of business is lower, and sales are down.  If they go to the sand-and-gravel people and observe their products, they will find the same thing. If they go to the cement suppliers, they will find the same thing.  For example, from February, 1974 to February, 1975 cement sales on the home market were down by 12 per cent.  From March, 1974 to March, 1975 cement sales were down by 36 per cent.  These are accurate figures.  They tell one immediately that there is something wrong somewhere, that the amount of material is not going into the building industry, the same number of people are not working and no detailing of statistics will change that situation.</P>
    <P>Let me say also as there were a lot of figures bandied around here this evening, and a lot of false and foolish claims made in a most aggressive way, the most significant increase in the building of housing here occurred in the two years when the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Molloy, was Minister for Local Government.  In that period the number of houses built went up from approximately 15,000 to 21,500, a massive increase in two years of 6,500.  This was the launching pad and there is no point in the Minister saying otherwise.  This was the launching pad that gave him the opportunity of building his 25,000 houses in the first year of the Coalition's term of office.  Let me add this figure to what has been said.  Then perhaps we could show the people opposite the concern that should exist, that the bubble has burst already, and that no Government Information <Col N="1762" /> Bureau&mdash;no matter how well manipulated&mdash;can now belie the fact that this is troubling the ordinary working people dependent on that industry.  The percentage increase in the last year of Fianna Fáil's Government was 36 per cent, a 36 per cent increase in the number of houses built.  In the first year of Coalition Government the increase was 17 per cent; in the second the increase was 5 per cent and the third year of Coalition Government has yet to come, if it finishes.  Indeed from the present difficulties that we know exist within both parties and between the parties forming the Government, it may not finish its third year.  But, if it does, even the Minister knows and is satisfied that there will not be a percentage increase but, unfortunately for all of us, a percentage decrease.  That is the factual situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to picking up &ldquo;back grants&rdquo; for record purposes.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to an occurrence&mdash;and I can produce factual evidence&mdash;in a town here, during 1975, when the final instalment of a grant was paid on a house that had been defective, with no application by the individual, with merely a completely unexpected visit from the housing inspector.  The interesting point about it is that that house was built approximately 15 years; 15 years after that grant was paid and not applied for.</P>

We had no reference to the other points raised by Deputy Faulkner.  We had a glossing-over of a situation we all know exists.  I can claim to have a considerable knowledge of the building industry, at ground level more than anything else, for many years. From 1959 until I came into this House I was closely associated with that industry.  In fact we know that the building industry was the industry neglected by Fine Gael and Labour in their last days of Coalition&mdash;I am hurting the Minister; I am standing on his toe.  In the years in between it was built up under solid, sound Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>People on the other side of the House believed that some of these people, because they gave employment, because they built office blocks, because they built factories, because they built bridges and roadways for us, were speculators. They looked upon them as enemies of society.  Many of them were their supporters.  They came into office determined to wreck the building industry, determined to run it down. They have done so, to the detriment of the Irish worker.  But remember 20,000 jobs, 6,000 extra, plus the people going off in the allied industries all the time, in my constituency and in every other.  I say to the Government that we have steel works of which we as a nation can be proud. Minister, preserve the jobs there before it is too late by injecting enough into the building industry to create a demand for steel.  I do not want us to be approaching the Minister and his colleagues in the very near future saying: &ldquo;Look, here are more jobs gone because of your incompetence.&rdquo; This is the position.</P>
      <P>The building industry could also be regarded as the one which contributed most to reducing unemployment and to bringing home our people from abroad. We are talking about numbers of houses.  I have given the percentage increases and the decrease for this year. The Minister and the Government have forgotten the constant price factor which means that less money is being given now than was given last year. There is no increase in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a question today by Deputy Faulkner about the cost of a local authority house we heard that in 1972/73 the cost of that house was £3,963.  It has increased to £6,208, an increase of 66 per cent.  There is also the problem of a growing number of young people and a greater demand for houses.  This is something which the Minister and the Government are taking no cognisance of.  The building industry has been let down.  The Government <Col N="1765" /> have not appreciated what we said here tonight.  They will obviously oppose the motion.</P>
    <P>I hope if the Minister has not already approached his colleague, the Minister for Finance, that he will go to him and say: &ldquo;Give me money.  Give me £50 million, not £2.6 million&rdquo;.  The £2.6 million will not save the building industry.  It is not significant.  If the Minister for Finance offers £75 million, the Minister should not refuse it.  If we <Col N="1766" /> were there it is £100 million we would talk about.  The bubble has burst for the Minister.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1973: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 70a:</P>
    <P>Before section 26 to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The planning authority, by exercising their powers under section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, may decide to grant a permission or approval even if the proposed development contravenes materially the development plan or any special amenity area order relating to the area of the planning authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Molloy.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the amendment aim to achieve a situation where the opinion of the manager would not prevail in a case where the elected members felt an application did not contravene the development plan. As the situation stands, and even with the suggested amendment which the Minister has offered to introduce on Report Stage, on which we would like to get further elaboration, it will not meet exactly the situation I am highlighting here.  All the members may be of the one opinion that the application does not materially contravene the development plan they drew up but if the manager says that in his opinion it does he informs the meeting that he cannot act, following the passing of section 4, and must submit the matter to the Minister.</P>
      <P>My amendment is seeking to give the right to elected members&mdash;the planning authority&mdash;to make a decision, using section 4 of the 1955 Act, to grant that permission whether or not it contravenes.  I am not anxious to go too far on the grounds of giving them the right where it does contravene but the cases that have come to my notice have been ones where in the opinion of the elected members the application did not contravene the development plan at all.  But the manager said that, in his opinion, it did.  I believe this was a device being used by managers to circumvent the right of councillors to exercise their powers under section 4 of the Management Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very strongly on this point.  This is a question of interpretation.  The county council are the planning authority and they draw up a plan but apparently, the law is that those who have the right to interpret it are the county manager and the officials.  Nine times out of ten the interpretation is different from the interpretation which the members put on the plan.</P>
      <P>What I want, and Deputy Molloy is trying to get this, is that where there is a difference of opinion on the interpretation of whether or not an application contravenes the plan, as prepared by the council the final say should be with the council as it is the council's plan.  The council should have the right to say whether or not it is against the plan drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is what our county manager does at the moment.  If we put down a section 4 application, even if it passes he says it must go to the Minister. I do not know how the Minister comes into it at this stage.  If it goes on appeal to the Minister, that is all right but I cannot understand how the Minister could be in a position to know which of us is right.  The engineers, inspectors and officials of <Col N="1769" /> the locality are the people who should know.  I have opposed all plans in Galway for the simple reason that every day we are arguing over interpretation. Interpretation is of vital importance to the plan.  It is whatever way the officials interpret it that matters and not what the people who drew it up say.  The local authority are the people responsible if a person is refused planning permission.  I wholeheartedly support Deputy Molloy's motion that the final decision, if there is a difference of opinion, should be taken by the people who drew up the plan and put it on paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing about it is that, having listened to Deputy Molloy and Deputy Callanan, I know what they are trying to get at but, in fact, the amendment as proposed by Deputy Molloy would not do that.  It would leave the position little better than it is at the present time. Strangely enough, I would be prepared to go even further than Deputy Callanan is prepared to go with an amendment.  In fact, I agree that there should be more control by the elected representatives.  I believe there should be more control by public representatives.  I am aware that it is common understanding by people who are not familiar with planning matters that the planning authority are the elected representatives. One finds again and again letters to the newspapers and statements by so-called experts who try to show that the local elected representatives have a point of view.  There is a special arrangement being made to draw up a plan.  Having been on a local authority for 15 years, I agree that very many elected representatives do not know what the plan means and do not take an interest in it even if they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I am under the impression that, if the elected representatives wish to contravene even their own plans or wish to contravene what the manager claims is the interpretation of their own plans, they should be entitled to do so.  I believe that there should be the right to object to that the same as there is if it goes by way of appeal.  What I propose to do <Col N="1770" /> before Report Stage is to consider amendments which would do exactly that, (a) give the right to elected representatives, and (b) give the right to those who feel that they are entitled to object to it.</P>

      <P>What I said was that I am not opposed to the intent of the amendment.  I propose to consider before Report Stage whether it would be possible to substitute a new procedure for section 26 (3) which would enable elected representatives to authorise material contraventions subject to the consideration of any objections by members of the public or of prescribed bodies.  A number of sections of the 1963 Act will have to be looked at.  I believe that if the drafting difficulties can be overcome &mdash;and I believe they can&mdash;it might be possible to bring in an amendment on Report Stage.  This is the best way to deal with it and I am as anxious as they are to give the elected representatives this right.</P>

      <P>It is a question of interpretation as to whether the plan has been contravened or not.  The Minister says that he is going to give power to elected representatives to make their own plans.  I was not talking about that.  What I did say was that if you think that it does not do it and the officials do, at least the public representatives should have the final decision.  The Minister is proposing to have an appeal from that now.  What I do not like about <Col N="1771" /> it is that the Minister is going to allow an appeal to the board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To get this clearly on the record, what the Minister is proposing is a very cumbersome mechanism to achieve possibly something similar to what my amendment aims to achieve.  I fail to understand why the Minister now suggests that we should introduce into planning a further appeals system.  The Minister does not like the word &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; because it may be confused with appeals to the higher authority, to the board. What the Minister is suggesting is that in regard to a specific application which the manager indicates in advance he intends refusing, the members can decide to grant that permission even though it contravenes the development plan, but the public have a right to appeal against the stated intention of the elected members.  It sounds very confused and burdensome to me and adds more machinery to the planning system which I think would be better kept as simple as possible.  If the amendment as suggested by me is accepted, it will merely mean that if members sitting as the elected members of the council make a decision to direct such a permission to be granted, the manager shall see that that permission <Col N="1772" /> issues even if it contravenes the development plan.  That is what I am seeking in this amendment.</P>
      <P>If any member of the public is not happy with the elected council's direction and the decision and the permission that issues subsequently from the manager's office, he has a right to appeal to the board.  Why does the Minister want to introduce this appeal at local authority level? It seems unnecessary and something which, from the explanations we have had, would not at all satisfy me. What we have here is very simple.  It states quite clearly the extent of the powers of section 4 that members have in relation to planning.  My amendment would be simpler, clearer and more easily understood, and it does not interfere with the appeals system in the old Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble with Deputy Molloy&mdash;and I cannot blame him for it&mdash;is that he is thinking of a specific case and he is relating the case he is thinking of to what he wants to do here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If every case was exactly the same as the one he is thinking of, it might be a simple matter.  Could I point out to the Deputy that if his amendment is accepted it will make no difference whatever to section 26 (3) (a) of the 1963 Act which states:</P>
      <P>A planning authority shall not, in the case in which the developer concerned would contravene materially the development plan on any special amenity area order in relation to the area, decide to grant permission under this section save with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, it does not matter what he writes in in a positive way here unless that is appealed to start off with, it cannot be done.  I am trying to be helpful because I want to go pretty far, and I am much nearer to Deputy Callanan's point than to Deputy Molloy's.  A local authority elected representative draws up, with the assistance of the officials, a plan and <Col N="1773" /> they cannot contravene that plan. Deputy Callanan says there may be cases where it is not necessary to contravene it but the officials say that it is.  Then do we set up some kind of mechanism to decide who is right? That is undesirable.  The obvious way to do it is to give the right, even if the officials say the plan is being contravened, let the elected representatives have the right to decide.  So far we are all agreed.  In addition, I believe there would be certain people who feel protected by the plan but in the event of its being changed would feel they are entitled to object to that change.  I suggest that we give the elected representatives the right to change it but we also give the individuals the right to object to the local authority to such changes being made.  The elected representatives will be the people who make the decision.  There is nothing complicated about it.  If we are really interested in doing this then that is the way to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have made their decision by then.  The elected representatives claim that they want to do something different.  The manager says &ldquo;you cannot do that because it is a contravention of the plan&rdquo;.  Then there should be a mechanism whereby people could object to such a change being made and the local authority <Col N="1774" /> elected representatives would have the right to consider if the objections were valid and having heard that then make their own decision.</P>

      <P>The mechanics of what the Minister is proposing would mean that what the Minister is suggesting could not be effective until the manager signs an order and if there was not prior consultation with the officials and the elected representatives. When the manager signs the order that, in effect, is a final decision on the planning application except there is an appeal to the Minister or the board.  Therefore it means either a resubmission on behalf of the applicant before the Minister's suggestions can be put into effect with the elected representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the manager signed an order and the decision is made, the appeal would be to the new board.  I would like to see the local representatives a lot more interested in local planning.  If local representatives have a particular interest in a plan, before it is signed by the manager they should have the right to say: &ldquo;We want to do that.&rdquo;  At this stage the manager says &ldquo;This is a contravention of the plan.  It cannot be done&rdquo;.  At that stage the local representatives should then be able to say &ldquo;We want to change it&rdquo;.  There would have to be the right of people to object to the <Col N="1775" /> change and the matter would then be considered by the elected representatives. Whatever decision was made would be subject to appeal to the Minister or the planning board in the normal way.</P>
      <P>It may sound cumbersome but I have not heard of an easier way of doing it.  I could easily say to Deputy Molloy &ldquo;We will accept what you put down here&rdquo;, but it would not achieve what I know now he wants and it would not achieve what Deputy Callanan wants and would not achieve what I want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any real point in going through all the various stages that the Minister has in mind? The case made by Deputy Molloy was where all of the elected representatives wanted to make a change and where the manager was opposed to it or rather where the manager's interpretation was different from theirs. In those circumstances having an objection made to the local authority would be fruitless.  It would only amount to prolonging the agony.  If all the members of the local authority are in agreement in relation to change then obviously the change will come. The aggrieved person can appeal to the Minister at the moment and to the board after the Act is passed. Would the Minister not agree that it would be simpler to allow the appeal direct to the board?  The alternative would be a waste of time.  I could not see a local authority whose members were all in agreement that a change ought to be made making any change because of an objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I see great merit in what the Minister proposed to do.  I can also see some difficulties.  The Minister's idea is to give greater say to the elected representatives who are the planning authority.  They make the plan and its implementation is handed over to the officials.  It is a question of the interpretation of that plan.  In Cork we have a planning working committee of ten members out of the 46 that go into the grey areas with the manager and the officials involved.  All the applications <Col N="1776" /> are not just black and white.  There are the grey areas, the borderline cases.  It is to these cases that the Minister is referring, where the interpretation of the plan is at issue.</P>
      <P>For example, if an application is made and it is referred to the local authority there is the question of the statutory time of 60 days.  Although I am saying this, I agree wholeheartedly with what the Minister is suggesting. It is a good thing.  If I have a case with which I am not satisfied and about which I have already made representations to the planning officer and to the officials concerned and I am afraid that I will meet with a refusal, before I can get an opportunity of bringing this to the attention of the authority concerned, which is the Cork County Council, the period of 60 days will have expired.  The decision must be made.  I can see that as a great difficulty.</P>
      <P>There are anomalies in the Planning Act.  There are many frivolous objections made.  This increases the cost. There should be some way of eliminating frivolous objections.  We have had cases in Cork of people resident in Dublin who have holiday homes in West Cork objecting to a house being built across the road from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it from what the Minister proposes with reference to what Deputy MacSharry said, that from now on the manager will not have the right to make the order?  If he intends to refuse he must bring that before the planning authority?  This is the important point.  At present the manager examines the application and he may refuse.  I would like to see in the Bill a provision that before the manager refuses an application he must lay that application before the elected representatives and that they would make the final decision.  I do not care about the appeal afterwards so long as it has been put before the elected representatives first.  My point is that the manager should not have power to refuse an application until he has first laid the application before the elected representative.  After all, the local representatives are the planning authority.  My question is whether that <Col N="1777" /> is what the Minister has in mind.  If that means changing the present system in which the manager either refuses or grants an application, that would satisfy me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that different local authorities have different ways of dealing with planning, even with notification of applications or decisions.  For instance, one local authority I know sends out a weekly bulletin or circular giving the list of applications for planning while others do not.  They are presented at a monthly meeting after the decision has been given.  A number of them do this. Most public representatives particularly those in this House are good at sending out circulars when the occasion arises.  It is not quite correct to say that the county manager will have to notify everybody concerned that he is going to make a decision because under the section 4 system he does not have to do this.  Councillors know about these things: otherwise how would they operate section 4?  As regards the two months being up, the usual thing is that somebody sends a letter from the local authority and that extends the period again, something which is not a very desirable practice but it is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>All that comes from the officials who are going to refuse or grant something.  If you are then seeking to give the elected representatives this authority, why not give it to the officials who are dealing with the whole show?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that as a result of this Bill the balance would be changed considerably.  It is enshrined in the planning laws that people have a right to object if the plan is being changed.  At present they have the right to object to me if I am being asked to change the plan or to grant something in contravention of the plan.  In view of the discussion here tonight I would consider the question of simply making it a matter if the local authority elected representatives introducing a section 4 and being able to carry it.  In other words, giving them the right to contravene their own plan. Deputy Molloy's amendment does not <Col N="1778" /> do that.  It does suggest it but without certain other things it will not be possible.  While I know what is required and the matter will have to be discussed here on Report Stage, at the same time I want to ensure that it is something that will do what we all want.  I suggest that it is left with me until Report Stage and I will see what I can do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that reason is prevailing.  I think the Minister is coming around to our point of view.  I do not agree with the Minister when he says that the amendment, as worded, is inoperable.  If it is it does not require very much change to make it operable.  I would suggest that section 26 (3) (a) of the 1963 Act to which the Minister referred could be written into or added to this amendment so that that section would not apply in cases where this amendment was operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That sort of thing would have to be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all that is required; otherwise you are accepting the amendment as suggested.  The Minister is leaving it under the section 4?  We understand now from what the Minister said that this is right, that he is dropping that other second level of appeal that he was talking about earlier on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of other sections which have to be looked at.  In the main what the Deputy wants to do is similar to what I want to do.  If he leaves it with me I will attempt to get something which will meet the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough. The Minister prefaced his original suggestion with that remark also.  Bureaucracy has its own way of interpreting what we are getting at.  If it is a cumbersome thing I think we will find it very hard to agree with it.  We do not want to have to come back and debate it on Report Stage.  I suggest the Minister might leave it under section 4 which I think most local authorities do not wish to use too often and would only use it in exceptional cases. It involves a lot of bother for the representatives <Col N="1779" /> anyway to get the necessary signatures, to be notified in time to have the meeting held before the statutory period expires.  It puts considerable onus on the representative before he can in fact operate under section 4.  That little bit of difficulty is a good thing.  It means that section 4 will not be used every week or in every planning application.</P>
      <P>In view of the remarks that were made by Deputy MacSharry it might be no harm to suggest at this stage that a section be put into this Bill putting an onus on local authorities to circulate to the elected members a list of all planning applications.  The Miniser mentioned that in one county they issued them weekly.  In my own county they issue them monthly.  Each member gets a list of the planning applications for the month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>And we have an arrangement with the officials that any member may write to the secretary or the manager of the local authority, having got this list, and ask him to indicate to that member in advance his proposed decision.  If I see a planning application is made and it is No. 1, 2 or 3, I can write to the manager or the secretary and say: &ldquo;Please let me know in advance the proposed decision on planning application No.1, 2 or 3.&rdquo;  He must let me have that information before the statutory period expires so that I may exercise my right under section 4 if I so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been occasions when the manager, because of circumstances, was not able to fulfil that requirement in every case but the members were amenable to that and did not kick up too much of a fuss. In the main that principle did obtain, you were told possibly seven or ten days before the decision issued that the application was going to be refused. It gave you enough time to get in with section 4 with the signatures and have a meeting held.  Provided your motion was in in time that was all right.  This difficulty of the two-months' <Col N="1780" /> period would operate against the original suggestion that the Minister made here which I do not feel would work.  It would be very cumbersome. If he leaves it under section 4 and agrees in principle with what is in our amendment and makes whatever other necessary changes are required, I think it will meet the situation. I think the Minister is accepting that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The trouble about this sort of thing is that as it goes along one gets other ideas.  Everyone who speaks has an input which may change the whole thinking on it.  For instance, a very simple way would be to put the onus on the manager in the event of him deciding or wishing to decide that it was a contravention of the plan that he could not do so without the permission of the elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with all that.  I think you have gone too far now.  My amendment was intended to overcome this difficulty that county managers were giving it as their opinion that a planning application contravened the development plan and irrespective of the motion under section 4 being passed they would not issue a permission in that case.  They were passing it off to the Minister and using it as a device.  I want to circumvent that.  The Minister is going further and saying that any time the manager is making any decision which contravenes the development plan he should inform the members in advance.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the ideal position would be to look for justice for people who felt they were aggrieved. Public representatives, I am sure, are concerned about justice.  The simple way would be, as I said, that in the event of the manager using this as a contravention of the county plan or whatever, he should get the permission of the elected representatives.  If he does that he is completely tied and he cannot go any faster.  This is what Deputy Molloy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is the allegation that the manager can make up the excuse that a certain thing is a contravention of the plan because he cannot think of another excuse.  If he does not plead that, it is plain sailing.  But, if he does plead it, the elected representatives are the only people who will say whether it is or not, as they see it, a contravention of the plan.  If that is written into the Act it copperfastens the whole thing and it is very simple.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The second suggestion would not meet the point at all.  The <Col N="1782" /> Minister is suggesting that where a planning application is to be refused because it contravenes the development plan the manager should inform the members in advance.  That is not worth a damn to the members of the county council because they will say: &ldquo;OK, we will exercise section 4.&rdquo;  He will say: &ldquo;Are you passing this motion?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes, it is passed.&rdquo;  He will say, &ldquo;I am sorry, I am not going to issue planning permission because it contravenes the plan&rdquo;, as stated by the Minister.  That is what I want to stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Deputy does not understand what I am saying. What I am saying is that he cannot do that in future.  If he notifies the council that he proposes to refuse because of this, the council are entitled to say whether he can or not. That is the end of it.  If they say it does not contravene the plan he must give the permission.  I do not see where the difficulty is at all.  It does exactly what is wanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot talk like this on Report Stage.  There is something vital missing.  The Minister is saying that, where a planning application is to be refused by the manager on the grounds that it contravenes the development plan, he will inform the members before he makes the decision that he intends to refuse and that his reasons are that it contravenes the development plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I just cannot follow Deputy Molloy's argument at all. What in effect I am saying is this. Somebody applies for planning permission and the county manager says &ldquo;This is a contravention of the county plan&rdquo;.  He must then get the permission of the elected representatives before he can disallow the application for planning permission on that ground.  Where is the loophole or the difficulty in this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only a two-month statutory period.  The engineers in the sanitary section, road section and every other section in the council have to look at this application before the manager knows it is in the office at all.  It is only when the various opinions and information are put together that an opinion is eventually given as to whether the thing is within or without the plan or not.  It is handed up to the manager with a recommendation from the county engineer that it be refused or granted because it is contravening the plan. It is at the latter end of the two-month period that it comes to the manager.  He will have little time between that stage and the end of the statutory period to exercise this right of involving all the members in the decision.  Will he call a special meeting of the county council to make this decision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He must get their permission before he can refuse.  This is obligatory under the Bill.  The statutory 60 days already existing may be altered to accommodate that.  Arrangements with regard to time will have to be made to see in what way it can be extended.

I am anxious to have it done as quickly as possible.  As Deputy MacSharry said, there might be a note from the manager to the applicant <Col N="1785" /> telling him that whatever he wanted might not be granted.

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 71:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;26.  &mdash;(1)  Notwithstanding section 10 (4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, summary proceedings against any person liable to be proceeded against pursuant to section 22, 28 or 29 of this Act or in respect of a contravention of section 24 (2) of the Principal Act may be commenced&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  at any time within six months from the date on which the offence was committed, or</P>
      <P>(b)  at any time within three months from the date on which evidence sufficient, in the opinion of the person instituting the proceedings, to justify proceedings comes to his knowledge, </P>
      <P>whichever is the later.</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purposes of this section, a certificate signed by or on behalf of the person instituting the proceedings as to the date on which evidence described in subsection (1) of this section came to the knowledge of such person shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence thereof and in any legal proceedings a document purporting to be a certificate issued for the purposes of this section and to be so signed shall be admitted be so signed and shall be admitted as evidence without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate unless the contrary is shown.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> This amendment proposes, in effect, to substitute a new section for section 26 of the Bill as introduced.  If the amendment is accepted, the existing section 26 will be deleted.</P>
    <P>Section 26, as it stands, was inserted in the Bill at the request of a number of planning authorities.  Section 10 (4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, requires that a prosecution be taken within a period of six months from the date on which an offence is committed.  It appears that there have been cases which would warrant the institution of proceedings but which did not come to notice or where there was not adequate evidence in time to prosecute an offence.</P>
    <P>The new draft of section 26, proposed by amendment No. 71, differs from the existing draft in two ways&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  it relates to offences under the new sections 28 and 29 (register of interests and declaration of interest at meetings); and (ii) the certificate provided for in subsection (2) is made <i>prima facie</i> evidence rather than conclusive evidence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) provides in relation to section 24 (2) of the 1963 Act and sections 22, 28 and 29 to be inserted by amendments Nos. 75 and 76 of the Bill, that proceedings may be taken (a) at any time within six months of the offence, or (b) at any time within three months of the date on which sufficient evidence comes to the knowledge of the prosecutor, whichever is the later.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) is necessary in order that the section will be workable in practice.  It provides that a certificate signed by or on behalf of the prosecutor as to the date on which evidence sufficient to justify a prosecution came to his knowledge shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence thereof and, further, that a document purporting to be such certificate shall, until the countrary is shown, be accepted without proof of the signature.</P>
    <P>It is obviously necessary that section 26 should cover the offences under the new sections 28 and 29.  Planning and development is a long-term business and it is not difficult to envisage a situation in which a councillor's <Col N="1787" /> interest in land, which he failed to disclose at the relevant time, would not come to notice until, perhaps, years after a council decision affecting the land had been made.</P>
    <P>The use of <i>prima facie</i> in subsection (2)  is in line with the decision in the Supreme Court in the case of John P. Maher v. the Attorney General and Francis T. Murphy, in which judgment was given on 16th July, 1973 by FitzGerald C. J. The court held the Constitution reserves to the courts the determination of all the essential ingredients of any offence charged against an accused person and it was held accordingly that in so far as a statutory provision purported to remove such determination from the court&mdash; by using the term &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo;&mdash;it was an invalid infringement of the judicial power and was unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, does not in any way restrict the powers of planning authorities to serve enforcement notices&mdash;section 31 of the 1963 Act&mdash;within the five-year period allowed.</P>

      <P>Therefore the Chair is allowing me to take amendment No. 22 in conjunction with the Minister's amendment.  That is very logical because the Minister proposes to insert a new section 26 which comprises a subsection (2) which I want to delete.</P>
      <P>The attention of the House should be drawn to the fact that there is a very considerable change being made by the Minister in this new section 26. The original section 26 was a fairly straightforward one to which, with the exception of subsection (2) I would not have taken any exception.  The new section 26 makes a very important change.  The original subsection (1) paragraph (b) provided that:</P>
      <P>at any time within three months from the date on which evidence sufficient, in the opinion of the planning authority within whose area the contravention took place, to justify a prosecution by the authority for the contravention comes to the knowledge of that authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1792" /> Section 26 subsection (1) in so far as the second leg of subsection (1) is concerned, in paragraph (b), relates to evidence coming to the notice of the planning authority and the planning authority coming to a decision, on the basis of that evidence, that a prosecution or the institution of proceedings is justified.</P>
    <P>The new section 26 which the Minister now puts forward changes that very considerably.  It seems to me to broaden it very widely.  In subsection (1) paragraph (b) of the new section 26 we find the following words:</P>
    <P>at any time within three months from the date on which evidence sufficient, in the opinion of the person instituting the proceedings, to justify proceedings comes to his knowledge.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is no longer confined to the planning authority.  It is, apparently, any person.  I would like the Minister to elaborate for us what is the reason for that significant change, and what category of people can now be included in the category of persons indicated in the new paragraph (b).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite simply, as the Deputy is aware, two new sections are being brought in with regard to interests of people.  The planning authority solely were involved originally. Now, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Gardaí can be involved. It would be ridiculous to bring in the two sections dealing with interests and then say that the planning authority were the only people who could take action, which would possibly nullify the whole idea.  Therefore it was necessary to alter the phraseology simply to make it work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can readily appreciate that the change is brought about because of the additions made by amendments Nos. 75 and 76.  But I am not altogether happy about this proposed change.  As paragraph (b) of subsection (1) reads at present, it seems to me that anybody, whether a member of the planning authority, whether the Director of Public Prosecutions, whether a member of the Garda, or a member of the general public is now <Col N="1793" /> admitted as being capable of taking proceedings.  It says: in the opinion of the person instituting proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that later.  I want at this stage to clear up the point.  Are the terms of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act of 1851 such that the taking of proceedings in this case will be confined to an official of the Director of Public Prosecutions office or the Garda Síochána or the planning authority, or will it extend to a member of the general public?  This is a very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>To me it would appear to include the general public.  However, if Deputy Haughey feels it is too loose I do not mind having a look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be happy if the Minister ensures me he will have a look at it.  I just want to mention, before leaving it, that we are now bringing in very important, far-reaching and fundamental provisions such as the disclosure of interests by members of a local authority.  It would be a very serious matter if we were to throw it open to members of the general public to institute proceedings under these new sections.  If the Minister is prepared to look into the matter I accept that.</P>

I am very glad to note that my distinguished colleague, who is a member of the Bar, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, has come into the House.

      <P>I doubt the necessity for subsection (2) at all.  I doubted its necessity in the original section 26 and I maintain that doubt as to its necessity in the revised section 26. It seems to me to go very far.  Perhaps the best thing I could do would be to read the wording of subsection (2) so that we know exactly what we are talking about.  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section, a certificate signed by or on behalf of the person instituting the proceedings as to the date on which evidence described in subsection (1) of this section came to the knowledge of such person shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence thereof and in any legal proceedings a document purporting to be a certificate issued for the purposes of this section and to be so signed shall be deemed to be so signed and shall be admitted as evidence without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate unless the contrary is shown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to elaborate on the thinking which makes that necessary because here we are dealing with summary proceedings and he has explained the reason why he is using <i>prima facie</i> evidence and, in accordance with the Supreme Court decision, to which he adverted, he is allowing this certificate as the basis on which proceedings are instituted.  He is allowing this certificate to be put in as <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  Perhaps we need not quarrel with that but I wonder if it is not going much too far to say, as the subsection says: that in any legal <Col N="1795" /> proceedings a document purporting to be a certificate issued for the purposes of this section and to be so signed shall be deemed to be so signed and shall be admitted as evidence without proof of signature.  We are dealing with something very important here.  This is a case in the normal course of events and in the sort of situation envisaged by the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851 proceedings would have to be taken within six months.  That is a reasonable proposal because people in this sort of situation are entitled, if proceedings are to be taken against them, to have the action against them initiated with reasonable speed.</P>
    <P>In the situation envisaged under paragraph (e) we are dealing with something that could arise years after the event, as the Minister said in his opening remarks when proposing section 26 to us.  These proceedings could be taken many years after the alleged offence had taken place.  These proceedings would only be instituted on the basis of somebody coming to the conclusion, perhaps years after the offence is alleged to have taken place that there is now sufficient evidence to justify proceedings.  Everything will hinge on this certificate of the person involved, whether he is an officer in the local authority, the Garda Síochána, a director of public prosecutions or, although we hope this will be omitted, a member of the general public, proceedings will be taken on the basis of this person's opinion that there now is sufficient evidence that an offence took place.  Surely in that sort of situation, where it could take place many years after the event proceedings can only happen if the person is of opinion that there now is sufficient evidence to justify proceedings on the basis of a certificate submitted by that person.  At least the certificate should be signed by the person who has taken the responsibility for instituting proceedings and that signature should be proved in court.  That is my objection to the subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey has a very good point and I tend to agree with him.  First of all, in regard to the proof, I think he will agree that it is <Col N="1796" /> normal, unless it is proved otherwise, that the signature is accepted.  There is nothing wrong with that part of it but I believe he has a point when he talks about it being over a period of years. I think there should be a limit.  I propose to put a limit.</P>

      <P>The Minister promised to look at the other aspect.  Would he not also have a look at whether or not, in view of the importance of this certificate, in view of the fact that this certificate will be the basis of the whole proceedings&mdash;I am prepared to go along with the Minister in regard to the <i>prima facie</i> provisions because he has the moral authority of the Supreme Court behind him in that&mdash;and in regard to the signature on the certificate would it not be desirable that the certificate should be put in the normal way and the prosecution have to prove the signature by producing the person involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Since there are only three&mdash;I will have a look at that particular end of it.  I agree with the Deputy. This appears to be reasonable, whether it should be confined to those three sections.  It would be unreasonable to leave it open ended.  There should be a limit but I do not think it is reasonable that somebody would be at the other end of the country and that he should be brought along for the purpose of proving the signature. The signature is not being challenged.</P>

    <P>I suspect the Minister will accept this amendment which is only a drafting amendment.  I cannot understand why in the Bill before us the words &ldquo;Local Government Planning and Development Acts, 1963 and 1974&rdquo; are inserted because the definition section clearly defines Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1963, as the Principal Act.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is only a drafting amendment.  I think the amendment makes no material difference.  I do not agree with Deputy Haughey that it is important.  If it is accepted it would require alteration in the terms of amendment No. 47 to section 21 for the sake of consistency.  The text, as it stands, has the merit.  It is a citation of the short title as provided in section 36 (1).  If Deputy Haughey looks at it he will see that it is not an important thing.  It is merely drafting and the section as it stands does exactly what we want it to do.  I am not inclined to accept the amendment.</P>

Having done that why then does he use the words &ldquo;Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963&rdquo; in subsection (2), lines 45 and 46?</P>

      <P>In view of those sections could I ask the Minister what is the purpose of section 27 (2).  Why should that be there when it is already, in my opinion, covered in the earlier sections?  What is the point putting in an extra section saying the Minister may consult with the board in relation to the performance of its functions under the Local Government Acts?

      <P>Subsection (1), section 27, enables the board to make submissions to the Minister in relation to any matters pertaining to its functions, as for example, to elucidate or clarify policy in the event of there being inconsistency between development plans for adjoining areas or between local and regional plans.  Section 5 enables the Minister to give general directives to the board as to policy in relation to development.  Section 2 enables the Minister to consult the board in relation to any of its planning functions. He could, for example, ask them to advise him in relation to an application to him under section 26 (3) of the 1963 Act for his consent to the granting by a planning authority of permission for development which would materially contravene a development plan. He would also hope to draw on the expertise and experience built up by the board where their advice might be valuable, such as in relation to problems <Col N="1800" /> of co-ordination of development plans.</P>

The register of members' interests shall be kept at the offices of the planning authority and shall be available for public inspection during office hours.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where a person ceases to be a member of a planning authority, any particulars entered in the register of members' interests as a result of a declaration being given by the person to the authority pursuant to this section shall be removed, as soon as may be after the expiration of the period of five years beginning on the day on which the person ceases to be such member, from the said register by the authority.</P>
    <P>(7)  Subject to subsection (8) of this section, a person who fails to comply with subsection (1) of this section or who, when purporting to comply with the requirements of the said subsection (1), gives particulars which are to his knowledge false or misleading in a material respect, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds, or at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> (8)  In any proceedings for an offence under this section it shall be a defence for the defendant to prove that at the relevant time he believed, in good faith and upon reasonable grounds, either that there was no matter as regards which he was then required to make a declaration under subsection (1) of this section or that the matter in relation to which the offence is alleged was not one as regards which he was so required to make such declaration.</P>
    <P>(9)  In this and in the next following section &ldquo;company&rdquo; means a company within the meaning of section 2 of the Companies Act, 1963, or a company incorporated outside the State.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to insert in the Bill a new section under which members of planning authorities will be obliged to make declarations of certain interests and to keep these declarations up to date for as long as they are members.  The new section is not designed to provide for a general register of interests.  This would not be appropriate in planning legislation and is being considered separately.  Instead, the section provides for a register of those interests which would be relevant to the functions exercised by councillors under the Planning Act or otherwise in relation to land deals.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (1), it will be the duty of each member of a planning authority, that is, a county council, county borough or borough corporation or urban district council but not town commissioners, to give to the authority a written declaration, in a form to be prescribed, of certain interests which could affect the performance of his duties as such member. A member will be required to keep his declaration up to date by submitting a fresh declaration when circumstances change, that is, when he acquires a new interest or when there is a change regarding an interest already registered.  The form of the declaration will be prescribed by regulations under section 10 of the 1963 Act.  The form will be a simple one, <Col N="1804" /> basically a list of headings under which the member can fill in any registrable interests which he has.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) lists the interests to which the section applies.  They are, first, interests in land in the area of the authority, secondly, any business of dealing in or developing land in which a member is engaged or employed and any such business carried on by a company or other body of which he, or his nominee, is a member, and, thirdly, any profession, business or occupation in which a member is engaged and which relates to dealing in or developing land.</P>
    <P>The interests have been defined in such a way as to cover a considerable number of situations.  For example, while a member would not ordinarily be required to make a declaration regarding employment as, say, an accountant, he would be required to declare this if he is employed as an accountant by a builder or developer, that is, subsection (2) (b).  Again, a member who is employed, or is in private practice, as an architect or auctioneer would be required to declare this under subsection (2) (c).  The member who owns land or has an option or any other enforceable interest in land is covered by subsection (2) (a).</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that in the case of existing members, a first declaration must be made within 28 days of the coming into operation of the new section; new members&mdash;either coopted to existing councils or elected to new councils&mdash;will have a similar period beginning on the day they come into office to lodge any necessary declarations.  The same period will be allowed for the submission of a fresh declaration where there is a change of circumstances.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) makes it clear that a member of a planning authority will be regarded as having an interest in land if he, or a nominee of his, is a member of a company or other body which has an interest in the land. Some provision of this kind is essential if members are to be prevented from evading the requirement to register their interests in land by transferring their holdings to companies managed, <Col N="1805" /> perhaps, by nominees of theirs.  It may be, however, that the subsection, as drafted, goes too far since a councillor could be a member, that is, a shareholder of a very large company with numerous land holdings throughout the country.  For this reason, consideration might be given to limiting its application to cases where the member has a substantial shareholding in a company and should, therefore, be expected to be familiar with its property holdings.  In relation to the existing draft, it could, of course, be pointed out that subsection (8) provides a good defence where the member shows that he believed in good faith that the matter in relation to which an offence, for example, a land holding, is alleged was not one which he was required to declare.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides for the keeping by each planning authority of a register of members' interests. This register will contain the particulars given in declaration under subsection (1).  It will be available for public inspection at the offices of the planning authority during office hours.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) provides for the removal from the register of entries relating to a member five years after he ceases to be a member.  It is considered necessary to retain entries for this period because planning and development is a long-term business and questions could be raised about planning decisions years after they are made.  The retention of entries will be a safeguard for the public and, indeed, for a councillor, too, since it will enable him to allay suspicion by pointing to the fact that he had made a proper declaration at the relevant time.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) makes it an offence to fail to make the required declaration or to give particulars in a declaration which are, to members' knowledge, false or misleading.  The penalty, or summary conviction, will be a fine of up to £100, or imprisonment for up to six months, or both.</P>
    <P>The purpose of subsection (8) is to provide a good defence for a person who can show that he believed in good faith and upon reasonable grounds <Col N="1806" /> either, one, that there was no matter as regards which he was required to make a declaration or, two, that the matter in question was not one as regards which he was required to make a declaration.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) defines &ldquo;company&rdquo; for the purposes of the new section 28 and the new section 29 as a company within the meaning of section 2 of the Companies Act, 1963, or a company incorporated outside the State.  Section 2 of the Companies Act, 1963, defines &ldquo;company&rdquo; as &ldquo;a company formed and registered under this Act, or an existing company&rdquo;. &ldquo;Existing company&rdquo; means a company formed and registered in the State under the earlier Companies Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: Amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 75:</P>
      <P>To add the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10)  For the purposes of this section &lsquo;member of a planning authority&rsquo; shall include a City or County Manager or an employee of a planning authority&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we were discussing these matters, at an earlier date, 14th January, we explained our position in relation to that declaration of interest. This principle, if it was to be introduced, should be done in a general Bill and should cover every aspect of activity in this country.  It should be made to apply to all persons in public office, if that was the Government's intention and should cover the various Departments.  We objected to the amendments as drafted by the Minister because they are aimed solely at one section of the community, a section who have given their service free to the community as members of local authorities.  The section as worded by the Minister is derogatory and disrespectful to them and casts a suspicion on any person who is a member of a local authority dealing with planning matters.  We object to the Minister's attempt to single out, for this special <Col N="1807" /> restriction, only those members of our community who serve as elected members on our local authorities.  These people have had a great slight cast upon their character, their integrity and their honesty, by the Minister in the terms of his amendment.</P>
    <P>We asked on that occasion, and we again appeal now to the Minister, and through him to the Government, that, if they want to deal with this matter, persons in public office and in positions of public importance, and if they feel that some persons may be in a position to make decisions which may be of benefit to themselves or to others and if it is deemed necessary that such persons should make a declaration of interest in some public form, then the whole principle of that should be incorporated in a separate piece of legislation and this House would then discuss this whole idea in a comprehensive way.  We object very strongly to the reflection in the Bill on local authority members.  We object to the fact that only they are being singled out.  We object to the off-hand way in which this is being done.</P>
    <P>This Bill was published and circulated by the Minister many months ago and there was no reference to it. A general discussion took place in this House on Committee Stage and the public read that debate.  There was much public interest in the terms of the Bill as it was originally published.  Now, at a later stage, the Minister inserts in the Bill three major new sections dealing with a completely new principle for dubious reasons and for reasons which the Minister has not yet validated.  Again, we appeal to the Minister to withdraw these three sections and I shall withdraw my amendment if he does so and have the matter brought before the House for a full general debate in a comprehensive Bill, if that is the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister, speaking here last January, to state his intention of introducing such a Bill.  He said in column 106, Volume 277, of the Official Report of 16th January, 1975, that this other Bill I have been <Col N="1808" /> speaking about would be introduced later.  I told Deputy Haughey that I was as anxious as he to have this Bill passed quickly and we agreed on the end of June if possible.  I have not seen the Bill since.</P>
    <P>I quote:</P>
    <P>Mr. Tully: There is not much point in introducing a Bill of that kind even if it were ready now when this Bill is making such slow progress. I should like to see it introduced before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>The summer recess, as the Minister knows, is coming up sometime in the next month or two.  I do not know how long we are going to be here but it is running to the end of the term and we have not heard one word from the Minister in the House about the other Bill since.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it on the record of the House that I have spent many hours pouring over this Bill before the Committee Stage was taken, preparing amendments after that which are on the Order Paper and in following this debate and in trying to ensure, with the other Deputies, that this important legislation is adequately debated.  If the Minister had his way it would be put through the House, he says now, in five minutes, even though we were denied the opportunity <Col N="1810" /> to debate it for many months.  During the course of the discussions that have taken place we have made contributions which the Minister has accepted as being valid and he has promised that he will bring in amendments on Report Stage to implement the points we mentioned. As late as tonight the Minister has agreed to introduce a major change in planning legislation, one of the most significant changes that is proposed in this second Planning Bill. That would not have been brought about were it not for the contributions from this side of the House.  That is our position.  The amendment is only there as a safety provision for us if the Minister, as he indicated on the last occasion, is not prepared to accept the appeal we are making to him to withdraw these sections altogether and come back to the House with his general Bill.</P>
      <P>This thing is now before the House. Not one other member of the National Coalition group is in the House other than the Minister.  These three sections are of very great importance, introducing a new principle of major importance into planning, introducing a principle which will affect each and every elected representative on a planning authority.  Yet there is no person here from the Minister's side to discuss or to hear what is going on or to indicate a view on this important matter.  We would appeal to the Minister to let us know whether he will withdraw it, and if he indicates that he will not then we must seek the acceptance of an amendment to amendment 75.  That seeks to extend this matter to all persons who are involved in any way in the planning process, be it the application section or the appeals section, be it the Minister or the board when it changes to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to state our basic position, and if that is not accepted then we must seek acceptance of our amendment. We are proposing the amendment to the Minister's amendment on the basis that elected members are only one group of persons who are involved in the planning process, and they are involved in a very minor way <Col N="1811" /> under the existing Act inasmuch as their primary responsibility is the adoption of the development plan.  As I indicated earlier, up to now the powers under section 4 in making directions in relation to decisions on applications have been very weak and have been circumvented up to now by county managers.  The only other involvement is where they have the power to change zoning.  As the Minister well knows, the number of changes that have been made by members of local authorities in the zoning of developing plans has been very minor.  The number of local authorities who have made any basic change on a development plan that went before the public over the past four to five years is very slight.  I would ask the Minister when replying if he would indicate if any local authority has, in fact, carried out a full statutory review of their development plan; if any local authority has made a major change in the original development plan that was adopted requiring three months' viewing by the public as provided by the statute.  I would like if the Minister could let us know how many, if any, have gone through that process.  If none have, or if very few have, then it lessens the involvements to date of elected members of planning authorities in the planning process.  Their primary function was in the adoption and in deciding the wording and the scope of the original development plan.  After that their involvement is very slight.</P>
    <P>On that basis we say that it is wrong to single them out.  The principal people with the main and the most powerful decision are the engineers in local authorities, the managers in local authorities, the other members of the staff who contribute to the final decisions made by the officials of local authorities.  That covers persons operating in every single department in a local authority, the road section, the water and sewerage section and the health section.  The medical officers also play an important part in it, and others working for the local authority.  Also the Minister himself and the staff in <Col N="1812" /> the Minister's office play a very important part, the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary or any other person who is empowered to exercise the Minister's powers under this Act. There are a lot of other people who are in a real decision-making position who are not being covered at all.  Why cast this cloak of suspicion over elected members whose involvement is so slight, when we know from our own practical experience that the real abuses of the Planning Act have been carried out in the Minister's own office since he assumed office.  I will admit that most of the extraordinary decisions have emanated from the office of his side-kick, the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>I would like to protest against this wild charge being made by Deputy Molloy.  He wants to villify somebody.

A number of planning applications had been made to the local authority, certainly more than one in my memory, at least one of which&mdash;if I remember correctly&mdash; had in fact, been appealed.  These had all been refused.  On the change of Government, and within a short time afterwards an application was made again; it was refused by the local planning authority in Galway and was sent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am pointing out that these three sections are pointing an accusing finger at the elected members of local authorities but the finger is pointing in the wrong direction.  If there is any finger to point it must be pointed in the general direction in which I am looking at this present time, even though as I said, in fairness to the Minister, he might be bad enough, but he is not the worst culprit&mdash;the other person who, unfortunately, has been given responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and putting us in an invidious position of accusing <Col N="1818" /> somebody else when he was the person with whom the buck stopped.  I want to indicate to the House that there is a serious bias in the terms of these three amendments, that they are pointing the finger of suspicion at elected members of local authorities who, in their complete innocence, and in fairness to them, have very little say in the deciding of planning appeals.  It is in the decision-making process that the power lies.  That is where the responsibility should lie and that is where we look for integrity. When he comes back with a general Bill dealing with this whole area, we must insist that this type of principle be applied to all personnel involved in the planning process.  For the purposes of this section, we therefore ask that &ldquo;a member of a planning authority&rdquo; should include the city and county manager or an employee of a planning authority.  We will have a further amendment later on but that is the purpose of our amendment and we would ask the Minister for clarification if he intends pursuing seeking the approval of the House for these sections.</P>

In fact I would be ashamed of them.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I introduced this amendment at the time it was introduced is because in the national newspapers and magazines allegations were made against elected representatives. I defended the elected representatives in this House but no action was taken by anybody against the newspapers involved.  Allegations were made week after week about land deals.  I, in this House and outside, defended the elected representatives and said I was not prepared to accept that, but they were published and republished.  There is only one way to stop that kind of thing and that is by putting it into the Bill so that everybody will know that there is no involvement.</P>
      <P>On 14th January, 1975, when we were discussing this Bill, the question came up about whether more than elected representatives should be included in this question of declaring interest.  He made a statement, and I told him at the time that he would be hoisted on his own petard and so he is, because he cannot get away from it.  He said:</P>
      <P>Could we have the Minister's assurance... that similar types of obligations or responsibilities in regard to declaring their interest will fall on these other areas in the Minister's Report Stage amendments; that we will not be passing something in Committee which will apply to members of local authorities and then, on Report Stage, apply a somewhat less restrictive form of declaration of interest?</P>
      <P>I asked would Deputy Molloy accept the same principle and Deputy Molloy said: &ldquo;So long as we have the Minister's assurance that he will try to introduce something that will cover them all equally.&rdquo;  In fact, he accepted that and he is now attempting to reintroduce something to prevent anybody being included.  If the elected representatives are left out I do not know what the justification for including anybody else will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> He spoke about the Bill that is to be introduced.  I am hoping to see it introduced very soon.  It is not my fault it has not come before the House.  Deputy Molloy is well aware that while the Planning Bill was being discussed, with a few honourable exceptions on the Fianna Fáil benches, we got nothing but obstruction.  When the other Bills before the House at present came here, day after day people came in and repeated the same clichés in an effort to try to hold up the business of the House.  That is why we have had not more time to deal with this matter or indeed to deal with the matter of the general declaration of interest.  I want to see it introduced but not in the way in which it is introduced here because Deputy Molloy attempts to bring out, as was suggested that time, that I should take this out altogether and introduce a Bill covering everybody. We will introduce a Bill covering everybody but this Planning Bill will have something which will ensure that everybody connected with planning will not be accused, either by newspapers or by anybody else, in the wrong of being involved in any kind of deals.</P>
    <P>God knows I have more respect for elected representatives than Deputy Molloy has and I have proved it.  He intended to do away with 42 local councils and I have ensured that they will stay where they are.  As far as I am concerned I give nothing but the highest praise to the elected representatives who are, in the main, working for the public for nothing.  I am not going to let Deputy Molloy slide off the particular hook he is on by introducing an amendment here which he wants to pretend he is trying to push through.  He then suggests that we forget all about it and introduce another Bill which will cover everybody, that this is not the appropriate measure.  This is the appropriate measure for planning as far as I am concerned.  When this goes through the House there will be a Planning Bill which can, in fact, be carried out properly.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, with regard to the question of planning itself, <Col N="1821" /> I have been for my time in the Department of Local Government responsible for quite a number of decisions and so has my Parliamentary Secretary.  By law I am the responsible person for decisions taken and I take that decision whether or not I looked at the file.  Whether he signed the order or not, it is on my table the responsibility lies and I carry that respossibility. I do it for my officials as well.  If somebody disagrees with a planning decision I take it they have the right, by law, to take the matter to the High Court.  As I said, there was a High Court case today in which I was involved and was vindicated.  As far as I am concerned that is the way to deal with it.  To say that somebody can come into this House and make completely outrageous charges against an elected Member of the House, whether a Minister or anybody else, I never heard anything like it in my life and I hope I do not hear it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support strongly the case made by Deputy Molloy, that rather than introduce these new sections they would be introduced in the general Bill.  I am not saying this for the first time.  I made the same case when I was piloting a Bill through the House while I was Minister for Education when the Opposition at the time wanted to make certain changes which I considered were piecemeal type of changes.  For that reason I thought it much better to bring in a comprehensive Bill.</P>
      <P>If the Minister should decide not to withdraw these new sections then we would have no alternative but to press the amendment put forward here by Deputy Molloy to include the city and county manager as employees of the planning authority.  My view is that if it is found necessary to make regulations relating to members of a planning authority who are elected representatives then it is equally necessary to do likewise in relation to any others who are involved in planning decisions.  It is only right to point out at this stage that public representatives in this country have as high a standard of morality and as good a record as any other section of the community.  The record of Irish politicians is of exceptional quality.  Politician-bashing is a favourite pastime of certain sections of the community, and this is a hazard which we must accept but when this is overdone it tends to downgrade public life generally and to undermine to a considerable extent our democratic institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be a useful exercise for those who are anxious to downgrade the politician to take the Members of this House individually and to compare himself objectively with each one and see whether he is better or worse than they are.  I have no doubt he would find that the code of conduct <Col N="1825" /> in this House and among politicians generally is of exceptionally high character.  I am simply referring to this in relation to this section so as to ensure that we do not add to what I might term a rather warped view expressed by some that politicians are bad and corrupt by singling out politicians in this Bill and by making regulations to control their activities while at the same time seeming to accept that there are other people very often much more intimately concerned in planning decisions who are exempt as if they belonged to a different species, is not right.</P>
    <P>I make this case to the Minister in all sincerity.  By singling out public representatives we are to a considerable extent downgrading ourselves.  I would much prefer if the matter were dealt with in a comprehensive fashion in a Bill which was promised.  I feel also that if we leave the sections as they are, without concerning ourselves with other people who are very often more intimately concerned in planning than we are ourselves, we will tend to lower the status of politicians.  If we continue on this line, then we can hardly blame others who tend to downgrade us.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to think again with regard to the amendment put down by Deputy Molloy.  The amendment was put down for a specific purpose.  By accepting this amendment the Minister will be accepting that people in public life here are decent people and can be compared with any section of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, as strongly as I can, to support the general appeal made to the Minister in regard to the amendments he proposes.  At an earlier stage of the debate on this legislation I made my view clear.  I support very strongly the objection to legislating separately and solely for elected members of local authorities, as is being done in these amendments.  Indeed I would nearly go so far as to say that the last section of the community on whom these constraints and obligations should be placed are the elected members of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel perfectly free to speak frankly <Col N="1826" /> and openly on this question because I am not a member of a local authority and, hopefully, never will be.  Therefore, I feel I can speak on this question without having any vested interest of any sort whatsoever.  I wish to underline the importance of the fact that we expect elected members of local authorities to give their services voluntarily and gratuitously to the community. Also, in this regard we should be concerned with procuring the highest possible calibre and quality of elected representatives on local authorities. We should be very reluctant indeed to enact anything by way of legislation which would inhibit anybody from going forward for election to these local authorities.  I have a very strong doubt about the wisdom of these proposals <i>ab initio</i>.  I have a particularly strong objection to the Minister bringing in these amendments to deal with one section of the community in this way, in this very restricted area.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that, in my view the right way to deal with this&mdash;if it is to be dealt with; and when that day arrives I would have a lot to say on whether any action at all is called for in this area&mdash;is by one composite piece of legislation which affects everybody whether they be elected members of local authorities, Members of this House, members of the Judiciary, public officials, or whoever.  The Bill should be comprehensive and should cover everybody and every aspect of public administration.  That is the only fair and just way of dealing with the matter if it is to be dealt with at all. I agree with the Minister's suggestion that, if it is to be dealt with, it would be dealt with preferably by either the Attorney General or the Minister for Justice, because it is in their areas that these sorts of questions arise.  I cannot see the force in the Minister's argument that because this Bill has taken a long period of time to get through this House&mdash;for reasons I shall not go into&mdash;and because he was preoccupied with this legislation the Attorney General could not go ahead with preparing the other piece of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that at all. What I said was there was not a hope <Col N="1827" /> of getting it into the House in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is now the Minister's argument&mdash;that it has not much hope of getting into this House in the foreseeable future&mdash;I should like to know if, at least, the Attorney General is proceeding with the preparations for such a Bill.  I would like to know if that is the case.</P>
      <P>I want to make the argument as strongly as possible to the Minister, to the House and indeed to the general public that the right way to deal with this question is by a composite piece of legislation in which everybody is covered, in which we can see the whole picture and the rights and obligations of everybody concerned set out for everybody to comprehend.</P>
      <P>The Minister said, in his reply to Deputy Molloy, this was the legislation into which to put these proposals. I fundamentally disagree with that. I cannot be moved from the belief that the Minister brought in these amendments precipitately to deal with a particular situation which had arisen.  I always distrust <i>ad hoc</i> legislation, legislation which is brought in hurriedly in response to some particular situation which has arisen, which is agitating the public mind.  If the Minister were to consider the matter calmly and objectively he would admit that that is what happened in regard to these amendments.  He said that this is a Planning Bill and, therefore, is the place to insert these provisions. I submit that that is false reasoning on his part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Planning Bill and should deal with planning matters.  These amendments are concerned with the constitution of local authorities.  Were they to belong anywhere they would belong more properly to legislation which dealt with the composition of local authorities, election to local authorities and the rules of procedure governing local authorities.  It is coincidental only that this Bill happened to be before the Dáil and the Minister availed of that opportunity to insert these particular proposals concerning local authorities.  They are the last <Col N="1828" /> people in this country who should be singled out in this way, suspicion cast upon them, because no matter what protestations of goodwill towards local authority members the Minister makes, there is no doubt that these proposals do point the finger of suspicion at members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I support fully what Deputy Faulkner has said, that it is rather encouraging how standards have been preserved down the years throughout all the local authorities with the divisive people who are members of them in the different areas.  It is quite possible, if these amendments are adopted and these proposals become law, they will have the effect of prohibiting, or inhibiting, certain very worth-while people from becoming members of local authorities.  It is not difficult to visualise the type of individual who would have an interest in public affairs, who would wish to offer himself for election but who, because of his business interests, could not consider, not for any secret or illegitimate reasons but for genuine business reasons, disclosing in a public register all his business and property interests not because he would wish to do anything furtive or secret in the confines of the local authority to promote his own self-interests but simply because it would disclose information to business rivals which competitors and he could not face up to.  I put that one aspect of these proposals to the Minister for serious consideration.  Is it worthwhile, for the objectives which the Minister seeks in these proposals, to inhibit and prevent, perhaps, a fairly widespread number of people who could make a useful contribution to the councils and the local authorities from going forward for election?</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the views of some political scientist on this.  Is it not better to leave this matter to public opinion expressed through the ballot box?  I do not know if there is any situation in this country which has developed to a stage where we should depart from the old, wellestablished procedures that if you are a member of a local authority or indeed anybody, a member of a private <Col N="1829" /> organisation, a member of the board of directors of a company, where the old principle applies, if something affects your own interests you must disclose that before you participate in the discussion or vote on a proposal. If you are not honourable enough to do that I think that the normal democratic processes of public opinion, ultimately expressed through the ballot box, will take care of this situation.</P>
    <P>I believe that it will take care of it much more effectively than any legislation the Minister puts on the statute book.  After all if there is somebody who is devious and who seeks to manipulate the local authority in his own self-interest&mdash;I think that it is a very difficult thing to do because of the way local authorities are constituted and with the balance that is maintained between the managerial system and elected representatives&mdash;then I think he will succeed in doing this, no matter what legislation the Minister passes.</P>
    <P>All the Minister will do, by passing this legislation, is to embarrass perfectly straightforward, honest, decent people and perhaps, in many cases, inhibit them from going forward for election to local authorities.  As I say, I hope that we could discuss this matter much more fully on one piece of legislation which would cover the whole field.  I feel that the Minister is mistaken in endeavouring to insert these provisions relating to one narrow section of the community in this Bill.  These provisions are concerned with the constitution of local authorities, with the sort of people who should be members of local authorities, with the sort of people should behave, and with the standards they should uphold.  If those provisions have to be enacted they would be much more appropriate for a piece of legislation which governed the set-up, the election to and the procedures of local authorities as a whole, as distinct from putting them in on this very narrow aspect of the planning functions of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I do not want to advert to the matters which were raised earlier.  I feel perfectly free and at liberty to speak very openly and very frankly <Col N="1830" /> about these proposals because I am not a member of a local authority and, therefore, not in any way involved in anything that may be affected by the register that will be established as a result of these provisions. I had occasion in this House to direct a question to the Minister for Local Government&mdash;I want to give him credit for the fact that he answered very frankly&mdash;because of the allegations that were made inside and outside this House by a colleague of his in the Government, about myself and my colleague in my constituency. I felt it necessary to put down a question to the Minister asking him if anywhere in the files of his Department there was any record of any improper representations ever made by myself or Deputy Timmons in relation to planning matters.  I give the Minister credit for answering that parliamentary question put down by both of us in a manner which was satisfactory to us.</P>
    <P>It shows that allegations of this type are made and these can be very hurtful to people in public office.  It is in the atmosphere of those allegations that I am opposed to these sections. I am opposed to anything being done in isolation in regard to members of local authorities but I am not sure that when the time comes I will not be totally opposed, in principle, to this sort of departure.  I know it has become a popular concept in certain Labour circles in Britain and perhaps that is why it is being promulgated here, but I am not so sure that when the time comes to debate the full comprehensive legislation that I will not be equally opposed to that.  I am certainly opposed to this unilateral departure here in relation to members of local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Haughey have, in a reasonable way, argued against the proposals. Deputy Faulkner, of course, made his usual reasonable comments. I do not agree with the points he made but he made them in a reasonable way.  Deputy Haughey did also. Unlike Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Haughey I was a member of a local authority for 15 years.  Since this proposal <Col N="1831" /> has been made and the discussion of the amendment which would produce the declaration of interest by local authority members before the other question arose, I discussed the matter with numerous local authority representatives, members of various parties and also with representative groups of local authorities.  In no case did I get an objection to it.  All of them, like myself, are heartily sick of unfounded charges made&mdash;Deputy Haughey is perfectly correct when he says that he put down a question from himself and Deputy Timmons&mdash;either in such a way that they cannot be followed up or they are made under the protection of this House, which are hurtful, not alone to the people concerned, but to their families particularly when they are so untrue. Some of them, however, have been made outside the House.  This is the really dangerous part of it.</P>
      <P>They have been made in public, on television, radio and in the newspapers. I can recall the stories of some of the newspapers and at least one magazine which had long stories about these matters.  This is entirely wrong, and since the people who are affected by it &mdash;it is impossible to say that a politician should take a case against a newspaper because even if he wins he loses in the long run.  Whether it is right or wrong this has been publicised.  Of course, if enough mud is thrown some of it seems to stick.  This is obviously what the people who throw the mud are depending on.  There is one way to stop it and that is to have a declaration which will ensure that everybody is aware of what the situation is.  Deputy Haughey says it should not be included in a Planning Bill, that we should keep it for a Local Government Bill or for something else other than this.  The facts are that this is now before the House and the charges in the main were made with reference to land deals.  There were very hurtful charges made against decent people. Decent public representatives had their character taken away because statements were published saying that they were involved in land deals, as members of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1832" /> If they cannot protect themselves in any other way the onus is on this House to ensure that they are protected. That is the second reason why we should ensure that putting it down here means that in future, as far as planning and zoning are concerned, everyone will know what interest, if any, an elected representative has in that and nobody can write a scandal sheet in a newspaper or magazine accusing him of something which is entirely incorrect.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at one thing.  Dealing with Deputy Haughey on this Bill we discussed matters and if he puts up a reasonable case I accept it and if I put up a reasonable argument against it he is prepared to accept it although he may disagree with me.  But he is aware that on 14th January, 1975, Deputy Molloy said he would be prepared to accept it with regard to elected representatives if it was applied to others, and he was talking about local authority officials.  Eventually he stretched it out to include officials of the planning board.  I asked Deputy Haughey if he was talking for his party or was Deputy Molloy talking for the party.  The reply which he gave to me when he put out his hand was: &ldquo;The spokesman for the party is making the official statement&rdquo;.  The official statement was made by Deputy Molloy that he was prepared to accept this. That was in last January on another amendment.  Now we have both Deputy Molloy and Deputy Haughey arguing against what was accepted by them on 14th January, 1975.  That is just not good enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that Deputy Molloy was talking for the party.  If Deputy Molloy was talking for the party and he had accepted it Deputy Haughey will admit that the official spokesman had, in fact, spoken.  I know Deputy Haughey has a genuine objection to the proposal and I have no quarrel with him over that.  He is perfectly entitled, as is any Deputy in this House, to have his own views on any matter, but the facts of the case are that it has been agreed that the elected representatives of a local <Col N="1833" /> authority be included in the Bill.  I have given a guarantee to the House, which was accepted.</P>
      <P>In addition, the officials, both of the local authority and the planning board would be included in the declaration of interest.  Having gone that far, it is a bit unreasonable now to reverse engines and attempt to go back to square one again and say, &ldquo;all that is gone now, we are now going to have a new ball game and we are now going to attempt to argue the whole thing over again.&rdquo;  When we talk of the speed or otherwise with which this Bill is going through the House that is very relevant.  There is no point in having a long discussion on one section, reaching a conclusion, and a guarantee which I had given being accepted by the Opposition, and then on a subsesquent section going back to the same objection. That is unreasonable.  Nobody can quarrel with my argument.  As far as I am concerned, it is necessary in this Bill to have included the declaration of interest for elected representatives and to follow that up with the declaration of interest for the officials, of both the local authority and the planning authority.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister not see, for instance, that if these amendments had been introduced together, the sensitive questions of the public representatives at local authority level being singled out would not have arisen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a ridiculous argument.  He is arguing about local authority representatives being singled out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister has mentioned that, that is the reason I find very unconvincing.  He may genuinely hold that view.  If in fact he feels obliged to introduce legislation requiring all public representatives at local authority level to state their interests, simply because of reports in newspapers so that, as he says, such charges cannot be made again, if you follow that to its conclusion, it means that in respect of any such group you wait until charges of that nature are made in newspapers and then you introduce some provision in this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Ministers could wait and say: &ldquo;We will not do it until such time as charges are made in newspapers and then because these charges are made we will bring a section into a Bill&rdquo;.  That does not seem to me to make very good sense. Either the thing is right in its own right or it is wrong.  It is not because of charges made in newspapers.  That is where I see the weakness of the Minister's position in this.  If the principle is right it applies to all and not <Col N="1837" /> by way of response to charges made in newspapers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>On a point of information, does the Minister's guarantee include members of the new planning board or only the staff?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in fact I have made it very clear that the proposals that have been put in have been strengthened because of unfair attacks made on public representatives.  I consider it scandalous that public representatives should be attacked in the way they were and no proof of it except that somebody published it in a newspaper.  For one reason, a very good reason, court cases did not follow and the general public, who do not know the facts, said: &ldquo;There must be something in it or it would not have been said.&rdquo;  So there is one way of ensuring that it will not be repeated and that is to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not.  The allegations will still be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the allegations are made, then there is a way of dealing with this kind of thing.  Allegations made outside the House, in my opinion, should be followed up even though <Col N="1838" /> politicians say it is foolish to go to court with the Press&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think, just taking up his own argument, that the fact that this register is there open for public inspection, will invite vindictive and malicious people to go and look at the register and proceed to make all sorts of allegations on the basis of what they read in the register&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But they cannot because, if somebody declares in the register that he has an interest, nobody can accuse him of deliberately cloaking what the position is and taking advantage of the fact that it was not known that he had that interest.  It is a castiron protection for people who are or are likely to be vilified.  Public representatives, particularly local authority representatives, who are unpaid, should be protected in every possible way.  At that time I only included that, but because of the argument made here I included the local authority staff and the members and staff of the planning board.  This is to be included in the Bill on Report Stage.  I thought we would have no further discussion, that that was as clear as crystal when we discussed it before.  I am very disappointed that it should be debated again.</P>

      <P>The capital allocation for major water and sewerage schemes notified to local authorities, including Galway County Council, on 16th May were related, as were the corresponding allocations in previous years, to expenditure out of loans which had been sanctioned at the date the allocations were notified to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Galway County Council notified my Department in January, 1975 that their requirements in 1975 would be £32,940 in respect of loans sanctioned up to then.  I gave the council an allocation of £122,000 to enable draws to be made out of those loans and out of additional loans which I had sanctioned between the date of the council estimate and the date the allocation was notified.  In addition, I gave an allocation of £30,000 for small schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In giving their estimate of £32,940 in January, 1975, the county council indicated that they would also hope to get sums totalling £721,144 in respect of loans which in fact had not yet been <Col N="1679" /> sanctioned.  This was of course premature, and I may add that the overall capital available for sanitary services, although very much greater than that available in 1972-73, is not unlimited.</P>

      <P>Projections of national debt as such are not made but, of course, projections of the Government's borrowing requirements for each financial period are.  These projections and subsequent outturns relate to complete financial periods only.  Conditions on both domestic and foreign capital markets can fluctuate considerably over a period of time and the Government can only borrow when market conditions are appropriate. For this reason it would not be meaningful to make borrowing projections for periods of time less than a complete financial period or to compile outturns for such periods.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will make special arrangements for signing for unemployment for workers in the Blarney and Douglas areas, County Cork, whose arrangements for annual holidays were made before receipt of redundancy notices and where both dates coincide.</P>

      <P>In the absence of more precise details as to the workers or firms involved I cannot say if the question of special signing arrangements arises.  I presume, however, that the question relates to entitlement to unemployment benefit in respect of a period which would normally have been an annual holiday period.  This would, of course, be a matter for decision by a deciding officer or on appeal by an appeals officer.  If the persons concerned have not already claimed unemployment benefit I would suggest that they should do so without delay in order that the question of their entitlement can be determined in accordance with the statutory procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 319 and 320 together.</P>
      <P>The acquisition of the premises referred to in the questions would be a matter for consideration in the first instance by the Midland Health Board.  I understand that the question of the acquisition of the former vocational school premises at Ballinamuck for use as a welfare home was considered by the health board at their meeting on 30th January, 1975, but that the premises were not regarded as suitable for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I understand that the board have not considered the question of the acquisition of Castlecore Convent, Ballymahon, for use as a rehabilitation centre or a welfare home but I am bringing the Deputy's suggestion to the board's notice.</P>
