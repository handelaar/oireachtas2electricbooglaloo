    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will name the areas in the country where television reception is deemed to be unsatisfactory; and if he will outline the plans for improving this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>About 98 per cent of the population can receive RTE television programmes but there are many areas throughout the country where reception is not fully satisfactory.  It is not possible to give precise details of all the areas involved, some of which contain only a few houses.  The main areas where reception is below the national average are parts of Counties Clare, Cork, Donegal, Kerry, Louth, Tipperary, Waterford and Wicklow.  In addition viewers in areas served by the Maghera transmitter suffer interference at times from Spanish and Swedish stations particularly during the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE have drawn up a programme which is being financed by advances from the Exchequer for improving reception in these areas.  However, owing to the heavy programme of capital works RTE are facing over the next few years and the varied demands on scarce capital, it will probably be four to five years before the programme is completed.  Even <Col N="1636" /> then there will be some small pockets where, owing to unusual topographical configuration reception will still be a problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Omitting topographical considerations is the Minister aware that there are areas where reception is poor spasmodically due to frequent breakdowns?  These breakdowns could be repaired at small cost but there seems to be no system whereby they can be speedily remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a remedy for this kind of thing comes under the general plan.  If the Deputy would care to give me particulars of individual cases where he thinks something should be done, I will be glad to get RTE to look into them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the discontent in many areas where there is poor television reception and of the apparent neglect by himself and his Department?  While other issues are being raised by him, the areas concerned for the most part have no television reception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this is no new problem.  It has prevailed for many years in the past.  An effort is now being made, through the provision of £1 million from the Exchequer, to remedy the deficiencies which existed for many years and were not set right previously.  With the help of the Government RTE are moving as fast as they reasonably can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if a request was made recently to the BBC asking that a televised interview with the Minister for Justice be not broadcast; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of an interview which the Minister for Justice gave to BBC Television for a programme on the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, it became apparent to the Minister that the approach of the interviewer was uniformed and unbalanced.  The Government Information Services advised the Minister to withdraw his consent to the transmission of his interview and this was conveyed to the BBC by the Government Information Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what exactly were the objections to the broadcast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was concerned that the uniformed approach which appeared likely to be reflected in the programme might have a detrimental effect on public opinion, particularly in Northern Ireland.  The association of the Minister with it in the form of a prerecorded interview might appear to condone that approach.  Inherent in the programme's approach was the suggestion that the Irish authorities were not doing all in their power to minimise subversive activities within the State.  Such a suggestion, if given currency on a BBC programme which, of course, can be seen in Northern Ireland, could only sustain further the many misunderstandings held by many people in Northern Ireland as to our attitude on violence and its perpetration.  The Minister offered to appear live at the end of the programme and so to be in a position to offer informed and corrective comment on the line taken in the programme but the BBC declined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Minister's reply a good example of what <Col N="1638" /> can occur if the State undertakes to broadcast a foreign programme in its entirety?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is.  This incident occurred in conditions in which no such rebroadcasting is happening.  Secondly, there is only one thing really to be feared about this type of programme and that is its impact in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Or anywhere.  The truth is the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people living in the Republic know that this type of allegation is unfounded.  Many people are interested to see that things are covered in this way, and it may be no bad thing that they do see it. I do not think any damage will be done to the national interest by the possibility of viewers in the south and west seeing something which is already viewable in the east and north.  The fact is that the damage which we feared was the damage due to the broadcasting of this in Northern Ireland which we are not in a position to affect one way or another except, as was done in this case, to draw the attention of the BBC to the kind of damage that can be done in that area. On that we would propose to follow up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that current affairs programmes dealing with matters of this nature being transmitted into the State can cause a similar situation to develop?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the whole problem about this, as I tried to emphasise, is that the damage is done not by the reception of this kind of programme in this State where people know this is not true but by its reception and belief in it in Northern Ireland.  That is the point that has to be made in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister envisage the situation where the greater damage could be done in the South?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the BBC and other British <Col N="1639" /> channels are widely available in the Republic already.  The gentleman who put down this question is not here. Deputy Molloy it was, who was arguing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just expressing regret that he is not here because that Deputy urged that multi-channel television be provided for Galway city.  If it were provided it would carry this kind of programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that an untruth about this country televised and broadcast in Britain is unimportant?  Is he saying that it is only important when it is broadcast in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not. I accept the Deputy's point.  It does damage in Britain and it does damage in Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland is the main one because opinion there is much more sensitive on this issue than it is elsewhere.  Damage is also done in Britain and it is right that we should draw the attention of the people concerned to the damage that can be done by this kind of programme.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say who has the final responsibility in this area?  In reply to representations I have been told that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Department of Transport and Power, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Industry and Commerce have a responsibility.  Is there any intention to give the responsibility <Col N="1644" /> and power to a single Department to control the pollution of the Shannon? It is causing concern all along the basin.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Deputy has said in that regard.  It is causing concern in my Department&mdash; to Bord Fáilte&mdash;because of the effects it might have on the tourist industry. There is also concern by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries from the point of view of fish life. Bord na Móna would have responsibility in this regard because they are, allegedly, the polluters.  Any industry, town or group of people if they were to have the responsibility would have the responsibility for seeing (a) that the damage done is corrected and (b) that it does not occur again.  As regards towns and houses, the Department of Local Government would have the responsibility there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will use existing legislation or introduce new legislation to deal with the very serious road freight service problems in the north-western half of County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the <Col N="1646" /> Deputy has in mind the withdrawal by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company of their service for the collection and delivery of small lots of traffic within the north Donegal area.  I am assured, however, by CIE, who took over this service from 3rd June, 1975, at short notice, that their arrangements are working smoothly and that there has been no deterioration in the road freight service in north-west Donegal, which would warrant action under existing road transport legislation, or require the introduction of new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the twin evils which occur here.  First, two transport authorities are now responsible for the road freight services operating heretofore in this area, so that we fall between two stools.  Would it not be more efficient if either the Lough Swilly Railway Company or CIE did all the road freight?  Secondly&mdash;and perhaps this is the greater problem, to which the Minister had not even adverted in his reply&mdash;50 workers formerly employed by the Lough Swilly Railway Company are now, due to a bit of juggling between CIE and the Lough Swilly Railway Company, being made redundant.  If CIE are going to take up the road freight services of this company, then they should pick up the employment situation as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to go back a little into history in this connection. The Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company approached me last year and said they were in financial difficulties and were looking for a grant.  Because of an EEC directive I could not give them a grant for road freight and I gave them a sum of money which was to be used only for passenger traffic.  Then in May they announced they were curtailing their services in north-west Donegal for road freight.  CIE went in immediately and established connections to the rail head in Derry to serve areas previously served by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company. I understand it is working very efficiently and I do not think there have been any complaints about the way <Col N="1647" /> CIE are operating it.  CIE went in to provide a service for the traders in the area, to collect and deliver their goods.  However, there are not 50 people redundant; the number redundant is about 12 or 13.  CIE did not go in and take over trade already being done by another company; the other company pulled out and CIE had to go in.  They would have been quite happy not to do it and to leave it to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company if they had been willing to continue, but they were not so willing.  To ensure that there was a service for the traders in the area CIE went in and provided that service.</P>

      <P>If this is a subterfuge to assist the Lough Swilly Railway Company by way of having CIE, which are already a subsidised company, doing the road freight service, I should think it would be better that they would do all the road freight services and retain in employment the 50 people who have been given protective notices.  I admit that only 12 of them have been made redundant so far, but they are under protective notice and I can assure the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1653" /> I am informed by BGE that, as the provision of the Kinsale Head gas transmission system will involve technologies new to this country, the company consider it necessary to employ consultants experienced in natural gas transmission systems in an advisory capacity in connection with the project.  To that end BGE have been having discussions with a number of consultancy firms including the organisation referred to by the Deputies. There is, however, no question of that organisation being engaged to undertake all the engineering work involved or being utilised as main contractor for the project.</P>
    <P>BGE have assured me that their policy will be to utilise Irish engineering firms and Irish personnel, equipment and materials to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the ESB are fully competent and capable to undertake consultancy work or prior surveying work for this project?  Since there has been an allegation that the ESB are overstaffed and in view of the fact that they are doing similar work abroad on a consultancy level, should not the Minister ensure that the ESB get this contract as consultants since they have the capability, staff and experience?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the ESB would agree with what the Deputy has said.  If they were awarded the contract they would have to engage outside consultants to advise them because they do not have that technology.  I am concerned to see that as many people in this country as we will need for the future development of natural gas will have the necessary training and expertise in this area.  Deputies may have seen advertisements last weekend by BGE to recruit engineers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Six months ago I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not fall within the province of the Department <Col N="1654" /> of Industry and Commerce.  It would be within the province of the Department of Transport and Power. BGE are recruiting their own staff.  I appreciate what Deputy Barrett has said about the ESB and the vast amount of very fine technology in the engineering field which they have built up during the years.  However, the ESB are customers of BGE and, in the long-term, I should prefer to see that expertise in gas pipeline and gas transmission being with BGE rather than with somebody who may be a customer of the board in the future as well as at present.  As I have stated, I am concerned that the maximum amount of work possible is done by Irish personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the ESB laid ten miles of 16-inch high gas pressure pipeline across Dublin Bay from Poolbeg to Carrickmines and that they were fully capable of doing the work?  Is there any difference between the two pipelines other than the fact that the Cork pipeline will be slightly larger?</P>

If BGE said to the ESB tomorrow morning that they wanted the natural gas brought from point A to point B and that the job was being given to the ESB, the latter would have to engage outside consultants to advise them.  I do not want this expertise to be available only to one firm.  I want it to be under direct State control through BGE.  The board have the job of engaging consultants&mdash;there are a number of firms concerned other than the one mentioned by the Deputy&mdash;and they will then award the contract.</P>

One of these firms has decided to establish an industry in Tallaght and details of this are expected to be announced at an early date.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, industrialists, by and large, go to areas of their own choice.  It may be that because of the incentives offered by the IDA they can be moved from, say, an area like Dublin to an area like Cashel, but it may also be that if they do not get incentives to come to the Dublin area they will not come to this country at all, that they are just not interested in going outside the Dublin area and that they only come to this country on condition that they will get incentives. The incentives that have been available outside Dublin are now available to industries coming to the Dublin region.</P>

      <P>I would certainly not agree with the Deputy that the vast majority of the people in the west of Ireland are living on social welfare.  I am sure that is untrue.  It is certainly the policy of the Government to encourage as many industries as possible to go to the west of Ireland. I have not got the figures here but they have been very successful in that in the last couple of years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a large number of workers are being laid off in a major industry (name supplied) in County Louth; and if he will state the steps he is taking to get the industry back in full production or to provide alternative employment for any workers who may be declared redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the matter referred to by the Deputy.  I understand that the company closed on 20th June, 1975 and reopened on 30th June, 1975, when it resumed production of a limited range of some of its more profitable products.  I further understand that the management expect that within a short period the work force will be built up to around 50 per cent of the level obtaining prior to the closure on 20th June, 1975.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Industrial Development Authority that the company is agreeable to set up, in conjunction with the National Manpower Service, an employment bureau in the factory.  In addition it is expected that there will be surplus factory space available and the company has indicated that it is willing to lease this to an alternative suitable industry.  The IDA will assist them in this and will continue with its efforts to attract alternative industries to the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alternative employment possibilities already being created within a reasonable commuting distance of the area include three new industries <Col N="1666" /> being set up in the Drogheda area which will eventually provide nearly 1,200 jobs.  Three hundred-and-fifty of these will be filled by the end of 1976.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this is the only industry in the area and that about half of the workers, that is, approximately 300, will not be re-employed?  Would he agree that in the circumstances it is necessary that very special consideration should be given to this area to ensure that these workers are back in employment as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I accept that this is the only industry in the area. As I said, there is space available in that factory to which the IDA are doing their best to attract industrialists at the moment but in the interim there are new jobs being created within fairly reasonable distance of the existing factory.  The Minister is very conscious of the particular position in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that the new jobs being created will not help to absorb these workers when there are so many unemployed trying to get employment in the Drogheda area as it is and that quite recently one industry there, a heavy industry, announced that it was closing down in the autumn and that a boot and shoe industry in Drogheda has gone into liquidation?  What possible hope can the workers in the Dunleer factory have of obtaining employment in the industries mentioned by the Minister?  Is the Minister also aware that the whole midland area is economically dependent on this industry particularly having regard to the fact that there has been a big lay-off in employment in the Castlegar textile factory and that the chair factory has also closed down? Will he ask the IDA to take very particular cognisance of the fact that the employment situation in the whole midland area is in a critical condition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do appreciate the very important position that this firm held in that area.  The notes attached to the answer to this question make it obvious that the IDA are particularly interested in getting something else in there to fill the void and to provide employment for the people who have lost their jobs in the factory referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will probably be aware that this is a heavy industry and that it is of particular significance because it is located in a rural area.  Would he agree that apart from any other consideration, it would be a national disaster if the skills built up in that area over quite a number of years were to be lost and would he impress on the IDA the necessity not only to provide further industry there but to provide industry which could make use of the special skills which are available in the area?</P>

      <P>The IDA have been in contact with the factory to which I am sure the Deputy is referring and they do not foresee any further reduction in the work force at the moment.  Part of the problem there has been (a) the distillers' strike here removed some of the demand for bottles over all last winter and (b) the general fall-off in economic activity reduced exports to the English market; that these factors depressed the industry and necessitated redundancies to date but the company involved are expecting that this is of a temporary nature and that the demand will pick up again.</P>

Deputy Colley will appreciate that when we adjourned last week we had not concluded section 7.  As a matter of fact, we were in the middle of a discussion on a point raised by Deputy Colley on section 7 and it was thought appropriate that I should resume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to make the general observation that, if the Minister for Finance could be here, he should be here.  To resume on section 7, as amended, on the last occasion when we were discussing this matter I drew attention to a certain aspect of it and the Minister for Lands appeared to be somewhat taken by surprise at the point.  I trust he has had an opportunity of considering the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To recapitulate, the situation is that this section, as amended, provides for the exemption from wealth tax of the capital value of superannuation funds or approved superannuation schemes. I made it clear that, in regard to the public service and their pensions, I have no objection whatever to the manner in which their pensions are calculated.  I pointed out that I personally had something to do with the establishment of parity in public service pensions.  I do not want any <Col N="1679" /> misunderstanding in regard to that. Nor have I any complaints about the level of salary and therefore of pension of public servants.</P>
    <P>The point I am raising is, that under this section, in my view there is considerable unequal treatment as between those who are employed in the public service and in particular in the civil service on the one hand, and those who are self-employed or employed outside the public service with or without an approved pension scheme.  Very succinctly the position is that a self-employed or non-pensionable married man is entitled to have up to £100,000 before he reaches the wealth tax threshold whereas a person who is in receipt of a pension or superannuation rights under an approved scheme is entitled to a threshold of £100,000 plus the capitalised value of his pension.  This is a particularly acute problem for the self-employed who are in their fifties or sixties.  It can lead to considerable hardship.  It appears under this Bill that there is no provision for relief in respect of a married man who is self-employed and who has put his savings, which have already been taxed, into stocks and shares or property in order to have a pension when he retires.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill goodwill is liable to wealth tax.  In many cases, particularly in the case of self-employed professional men, the goodwill of their business or practice may well represent for them the capital sum on which they will be depending to provide them with a pension on retirement. Therefore we are urging the Minister to ensure that there is equal exemption in so far as it can be given. I am not suggesting that it is a simple problem but there are approaches open which would make the position as equitable for those in the private sector as for those in the public sector. It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that the section approves or exempts superannuation funds under an approved superannuation scheme. What is really involved is whether an equal threshold or as reasonable a threshold is given to somebody in the <Col N="1680" /> private sector who is self-employed as is given to somebody in the public sector with the kind of pension scheme there is in the public sector.</P>
    <P>I gave an instance of a situation in regard to a Secretary of a Department and a present salary of approxiimately £11,000 a year, if he had 10 years of service to go and if we assume an average rate of inflation over the next 10 years of 15 per cent with the increase in his salary and consequent increase in pension on retirement, in line with inflation, with no improvement in the standard of living over today, we arrive at a position in which the capitalised value of his pension at retirement in 10 years' time is £321,000.  He is therefore entitled to a threshold of <i>x</i> £100,000 plus £321,000.  There is no comparable or remotely comparable exemption for a self-employed man in the private sector or for people who are employed but are beneficiaries under a superannuation scheme in terms approved by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Even if the Revenue Commissioners were to relax their conditions of approval for the purpose of income tax relief commercially, there is no way one can purchase this kind of pension right.  Consequently we are faced with the situation in which, taking the example I have taken in the public sector, the effect of a threshold in one case is £421,000 and in the other £100,000. This is the basis of the complaint made.  There is not an equitable approach in the Bill to this problem. There is not any solution, but an effort could be made to allow somebody to receive an exemption, if he has no pension rights, which would roughly equate him with somebody in the public service, and he has pension rights which are restricted, an exemption which when added to his existing pension rights would put him approximately in the same position as a corresponding person in the public service.</P>
    <P>I recognise immediately that it is very difficult to equate a self-employed man with a particular grade in the public service, and say <Col N="1681" /> that is the level of exemption which should operate.  This problem is not totally insoluble.  Even if it presents difficulties and does not result in absolute equity, it is far better that some rough and ready effort be made to tackle the problem than to pass this Bill with the built-in inequity I have described.  For that reason I hope the Minister will have found it possible in the interval since we discussed this matter before to be able to indicate to the House the steps he would propose to take to try to remedy the inequities I have highlighted, the very different treatment meted out, on the one hand, to somebody employed in the public service or indeed somebody in receipt of a Ministerial pension, or, on the other, the self-employed without a pension or a person employed outside the public sector in receipt of a much more limited pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the point made by Deputy Colley.  It is a serious problem and I do not see an easy way out of it.  If there is not to be some form of exemption from this tax for superannuation purposes, then there will be a basic inequality directed against the private individual in the circumstances that can arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is talking about the self-employed. These superannuation schemes apply to a lot of private businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The problem that arises here can arise for a surprising number of people, such as those who have not been able, either through their employment or through the circumstances of the particular nature of the business they have been engaged in, to make provision for the standard superannuation retirement scheme.  I maintain that those who have not this advantage and yet who when it comes to retire either have succeeded, through investment or otherwise, in setting aside a sum of money or by disposing of a farm or a business, have the necessary amount of capital which would provide for retirement, should have the benefit given to others under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> It is impossible to visualise as Deputy Colley has set out what the necessary amount of capital would be, with inflation running at 15 to 20 per cent.  Nevertheless if an individual has a farm, a business or a small factory which he has been running or something of that kind and in order to retire sells it, his position will be as one sees it at the moment, that the capital sum that he would then have would form part of his taxable liability for wealth tax purposes. The sort of provision that is needed here is that he should be able to provide some sort of investment return, whether it is in certain kinds of Government securities, which would not be included, just as the individual who either in private employment or in the State's employment or the local authority would have his pension and his pension is not capitalised and included as part of his wealth possessions.</P>
    <P>This is a question that could become quite a contentious one if the Minister cannot find any way around it, because there would be a basic injustice against the individual who wants to provide for his retirement.  I mentioned that there is not very much the State can do about the escalating, inflation rate, but there is something the State can do to enable that individual, outside of his ordinary possessions which any person in significant employment would have on retirement, to invest an appreciable sum to provide himself, in terms of today, with some sort of reasonable income on retirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Deputies opposite seem to miss the point that the object of this Bill is to tax wealth in possession.  A right to future wealth is not taxable except in one or two exceptional cases which are dealt with elsewhere in the Bill. This section we are dealing with is the exemption section and it simply exempts all superannuation arrangements, entitlement to pensions however provided, lump sums secured to people on retirement until they receive them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley seems to suggest that there should be a higher threshold for those who are not entitled on retirement <Col N="1683" /> to superannuation benefits than to those who are so entitled.  I think that is his case in a nutshell.  He seems to think that, because provision is not made for a higher threshold for self-employed people or those in employment which does not make provision for them on retirement, than for people in employment who are entitled to superannuation on retirement, there is discrimination against the former.  I do not agree with that.</P>
    <P>I pointed out on the last occasion that we have in the Bill several instances which, if Deputy Colley was to argue his case to its logical conclusion, would also suggest there was discrimination.  Take the person who has a house worth £50,000 which is exempt, against the person who has only a house valued £10,000.  It is not suggested there is any discrimination there.  As a matter of fact one might have one person with a house valued for £50,000 and another person with no house at all, who was living in a flat all his life or lived with his relatives. The same argument applies to a person with livestock as against the person with no livestock; the person with bloodstock as against the person with no bloodstock; the person who lives on just the site of the house in the town as against the person who resides in the suburbs in a detached house on an acre of ground.  In all those cases it could be said there is discrimination.  There is not.  Those are exempt.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that there is more discrimination there than in the case we are dealing with.  In the case we are dealing with we are simply exempting superannuation arrangements. It may be said that the self-employed person usually has tangible wealth in the form of buildings, or land, whereas the employed person very often has not.  Secondly, the employed person is usually, by the conditions of his employment, forced to retire at 65 when he is usually unlikely to find other employment, whereas the self-employed person can continue to work, continue to manage his business, practice his profession, until later on in life if his health permits <Col N="1684" /> him to do so.  You are not comparing like with like.</P>
    <P>I did say to Deputy Colley the last evening it was a pity he had not raised this in a more formal way.  Of course he is not obliged to give notice; nor is any member of the Opposition on Committee.  They can raise any point at any time without an amendment.  I do not want to be taken as being critical of the Opposition, but I did say that.  I have had the matter gone into and I will give the Opposition what I consider to be a reasonable reply to the point raised by them.  As I have said, section 7 is the exemption section.  Amongst the many exemptions contained in this section are the exemptions for benefits from superannuation schemes and analogous benefits provided by private individuals for themselves. The scheme of the Bill as far as individuals are concerned is to tax present interests which are in possession and to ignore future interests with one or two exceptions, which have already been dealt with.  Therefore, the right to receive a superannuation benefit in the future is in common with all future interests, like contingent life interests and remainders, generally not the subject of the tax.  As a result, the exemptions in paragraph (c) are concerned with interests in possession, pension rights which are actually enjoyed by pensioners.  We are therefore talking about persons who are retired and who are in the wealth tax bracket.</P>
    <P>As I understand the proposition which has been put forward by the Opposition it is that an individual who is self-employed and who has made no provision for himself by way of a retirement annuity should be given a further exemption of such a sum as would represent the value of a superannuation benefit which he would have been entitled to if he had been a member of a superannuation scheme or had made similar provisions of his own.  The proposition therefore applies only to those who are above a certain age and who are retired whether on the grounds of age or ill-health and who are in the wealth tax bracket.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> In considering this proposition several factors are to be taken into account.  It is the nature of exemptions that they apply only to property which is liable to tax.  The suggestion does not fall within this principle.  It is, therefore, another proposition in that it asks for an exemption for property which does not exist and that, accordingly, an individual should get a benefit for non-existent property.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I will come to that in a minute.  We will assume for one moment that the superannuation which Deputy Colley is talking about is existent property which may be looked forward to in the future if the person lives long enough.  But Deputy Colley is saying that the other person who has no such right should have it taken into account as imaginary property and should be given a threshold in respect of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is what Deputy Colley is saying in effect.  What is sought is a special additional threshold for certain individuals. The reasons advanced for this treatment suggest that there should be differentiation between the selfmade man and the individual who inherited his wealth and that the relief should be related to the business element of that.  If this is pushed to its logical conclusion the relief should also be extended to employed persons in so far as their existing superannuation benefits might be considered to be inadequate.  This suggestion would present enormous problems, a fact which I think it is fair to say the Opposition speakers acknowledge.  Deputy Colley said it is going to be difficult to get over this one but that it should not be <Col N="1686" /> beyond the ingenuity of the Minister and his advisers to get beyond it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes.  If the principle of special thresholds is admitted it would have to be extended.  Clearly there would have to be a differentiation between people of the same wealth to take account of such factors as age, state of health, family circumstances and whether, for instance, an individual has a salary in addition to his wealth.  Furthermore to ensure equity there should instead of a flat rate of tax be progressive rates increasing with the amount of wealth.</P>
      <P>It is perhaps significant that there is no provision similar to that suggested to be found elsewhere and as far as can be ascertained writers on the subject have not advanced the idea.  A very recent and comprehensive study of wealth tax running to over 350 pages which was published after this Bill was introduced entitled &ldquo;An Annual Wealth Tax&rdquo; by Messrs.  Sandford, Willis and Ironside has this to say on page 139:</P>
      <P>The conclusion is that pensions and pension rights should be exempt as the Green Paper proposes, whether they arise under the national scheme, a statutory scheme or an approved private scheme. Similar exemptions should be given in respect of the retirement annuities provided for themselves by self-employed persons or non-pensionable employees where the conditions for income tax relief are satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is precisely what has been done in the Bill.  There might be some justification for considering the suggestion if the thresholds for liability were much lower and if there were no exemptions such as those for the private dwelling house and its contents. The fact of the matter is that the thresholds exemptions and reliefs in the Bill which combine to produce a low effective rate on all assets of taxpayers are such as to render any further refinements based on individual circumstances unnecessary.  The <Col N="1687" /> additional administrative costs which such refinements would entail and which would have to be met by other taxpayers could not be justified.  Such refinements would themselves create their own inequalities.  There is, however, one certain way of ensuring that discrimination which the Opposition claim the Bill creates is removed, that is, by deleting the exemptions for superannuation benefits and for private schemes entirely.  If the Opposition introduce an amendment to this effect, I will promise to give it my full attention.  I know that the Opposition are not suggesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> There is no way of dealing with it.  I am going further and saying that there is no problem, there is no discrimination or injustice, any more than there is in the other instances which I have mentioned.  Here I might point out, in one way or another all exemptions bring about some element of discrimination.  That is what I have been saying.  A town-dweller might object that he should get a further exemption equivalent to that for an extra acre of land which a tillage farmer or any farmer for bloodstock might enjoy.  Perhaps the people with the greatest grievance are the many thousands who will never reach the thresholds and for whom all exemptions are academic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally I would like to clear up any misunderstanding which might arise out of Deputy Colley's reference to a figure of £300,000 as representing a value of a pension of £5,500 ten years from now, assuming inflation at 15 per cent per annum, with the result that the pension would then amount <Col N="1688" /> to £22,000 per annum.  It is not necessary for me to say whether this estimate is right or wrong.  All I can do is deal with the present, not with the position ten years from now.  What we are concerned with now is the present value of an existing annuity in possession of a pensioner on 5th April last, that is taking Deputy Colley's example, a pension of £5,500 per annum.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 of the Bill such a pension is valued in the same way as any annuity which is not charged on property.  This value is arrived at by taking the current yield, 14 per cent, on the relevant Government security on 5th April, 1975, that is the 11th national loan 1993-1998 which then stood at £80.  On that basis such an annuity would be valued at £40,000.  This figure then indicates that if such a pensioner were to be liable to tax he would have to hold additional assets to the value of £60,000 in addition to exempted properties such as his dwelling and contents if he were married.  I think those figures put the matter in its proper perspective and put it beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>I repeat here that we are dealing with exemptions and to do what Deputy Colley suggests would be introducing an element of unreality into the matter by introducing imaginary property, seeing discrimination where there is none.  I keep on repeating, and I will do so <i>ad nauseam</i> that a man without stock is just as much entitled to have a grievance against the man who owns £50,000 worth of livestock as is the man with no superannuation arrangements against the man who has such arrangements.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement is an extraordinary mixture of valid argument plus what appeared to me to be interpolations that I do not think improves his case.  Before I go on to the case he said something about the private sector, that the Opposition could put down an amendment as regards that sector.  My simple question is why not the public sector?  If we were to put down an amendment for the public sector why not for the public sector?  I may have misunderstood the Minister.</P>

      <P>This is a preliminary point to clear.  I may have misunderstood the Minister but the way he used the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; in that context suggested a difference in principle between the public and the private sectors.  The whole point, of what Deputy Colley wished to say in general terms is that we should try to keep as far as possible the same levels for taxation or benefits, particularly taxation, between the public and the private sectors.  That does not mean that the public sector should not be properly remunerated.  I, for one, went out of my way the other day to make a comment on that point but what I am saying is that the principles governing the public and the private sectors should be the same and if they are not the same it is ultimately going to bring about difficulties such as, for instance, the recent PAYE difficulties. These difficulties inevitably come and it is interesting to reflect that the difficulties and the imposition on the public service of PAYE occurred because there was a differentiation made at the beginning although I think many in the public sector wanted to treat it flat across the board, that is merely a comment.  If the Minister did not mean to imply that and if I misunderstood him I am sorry, I merely want to make the point that we are standing on the principle, the assumption if you like, the hypothesis that the public and private sectors are entitled to the same principles of approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about a principle of approach.  The Minister has talked about property, property in possession and property not in possession, and imaginary property. He has insisted particularly on interpreting much of what has been said from this side as applying only to the self-employed.  I would like to make it quite clear that at one extreme it does cover the self-employed but it also covers an intermediate scale of the spectrum.  For that reason I am going to take a fairly typical case in the private sector, big firms in the private sector, which would be by and large on the same level as in the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to take the case of a superannuation provision in, say, a fairly progressive firm which over the years has within the terms of the Finance Act operated a contributory pension scheme.  We have a definition of property in section 1 and we have a definition and delimitation of taxable wealth of an individual in section 3.  In that section there is in effect a provision that if somebody has an income but the property from which that income is derived is not, to put it in colloquial language, immediately owned by the individual that the capital represented by that income will be captured for the individual by a process the Minister invoked, a process of calculation to determine the present value of the annuity.  It is because of the effect of the definitions in section 2 1 and of the provisions of sections 2 and 3, particularly in relation to annuities, that we have the position here that if these exemptions were not in the Bill then they would be capitalised <Col N="1691" /> and assessed for wealth tax.  I think that would be the legal position under this section if these exemptions were not in.  Let us follow this up in my hypothetical case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is not so if the Deputy is going to argue on that.  They would be capitalised only from the date on which the person became entitled to receive them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  Let us get another point clear for the purpose of our argument because this has given rise to confusion.  The Minister is making great play with the word &ldquo;present&rdquo;.  He is right in the sense that any annuity would not be chargeable in that sense and be aggregated for wealth tax until it has actually been paid.  I freely concede that point. That is the fact.  However, I will come back to this because I want to follow the first part of my argument.  By virtue of the earlier provisions of the Act particularly in sections 1, 2 and 3, as soon as an annuity became payable that annuity would be captured and would be, so to speak, capitalised for taxable purposes and would be taxable for wealth tax in the hands of the recipient if the recipient's threshold were exceeded.</P>
      <P>Let us agree that that would be the legal position if the provisions in section 7 were not there.  It will be only in the higher brackets, whether in the public or private sector, and where there has been some accumulation of property as well, such as invested income or something like that, having regard to the thresholds and the exemptions, that the case will become of practical importance.  The Minister himself made that case.  That is a matter for actuarial determination. It does not take away from the equity of the case I am trying to make.  It is a poor defence to escape on the question of the principal of this matter although if I were pleading it, say, in a court, I probably would make my point like the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would keep it in proportion and I would not try to mix it up with my main argument.  Let us approach the problem on that basis and ask the <Col N="1692" /> fundamental question&mdash;why is this exemption included?  The reason is that if it were not the annuities, by virtue of the notional capitalisation of them provided for in the earlier section, would be aggregated for the purposes of wealth tax in the hands of the recipient of the annuity, the pensioner if you like, and if his thresholds were then exceeded he would be liable for wealth tax correspondingly.  That, I think, can be admitted as a fair interpretation of the section.  Therefore, these provisions are very correctly put in.  The problem left as a residuary is that there will be other members of the community and in our community, which has not yet gone like China, the whole way to administrative socialism, there will be many people who, when they come to retiring age, will have retiring benefits and annuities which, in equity and in actual practical effect, are retirement pensions but who will not have the reliefs in this section available to them.  This is where we reach the problem.  I cannot say to how many people this relief would be important.  That would depend both on the amount of their pension and on the amount of their property.  That is for an actuary to determine.  In the same way I cannot say how many people are in the category that I am talking about namely those who are, in effect, in receipt of annual income in a retirement situation and who are not in the class which is available for reliefs under section 7.  I may be labouring this but I hope I have made myself clear thus far to the Minister.  Having said that let me try to suggest what classes are involved and then follow the consequences of that.  The self-employed man, for instance, being self-employed, may accumulate a capital sum and on retirement live on that capital sum.  The annuity from that capital sum would be the direct equivalent of the annuities contemplated within subsection 1 of section 7.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a land owner.  I do not mean one of the wealthy landed classes, I mean somebody who earned his living on the land, who had property and who sold it but who kept either the whole of <Col N="1693" /> the proceeds, if he deemed it necessary, or part of the proceeds to form a fund for his retirement.  This man has an income from that fund.  It seems to me that that fund will not be exempt from wealth tax.  Let us just take the principle here.  You have a number of people like that.  This is a person at around the 65 years of age mark who capitalises, provides himself with an annuity, without the intervention of any other organisation. It seems to me in that case the sum involved is aggregated to wealth tax. Now staying with the present and recognising that that annuity does not become taxable in that sense, does not become equivalent of that until it exists, and recognising that the thing that would be taxable would be the capital sum supporting that annuity the first part of the case is that that annuity is aggregatable for wealth tax and one asks, in the circumstances, is that fair in principle?</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that if he has enough wealth to give him an annuity and also to breach the thresholds there is no reason why he should not.  The fallacy of that argument is that the capital sum which is supporting the annuity is being aggregated in the calculation of the total property taxable, whereas in the case of the exempted annuities under section 7 that is not so.  Let us take a specific case.  Suppose we take somebody in the scheme about which I have spoken and somebody outside the scheme, both in receipt of the same pension.  Suppose that the threshold in that case is £100,000&mdash; which would be the married man&mdash; in the case of the person in the scheme if he had £95,000 assessable wealth he would just escape wealth tax.  In the case of the other man if he was receiving a comparable annuity, and even taking the Minister's base of calculation and I will add £20,000, that would only give a pension of approximately £2,500, that would add £20,000 and would put him over the threshold.  So here would be two people who are at the same age, receiving the same pension, in effect, but one having the same taxable wealth without the pension being <Col N="1694" /> taken into account.  One, because of the provisions of this section, is not assessable to wealth tax because he is under the threshold and the other is paying wealth tax because he is over the threshold.  In that case one person is being taxed more in an equivalent position than the other.  I am purposely avoiding embellishing my own arguments to try to keep to the straight line, to which I have asked the Minister to keep, but I could talk about security and many other things. Those would be red herrings too.  Let us keep to the simple principle that we wish to treat all people equally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy take into consideration the fact that the person in the private sector is getting an annuity from capital which he owns?  In other words, he has capital which the person under the superannuation scheme in the public sector has not got.  In addition to the annuity he has got a big block of capital assets. That is a big difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential point to appreciate here is that, the man who is getting the voluntary pension has a block of money to support that, but remember, in most of the cases concerned, to build that up he was saving.  Leave out of consideration here inherited wealth and so on.  He has saved this money in his lifetime and now he is getting his pension out of it, what I call the voluntary pension. The Deputy is right as far as he goes. What the Deputy is forgetting is that in the case of the pension scheme I mentioned&mdash;and this goes right across the board, public or private&mdash;there has also been a saving.  In the case of a contributory scheme the actual contributor has been paying that money and it has been accumulated as a saving for him.  Where the employers, whether the State or a private company, have paid their contribution that has, in effect, been annual payment and in fact in the private sector, at least, directly so.  The accounting in the public sector is another matter but it is merely a matter of technical accountancy. This money has been saved so that notwithstanding the advantage there is in the public sector, mentioned <Col N="1695" /> by Deputy Colley, of being payment out of current revenue, and that is relevant to the inflation problem, or the difficulty in the private sector with insurance companies where you are paying for the future from contributions in the present in an inflationary position, but leaving that out, it is a fallacy to suppose that there is not a capital sum in the background supporting the other also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In practical terms it is very simple.  A, in the recognised pension scheme is in receipt of an annuity and that annuity is ignored for the purpose of wealth tax.  B, who has provided himself with an annuity which is on all fours with a pension under a scheme, has that pension supported by a sum of his own.  In one case it has a liability to tax, in principle anyway.  In the other case it has not.  Let us look at it this way.  In one case the annuity is supported either by an insurance company or by the State, and I am beginning to think that in the future, because of inflation, the State will probably have to intervene to support all pension schemes, but it is the State which is supporting it and admittedly the State does not want to tax itself.  The other man is taxed.</P>
      <P>I hope I have made the point as clear as I can.  I am not suggesting that there are answers to any arguments but at least I hope I have made that argument in a logical way and I hope that it has been understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it be too much to ask the Minister if he would listen to me for a moment?  He will not find me trying to trap him or anything like that.  I will try to develop a point which is not very easy to develop. There will be plenty of time to answer it.  I want to speak about what the Minister said on imaginary property.  There is no imaginary property involved on either side at the date on which the pension is being paid.  In one case in the scheme there has been an accumulation over the years of contributions from employer and employee, whether it is in the <Col N="1696" /> public or private sector, under a recognised scheme and that is captured by this section.  The big problem arising is the inflationary one, but, from an accounting point of view or from any financial approach, that is the situation. The pension is not being plucked from the air; it is being paid out of property.  Take an assurance company, for instance, that is paying an annuity in a case in the private sector. It is paying out of funds collected over the years in contributions largely invested and getting the biggest return, the company averaging out over all the factors concerned.  Specious arguments can be made about the State and the fact that money is being paid out of current revenue but essentially the principle is the same.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that my argument so far stands up.  I am not making it in any contentious sense.  I am making it as objectively as I can.  Then the problem is: &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; At this stage I take the Minister's point about property in the present.  In the case of the person who for the simplicity of my argument I am taking to be totally dependent on that pension you could say that that pension is equivalent to what would be a pension within the meaning of the Act and treat it as such.  At that stage you could exempt the capital sum <i>pro tanto</i> for as much and in that way you would solve the problem.  We did not put down an amendment for that but, just to tease out the problem, you could do that.  You could ask, has this man at this age retired?  Is he receiving an annuity that is equivalent to, say, the pension in the firm I mentioned, taking that as a standard which would be practically equivalent to the public service in some regards, at least so far as the amount would be concerned?  You could say: &ldquo;We will disregard the capital supporting that annuity to the extent to which that annuity could be <i>bona fide</i> considered as a pension.&rdquo;  This is a clear, concrete proposal.  I can see there is difficulty in it.</P>
    <P>First of all, there is the question of age.  I understand the Minister's problem. He would have to fix an age at which it would happen.  The Minister <Col N="1697" /> has made great play of the point that somebody in the public service has to retire at a certain age.  It is a valid point as far as it goes but it is not completely valid.  How many retired people in either the public or the private sector not only have their pensions but have some additional post? It has not been unknown for people who are in receipt of their pensions to find, not additional employment in the sense of 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock working hours, but to have been appointed to boards or to be in receipt of remuneration from various sources.  It has not been unknown for a man to retire from one post with his pension and to work in another.  There were branches of the public service, like the Army, where the retiring age was early and where people in receipt of a pension got new employment.  So the Minister's argument on that point is not quite as sound as it would seem at first sight. There are many people in receipt of pensions who are supplementing their pensions with additional earnings. That, of course, is a matter for the income tax authorities.</P>
    <P>I mention this point because of the contention the Minister made about the self-employed man.  One of the reasons that make me hesitant about a limited suggestion I made a moment ago is the difficulty of implementation because, quite obviously, it would be antisocial and wrong and very typically totalitarian to try to introduce the principle that if a person had a pension he could not do any other work.  We had this old-fashioned idea operating in the case of certain State pensions which constantly came before the House in previous years and it was difficult to get away from what seemed to be a principle.  We do not want to go back to those bad old days.  It will be common case if we say that whether a pensioner sits back and enjoys his pension or decides that life is still worth living and goes on making an effort is a matter for himself and he should be encouraged in whatever way he makes his decision.  I think we agree on that.  This is a difficulty all right.  I am stressing that point because the Minister's statement was a little over-elaborated.  Had he left out some <Col N="1698" /> of the trimmings the essential point would have come over more clearly.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the question of imaginary property, there is no imaginary property involved on either side. I do concede the Minister this: he is quite right when he says we are not dealing with future property, we are dealing with property vested.  The solution that I have suggested, namely, that if a self-employed man, a professional man, who was not in a scheme that is covered by this subsection were to provide himself with a pension by providing over his lifetime a capital sum or else by selling assets at the retiring age to provide himself with an annuity, that annuity should be treated as an annuity under that section.  It might not be too hard to meet the case that far, and that would ensure then that all pensions were treated the same.  I appear to be repeating myself here because I want to make it clear-cut at this point before coming to the next stage of the argument. In so far as a pensioner is concerned in receipt of an annuity the position is clear: he is covered by this.  In so far as a person who has been self-employed or not within a scheme has provided for his future by way of an annuity then the capital sum supporting that annuity could be given the same exemption as is in this section.  To that extent a certain amount of equity would be done notwithstanding some of the difficulties that I mentioned in the process.</P>
    <P>But now I wonder can I come to what was really our first point and puts Deputy Colley's argument in perspective here, and that is the method of accumulation of that fund.  May I repeat?  Has the Minister got my point now?  Up to this I have been with the Minister and I have said nothing arises until the annuity is payable and being paid and we are only treating the capital sum supporting the annuity.  That is one argument. But now let us see the second one. I am sorry to be so long about this. I hope the Minister will bear with me, but it is not easy to tease out a problem like this and to keep it logical. The difficulty we started about arises precisely at this point.  This is <Col N="1699" /> why Deputy Colley was forced to resort to the capitalisation value of annuities in this argument.  It happens like this.  In the case of the contributory pension, say, the pension scheme within the Finance Act in the case of the firm which I mentioned, over the years annual contributions have been made&mdash;and the Minister will have to forgive me if for a moment I have to talk about the income tax side of equity, but it is all taxation&mdash;over the years these sums have been paid and have got a tax benefit in the accumulation.  They are available for relief and, as I have pointed out, the pensions payable under the scheme are supported by a capital sum albeit it is a limited interest within the meaning of this Act because it is in the hands of the insurance company, but that capital sum has been accumulated by contribution from employer and employee and there have been, in fact, tax reliefs. Take the case of the man that I am talking about, whether he is the farmer or property man selling out, whether he is the small businessman that has been so ably defended right through all these discussions and represented by Deputy Fitzpatrick of this side of the House or whether he is the self-employed man that has featured so much in our arguments, that man in accumulating a surplus has probably not only got reliefs but he is being fully taxed for income tax on it.  But when it comes to the collection of his wealth, the aggregation of the wealth, and particularly if he has to realise even with the 55 years provision&mdash;I think it is in the Capital Gains Act&mdash;he is actually at a disadvantage already and, in so far as he has been trying to save, all his savings are aggregated for the purposes of all these capital Acts.</P>
    <P>Again, do not let us get involved in the application of thresholds or not, because I think we should be as fair to the man who exceeds the thresholds as to the man who is poor enough to be within the thresholds.  In these inflationary days I am wondering what these thresholds will really amount to in a short while.  The effect of this thing is that the capital sum in its <Col N="1700" /> accumulation has been&mdash;&ldquo;unfairly&rdquo; is hardly the word&mdash;but there has been a discrimination in taxation adversely affecting him as compared with those who are in the pension scheme appropriate to a firm or to the public sector.</P>
    <P>This is the point where we got confused over time.  It is here that one has to look at the flow of time and look at the present in the sense of the present now, the present of the man in the pre-retiral period.  This is the relevance of Deputy Colley's first calculation of sums supporting pensions particularly with regard to inflation. This is the relevance of it.  Deputy Colley's point in a nutshell is this: if the self-employed man or the man retiring by selling his property or his business were to have a sum to provide for a comparable pension he would all that time in doing it be paying a wealth tax and to that extent the actual sum available for supporting the pension would be reduced or milked for taxation purposes, in a way that, those schemes under Acts of the Oireachtas or authorised by them would not.  This is the relevance of Deputy Colley's point here, and this is the importance of bringing in the capitalisation.  This has been the essence of the whole argument.</P>
    <P>The last thing I would say is this: there is an in-between area.  There is the person with the insufficient pension. Suppose there is a late entry to a scheme, or something like that, and that man wishes to support his pension to make up the deficiency.  There are many people in the middle executive range both in business and in the State service who are prudent and thrifty enough to provide for supplementing their pensions by annuities. This is a case that, in principle, is exactly the same thing but it is only <i>pro tanto</i> for how much.  They come into this argument too.  I emphasise that because everybody seems to think we are talking only about the self-employed man.</P>
    <P>I have spoken for a long time on this section and I apologise to the House for doing so but I think I have been completely relevant to the provisions of the section and to what the Minister has said.  I would ask the Minister to accept our <i>bona fides</i> and have an <Col N="1701" /> open mind about the problems we are posing.  We will also have an open mind to the difficulties and the logical answer to this.  Neither side should assume that the other is either not serious about it, or blind about it. There is a genuine problem here and the question is, can it be met and how far it can be met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the Minister's example in the case being made by Deputy de Valera.  The Minister took an example, which is a valid one, that if an individual wishes to retire and has the capital he can provide himself with a pension equivalent to that of a Department secretary retiring on £5,600 with a sum of £40,000 if he purchases current national loan standing at 80 or 100 which would provide him with £5,600. One of the cases we are making is that the discrimination lies in the fact that that £5,600 would only be £5,600 for One year.  If, as in the example given by Deputy Colley before we adjourned, capital is to be subject to an inflationary rate, or a cost-of-living rise of 15 per cent, that £5,600 at the end of five years will be worth £2,600 and at the end of ten years it will be down to around £1,000.  In the case of a Minister, or a TD, or a public servant, any of the public service categories, Army, Garda, health officials, the position is that the pension will start at the rate applicable but, at the end of the first year, if there is an increase in the cost of living, that pension will be increased accordingly and in subsequent years.  Presumably it will not be increased on the basis of the superannuation fund but rather it will be increased by the taxpayer in two years' time, five years' time, or ten years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on this side of the House, as Deputy Colley has said, welcome the fact that retired public servants have this advantage and this benefit.  What we are querying is that no provision is being made under this Bill whereby the individual who has to provide for his own retirement will not be disadvantaged. As far as I understand it, if an individual retires and puts the substantial sum the Minister speaks <Col N="1702" /> of in, say, national loan, it will still qualify as part of this property.  If his property exceeds the threshold, he will be taxed on it, despite the fact that year after year it will depreciate.  If the Minister is making the case that to provide the substantial pension mentioned by him an individual only requires £40,000, if he does a simple sum he will find that if that individual expects to live for five years, it is not £40,000 he needs but £70,000.  If he should live for ten years, it is not £40,000 he needs but something in the range of £100,000, unless he is to be faced with a substantial reduction in his standard of living, a reduction comparable with the figures I have quoted.  Starting at £5,600, with an inflationary rate of 15 per cent he would end up with something a little over £1,000 a year in value terms.</P>
    <P>That is a problem a retiring individual has to face anyway.  He can do it probably if he is fortunate enough to be able to buy leasehold property which has fairly short review periods of two years, three years or five years, so that with the fall in the value of money he can increase the rent incomes available to him. The fact is that in comparison with the former Minister, or present Minister, or the Deputy, or any of the range of public servants, what he provides himself for his retirement will be taxable under this Bill, and what we may get by way of retirement in the line of pension which will be, we hope, increased each year in accordance with the fall in the value of money, will not be so applicable.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that there is a case in equity.  I agree there are problems, but I do not think problems of this kind should be glossed over by trying to compare like with like when it is really like with unlike.  It could end up with those who are being treated as like&mdash;ourselves and the various categories of public servants&mdash;being, shall we say, happy socialists.  In effect what we are saying to the individual who is providing the energy and the enterprise is: &ldquo;We do not make any provision for you.&rdquo;  Barring the very large fortunate companies, we are not making provision for the individual who, in <Col N="1703" /> fact, is creating wealth whether it is in farming or in industry.  The Minister should at least agree to take a look at it before Report Stage because there is an obvious disadvantage under this Bill for the private individual who wishes to make provision for his own retirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to labour this point unduly.  Deputy de Valera has given a thorough exposition of what is involved in this problem.  He has exemplified the practical problems involved.  Deputy Brugha put his finger on the real problem involved for the self-employed or the businessman.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's effort to avoid the allegation of discrimination, he fell back on the argument that, if this is discrimination, there are other areas of discrimination as well in the Bill and we should also have been arguing about them.  Could I point out to the Minister that, in the case of the dwelling house to which he referred, a person is not trying to live on the proceeds of his dwelling house.  At least in the normal way he is not.  It is where he lives.</P>
      <P>The realities of the situation are that he has a house, be it large or small, but he has to get his income from some other source.  Therefore, the house and the question of whether you exempt a large and a small one at the same time and therefore there is discrimination, is largely irrelevant to the realities of this problem.</P>
      <P>The other examples he mentioned, such as exemption of bloodstock and livestock in certain cases, are productive assets.  The failure to exempt productive assets from wealth tax is one of the gravest failures of this Bill The fact that some productive assets are being exempted and others are not should not be put forward as an argument to show that we did not protest against discrimination in that regard. The Minister knows we urged very strongly that all productive assets should be exempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said we were talking about imaginary property.  I found that argument somewhat disturbing.  It seemed to me to suggest a certain line <Col N="1704" /> of thinking that, if somebody is a member of a superannuation scheme&mdash; let us say he is 55 and he will retire at 65&mdash;at age 55 he does not have anything so far as that pension scheme is concerned.  Of course there is the present value for his rights under that pension scheme.  It is based on a particular lump sum.  From the moment he becomes entitled to that pension, or even entitled to a refund of contributions, then his position under the scheme has a present value.  That is the reality of the situation.  It may even be that, technically on the wording of paragraph (e), it comes within the section as amended.  If there is a present value and somebody who is entitled to a pension under a superannuation scheme thinks or suggests that he does not have wealth arising directly out of his rights under the superannuation scheme, he is simply fooling himself.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned to hear the Minister put forward as part of his argument what sounded ominously like the argument that such a person does not have any wealth until he gets his pension and then all he has is his pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister has missed the point.  The question of bloodstock or no bloodstock is that for reasons best known to the Government they decided to exempt bloodstock.  I do not object to that because bloodstock is a productive asset.  All productive assets should be exempt.  That is not an argument for saying that we should ignore the position of a self-employed person, or somebody entitled to superannuation. It should now be clear that there is not equal treatment involved in so far <Col N="1705" /> as retirement and superannuation are concerned for, on the one hand, those in the public sector and, on the other, those in the private sector.  I am not suggesting that the problem is easy of solution.  I am suggesting that an attempt can be made to solve the problem which would go a long way to getting some degree of equality in the treatment.  There is an obligation on the Minister to try to achieve that equality as far as he can.  Having regard to all of these factors and the consequences which can arise due to failure to do so, I urge the Minister very strongly to give consideration to this between now and Report Stage, to see if he can come up with a solution which, while it might not be perfect, will at least show that an attempt has been made and that recognition has been given to the position of the person in the private sector <i>vis-á-vis</i> that of the person in the public sector.</P>

      <P>On this imaginary property question, it is a fact that, in the scheme I took as my norm, if somebody leaves the scheme there is a refund of the contributions.  Very frequently that refund is apportioned as between the company and the individual. Sometimes the company will give all the contributions to the individual concerned.  The accumulated contributions are refunded.  The fact that interest is not refunded with them is one of the devices by which the supporting institution, very often an insurance company, provides itself with excess funds or profits.  It is not right to talk about imaginary property, whether in the public sector&mdash;I bracket the firm as the public sector&mdash;or in the self-employed case.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am afraid we have got away a considerable distance from section 7 (1) (e) which exempts superannuation arrangements from wealth tax.  It exempts the capital value of those superannuation arrangements.  This paragraph exempts superannuation schemes arising out of the terms and conditions of a person's employment. Some schemes arose perhaps 40 years ago when a person entered into employment. Those were the conditions <Col N="1706" /> upon which they entered into employment either in the private sector or the public sector.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Colley and Deputy de Valera, and the other Deputies involved, are not making any conflict or controversy between the public sector and the private sector.  They are basing their argument on superannuation schemes of one level and another. They are drawing a distinction between a person who is entitled to superannuation on retirement and a person who is not.</P>
      <P>In my opinion no discrimination arises under this exemption beyond the discrimination that arises out of any exemptions.  If one grants exemptions there will be people who are entitled to them, and people who are not entitled to them.  There will be people who are entitled to greater and lesser exemptions in the same category.  To that extent there is discrimination, but there is no other discrimination arising under this provision.  To the extent that any argument put up by the Opposition will be considered between now and Report Stage, this will be considered, but I do not concede that any valid case has been made for the introduction of any amendment and alteration to this on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to drag on this debate on this point any longer, because if I were to do so I would consider I would not be acting in the best interests of the House or in the best interests of the Opposition.  I might even be accused of extending one section of what is now a limited debate. I have made my point as clearly as I can both in a general way and in a considered and reasoned way.  I will have to leave it to a vote of the House to decide.  I suppose that is a foregone conclusion, but if posterity want to raise the argument later on they are welcome to do so and to pass judgment on it.</P>

      <P>There are a few technical points I want to raise on the section.  The first relates to the one we have been discussing, paragraph (e). There is a list in the section of items which will not be treated as taxable wealth.  Paragraph (e) reads:</P>
      <P>the right to receive any benefit or any annuity or periodic payment&mdash; under any scheme&mdash;</P>
      <P>What is exempt there is the right to receive any benefit or any annuity as distinct from the benefit or the annuity itself, particularly the benefit.  The benefit could, it seems to me, be easily read as meaning the capital sum to which I was referring earlier.  It seems that it is possible, on the wording of this, that such capital sum might not in fact be exempt.  I want the Minister to consider the wording of it in this way, &ldquo;any benefit or any annuity or periodic payment or the right to receive same under&rdquo; and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the same thing. What is being exempted is the right to receive.  I am suggesting both the right and the benefit itself.  Supposing it is an annuity, the benefit of the right to receive the annuity could be deemed to be the capital sum, the capital value of that annuity.  What seems to be exempted here is the right to receive it.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The right to receive the annuity is <Col N="1708" /> exempt.  The periodic payment is clearly exempt, both the right to receive it and when he is receiving it.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on what is meant by the right to receive a benefit under one of these schemes&mdash;whether that means simply the receipt of a pension each month or whether it means, as I suspect it could mean, the capital value of that right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I make the point a little more specific in this way? Take again the scheme I took as the norm for my argument, the public company, and something analogous would apply in the public service.  The normal thing is that a person at retiring age, say, 65, receives his annuity.  If it is a State or State-authorised scheme that is clearly covered, but three other possibilities arise.  On the date of retirement in many schemes&mdash;I am not quite clear whether this applies in the case of the Civil Service but a gratuity might be in this category&mdash;there is often an <Col N="1709" /> option under the Finance Acts to take a lump sum and a lesser pension.  Is the lump sum exempt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is exempt until he gets it and then it becomes part of his wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that anybody, when they come to retiring age and have the option of taking a lump sum, will have to think twice, even though it may be to make a provision for a disabled child.  Take a typical case of an executive in one of these pension schemes who, at retiring age has the option of taking say, £10,000 and cutting his pension to half and he wants that £10,000 for a specific purpose.  Again, do not complicate the issue by bringing in the other Acts and the exemptions because they are related or anything.  It might be, talking about pure merit, the hard cases.  Do not let our ingenuity come to give answers of this sort; let us take the essence of the argument. There are cases of unrelated people whom a lot of us might want to help. Let me take it, there is a merit.  In taking the lump sum this wealth tax comes into play.  Therefore, in taking the wealth tax the benefit once paid is aggregated for wealth.  Is that what that means?  The section says:</P>
      <P>Tax shall not be payable in respect of the following property and such property shall not be taxable wealth&mdash;</P>
      <P>(e)  the right to receive any benefit or any annuity or periodic payment&mdash;</P>
      <P>It seems that the benefit is not taxable wealth, that it stands apart as long as it stays indentifiable as the benefit.  I am making a legal case here, but if benefit is on the same footing as the other alternatives in the paragraph, &ldquo;or any annuity or periodic payment&rdquo;, then as long as the benefit is identifiable as the sum it is in precisely the same category.  I would be prepared to argue that in court.  That may be an unintended interpretation.</P>

      <P>Could I refer the Minister to paragraph (j) of subsection (l) as the Bill was printed?  I know the Minister has introduced an amendment which puts in a new paragraph (j) but the original paragraph starts:</P>
      <P>Shares in a private non-trading company...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister brought in amendment No. 9, which has the effect of taking a private non-trading company out of section 5 provided it is controlled by a trading company.  That is a fair interpretation of what the amendment does. Therefore, it leaves the assets of that private non-trading company to be <Col N="1711" /> taxed in the hands of the shareholders of the trading company which controls the non-trading company.  This paragraph makes the shares in a non-trading company non-taxable.  Are the shareholders in the trading company which controls a non-trading company to be taxed on the value of the assets or the value of the shares in the non-trading company?</P>

If they are to be taxed on the value of the assets in the non-trading company that is one basis of approach, but if they are to be taxed on the value of the shares in the non-trading company there is a distinction, as the Minister knows, between an asset basis and a share basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought. There is one other matter I want to raise.  This section exempts certain property from wealth tax effectively. Some of the items exempted such as livestock, subject to the conditions I have mentioned, and bloodstock are presumably exempted because of their effect as productive assets, in agriculture in the case of livestock, and generally in the economy in the case of bloodstock.  An effort is made in a subsequent section to give some relatively minor reductions in liability in the case of some other productive assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have sought, in an amendment, <Col N="1713" /> to have all productive assets, as defined in the Bill, exempt from wealth tax.  The Government and their supporters on the other side of the House have voted down that proposal.  In exempting various items as listed here and other things added in afterwards and not exempting all productive assets on which our growth and the provision of employment depends, the Government's whole thinking on this wealth tax, particularly in our present economic circumstances, is crazy.  The effect of what we are doing is to take away with one hand what the Government are giving with the other in the way of a £12 employment premium per week per job for those getting employment off the unemployment register.  According to the Minister's interpretation of the Bill, we are giving exemption from wealth tax to foreign owners of Irish assets who are competing with Irish owners, in the case of hotels, supermarkets and factories and various other aspects of our economy.  When we take account of that it should become totally clear, I would have thought by now to all the Deputies on the other side, that if you must have a wealth tax the only sensible thing to do is to exempt from the wealth tax all assets which are productively employed, all assets which are being used to create and maintain employment and to create growth in our economy.  Anything else, at this time, cannot make sense to anybody.  In the light of the failure of this section to exempt from wealth tax productive assets employed in our economy&mdash;which we tried to have exempted and which the Government have failed to do&mdash;I cannot support this section.</P>

      <P>Or else establish new churches.  While endorsing what Deputy Colley said, I should like to bring one further point to the Minister's attention on paragraph (i).  Here the Minister exempts pictures, prints, books, manuscripts, works of art, jewellery, scientific collections and so on on three conditions, the third of which is that reasonable facilities for viewing are allowed to members of the public or recognised bodies or associations.  It is quite clear what the Minister is doing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many wellmotivated people who have used their wealth to accumulate artistic treasures or collections.  Although they themselves have not been, say, directly engaged in art and science and humanity generally they have devoted their wealth to such a purpose. It is proper that this type of exemption should be given and, indeed, there is one very important collection in this country that has come about through the very laudable activity of a particular person.  There is one case that is not covered which should be <Col N="1715" /> covered, which is books.  I am leaving out professional men.  It is very difficult to draw a distinction between a barrister and the type of person I am talking about&mdash;but there are people who are either actively engaged&mdash;in art or science or study of any nature&mdash;let us call them scholars&mdash;who are personally and genuinely devoting themselves to study, sometimes in a voluntary way.  I am particularly thinking of professional scholars who have retired and are still pursuing their scholarship.  We have had eminent scientists and literary men and artists who have, as part of their necessary scholarship, the tools of their trade, books or material.  Take the case of books.  A scholar in a particular line may over the years have collected a large number of books in his own speciality, be he an academic lawyer, a scientist or a person interested in literature and so on.  Provided he is an active scholar&mdash;I mean that it is not just a collection; what is covered here in the section is a collection&mdash;it is right that an exemption should be made for the benefit of the community.  It is his contribution to art or learning that matters, and what is concerned is essentially the tools of his trade.  Over a period of years he will have collected perhaps a unique collection of documents, books, manuscripts and so on, which may have considerable value; he requires them for the furtherance of his study, and he is contributing to the community.  Anyone who adds to the total of human knowledge is making a community contribution.</P>
    <P>If a man has accumulated books and if he is a genuine scholar, he should be exempt from wealth tax because some of the things he has could make a substantial contribution to the community.  I am talking now only in terms of the wealth tax; I am not relating this to the capital acquisitions tax or anything like that where the personal element has gone out of it.  Such a person might be a wellcircumstanced person, but nevertheless could be making a contribution of a sort that should be exempt here. I ask the Minister to exempt him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> Take the case of the retired professional scholar; I had better dispose of the income tax argument straight away.  There would have to be a provision to the effect that no claim in respect of income tax relief on the said property is allowed or where there is a claim there would be an election, because it is quite clear that if he were using it for the purpose of a trade or profession a claim to income tax relief might arise.  I am not asking for double relief here.  I am asking that in the genuine case there would be an election.  There could be a barrister or a university professor, and not only a retired person, who could make a claim for income tax relief, but there should be no double relief; that principle is admitted.  The furthest I would go there is to make it a question of election, which might possibly be important.  There may be retired persons, or more important still, there are amateurs.  There was one very distinguished civil servant, for instance, who contributed to scholarship. That was quite a common occurrence in the past.  There could be a retired barrister and also the genuinely scholarly amateur.  Over the years a substantial sum may be accumulated, particularly, as everybody knows, the price of books has become so great that there is the problem of publishing books of that nature.  There is plenty of pop stuff, but serious works and even serious literature is a problem.  I would ask the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <P>To go back a few centuries, there is the case of Cavendish, one of the most eminent scientists in the history of physics, who was a wealthy man. He contributed very greatly to science, and if he were living in this day it would be a reasonable plea to say that the paraphernalia and the library that enabled him to make this contribution to human progress should be available.  The problem here is one of reasonable facilities.  In the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, if there is a genuine scholar and a genuine asset, provided there is no double taxation relief in income tax, some relief should be given to that person.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Colley referred to exemptions of livestock and bloodstock and availed of that to say that all productive assets should be exempt.  I do not want to prolong this debate.  I could, but it would not be reasonable for the Government side of the House to encroach on the debate any more than is necessary.  But I want to say that I am satisfied and I believe that the public are satisfied that productive assets in this Bill have been treated generously.  Productive assets in agriculture have received as <Col N="1718" /> generous treatment as was possible. Productive assets in trading companies are granted a special treatment and that is fully recognised.  Furthermore, not alone have we exempted specific assets but we have gone further and we have taken the unprecedented step of giving preferential treatment to shares in trading companies. This is an unprecedented step in the field of wealth tax, and it is appreciated not alone here but also abroad and it is appreciated in countries like Britain from where we might expect investment.  I do not want to burden the House with lengthy quotations from foreign writers I will just give one quotation from the <i>New Law Journal,</i> 3rd July, 1975, which says:</P>
      <P>However, relief also applies to stocks and shares of trading companies, whether public or private, listed or unlisted.  Capital can thus take heart that the Irish Government have equated the ownership of shares with the direct provision of employment.</P>
      <P>That is not done in the proposed British code of wealth tax.</P>
      <P>I am not going to have a Second Reading debate on this again but I am tempted to do so every time Deputy Colley tries to introduce this. It is a fact that if we are to have a wealth tax at all&mdash;and it is agreed in principle that we should have it&mdash; then this Bill has treated everyone fairly and in a way that is encouraging production, whether it is production in agriculture or in the industrial sector, and we give preferential treatment to shares in trading companies in the hands of investors.  There is ample evidence of that and it is recognised by people in Britain who think it worth their while to sit down and think about our Bill and the proposed code in Britain and compare the two of them, who think it worthwhile to sit down and commit their thoughts, comparisons and their analyses to paper.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am trying to point out the particular people at whom this Bill is directed.  I want to find out the people who are exempt from wealth tax.  All unions, irrespective of what type of business they pursue, are exempt. Semi-State bodies, which are also running business in this country, will be exempt.  Foreigners, who are quite at liberty to come to this country, invest their money, let it be in hotels, supermarkets, factories, will also be exempt from wealth tax.  But there is one section of people that will not be exempt from wealth tax. and that is Irish people born in this country, who have lived here and worked here and used their finance in building a factory or building up a business, let it be a hotel or any other type of industries.  Those are the men that this Bill is directed at.  That is what I want to make perfectly clear to any Irishman in this country, that he is taxed and that we have these lists of exemptions.  That is what I object to, as I said before.  As a citizen of this country I object to being discriminated against and that is what the Minister has done.  Many people are not aware that foreigners are exempt, as are all types of union property, irrespective of whether it is dancehalls or office blocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with and I welcome the fact that all Church property, schools and religious institutions are exempt.  But I object to the fact that we have here discrimination against an Irish person living in this country.  Any incentive will be considerably dampened when he looks at the implications of this Bill and when he sees that foreigners in this country owning property side by side with him, trading under the very same circumstances, with whom he has to remain competitive are exempt.  He is going to be placed at a disadvantage as regards this Bill.  Irrespective of whether we like it or not, this is going to make it much more difficult for him to hold on to his property, especially the type of business that is <Col N="1723" /> operating on a very tight margin.  We will see more and more of this type of business, especially supermarkets, getting into the hands of foreign shareholders. We will see far more people forming foreign companies.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will say if they are domiciled here they are caught. If there is sufficient money involved, I can assure the Minister that there are people in this country who will get around it very easily.  The loophole is here for them if they do not want to be domiciled in this country. If there is a substantial amount of money involved in wealth tax where an Irish person is concerned at the moment I believe there is a way in the Bill to evade that liability, which would be most undesirable where this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>These are the particular aspects which I dislike in the Bill.  I do not think the average medium-sized businessman would involve himself in the type of operation I am talking about but the bigger person will do so.  The average-sized businessman under £200,000 will remain here and he is the person who will be caught for this tax.  There is no way out for him.  He is a man who probably has lived in this country all his life, his children have been reared here and he is going to be subject to wealth tax while the larger business is going to find some way out of it.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not propose to raise the temperature of the debate but I do feel compelled to say that it is immaterial to the Government side of the House whether this section concludes now or whether it concludes at 2.15 p.m. on Thursday.  Personally I would not like to see it dragging on until 2.15 p.m. on Thursday, I would rather have an opportunity of going through the Bill section by section having a reasonable discussion on it within the time limit which I consider ample, but if the Opposition insist on getting up and making speeches on sections <Col N="1724" /> which were appropriate, if at all, on the Second Stage or on section 2&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I want to tell my namesake, Deputy Fitzpatrick, that the object of this Bill is not to squeeze small- or medium-sized people.  It is to collect, after giving generous exemptions, a sum which has been variously named at £3 million to £1,500,000 from comparatively wealthy people at the rate of 1 per cent, with a threshold of £100,000.  That is being collected in lieu of a payment by families in this country of £13 million death duties per year.  That is the fact of the argument and there is no getting away from it.  I do not believe we are dealing with exemptions here.  I put it to the House that generous exemptions are given with regard to agriculture, livestock, bloodstock, the individual who has his private house and the contents exempt, which does not happen elsewhere.  Furthermore, I repeat that trading companies and the assets of trading companies are exempt as are trade unions.  I make no apology to this House for exempting trade unions.  Trade unions fought over the years for their rights to represent workers and represent their members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Having been told that they were not taxed the Deputy seemed to go on and develop his argument from there with a view, I regret to say, of trying to set one section of this nation against another.  I do not think that is in the interest of this nation at any time.  It is certainly not in the interest of this nation at the present time.  As I say, Church buildings are exempt, schools are exempt.  It should not be necessary to ask that.  They are exempt from income tax.  They are not exempt from death duties because the owner never dies; the owner of a church or a school lives in perpetuity. He does not die; therefore he is not <Col N="1725" /> liable to death duties, nor is he liable to wealth tax.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Fitzpatrick speaks about shareholders being liable to wealth tax, they are liable to wealth tax if all their assets including their shares reach a threshold of £100,000 if the person is married and £70,000 if he is single, having in each case disregarded his dwellinghouse and disregarded the contents.</P>
      <P>I have an information booklet here from Cement Roadstone Limited and there are in that company 11,300 shareholders.  Without going into mathematics or trying to divide that up, it will be very easy to see that if you divide the wealth of Cement Roadstone among 11,300 people you will get about £15,000 per head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that Deputy Fitzpatrick's argument and the Opposition's arguments have run out and that the people now accept that there is no terror in wealth tax.  He would try to get them to believe that each shareholder in Cement Roadstone and every productive company in this country is liable to wealth tax.  Of course that is not the case.  There is a threshold in every case of £100,000 if a man is married plus his dwellinghouse, plus the contents of it; £70,000 if he is not married.  I do not know what standard of authority he is but the writer in the <i>New Law Journal</i> is somebody who is looking in from outside, who has thought it worth his while to get our Bill and read it, study it and compare it with the Green Paper and the British proposals.  His reaction is not that we are crippling productive assets here, not that we are doing something that will drive people away, but he is constrained to say that we are equating shares with productive assets.  That is something that I am not holding out as the ultimate in authority but I am quoting that as somebody looking in from outside, living in a country where it is proposed to impose wealth tax, a country which is imposing wealth tax, and drawing a comparison between the two countries.  His reaction is that we have been lenient on productive assets.  I am not going to go back to <Col N="1726" /> Deputy Colley's letter but it is there on the record of this House.  It is as clear as A B C that Mr. Frank Reilly in writing to Deputy Colley was speaking about American corporations investing money here.  That man wrote that letter on the basis that such corporations were going to be taxed here.  For the last four or five days Deputy Fitzpatrick has been running the argument against me on the basis that such corporations and such shares are not going to be taxed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This is part of the letter quoted.  I quote from the Official Report of 10th June, 1975:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under normal circumstances I would hesitate to comment publicly on tax proposals now pending before your legislative body.  But, as <Col N="1727" /> I view it, the damage that may result from the enactment of these measures justifies that I speak out. The Capital Gains Tax Bill, 1975 and the Wealth Tax Bill, 1975 to the extent that they affect shareholders who do not reside in Ireland are the latest in a series of economic measures which are inconsistent with the promises made by the Government to leaders of the Council to strengthen its policy of encouraging American companies to establish industrial facilities in Ireland.  Among the factors which have encouraged American companies to make industrial investments in Ireland are the undertaking made on behalf of the Government that for specified periods profits from sales of industrial products outside Ireland would be tax free and that both profits and investments could be freely removed from Ireland without penalty or limitation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the current tide of legislation which goes counter to these undertakings would seriously undermine the effectiveness of the Council as a recruitor of American investors for Ireland.  I suggest to you that the permanent damage to this recruiting programme would far outweigh the benefit of any additional revenue which might be produced by these tax proposals as they relate to American industrial investors and their shareholders.</P>
    <P>That can only refer to American corporations, and Deputy Colley quoted it in this House as evidence of the terror which had been driven into the hearts of American industrial corporations.  I believe that when the Committee Stage of this debate commenced Deputy Colley genuinely thought that those companies were being taxed.  Otherwise he would not have produced that letter as evidence of the terror which has entered the minds of those people.  That letter was written by this foreign industrialist to a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, a former Minister for Finance and spokesman for Finance <Col N="1728" /> at the moment.  I only hope that since this debate Deputy Colley saw fit to write to this industrialist, Mr. Frank Reilly, and explain to him what is involved in this measure and point out to him that American corporations investing in trading companies here and holding shares in those companies are exempt.  That is the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the letter from Mr. Frank Reilly is concerned the Minister glossed over the fact that it referred both to the wealth tax and the capital gains tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I said both.  In regard to the wealth tax the position is that if the Minister has a particular interpretation or particular words in this Bill, and assures the House that American residents who are shareholders in American trading companies holding assets in this country will not be liable to wealth tax in this country, of course we accept that.  But, as we pointed out before, the interpretation on which the Minister relies is somewhat stretched but we accept it when the Minister speaks with the authority that is vested in him.  It does not cover the situation in regard to the type of case I mentioned, for instance, the private non-trading company which has holdings here.  The Minister relies on a list published by the IDA which is not purporting to set out the legal position as to how each American-owned company operating here is legally constituted. It does not cover that.  The Minister said we have this outside view which shows how enlightened we are in this country that we were making some concessions in regard to double assets.  It may be very heartening to hear the view of some anonymous writer from Britain writing in a legal journal.  That is not the problem with which the Minister is concerned now. His problem is the question to which the Irish people want to know the answer.  Why, in our circumstances, given the appalling rate of our employment and the contraction in our <Col N="1729" /> economy and all the other ills to which we are subject, do this Government propose to apply a wealth tax to productive assets?  These are the only assets on which we can rely in order to get us out of the present economic situation.</P>

I do not wish in any way to stretch it, but having regard to what we heard from the Minister I would suggest that I am entitled to refer to the consequences of this section.  It purports to exempt certain property. When the Minister has told us and was allowed to tell us that the reason why wealth tax is being introduced is to replace death duties I think I am entitled to point out to the Minister that wealth tax does not replace death duties.  Inheritance tax, which is death duties by another name, and gift tax replace death duties.  Wealth tax and capital gains tax do not replace it. The Minister and the Minister for Finance are trying to do a three-card trick with these three Bills.  Whenever they are cornered they say that whichever particular one happens to suit them is replacing death duties.</P>

      <P>Is é cuspóir an Bhille seo ná uasteorainn na n-airleacan ón bPríomhChiste do Ghaeltarra Éireann a ardú ó £10 milliún go £25 mhilliún. Uasteorainn £500,000 a bhí ann ar dtús faoin gcéad Acht um Thionscail na Gaeltachta a ritheadh sa bhliain 1957 agus tá sí á hardú don cheathrú huair anois.  Cuireadh go dtí £2 mhilliún í sa bhliain 1965, go dtí £6 mhilliún sa bhliain 1971 agus go dtí £10 milliún anuraidh.  Ós gearr go mbeidh an £4 mhilliún a údaraíodh anuraidh íoctha amach is mithid socrú a dhéanamh ionas go bhféadfar tuilleadh fós a eisiúint.  Mar sin, tá £15 mhilliún bhreise á chur leis an uasteorainn faoin mBille seo.  Caithfear thart ar £2 mhilliún de sin i mbliana&mdash;anuas are £2,855,000 faoin tseanteorainn, is é sin, beagnach £5 mhilliún san iomlán i 1975.</P>
      <P>Caiteachas caipitil ar fad atá i gceist sna hairleacain a eisítear díreach chuig Gaeltarra as an bPríomh-Chiste.  I láthair na huaire caitear beagnach dhá thrian den chaipiteal sin ar mhonarchana lena gcur ar cíos do thionscail nua; caitear beagnach trian eile ar scaireanna i gcomhthionscail nua a nglacann Gaeltarra páirt iontu; agus is ar na tionscail atá á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra féin is mó a chaitear an fuílleach.  Ar ndóigh, bíonn caiteachas caipitil i gceist chomh maith sna deontais a íocann Gaeltarra le tionscail ach is trí Vóta bliantúil Roinn na Gaeltachta a chuirtear an t-airgead sin ar fáil. Meastar go gcaithfear £2,300,000 ar na deontais sin i mbliana, is é sin, go sroichfidh an caiteachas caipitil ón dá fhoinse £7,232,000 i 1975&mdash;méadú anmhór ar an gcaiteachas in aon bhliain roimhe seo.</P>
      <P>Ós rud é go mbeidh mé ag tagairt go minic do thionscail de dhá shaghas a dtugann Gaeltarra cúnamh dóibh, b'fhéidir nach fearr rud a dhéanfainn ag an bpointe seo ná an difríocht eatarthu a shoiléiriú:</P>

    <P>&mdash;tugaim &ldquo;comhthionscal&rdquo; ar thionscal ina mbíonn Gaeltarra agus <Col N="1734" /> daoine eile i gcomhar le chéile agus scaireanna ag Gaeltarra ann: de ghnáth tugann Gaeltarra deontas chomh maith do thionscal mar sin agus uaireanta ligeann Gaeltarra monarcha ar cíos don tionscal;</P>
    <P>&mdash;tugaim &ldquo;miontionscal&rdquo; ar gach tionscal eile a dtugann Gaeltarra cúnamh do deontas a bhíonn i gceist de ghnáth agus is annamh a rachadh sé thar £40,000 ach uaireanta ligeann Gaeltarra monarcha ar cíos don tionscal chomh maith; ní bhíonn aon scaireanna ag Gaeltarra i &ldquo;miontionscal&rdquo; agus ní bhaineann an t-airgead faoin mBille seo le tionscal mar sin ach amháin nuair a chuirtear monarcha ar fáil dó.</P>
    <P>Is le deich mbliana anuas a thosaigh Gaeltarra ag cabhrú le tionscail den dá shaghas sin ach tá cuid de na tionscail a bhí ann roimhe sin á reachtáil fós ag Gaeltarra féin&mdash; bréidín agus cniotáil&mdash;agus thosaigh Gaeltarra féin ar innealtóireacht phlaisteach roinnt blianta ó shin.  Is cúis athais dom gur tháinig laghdú mór ar na caillteanais ar thionscail Ghaeltarra féin anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Is comhartha an Bille seo ar an tslí ina bhfuil Gaeltarra ag brostú le forbairt na tionsclaíochta sa Ghaeltacht&mdash;in ainneoin na ndeacrachtaí iomadúla atá ar fud an domhain le tamall anuas mar gheall ar an gcúlú i gcúrsaí eacnamaíochta.  Is oth liom nach bhfuil tuarascáil Ghaeltarra don bhliain 1974 ar fáil do Theachtaí go fóill ach, mar chabhair don Dáil, tig liom a rá go mbeidh eolas mar seo a leanas sa tuarascáil sin:</P>
    <P>&mdash;bhí 2,617 nduine ag obair go lánaimseartha i ndeireadh na bliana seo caite sna tionscail a bhfuil baint ag Gaeltarra Éireann leo, agus comhthionscail, miontionscail agus tionscail Ghaeltarra féin san áireamh; is ionann é sin agus méadú 40 faóin gcéad ar an bhfostaíocht laistigh de dhá bhliain; ach na tionscail sin uile a bheith faoi lánseol bheadh fostaíocht lánaimseartha do 5,298 duine iontu;</P>
    <P>&mdash;ceadaíodh 11 chomhthionscal nua i rith 1974 agus bhí Gaeltarra chun</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> £498,000 a infheistiú ina gcuid scaireanna agus deontais £1,890,700 a thabhairt dóibh;</P>
    <P>&mdash;bhí páirt ag Gaeltarra i 46 chomh-thionscal ar fad i ndeireadh 1974;</P>
    <P>&mdash;ceadaíodh deontais dar luach £761,200 i rith 1974 do 82 mhiontionscal nua agus do roinnt miontionscal a bhí ann roimhe sin, rud a thug líon iomlán na miontionscal a raibh deontais ceadaithe dóibh go dtí 268; agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;tháinig méadú timpeall 80 faoin gcéad laistigh de dhá bhliain ar líon na dtionscal, idir chomhthionscail agus mhiontionscail, a raibh cúnamh ceadaithe ag Gaeltarra dóibh.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin thug mé roinnt mhaith eolais faoi chúrsaí Ghaeltarra mar fhreagraí ar cheisteanna anseo sa Dáil ó thús na míosa seo caite.  Ar an 12 Meitheamh, mar shampla, thug mé sonraí a bhain leis an tréimhse ó thús Aibreáin, 1973 go deireadh Bealtaine, 1975 agus a léirigh gur:</P>
    <P>&mdash;ceadaíodh 28 gcomhthionscal nua&mdash; seacht gcinn i gContae Dhún na nGall, dhá cheann i gContae Mhaigh Eo, 10 gcinn i gContae na Gaillimhe, sé cinn i gContae Chiarraí, ceann amháin i gContae Chorcaí agus dhá cheann i gContae na Mí;</P>
    <P>&mdash;ceadaíodh cúnamh breise do 21 chomhthionscal eile&mdash;cúig cinn i nDún na nGall, ceann amháin i Mhaigh Eo, seacht gcinn i nGaillimh, cúig cinn i gCiarraí agus tri cinn i gCorcaigh; agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;ceadaíodh deontais do 135 mhiontionscal&mdash;47 i nDún na nGall, 14 i Maigh Eo, 61 i nGaillimh, 10 i gCiarraí agus trí i gCorcaigh.</P>
    <P>Ar na príomh-chomhthionscail nua ar ceadaíodh iad agus ar cuireadh tús leis an obair iontu sa tréimhse sin tá earraí teileafónaíochta i nGaoth Dobhair, forbairt talún in Iorras, feistis solais i mBéal an Mhuirthead, ríomhaireacht sna Forbacha, gairneoireacht i gCorca Dhuibhne agus in Uíbh Ráthach, pailéid adhmaid i Múscraí agus innealtóireacht éadrom Ráth Cairn.</P>
    <P>Arís, ar an 8 Iúil, chuir mé eolas ar <Col N="1736" /> fáil i dtaobh 21 togra nua a bhfuil na socruithe dóibh ag teacht chun deachríche agus a bhfuiltear ag súil le 1,000 post iontu.  Beidh na tionscnaimh sin scaipthe go maith ar fud na Gaeltachta:</P>
    <P>&mdash;sna Dúnaibh, i nGaoth Dobhair&mdash; dhá cheann, i mBaille na Finne, ar Ard an Rátha, ar an gCarraig agus i gCill Charthaigh i gContae Dhún na nGall;</P>
    <P>&mdash;i mBun an Churraigh agus i gCoill an tSíain i gContae Mhaigh Eo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;i gCarna, i gCill Chiaráin, i dTír an Fhia, ar an gCeathrú Rua&mdash;dhá cheann, i Ros an Mhíl agus i gCorr na Móna i gContae na Gaillimhe;</P>
    <P>&mdash;i mBaile an Fheirtéaraigh agus i mBaile an Sceilg i gContae Chiarraí;</P>
    <P>&mdash;i mBéal Átha an Ghaorthaidh i gContae Chorcaí;</P>
    <P>&mdash;sa Rinn i gContae Phort Láirge; agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;i mBaile Gib i gContae na Mí.</P>
    <P>Silim gur léir go bhfuil an dul chun cinn á dhéanamh le forbairt na tionsclaíochta sa Ghaeltacht agus gur mó fós a bheadh déanta mura mbeadh an ghéarchéim eacnamaíochta atá ag cur isteach ar chúrsaí tionscail ar fud an domhain.  Tá ardmholadh tuillte ag Gaeltarra dá bharr sin: is é mo thuairimse nach bhfuil a sárú mar eagraíocht le fáil in áit ar bith. Tréaslaím le comhaltaí an bhoird, leis an lucht bainistíochta agus leis an bhfoireann uile as ucht a ndúthracht a chaitheamh le fonn agus le fuinneamh chun leas na Gaeltachta a chur ar aghaidh.  Chun na fadhbanna iomadúla le bliain anuas a shárú bhí gá le hiarracht thréan leanúnach agus le comhoibriú ó gach dream agus tá moladh ag dul freisin do phobal na Gaeltachta agus d'fhoireann mo Roinne féin.</P>
    <P>Leis na deacrachtaí go léir na laethanta seo ní féidir bheith ag súil go n-éireodh le gach uile thionscal a bhunaítear sa Ghaeltacht.  Níorbh fholáir tionscail áirithe a atheagrú nó tionscail nua a thabhairt isteach ina n-ionad agus tá muinín agam as a bhfuil déanta.  Nuair a thiocfaidh <Col N="1737" /> feabhas ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta beidh bonn maith tionsclaíochta ar fud na Gaeltachta chun tairbhe níos fearr fós a bhaint as na deiseanna nua.</P>
    <P>Tá bonn daingean á leagan cheana féin ag Gaeltarra do ghnó na cuartaíochta sna hóstáin ina bhfuil scaireanna acu.  Le bliain anuas tá tús curtha&mdash;don chéad uair riamh&mdash;le socrú trína gcuirtear eolas ar fáil do ghrúpa de na hóstáin sin i dteannta a chéile.  As an ngrúpmhargaíocht sin táthar ag súil go dtiocfaidh an méadú mór a bhfuil an-riachtanas leis ar na custaiméirí do leapacha na n-óstán.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh tionsclaíochta agus cuartaíochta araon is cuid thábhachtach dár mbeartas na haersheirbhísí sa Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt.  Tá scaireanna ag Gaeltarra in Aer Árann agus tá dul ar aghaidh an-mhaith á dhéanamh ag an gcomhlacht.</P>
    <P>Tá leas na gcomhluadar Gaeltachta ar cheann de na gnéithe is suntasaí agus is tábhachtaí de bheartas an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht.  Is chuige sin a chuir Gaeltarra tús le Comórtas Forbartha Pobal.  Is mór an chúis sásaimh an fhreagairt bhreá atá faighte ó na pobail áitiúla agus tá ós cionn 50 comhluadar páirteach sa Chomórtas.  Chomh maith leis na duaiseanna fiúntacha ó Ghaeltarra tuigim go bhfuil suas le £40,000 tagtha isteach mar bhronntanais ó chomhlachtaí móra tionscail, tráchtála agus baincéireachta agus ó ceardchumainn : molaim iad go léir.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairimse go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith leis na tionscail bheaga a bhíonn á reachtáil ag pobal na Gaeltachta féin agus tá áthas orm a rá go bhfuil ag éirí go han-mhaith lena bhformhór.  Dáiríre is sna miontionscail amháin a d'fhás an fhostaíocht i rith na bliana 1974.  Sa dá bhliain 1973 agus 1974 méadaíodh líon na dtograí ar cheadaigh Gaeltarra cúnamh dóibh gan páirt a ghlacadh iontu ó 146 go 268 agus líon na ndaoine a bhí ag obair go lánaimseartha iontu ó 730 go 1,074; agus bhíothas ag súil le 2,246 phost iontu ach iad a bheith faoi lánseol.  Ní aon ionadh mar sin gur thug mé treoir do Ghaeltarra aire speisialta a thabhairt <Col N="1738" /> do thionscail bheaga den saghas sin agus muintir na Gaeltachta a spreagadh chun iad a bhunú agus a leathnú as a stuaim féin nó trí chomharchumainn; is tionscail dá leithéid is fearr a oireann do na ceantair Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá leathnú na comharaíochta chun tosaigh i gcónaí i mbeartas an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht agus tá cabhair nach beag le fáil ag comharchumainn ó mo Roinnse.  Is iontach mar atá sprid na comharaíochta ag fás le tamall anuas sa chaoi go bhfuil breis agus 20 comharchumann ag gabháil do ghnóthaí éagsúla ar fud na Gaeltachta anois. Táim féin lánchinnte nach bhfuil bealach níos fearr ná comharchumann éifeachtach chun leas aon cheantair a chur ar aghaidh.  Tá Gaeltarra i bpáirtíocht le comharchumainn éagsúla i gcúrsaí gairneoireachta, talmhaíochta, cuartaíochta agus próiseála éisc agus tá súil agam go mbeidh ar chumas Ghaeltarra cabhrú tuilleadh lena lán comharchumann eile.  Mar shamplaí de thionscail ina bhfuil scaireanna ag Gaeltarra agus comharchumainn luaim míntíriú talún i gceantar Iorrais agus plandlanna i gCorca Dhuibhne agus in Uíbh Ráthach.  I láthair na huaire tá Gaeltarra ag obair ar phlean chun comhlacht margaíochta a bhunú a mbeadh na plandlanna i gCiarraí páirteach ann.  Bhí sé de phribhléid agam féin Plandaí Chorca Dhuibhne a oscailt go hoifigiúil seachtain is an Domhnach seo caite.</P>
    <P>Le cúpla bliain anuas tá Gaeltarra ag díriú go speisialta ar fhorbairt acmhainní nádúrtha na Gaeltachta&mdash; iascaireacht, talmhaíocht, gairneoireacht, agus mar sin de.  Tá an fharraige féin ar an acmhainn is mó atá ag an nGaeltacht agus, chomh maith le páirt a ghlacadh i dtionscail phróiseála éisc, tá Gaeltarra ag dul ar aghaidh anois le tionscnamh fíorthábhachtach muireolaíochta&mdash;saothrú nó &ldquo;feirmeoireacht&rdquo; oisrí le tacaíocht ón tSaotharlann Taighde Éisc Sllogáin de chuid Choláiste Ollscoile na Gaillimhe.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir smaoineamh ar acmhainní na farraige na laethanta seo gan ola agus gás a lua.  Tá Gaeltarra ag faire go géar ar a bhfuil ar siúl amach <Col N="1739" /> ó chósta na Gaeltachta le súil go bhféadfaí seirbhísí a bheadh ag teastáil a chur ar fáil i gceantair Ghaeltachta agus leas na gceantar sin a chosaint ag an am céanna.  Tá staidéar ar sheirbhísí den saghas sin déanta ag foireann Ghaeltarra san Ioruaidh agus tá a leithéid le déanamh in Albain: tá súil agam go mbeidh ar mo chumas féin páirt a ghlacadh sa chuairt staidéir ar Albain.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir gur leor a bhfuil ráite agam mar léargas ar an saothar mór atá ar siúl ag Gaeltarra agus ar an dul ar aghaidh fiúntach atá á dhéanamh ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Dá thoradh sin go léir, tá mórdhóchas agam go mbainfear amach an sprioc atá romhainn, is é sin, lánfhostaíocht sna seachtóidí do phobal na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>D'fhógair mé cheana go mbeidh Údarás na Gaeltachta le cur in ionad Ghaeltarra agus tá an réamhullmhúchán don Bhille i dtaobh an Údaráis chun cinn go maith.  Nuair a bheidh an Bille ceadaithe ag an Rialtas tabharfaidh mé os comhair na Dála é agus beidh deis eile againn chun cúrsaí na Gaeltachta a phlé. Idir dhá linn, áfach, ba mhaith liom go dtuigfí go soiléir go bhfuilimid ag brú ar aghaidh go tréan le forbairt na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá airgead mór le caitheamh ar an nGaeltacht agus tá an Rialtas sásta é a chur ar fáil ach, chun go bhféadfar cuid de a eisiúint, tá gá leis an mBille seo.  Dá réir sin iarraim ar an Dáil glacadh leis an mBille.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo.  Tá sé ar aon chéim le Bille leasaithe a tugadh isteach ó 1957.  I mbliain 1957 tugadh Bille isteach a chuir Gaeltarra Éireann ar bun agus tá dul chun cinn mór déanta i bhforbairt tionsclaíochta ón bhliain sin.  De réir an Bhille sin cuireadh bord ar bun.  Ag an am sin tugadh £½ milliún dóibh chun forbairt ar obair thionsclaíochta.  B'shin tosach agus i rith na mblian cuireadh leis an suim sin.  Inniu chun an dul chun chinn a choimeád ar siúl, is gá £25 milliún eile a caitheamh.  Ar an ábhar sin fáiltím roimh an mbreis <Col N="1740" /> deontais seo a bheas ar fáil do Ghaeltarra Éireann.</P>
      <P>Bhí sé i gceist forbairt ar thionscail Ghaeltachta.  Ach, chomh maith leis sin, leagadh síos sa Bhille i 1957 go rabh sé de dhualgas ar an mbord caomhnú agus leathnú a dheanamh ar an Ghaeilge.  Sin é an fá go raibh airgead le fáil ag Gaeltarra Éireann ag an am ceanna agus bhí Roinn na Gaeltachta ag plé leis na tionscail sin roimhe sin.  Ní ceart dúinn dearmad a dhéanamh gur leag ceann de altanna an Achta sin síos go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar an mbord cabhrú le caomhnú agus le leathnú na Gaelige. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil baill an bhoird an-dhícheallach maidir leis an obair sin&mdash;obair atá tábhachtach.</P>
      <P>Rinneadh leasú ar Acht na bliana 1965.  Sé tá i gceist anseo ná an t-airgead a mhéadú go dtí £25 milliún.  Ní dúirt an tAire cathain nó cén slí a bheadh an £25 milliún ar fáil, ach is cuma.  Tá cead ag an Aire Airgeadais an tsuim sin a thúirt don Aire má iarann Gaeltarra Éireann é.</P>
      <P>I 1965 tugadh breis cumhachta do Ghaeltarra Éireann bheith páirteach i gcomhlachtaí, scaireanna a cheannach agus deontaisí beaga a thabhairt. Arís, ardaíodh an t-airgead ó £½ milliún go dtí £2 mhilliún.</P>
      <P>Annsin, in 1968, tugadh cumhacht an méid a ardú agus tugadh cumhacht do Ghaeltarra Éireann tionscail a chur ar fáil i limistéirí taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Sé rud is mó a bhí i gceist ansin, sílim, tionscail a bhunú sna breac-Ghaeltachtaí agus rinneadh amhlaidh.  Bhí na breac-Ghaeltachtaí ábalta dul chun cinn dá bhárr sin agus gheall an tAire go dtógfaí isteach iad seo sa Ghaeltacht ach sin ceist eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sa bhliain 1971 rinneadh leasú eile agus ardaíodh an tsuim go dtí £6 mhilliún agus tugadh cead do na comhairlí contae dhá dtrian de na rátaí ar fhoirgnimh a chur ar ceal. Ba mhór an cabhair é sin.  Níl aon rud mar sin san mBille seo.  Níl aon rud ann taobh amuigh den ardú sin. Ach inniu agus go speisialta nuair atáimid ag caint, agus go háirithe nuair atá an tAire ag caint faoi na rudaí go léir atá ar siúl, an bhfuil ceart dlí ag cuid de na rudaí atá ar <Col N="1741" /> siúl?  An gá cumhachtaí Ghaeltarra Éireann a leathnú sa Bhille chun cuid de na rudaí&mdash;agus go leor rudaí&mdash;a dhéanamh?  Níl aon chumhacht bhreise ná leathnú breise á ndéanamh ach amháin go bhfuiltear ag cur níos mó airgead ar fáil dóibh.</P>
    <P>Is maith an rud é.  Molaim an tAire agus go speisialta Gaeltarra Éireann. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil obair fhónta á déanamh acu, gur gá an t-airgead seo.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ar fáil.  Tá súil agam go n-úsáidfear go maith é agus go mbeidh slite ann chun an t-airgead a úsaid.</P>
    <P>An raibh deíthneas leis an mBille seo?  An ghá é a thabhairt isteach anois?  An raibh an t-airgead ag teastáil díreach anois?  Táthar chun Údarás na Gaeltachta a chur ar siúl.  Tá sé geallta le fada.  Dúirt an tAire i bhfreagra ar cheist a chuireadh síos seachtain ó shin go mbeadh an Bille ag bunú Údarás na Gaeltachta sa Dáil tar éis Sos an tSamhraidh.  Ba mhaith liom ceisteanna a chur ar an Aire.  An mbeidh ceangal ar bith idir Gaeltarra Éireann agus Údarás na Gaeltachta? An mbeidh ceann acu os cionn an cheann eile nó an mbeidh an chumhacht fheidhmiúcháin ag Údarás na Gaeltachta?  An dtabharfar breis airgid má bhíonn breis oibre agus breis feidhmiucháin ag Gaeltarra Éireann faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta?  An mbeidh gá le Bille eile mar seo tar éis Sos an tSamhraidh?  Ba mhaith liom dá bhfreagródh an tAire na ceisteanna seo.  Níl mé sásta go ndeánfaidh an dá rud seo &ldquo;streameáil&rdquo; nuair a bheidh Bille Údarás na Gaeltachta os comhair na Dála agus an job go léir á dhéanamh ag an am céanna.</P>
    <P>Anois tá a lán ceisteanna agam le cur.  B'fhéidir nach ligfeadh an Leas-Cheann Comhairle dom iad a chur mar gheall ar an Údarás ach tá siad tábhachtach.  Cad í an pháirt a bhéas ag Gaeltarra Éireann sa chóras nua nuair a bhéas Údarás na Gaeltachta ar siúl agus ag reachtáil agus ag déanamh forbartha ar an nGaeltacht faoi mar atá Gaeltarra Éireann ag déanamh anois?  Ba cheart dúinn eolas a bheith againn anois nuair atáimíd ag cur airgid ar fáil do Ghaeltarra Éireann agus conas a bheidh an scéal i gceann <Col N="1742" /> trí mhí?  B'fhéidir go mbeadh saoire chomh fada sin againn, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Tá súil agam féin go mbeidh.  Ach mar sin féin, tá mé toilteanach fanacht anseo go ceann cúpla seachtain eile.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh an Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta os comhair na Dála inniu.  Cén fáth nach bhfuil?  Tá <i>vacuum</i> ansin.  Níor mhaith liom am a chur amú le ceisteanna borba nach mbeadh in ord.  Ní féidir liom ceist Údarás na Gaeltachta a phlé mar níl sé os comhair na Dála ach tá mé á rá leis an Aire gur ceart an Bille seo a bheith os comhair na Dála an tráthnóna seo sa dóigh go bhfeicfimís an pictiúir iomlán ar fad, an pictiúir atá geallta ag Aire na Gaeltachta.  D'fhéadfadh an tAire an Bille seo a chur siar go dtí tar éis laetheanta saoire an tsamhraidh agus an dá rud a cheangal le chéile.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nach raibh am ag an Aire é sin a dhéanamh.  Tá sé an-ghnóthach le déanaí agus le cúpla bliain anuas. Sílim go raibh sé i nÁrainn Mhór i dTír Chonaill nó le dul ansin chun scéim uisce a oscailt.  Is maith an rud é.  Tá sé an-ghnóthach ach bheadh sé an-tábhachtach don Ghaeltacht ar fad an pósadh a dhéanamh idir Gaeltarra Éireann agus Údarás na Gaeltachta agus sinn a bheith i láthair ag an bpósadh.  Nílimid ach ag tomhais, ag &ldquo;guessáil&rdquo;, mar adeir siad sa Ghaeltacht, maidir le cén baint, cén ceangal nó cén gaol a bhéas idir an Údarás agus Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, sílim go bhfuil leasú agat ansin a shín mé isteach roimhe seo, leasú atá ar intinn agam a mholadh ar Chéim an Choiste ar a 8 a chlog: San Tábla 26 (1) tar éis an focal &ldquo;suimeanna&rdquo;&mdash;agus sé an suim atá i gceist ná £25 milliún&mdash; gan deontaisí an chiste réigiúnach den CEE a chur san áireamh.  Má tá an tAire ag déanamh a chuid oibre bíodh scéim nó scéimeanna de chuid na Gaeltachta pé acu curtha chun cinn ag an Aire féin nó ag Gaeltarra Éireann i dteideal sciar airgid de chuid an chiste réigiúnach le fáil do na ceantracha Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ceist agam ar an Aire nó cúpla ceist.  An bhfuil scéimeanna a dhéanfas forbairt agus foirthint ar an Ghaeltacht, <Col N="1743" /> ar na ceantracha Gaeltachta, curtha faoi bhráid an Rialtais le cur os comhair an CEE chun deontaisí a fháil nó cuid mhaith a fháil den chiste réigiúnach agus go mbeidh caiteachas orthu ins na Gaeltachtaí? Tá súil go mbeidh sé ábalta a rá go bhfuil scéimeanna curtha ar siúl maidir le cuid den deontas sin ón Chiste Réigiúnach.  An féidir leis an Aire a rá cad iad na tograí atá curtha aige os comhair an Rialtais agus tríd an Rialtas os comhair an CEE?</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire ábalta a chur ina luí ar an Rialtas maidir leis na ceantair ó Dhún na nGall go Corcaigh, gur ceantair bhochta iad agus gur gá an chuid is mó den chiste réigiúnach a chaitheamh ins na ceantracha sin, pé acu Gaeltacht nó Galltacht iad.  Is ceart mórchuid airgid ón chiste sin a chaitheamh sna Gaeltachtaí.  Tá mé ag iarraidh a dhéanamh deimhin de go mbeidh pé airgead a bhéas ar fáil ón gciste sin mar breis ar an airgead atá anseo.  Sé sin le rá má thagann deontaisí maithe ó CEE chun na Gaeltachta nó chun Gaeltarra Éireann agus má bhíonn £1 mhilliún nó £2 mhilliún ar fáil nach £23 mhilliún a bhéas anseo i n-áit £25 mhilliún.  Ba mhaith liom béim a chur air sin.  Tá gá leis an £25 mhilliún seo.  Tá an t-airgead seo riachtanach agus má bhíonn airgead breise le fáil ní ceart an tsuim seo a laghdu de réir an deontais a bheas ar fáil.  B'fhéidir go ndéarfadh an tAire cad iad na tograí chuireadh chun cinn maidir leis an deontas sin.  Sin é an rud is tábhachtaí sílim chun forbairt a dhéanamh ar thionscail in iarthar na hÉireann agus go mór mhór sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh bunstruictúirí nó &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; ar fáil.  Ba cheart don Aire tríd an airgead seo na bunstruictúirí ar fad a chur ar siúl ach is gá dhó a chur ina luí ar na hAirí eile nach bhfuil ach méid áirithe maithis san airgead seo muna mbíonn na bunstruictúirí úd ann&mdash;mar atá, bóithre, tithe, seirbhísi uisce agus séireachais, telefóin, radio, telefís, aer-sheirbhís, seirbhís tráchta agus paisnéirí, seirbhísi báid agus mar sin de.  Is gá iad sin a bheith ann chun <Col N="1744" /> go mbeadh &ldquo;optimum&rdquo; buntáiste le fáil ar an gcaiteachas airgid.  Chun daoine, go mór-mhór turasóirí, a mhealladh isteach sa Ghaeltacht, is gá tithe ósta maithe agus is gá na seirbhísi go léir.  Tá liosta anseo agus tuigeann an tAire cad tá i gceist agam.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tithe ósta, thug an tAire freagra dhúinn le déanaí nach raibh ró-shásúil.  Dúirt sé go raibh deontaisí ar fáil chun tithe ósta a thógaint agus os rud é go bhfuil tuilleadh airgid le caitheamh anseo cuirim an cheist anois air.  An bhfuil nó nach bhfuil deontaisí le tithe ósta a thógáil san Ghaeltacht?  Nuair a rinne mé mion-scrúdú agus mion-cheistiú ar an Aire dúirt sé go raibh agus níor thuig mé go ró mhaith cad a tháinig ina dhiaidh sin.  De réir mar a thuigim féin thug Bord Fáilte Éireann le mórán blianta anuas go dtí a thrí nó a cheathar de bhlianta ó shin deontaisí do thithe ósta nua ar fud na tíre agus gur thug Gaeltarra Éireann deontaisí breise de bhreis ar na deontais sin.  Anois níl deontas ar bith á thúirt ag Bord Fáilte Éireann do thithe ósta in áit ar bith.  Dá bhrí sin, ní raibh an tAire fíor ar fad nuair adúirt sé go raibh deontaisí ar fáil. Ní thógfadh duine ar bith sa Ghaeltacht teach ósta nua&mdash;ní bheadh ciall leis gan deontas 40 faoin gcéad nó mar sin ó Bhord Fáilte agus deontas 20 faoin gcéad ó Roinn na Gaeltachta. Níl an 40 faoin gcéad ar fáil. Dá bhrí sin nach fíor a rá nach bhfuil aon deontaisí ar fáil anois do thithe ósta a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht?</P>
    <P>Tá an rud céanna fíor mar gheall ar dheontaisí maidir le feabhas a chur ar fhéirmeacha agus mar sin de, deontaisí a bhí le fáil ag feirmeoirí beaga suas go dtí an chéad lá de Fheabra, 1974.  Cuireadh na deontaisí sin go léir ar ceal agus anois muna feirmeoir atá cáilithe faoin &ldquo;Farm Modernisation Scheme&rdquo; an feirmeoir sin, níl deontas le fáil aige, mar nach bhfuil an &ldquo;Disadvantaged Farm Area Scheme&rdquo; ar siúl go fóill. Sin í an scéim a dheineann fóirthint ar 99 faoin gcéad d'fheirmeoirí sa Ghaeltacht. Anois, chomh fada agus is eol domsa, níl na deontaisí sin ón chéad lá d'Fheabhra, 1977, le fáil anois ag na feirmeoiri beaga.  An féidir liom <Col N="1745" /> iarraidh ar an Aire cuid den airgead seo a chur ar fáil tré dheontaisí &ldquo;interim&rdquo; sealadacha go dtí pé am a thabharfaidh an Rialtas isteach an scéim fá choinne na bhfeirmeoirí sna ceantracha cúnga, go mór-mhór sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go síleann a lán daoine ón mbolscaireacht atá ar siúl ag an Aire go bhfuil gach rud go deas sa Ghaeltacht. Ach tá feirmeoirí na Gaeltachta ó Dhún na nGall go Ciarraí, ó Chorcaí, go dtí an Rinn nach bhfuil ábalta deontaisí a fháil chun feabhsú a chur ar a gcuid feirmeacha.  Níl an tAire ag déanamh bolscaireachta ar bith ag cruinnithe na Comh-aireachta.  Tá sé bliain go leith ó cuireadh na deontaisí d'fheirmeoirí beaga ar ceal agus ní dhearna an tAire faic mar gheall air. Iarraim air anois sciar den airgead seo a chur ar fáil mar dheontas &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;, más mian leis, do na feirmeoirí sin.  Níl siad in ann £1,800 sa bhliain a ghnóthaint.</P>
    <P>Iarraim ar an Aire anois go mbeadh sé mar príomh-aidhm aige sula dtéann an Dáil ar scoir scéim speisialta shealadach a thabhairt isteach chun cabhrú leis na feirmeoirí beaga agus leis na hiascairí atá ina bhfeirmeoirí beaga chun ola saor a thabhairt do na hiascairí. Tá costaisí árda orthu, costas na n-eangach, costas na mbád Tá gach rud a bhaineas leis an iascaireacht costasach anois ach níor tháinig aon árdú ar na deontaisí agus tháinig an-ardú ar chostas an ola.  Ní féidir breith ar iasc gan an t-airgead a chaitheamh ar ola.  Tá gach tír san CEE ag tabhairt deontaisí móra do na hiascairí chun ola a cheannach do na hinneallbháid agus tá suim an-bheag ar fad á thabhairt anseo.  Dhiúltaigh an Rúnaí Parlaiminte don Aire Talmhaíochta anuraidh aon bhreis a chur air.  Tá árdaithe tagtha ó shin.</P>
    <P>Arís is gá córas iompair d'earraí agus ní luafaidh mé an fhadhb atá i dTír Chonaill faoi láthair agus i Gaeltacht Thír Chonaill faoi láthair&mdash;an deighilt idir Lough Swilly Railway agus CIE, Radio na Gaeltachta agus an telefís.  Cuireadh Radio na Gaeltachta ar bun nuair a bhí Fianna Fáil i Rialtas.  Ag taisteal dom thríd na Gaeltachtaí go léir ón Rinn go Tír Chonaill <Col N="1746" /> sílim féin gur sin an rud is tábhachtaí, ceann de na príomh rudaí tábhachta a rinneadh go dtí seo, mar anois tá radio dá gcuid féin acu ach tugaim fógra anseo.  Tá an Rialtas tar éis polaiteoir a chur i bhfeighil mar stiúrthóir ar Radio na Gaeltachta, &ldquo;lackey&rdquo; de chuid an Rialtais, &ldquo;lackey&rdquo; de cuid an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa.</P>

      <P>I nGaoth Dóbhair.  Chuala an Rúnaí Parlaiminte faoi Dhaingean Uí Chúise agus Dún Chaoin.  Is tábhachtach an rud na monarchana seo a chur ar siúl.  Chuir Gaeltarra Éireann faoin Rialtas a bhí ann cheana féin &ldquo;industrial <Col N="1747" /> estate&rdquo; ar siúl i nGaoth Dóbhair agus cuireadh brainse de AnCO ar siúl fosta.  Anois tá an dá rud tábhachtach. Tá sé tábhachtach monarchana a chur ar siúl sna Gaeltachtaí chun breis oibre a thabhairt do dhaoine óga ag fás suas sa Ghaeltacht agus do dhaoine a bhí ag teacht abhaile agus atá go fóill ag teacht abhaile chun obair a thabairt dóibh ansin.</P>
      <P>Na bainisteoirí, na fó-bhainisteoirí agus na teicneoirí eile a bhéas agus atá i bhfeighil na monarchana sin is gá Gaeilge a bheith acu nó deis a bheith acu chun Gaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Tá súil agam leis an airgead a bhéas ar fáil go dtig leis an Aire agus go mbeidh ar chumas Gaeltarra Éireann an t-airgead seo a chur i n-áirithe chun daoine óga &mdash;agus tá saoroideachas anois sna Gaeltachtaí ar fad, tá coláistí agus scoileanna teicniciúla, scoileanna réigiúnacha, agus pobal-scoileanna ar fáil acu&mdash;ón Ghaeltacht a thraenáil i gcóir na bpostanna sin.  Sé an dóigh is éasca agus is fearr ná daltaí óna scoileanna seo a chur go dtí AnCO.  Chuir Rialtas Fhianna Fáil brainse d'AnCO ar siúl i nGaoth Dóbhair agus ba cheart é leathnú go dtí na Gaeltachtaí eile chun teicneoirí a thraenáil i ngach grád suas go dtí grád an bhainisteora i ngach monarcha faoi Ghaeltarra Éireann.</P>
      <P>Ar an gcuma sin ní amháin go ndéanfar leas eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú ach leanfar leis an rud atá breactha síos in Acht na bliana 1957, go mbeidh leathnú, feabhsú agus caomhnú á ndéanamh ar son na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Níl mé chun tabhairt faoin Aire.  Is iomaí píosa bolscaireachta agus ráiteas a rinne sé le bliain anuas.  Bheadh sé an-deacair d'aon duine coinneáil suas leis na rudaí a d'oscail sé agus na rudaí a rinne sé.</P>

Tá baol ann go bhfuil sé ina dhearca aige.  Tá na &ldquo;releases&rdquo; chomh minic sin, bíonn sé <Col N="1748" /> ag foscailt scéime anseo agus scéime ansúd agus rudaí mar sin agus is deacair iad go léir a choinneáil le chéile.

Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá airgead á chur ar fáil nó ba cheart go mbeadh airgead á chur ar fáil ón Lár-Chiste do thograí sa nGhaeltacht. Chomh maith leis sin, tá súil agam nuair a bheidh an coiste réigiúnach ag obair i gceart san CEE go mbeidh airgead ag teacht as sin fosta fá choinne tograí sa Ghaeltacht.  An rud atá de dhith orainn anseo ná nach gcuirfidh an Rialtas airgead a bhéas ag teacht ón gciste réigiúnach sa mhéid atá á chur ar fáil anseo.  Caithfidh muidne a bheith cúramach ar an taobh seo den Teach mar is eol do gach duine anseo go ndearna an tAire Airgeadais an t-airgead a bhí ag teacht ón gciste réigiúnach a chur isteach mar chaiteachas reatha.  Níl sé de dhith orainne go mbeidh an tAire nó an Rialtas ag rá indiaidh tamaill go bhfuil méid áirithe airgid á chur ar fáil agus ansin má thagann airgead ón gciste régiúnach nach a <Col N="1752" /> thuilleadh a bheidh ansin ach an méid céanna.</P>
      <P>Níl a fhios agam an dtuigeann an tAire caidé atá i gceist.  Tá súil agam go dtuigeann sé anois gurab é an rud atá muidne ag iarraidh a shocrú ná nach mbeidh san £25 mhilliún ach airgead ón Lár-Chiste agus airgead ar bith a thagann isteach ón gcoiste réigiúnach go gcuirfí sin leis an méid seo agus nach mbeidh an Rialtas ag rá ins an deireadh gur £25 mhilliún ar fad atá á chur ar fáil.  Sílim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach, agus mar adúirt mé, ní dóigh liom go gcuirfeadh an Teachta Cunningham an leasú seo síos ar chor ar bith ach gurab é an taithí atá againn ar an rud cheana féin, agus b'éigean don Aire Airgeadais athrú a dhéanamh sa mhéid a bhí sé ag braith a dhéanamh agus sa deireadh rinne sé díreach an rud a bhí a dhith orainne.  Sa dóigh céanna ba cheart go mbeadh muidne cinnte sul a rachaidh an Bille seo tríd an Dáil gur mar sin a bhéas sé agus airgead ar bith a thiocfas as an gcoiste réigiúnach gur airgead sa bhreis a bheidh ann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Dúirt an tAire gur deontas a bhí i gceist san chiste réigiúnach agus gur caipitil a bhí i gceist anseo.  Sea.  Deontas atá i gceist ó CEE go dtí an Rialtas anseo, ach níl bac ar bith ar an Rialtas anseo an deontas sin a úsáid i gcóir oibreacha caipitil.  Sin mar atá an scéal.  Is deontas ó CEE atá i gceist ach ní gá gur deontas é ón Rialtas ná ó Ghaeltarra Éireann chun monarchana a chur ar siúl, obair chaipitil ná scéim ar bith eile.  Is féidir an deontas ó CEE a roint sa tír seo agus a usáid ar fhorbairt caipitil, ach caithfidh muid a chinntiú nach mbeidh aon chuid den £25 mhilliún sa cheist ansin, agus má fhághann an Rialtas £2 mhilliún ná má fhághann an tAire Airgeadais £2 mhilliún fá choinne forbairt sa Ghaeltacht, nach laghdóidh sé an tsuim airgid atá anseo de £2 mhilliún thar a chionn sin.  Má thugann an tAire an gealltanas sin tarraingeoidh mé siar an leasú.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom é seo a mhíniú níos fearr ná mar a míníodh cheana féin é.  Dúirt an tAire <Col N="1753" /> go mbeidh airgead ag teacht chugainn ón gciste réigiúnach ach de réir mar is eol domsa beidh an cineál céanna oibre á dhéanamh leis an airgead sin agus atá agus a bheidh ar siúl leis an airgead seo atá faoina bhráid faoi láthair.  An t-airgead a thiocfas ón gciste réigiúnach, beidh sé á chaitheamh ar áiteacha a dhéanamh réidh do thionscail.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil cead an t-airgead a chaitheamh ar thionscail féin, ach cibé ar bith é, beidh sé ann fá choinne uisce agus séarachais, bóithre agus telefón, leictreachais, agus mar sin de, a chur ar fáil.</P>
      <P>Cuir i gcás nach raibh an t-airgead sin ag teacht ar chor ar bith, bheadh an cineál céanna oibre ar siúl ag an Aire leis an £25 mhilliún atá á chur ar fáil anseo inniu, agus sé an rud atá de dhith orainne nuair a chuirtear an t-airgead seo ar fáil ón chiste réigiúnach ná go mbeidh sé mar farasbarr ar an méid atá á chur ar fáil anseo, sé sin, nach mbeidh an tAire ag rá ag an am: &ldquo;Tá mé ag cur an airgid atá ar fáil agam ón CEE isteach anseo, agus mar adúirt mé tá cosúlacht idir an cineál caiteachais a bheidh ann don dá rud.&rdquo; Ba mhaith linn a bheith cinnte gur airgead sa bhreis a bhéas san airgead a thiocfas ón chiste réigiúnach agus nach mbainfidh sé leis an £25 mhilliún.</P>

Mar sin féin rinne cúpla Teachta tagairt arís don chiste réigiúnach agus do phointi áirithe.  Is féidir liomsa a rá go dtig leis a bheith cinnte nach laghdófar an caiteachas faoin mBille seo de bharr airgead ón gciste réigiúnach.</P>

Beidh níos mó airgid le fáil le caitheamh sna Gaeltachtaí má ghlactar leis in leasú de réir an rud atá curtha síos againn.  Ach de réir an rud atá ar súil ag an Aire beidh sé in ann an t-airgead seo a úsáid ar mhaithe leis an Ghaeltacht gan cur leis an méid atá le fáil as an gCiste-Lár.  Sílim gur ceart dó glacadh leis an leasú seo. <Col N="1754" /> Beidh breis airgid le fáil sna Gaeltachtaí má ghlacann an tAire leis an rud atá i gceist againn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá cúpla ruda im cheann féin agus b'fhéidir nach bhfuilim ar aon aigne leis an Aire mar gheall orthu ach mar sin féin, is mian liom iad a phlé sa Teach seo. Tá a lán Teachtaí anseo a bhfuil spéis acu sna Gaeltachtaí.  Is é an rud atá ag cur isteach orm ná na tithe ósta ar a raibh an Teachta Cunningham ag caint.  Measaim féin nuair atá ostán tógtha sna Gaeltachtaí, is cuma cén áit, i dTír Chonaill, i nGaillimh, i <Col N="1755" /> gCiarraí, i bPort Láirge nó i gCorcaí agus nuair atá daoine ag obair sna hóstáin sin ba cheart muintir na Gaeltachta a bheith ag obair iontu. Táimid mí-shásta go bhfuil óstáin ann faoi láthair agus na daoine atá ag obair iontu ní ó na Gaeltachtaí iad in aon chor.  Tá mé á rá go poiblí leis an Aire gur ceart féachaint isteach sa scéal sin.  Tá a fhios agam go raibh sé scríofa isteach sa &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; nó cad é an focal ceart air, go mba cheart daoine óna ndúthaigh féin a bheith ag obair sna hóstáin.</P>
      <P>Rud eile, níl mé ró-shástá i dtaobh na gcoláistí samhraidh.  Measaim féin go mba cheart do Ghaeltarra Éireann nó d'Údarás na Gaeltachta nó do Bhord na Gaeilge na coláistí sin a choinneáil faoina gcúram féin.  Léigh mé sa pháipéar an bhliain seo caite gur dhein comharchumann amháin sa tír seo breis agus £32,000 as na coláistí Gaeilge agus fuair comharchumann eile atá sa Ghaeltacht breis agus £9,000 as na coláistí sin.  Ní ceart é sin.  Ba cheart don airgead sin dul isteach go dtí na mná tí nó na páistí.  Níl a fhios cad iad na smaointí atá ag Teachtaí an Fhreasúra ar an gceist sin ach measaim féin aon chomharchumann atá ábalta breis agus £32,000 a dhéanamh as na coláistí Gaeilge, tá rud éigin mí-cheart leis an scéim sin.  Ní ceart é.  Sé mo thuairim&mdash;agus tá seo á rá agam go poiblí&mdash;go mba cheart fiosrúchán a dhéanamh faoi cá bhfuil an t-airgead seo ag dul.  Ba cheart an t-airgead a thabhairt do na mná tí nó do na páistí chun iad a thabhairt timpeall na Gaeltachta agus na háiteanna speisialta a theaspáint dóibh.  Sin é an rud atá ag cur isteach orm go mór. Deirim anois go poiblí leis an Aire, go mba cheart fiosrú a dhéanamh maidir leis an airgead sin.  Ní raibh an Teach seo sásta riamh an oiread sin &ldquo;profit&rdquo; a thabhairt d'aon comharchumann, is cuma sa diabhal cá bhfuil sé, i gCiarraí, i nGaillimh nó i nDún na nGall, go bhfuil siad ábalta an méid sin airgid a dhéanamh as na coláistí Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sé an tríú rud atá ag cur isteach orm ná an t-údarás áitiúil.  Bhí an Teachta Cunningham ag caint ar feadh tamaill maith air.  Ní bheidh mé <Col N="1756" /> ach cúpla nóiméad eile mar tá a fhios agam go bhfuil a lán Teachtaí eile ar mhaith leo cúpla focal a rá.  Rud mór é an t-údarás áitiúil.  Tá mise ag dul mór-thimpeall na Gaeltachta agus níl aon duine sna Gaeltachtaí ag lorg an údaráis áitiúla, aon duine ar labhair mé leis.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil an tAire ag casadh le daoine áirithe a bhfuil sé á lorg acu ach níor chas mise le aon duine nó aon bhean tí sa Ghaeltacht atá á lorg.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon bhaint ag an mBille seo le coláistí samhraidh agus mná tí cé go raibh an méid a bhí le rá ag an Teachta an-shuimiúil.  Is dócha go bhfaighidh sé a lán aontú on taobh seo den Teach leis an méid atá ráite aige.  Ba chóir don Aire níos mó aire a thabhairt don mhéid atá raite ag an Teachta Begley.  Is caiteachas caipitil is mó atá i gceist sa Bhille seo, é a ardú ó £10 milliún go £25 milliún. Thug an tAire sórt eolais dúinn faoin áit ina bhfuil an t-airgead seo le caitheamh. Ba mhaith liom féin roint ceisteanna a chur ar an Aire faoi na háiteanna ina bhfuil Gaeltarra Éireann ag caitheamh na ndeontaisí seo agus an chaoi ina bhfuil sé caite go dtí seo agus an chaoi a bhfuil sé beartaithe acu é a chaitheamh amach anseo.</P>
      <P>Ar leathanach a 3 dá ráiteas deireann an tAire go bhfuil dhá short tionscail i gceist, comhthionscail agus miontionscail.  Tá suim faoi leith agam sna comhthionscail seo mar deirtear ar leathanach a 3 go bhfuil deich gcinn curtha ar fáil i gContae na Gaillimhe agus i bhfreagra sa Dáil le gairid dúirt sé an rud céanna agus dúirt sé go raibh seacht gcomhthionscail ar ceadaíodh cúnamh breise dóibh.  Tá siad seo luaite arís inniu aige agus is dócha go bhfuil sé ag cur in iúl don Dáil go bhfuil an t-airgead breise atá sé á lorg ón Dáil anocht le bheith ar fáil don tsórt tionscail seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá a lán bolscaireachta déanta ag an Aire faoin méid adeireann sé atá déanta aige.  Ba mhaith liom é a cheistiú faoi sin.  Ar dtús, deireann sé go bhfuil deich gcomhthionscail nua i gContae na Gaillimhe agus seacht gcomhthionscail ar ceadaíodh cúnamh breise dóibh.  Ba mhaith liom ar dtús <Col N="1757" /> dá mbreathnódh muid ar na deich gcinn seo.  Deirtear go bhfuil trí cinn acu nach bhfuil tosaithe.  Thug an tAire an t-eolas sin dúinn roint seachtain ó shin sa Dáil.  Má tá trí cinn acu nach bhfuil tosaithe fós fágann sé sin seacht gcinn.  Tá sa Spidéal, adeireann sé, monarcha bréagáin; ar an gCeathrú Rua, óstán; i Ros a' Mhíl, factory próiseáil éisc agus deireann sé aer-sheirbhís. Is dócha gurab é Aer Árainn atá i gceist ansin.</P>
    <P>Nach bhfuil sé fíor go raibh ceithre cinn de na monarchana sin ar siúl sul ar tháinig an tAire mar Aire ar chor ar bith, i Mí Márta, 1973 agus tá a fhios ag an Dáil agus tá a fhios ag na Teachtaí ó na ceantracha Gaeltachta go raibh factory bréagáin sa Spidéal i bhfad roimh 1973; go raibh an t-óstán ar an gCeathrú Rua tosnaithe sa bhliain 1968 nó 1969.  Dúirt an tAire féin é sin an tseachtain seo caite.  Cén fáth go bhfuil sé ag iarraidh cur i gcéill dúinn anois gurab é seo ceann de na deich monarchana nó comhthionscail nua atá curtha ar fáil aige féin?  Maidir leis an factory próiseáil éisc i Ros a' Mhíl, tá sé sin ann le fada.  Bhí mé ann lá d'oscail an Teachta Colley é nuair a bhí sé ina Aire na Gaeltachta.  Bhí mé ar an gCeathrú Rua an lá ar oscail sé an t-óstán ann agus bhí an factory sa Spidéal oscailte tá mé ag ceapadh sul má tháinig mé isteach sa Dáil seo mé féin níos mó ná deich mbliana ó shin. Agus Aer Árainn bhí mé ann le Mícheál Kitt, go ndéanfaidh Dia trócaire ar a anam, an lá d'oscail sé an aer-sheirbhís in Árainn.  Tá an tAire ag iarraidh bolscaireachta a dhéanamh gurab é féin a chuir na rudaí seo ar siúl agus ní hé.  Níor chóir dó eolas míchruinn nó mícheart a thabhairt don Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As an deich gcomhthionscail deireann sé go bhfuil trí cinn nach bhfuil tosaithe.  Fágann sin seacht gcinn.  As an seacht gcinn bhí ceithre cinn tosaithe sul ar tháinig an tAire. Fágann sé sin trí comhthionscail.  As an trí cinn sin deirtear go bhfuil tionscail oisrí le tosnú go luath i gCarna ach nach bhfuil sé tosnaithe fós.  Tá a fhios ag muintir Charna agus ag an dream atá i mbun an ruda seo gurab é <Col N="1758" /> Deputy Haughey a chuir an t-airgead ar fáil nuair a bhí sé ina Aire Airgeadais le haghaidh an taighde a bhí tábhachtach agus a bhí riachtanach sul a bhféadfaí dul ar aghaidh leis an tionscal sin.  Ní raibh aon bhaint ag an Aire leis an tosnú agus leis an taighde a rinneadh chun an job sin a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Chomh maith leis sin, deirtear maidir leis na trí cinn atá fágtha go bhfuil textile ar an gCeathrú Rua.  Is dócha gurab é seo an comhlucht, Na Beanna Beola.  Más ea osclaíodh an tionscal seo i mBéal an Daingin roint blianta sul ar tháinig an tAire isteach i Roinn na Gaeltachta ar chor ar bith. Níl ach an t-aon cheann fágtha, sé sin, sna Forbacha, ríomhaireacht.  Sin é an tríú ceann.  Tig leis an Aire a fhiafraigh cén bhliain ar ceadaíodh é sin. Is dócha gur ceann nua é.  Níl ansin ach ceann amháin as an deich gcinn a luaigh an tAire sa bhfreagra agus atá luaite ag an Aire arís inniu sa Dáil.  Tá ceann eile ann ar ceann nua é.  Tig leis a bheith bródúil as é a mhealladh, sé sin, an ceann in Inis Mór.  Sé sin an t-aon cheann, déarfainn, nó b'fhéidir go bhfuil dhá cheann ann, mar atá, an ríomhaireacht agus an seodra.  Sin dhá cheann as an deich a luaigh an tAire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ansin na seacht gcinn ar ceadaíodh cúnamh breise dóibh bhí ceithre cinn ar siúl sul ar tháinig an tAire in oifig ar chor ar bith.  Bhí factory cairpéidí i gCloch na Rón ar siúl roimh 1973 agus tithe réimh-dhéanta bhí sé sin ar siúl ar an gCeathrú Rua agus bhí an mhonarcha tíleacha marmair ar siúl sa gCnoc sul a raibh fhios ag an Aire cá raibh an Cnoc.  Tá sé ann le blianta agus deirtear arís ansin, ar an dara leathanach faoi na cinn seo ar ceadaíodh cúnamh breise dóibh, Ros a' Mhíl próiseáil éisc arís. B'fhéidir go mbeadh an tAire in ann a chur in iúl domsa an bhfuil dhá comhthionscail i Ros a' Mhíl ag próiseáil éisc.  Cheap mé féin gurab é an t-aon tionscal amháin a bhí ann ach go raibh dhá shuíomh acu agus go rabhadar ag cur suíomh nua nó breis foirgneamh ar siúl ar shuíomh nua don tionscal céanna ach tá sé luaite dhá uair ag an Aire.  Sin ceithre cinn ar aon nós a bhí ar siúl.  Bhí an próiseáil éisc ar siúl i Ros a' Mhíl. <Col N="1759" /> Bhí Tíleacha Marmair Teoranta ann. Bhí na tithe réamh-dhéanta á dtógáil agus bhí an factory seo i Cloch na Rón.  Tá mé beagnach cinnte.  Tig leis an Aire féin é seo a dhearbhú nuair a bhéas sé ag túirt freagra.  Tá mé cinnte go raibh tosnú éigin ansin.  Tá sé taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Níl sé sa Ghaeltacht ar chor ar bith.  Ach ar aon nós, fuair sé deontas i gconaí ó Roinn na Gaeltachta maidir leis an sean-tionscal a bhí ann ag Gaeltarra Éireann.  Fágann sé sin as na seacht gcinn sin trí chomhthionscail agus astu sin luaitear An Spidéal Textile.  Is dócha gurab é sin Monmara agus ceann in Indreabhán, innealltóireacht. Is dócha gurab é sin Hydro Marine. Bhí chuile réiteach déanta le haghaidh an dá thionscal sin roimh an toghchán sa mbliain, 1973.  Bhí an ráiteas curtha amach ag Aire na Gaeltachta Deputy Colley futhu.  Tá iarracht ann, tá mise ag ceapadh, dal-ladh-mhullóg a chur ar dhuine éigin ag iarraidh maíomh a dhéanamh astu siúd ós rud é go raibh chuile rud réitithe sul ar tháinig an tAire, An Teachta O'Donnell, san oifig ar chor ar bith.</P>
    <P>Tá an príomh-cheann ansin.  Luaitear an Ceathrú Rua, earraí plaisteacha. Níl mé cinnte faoin gceann sin.  Bhí tionscal plaisteach ar siúl ar an gCeathrú Rua.  Tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil athrú éigin ann.  Tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil sé sa factory céanna.  Tig leis an Aire bheith ag maíomh as sin más mian leis é ach cé mhéid daoine atá ag obair ann?  As an deich gcomhthionscail nua a luaigh an tAire níl ach dhá cheann a réitigh an tAire é féin, ríomhaireacht ins na Forbacha, seodra in Inis Mór agus as na seacht gcinn ar ceadaíodh cúnamh breise níl ach ceann amháin a réitigh an tAire as an nua, An Cheathrú Rua, earraí plaisteacha. As na seacht gcomhthionscail déag atá luaite ag an Aire san ráiteas a thug sé don Dáil anocht níl ach trí cinn a réitigh sé féin.  Ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire a mhíniú go cruinn, beacht don Dáil cad é an scéal ceart. An bhfuil an fhírinne agamsa nó an bhfuil an fhírinne ag an Aire?  Seo é an áit chun é a rá.  De réir mar a fheicimse níl san méid atá déanta ag <Col N="1760" /> an Aire ach breis airgid a thúirt do thionscal a bhí bunaithe agus a bhí ar siúl sul a bhí sé sa Roinn ar chor ar bith.</P>
    <P>Mar focal scoir ba mhaith liom an cheist deiridh a chur ar an Aire.  Cad é an scéim a bhí aige chun Éireannaigh a mhealladh abhaile as Sasana an Samhradh seo?  Deirtear liomsa go raibh réiteach déanta ag muintir Bhéal an Daingean, Tír an Fhia agus timpeall Litir Mhór agus Litir Mealláin chun glacadh leis na daoine sin an Samhradh seo ach go bhfuil siad ag fanacht fós orthu.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa ceist a chur ar an Aire.  Cén chaoi a dtárlaíonn sé nach bhfuil ach dhá thionscal á bhfáil ag Contae Mhaigh Eo?  Tuige go bhfaghaimid cuid Pháidín den mheáchan i gcónaí? Nílimid ag fáil aon tionscail.  Chomh maith leis sin, tá na Gaeltachtaí atá againn scaipthe.  Gaeltachtaí beaga iad agus tá siad scaipthe thart ar fud an Chontae in áiteacha ar nós Ceathrú Thaidhg, Cill Chaisil agus Acaill féin agus cé go bhfuil Gaeltachtaí atá níos lua ná Gaeltachtaí Chontae Mhaigh Eo ag fáil tionscail, tá sinne i ndeire na bpolasaí i gcónaí.  Cén míniú atá ar an scéal?  An é nach bhfuil tionsclaithe sásta dul isteach go Contae Mhaigh Eo nó an é an locht atá ann nach bhfuil Gaeltarra ag brú ar thionsclaithe teacht go Contae Mhaigh Eo nó an é an scéal atá againn maidir le Radio na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil aon stáisiún le fáil againn rud ba chóir dúinn a fháil?  Tá muid go siorraí fágtha chun deiridh agus caithfidh go bhfuil míniú ar an scéal agus nuair a bhéas an tAire ag tabhairt freagra ba mhaith liom go mbeadh sé in ann míniú a thabhairt dom ar céard atá contráilte.</P>

    <P>Luaigh sé iascaireacht anseo agus tionscail na h-iascaireachta agus is deacair a chreidiúint go bhfuil an tAire i ndáiríre nuair a fheicimid an rud atá déanta aige féin agus ag Roinn na Gaeltachta maidir le deontaisí do bháid iascaigh.  Ní féidir le duine ón nGaeltacht thar £4,000 a fháil anois mar sciar den airgead a dtig leis a fháil mar dheontas má tá sé ag ceannach báid úir.  Roimhe seo bhí cead aige 80 faoin gcéad den airgead <Col N="1761" /> a bheadh le cur síos aige ar luach an bháid le fáil aige agus an té a bhéas ag fáil báid a chosnóidh £600,000 i láthair na huaire níl le fáil aige ach £4,000.  Cé go bhfuil an tAire ag caint faoin iascaireacht agus an suim atá aige san iascaireacht tá constaicí á dtabhairt isteach aige atá ag cur bac ar iascairí nuair atá siad ag iarraidh báid úra a cheannach.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an tAire in ann míniú a thabhairt ar na rudaí sin.</P>

      <P>Is fíor a rá go bhfuil saothar mór déanta ag an Aire. I gcúrsaí tionscail is mó atá rian na hoibre sin le feiscint.  Anois, ó táimid i gComhphobal na hEorpa is mór ná riamh an dualgas atá orainn a thaispeáint don saol mór go bhfuil ár gcultúr agus ár traidisiún agus ár dteanga féin againn agus go ndéanfaimid ár ndícheall iad a choinneáil. Mar sin ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on this Bill because, not having a Gaeltacht in my constituency, I can look dispassionately at the entire problem. Since my election to the Presidency of the Commission for Regional Policy and Transport, I had an opportunity of studying like problems throughout the community in depth and I must say that the Minister has set quite a considerable example not only for this country but for many under-developed regions throughout the community.  Since he took office he has quadrupled the amount of money available and I think that this has given Muintir na Gaeltachta new hope and it is quite evident that they have responded to his leadership.  I should like to support the Minister very sincerely.  I hope that greater emphasis will be placed on the provision of infrastructures in the Gaeltacht and in the under-developed areas.  I wish his programme every success in the years ahead.  I think the success he has achieved in bringing new life to the Gaeltacht areas is significant and one would certainly like to see him entrusted with the administration of the regional policy of this country and of our regional fund.  He has set a headline in our <Col N="1762" /> country that many of our European colleagues are looking to.  When my commission visited this country both north and south last year they were impressed not only by the work of Roinn na Gaeltachta but by the excellent programmes that the regional development organisations had embarked upon and had put in operation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is most important that a big proportion of the funds that the House is now going to allocate to the Gaeltacht in this Gaeltacht Industries (Amendment) Bill should be used to provide adequate infrastructures.  Many Gaeltacht areas, particularly in the west, are remote and transport is a problem.  I want to compliment the Minister on the obvious impetus he has given to the people who are endeavouring to provide and who have provided air connections for the country. The development of small air fields and landing strips will bring new hope to people who were forgotten by the Opposition.  I see some of my European colleagues grinning contentedly there but when they were in office they conveniently forgot the people of the west and even the lip service was quite small.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House. It must surely bring new hope to the people of the west.  He has given them leadership and it is nice to see that they have responded fully to that leadership. I wish his efforts continued success.</P>

      <P>Ó tháinig mise isteach sa Teach seo feicim Aire na Gaeltachta ag imirt polaitíochta leis an nGaeltacht.  Níl deireadh seachtaine nach mbíonn sé ag spaisteoireacht dhó féin, ó thuaidh, ó dheas agus thiar. Ach ní fhanann sé sáthach fada in aon Ghaeltacht le teangmháil a dhéanamh le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Nach le poiblíocht agus le creidiúint a fháil dhó féin a bhíonn sé ag bogaidí thart? Deir an seanfhocal linn: &ldquo;An té bhíonn siúlach bíonn sé scéalach&rdquo; ach ní hamhlaidh sin don Aire.  Mar adeirtear i mBéarla &ldquo;a rolling stone gathers no moss&rdquo;.  Is cinnte gurab é fearacht na gcosa ag an Aire é.</P>
      <P>Tá sé leagtha síos go bunreachtúil go bhfuil sé mar dhualgas ar Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ar Ghaeltarra Éireann an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht a neartú tré obair a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Fáiltaíonn muid roimh airgead breise a chur ar fáil do Ghaeltarra Éireann le déanamh cinnte dhe go gcuirfear monarchana agus obair ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Ach is léir nach bhfuil ach trí cinn de na monarchana seo atá á bhfógairt ag Aire na Gaeltachta curtha ar fáil agus réitithe amach aige féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is deacair diúltú d'aon rud a chuireann postanna ar fáil sa nGaeltacht ach ó am go ham bheadh imní orainn go mbhféidir go ndéanfadh cuid de na tionscail a tugtar isteach dochar don teanga.  I gcásanna den tsort sin tá cúram speisialta ar Ghaeltarra Éireann agus ar Roinn na Gaeltachta a bheith san áirdeall maidir le staid na teangan i dtionscail dá leithéid agus mor-thimpeall na comharsanachta. Le go rachaidh tionscalaíocht chun cinn sa nGaeltacht, ní mór na gnéithe a bhfuil baint dhíreach acu léi a bheith ann chomh maith, cuir i gcás, córas iompair, córas leitreachais agus córas gutháin.  San airgead seo atá beartaithe ag an Aire chun cabhrú le monarchana agus le tionscail sa nGaeltacht, an bhfuil breis airgead curtha ar fáil aige sa £25 milliún <Col N="1764" /> seo le córas iompair nó córas leithreachais nó córas gutháin ceart a chur ar fáil i dtreo go mbeidh fonn ar thionscaileoiri teacht isteach sa nGaeltacht?  Mar muna bhfuil ná bíodh sé ag súil go bhfaighidh sé aon chúnamh óna chomrádaithe sa Rialtas.</P>
    <P>Tá deireadh curtha ag an Aire Iompair agus Cumhachta leis an scéim a thug Fianna Fáil isteach le leitreachas níos saoire a chur ar fáil do dhaoine in áiteacha iargúlta.  Níl an tAire Poist agus Telegrafa sásta an coras gutháin a fheabhsú le freastal ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus in áit ísliú agus cothromaíocht a dhéanamh ar phraghasanna teastail do dhaoine agus d'earraí is amhlaidh gur ardaigh an tAire Iompair agus Cumhachta an luach.  Nuair atá na trí rudaí ar a mbraitheann tionscalaíocht agus feabhas tionscalaíochta agus forbairt tionscalaíochta sa nGaeltacht in easnamh an féidir bheith ag súil go mbeidh an tAire in ann tionscal a mhealladh isteach?  Iarraim ar an Aire aith-bhreithniú a dhéanamh ar a pholasaí tionscalaíochta i leith na Gaeltachta má tá polasaí á thúirt aige.  Ní féidir a bheith ag snámh in aghaidh na taoide.</P>

Cé go raibh deacrachtaí an domhain ag brú orainn, mar sin féin rinne Gaeltarra obair an-mhaith chun fostaíocht a mhéadu.  Aon duine a thugann cuairt ar an Ghaeltacht, chífidh sé an obair.

Tá an ceantar beag seo in iarthar Corcaigh agus tá súil againn go léir go n-aithneoidh an Rialtas é mar cheantar Ghaeltachta sul i bhfad. Sé an rud speisialta atá ag baint leis na Gaeitachtaí go léir go bhfuil na daoine ina gcónaí ina ndúthaigh féin laistigh den Ghaeltacht.  Tá obair á fáil acu.  Tá na scoileanna Gaeltachta acu.  Tá an tAifreann fiú amháin as Gaeilge agus tá spiorad na Gaeltachta i ngach áit.  Tá sin an-thábhachtach faoi láthair nuair atá an CEE againn.

Nuair a bhéas na tionscail nua tosnaithe i ndeireadh na bliana seo measaim agus roimh mhí Aibreán seo chugainn, sé sin, ag deireadh trí bhliain an Rialtais seo beidh níos mó tionscal bunaithe ar fud na Gaeltachta ná mar a bhunaigh Fianna Fáil ó 1954 go 1971.  Tá sé sin cruthaithe chomh maith mar thug an Taoiseach freagra anseo sa Dáil an tseachtain seo caite.  Dúirt sé gur thuit an daonradh sa Ghaeltacht beagnach 20 faoin gcéad ó 1956 go dtí 1971.

      <P>I move amendment No. 17b:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (2), after line 54, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) In estimating the market value of shares in a company part of the assets of which do not constitute taxable wealth the total value of the shares shall be reduced by the same proportion as such assets bear to the total assets of the company&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are, as the Minister knows very well, in the previous section a list of different kinds of items which are exempt in effect from wealth tax.  If a company owns among other assets some bloodstock or superannuation funds coming within the terms of section 7, then such items as bloodstock and superannuation funds are, according to section 7, exempt from wealth tax.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that where such exempted items form part of the assets of a company, then the valuation of the shares of that company for the purpose of wealth tax will reflect the exemption of such items by being reduced proportionately as indicated in the amendment.</P>

This assumes quite wrongly that the only matter taken into account in the valuation of the shares of a company is the asset <Col N="1770" /> basis, which of course is not so.  In valuing shares underlying assets are but one of the many elements which are taken into account, in addition, for instance, to a company's current performance, its past history, its future prospects, its dividend record, the nature of its products, its gearing, its liquidity, the market and so forth. To isolate just one of these aspects, to take out the whole or part of the underlying assets of a company from all the other constituents which go to make up the value of a share and then to apply the exemption to those particular assets and to none other and have the exemption reflected in the value of the shares would in fact be virtually impossible.  It would be particularly difficult to carry out this operation where the shares were quoted on the stock exchange. Secondly, even if it were possible it would present enormous difficulties for both the private and the public sector to reach agreed valuations.  In fact I would say it would be virtually impossible to do so and we would have endless arguments as attempts were made to reconcile different approaches.  Thirdly, the amendment is of little practical significance as the majority of exemptions apply to assets which are not normally owned by a trading company, for instance, a private dwelling-house and its effects, superannuation benefits or their funds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Artistic objects, gardens and growing timber.  These are not normally the assets of the trading company.  Superannuation benefits or their funds are not the assets of a trading company; they may be assets of the intended beneficiaries but they are not assets of a trading company as such which are taken into account in valuing the shares of the company.  If they were, then they would not be within the control or available for future benefit of the beneficiaries if they were assets of a separate entity, the trading company.  Fourthly, the fundamental <Col N="1771" /> problem is this: exemptions from tax can only be given to property which is liable to tax.  Since the property comprised in a trading company is not liable to tax an exemption cannot be applied to it.  It is the shares only which may be liable to tax if the wealth holding of the owner of the shares is such as to exceed the thresholds, but one cannot say that all the shares are held by one person and that accordingly the assets of the firm which are exempted from tax should be reflected by a reduction in the shares of that particular person.</P>
      <P>I am sure that even though Deputy Colley might wish to pursue the line of the principle which he set out in his amendment, he will see that it presents impossible practical problems. The shareholders who own shares which are liable for tax are not entitled to the underlying property because we are dealing with two separate beings, the company on the one hand and the person on the other. The ownership to the property lies in the company, not in the persons. Therefore the shareholders are not entitled to any exemptions to which an owner of the property would be entitled.  In any event, the small number of cases which would be involved I am convinced would not justify doing a very serious violence to a fundamental and logical element in the tax, especially when the parties who are interested have control over the situation.  If they want benefits they can obtain the benefits themselves.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I would urge that the amendment, whatever be the motives behind it&mdash;I am not being disparaging about them&mdash;is not capable of being worked and, in any event, would not be of any value to the normal case under the Bill.  If it was to be of assistance it would only be of assistance in cases that were being created for the purpose of avoiding tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The motive behind the amendment is, of course, as can be seen on its face, to try to get some degree of equity into this Bill.  How the Minister manages to drag in, as <Col N="1772" /> he does in the very last sentence he uttered, the question of avoidance is beyond me.  It is really quite a simple matter that is involved in this.  To talk about its not applying because in the case of a trading company the company itself is not liable to wealth tax ignores the terms of the amendment which relates to the value of shares in a company.  The Minister said that in the case of superannuation funds they would not belong to the company, they would belong to the person contributing to the fund. On the previous section the Minister for Lands, who was standing in for the Minister for Finance, said the direct opposite.  When I suggested that the position was as the Minister for Finance has just said, the Minister for Lands assured us that paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of the previous section did not mean that at all.  It is very difficult to know, especially with the Minister for Lands alternating with the Minister for Finance, if they are saying contradictory things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was not here.  May I briefly point out that I <Col N="1774" /> was suggesting to the Minister that he ought to be careful about the wording of that?  It seemed to me that it was only relating to the right to receive certain benefits or periodic payments as distinct from the actual benefits or payments.  The benefits or payments could be interpreted as meaning the capital value of people's periodic payments.  The Minister for Lands said it did not mean that.  It meant the right to receive and when received they were then taxable in the hands of the recipient.  It is not relevant to this amendment.  It is only relevant to something the Minister for Finance said in response to it.</P>
      <P>The basic thinking behind this amendment seems to be quite straightforward and simple.  Let me illustrate it this way.  Admittedly it is an extreme case.  I do not think it is an impossible case but it illustrates the point at issue.  If you have a company 50 per cent of whose assets consist of bloodstock and 50 per cent of other property, is the Minister saying that whether you include the value of the bloodstock or not virtually makes no difference to the value of the shares because of all the other factors which have to be taken into account?  I do not think the Minister would contend that and, if that is not so, if it would make an appreciable difference in the value of the shares, then the whole point of this amendment should be quite clear to the Minister.  It is an attempt to get the value of the shares to reflect what is stated in section 7. The beginning of section 7 says:</P>
      <P>Tax shall not be payable in respect of the following property and such property shall not be taxable wealth.</P>
      <P>It then lists the various kinds of property. According to what the Minister is now saying that should read:</P>
      <P>Tax shall not be payable in respect of the following property and such property shall not be taxable wealth provided that it does not form part of the wealth of a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the Minister is now saying. That is not what section 7 says. The Minister now tells us that is how <Col N="1775" /> this Bill will operate.  If that is so, it is a little unfortunate that it was not spelt out in section 7.  It seems to me that the principle involved in this amendment is clear and equitable.  If the Minister does not choose to accept it, there is not very much I can do about it.  I have drawn his attention to what appeared to me to be an oversight.  Now it appears to be deliberate. If it is deliberate I regret that section 7 was not properly drafted to make quite clear what the position is, as the Minister now indicates it to be, and as he wants it to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental principle that exemptions and taxable liability go hand in hand.  You cannot have an exemption unless there is a taxable entity in the first place.  In other words, there must be a taxation liability before the exemption comes into play.</P>

      <P>I am not making a snide remark but it seems a contradiction in terms.  I do not quite understand it.  If the Deputy is looking for <Col N="1776" /> an exemption it means there is a taxation liability in the first place. What must be realised is that as far as a trading company is concerned the assets are different from the shares.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to the market value of the shares.  If the assets of the company were represented as to 50 per cent by bloodstock, can it be seriously contended that the value of the shares is not affected if one ignores the exemption in section 7 for bloodstock?</P>

If an individual is the owner of shares in a trading company which owns bloodstock and he does not like the arrangement under this Bill, he can very cheaply and very quickly rearrange his affairs to get whatever benefits he wants.  It is not for us to legislate in order to deal with extraordinary situations. It is not for people who have arrangements which can be quickly dissolved to adjust themselves to the legal provisions if they want to get the genuine benefits intended in the Bill without creating a huge paraphernalia of complexities.</P>

      <P>In reason.  You cannot escape out of every situation on that argument.  I want to ask the Minister a couple of questions.  The word &ldquo;company&rdquo; can mean what is called a public company.  I do not mean a semi-State body but a public company within the meaning of the Companies Acts, a private trading company and a private non-trading company.  In the case of any company quoted on the Stock Exchange I take it that the Revenue Commissioners will <i>prima facie</i> accept that as a valuation of the shares.  This is so in another Bill.  Can we start on the assumption that that would be the first normal standard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Market value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the determination of market value.  The accounting yardstick would be to take the shareholders' funds, that would be the assets, in a sense, and to relate that to the number of shareholders.  Is that not so?  Is that not what you do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only asset valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the valuation, the market value of the share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not necessarily assets alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you have one of two things.  You have either that, or you have a measure of actual transactions.  In the case of certain private companies I quite agree there may not be transactions.  But if you have the market transactions, surely <i>bona fide</i> transactions in the market would be what would determine it.  Is that not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about a public company now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Any company where there would be a trading in its shares.  It is conceivable that you could trade in the shares of a private company. The standard that would be taken there would be, first of all, I take it, that by an analogy with the acceptance of the standard of the Stock Exchange if there were <i>bona fide</i> transactions that they would be the next thing taken as market value by analogy.  If you have not either of these two things available&mdash;but remember I stressed both of these as being the norm, I mean the natural and normal meaning of the word &ldquo;market value&rdquo;&mdash;then you look at the accounts and the balance sheet in particular and take as a norm what would by and large determine the market values in shares that were on the market.  In other words, there are many cases where you could see how the values of shares have gone up and down.  I know the perturbation of the economic situation does confuse the argument.  Supposing one talks about normal times, the performance of the profit and loss account in the balance sheet would be interpreted in a certain standard way and that standard way would largely determine the Stock Exchange quotation. Therefore what would have determined the Stock Exchange quotation, I would imagine, would be the standard that the Revenue Commissioners would try to apply.  If that is so, then the assets of the company, whatever it may be, private or public, come into play and Deputy Colley's amendment makes sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking as an individual now who has been involved in this situation of a private company.  There are a large number of aspects that must be taken into consideration, and the persons who look at the share first of all think of two things.  First of all the asset backing, the net asset backing.  The second one they think of is: &ldquo;How much lolly do I get into my pocket per share per annum?&rdquo;  That is not the whole picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have one good decision here in <Col N="1779" /> our MacNamees case which went into the valuation of shares in, I think, a private company in Drogheda or Dundalk.  I think it was a milling company or something of that sort. Numerous things had to be taken into consideration.  I am not talking about majority or minority shareholders.  I know one case where, on a quick look at it, the shares were valued&mdash;I will not mention names&mdash;at £65 per share. By the time all the various aspects were taken into consideration, this is the message that came back to us from the Revenue Commissioners.  We are in Committee and we are talking about a factual situation.  It happened to be a 56 per cent shareholding.  It ended up when the whole thing was finished at £22 or £24 per share.</P>
    <P>I am not faulting the Deputy on his approach to this because he has put his tentacles out in dealing with the aspects that have got to be considered on this.  One of the things one has to bear in mind in deciding on a share is history.  History is a peculiar thing because in this case it was accepted over a period of 20 years.  I am saying this advisedly in this House because the practice to date has been on the advice sent out to an executor dealing with shares in a private company: &ldquo;Give us your accounts for three years.&rdquo;  I have always questioned that because of my experience of this case where we went back 20 years and made a difference between £65 and £24 or £25, or something like that, as the ultimate valuation per share. There is far more to it than just looking at assets and dividends.  You have got to look at the liquidity situation. You have got to look at the past history and you have got to look at it from the point of view of the prognosis for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever you have to look at is not the real point at issue here.  Does the inclusion or exclusion of what are exempted under section 7 make a difference or not?  Is that not the net issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the problems.  It is very hard to define what is the excluded asset and what is the included asset for the purpose <Col N="1780" /> of tax.  It could have various rights built up on included or excluded assets.  After all, the taxpayer is being asked to pay tax on the share as it stands on the notional market value, what an expert accountant or financier would advise the person to pay for the share.  The section goes further because you must look at the share from the point of view of a seller of the share.  This is where private enterprise has its hand in the thing, and rightly so, because you do not want to see a vendor kicked around.  After all, he owns the property. It is only right to look at it from the point of view of the holder of the share, the holder of the property and the rights to it.</P>
      <P>May I say another thing here? Deputy de Valera will appreciate this and I am sure Deputy Colley will appreciate it.  I am not making a distinction between the two learned gentlemen, both lawyers.  The point is this.  Shares are quite distinct from the property that underlies them. Law courts, over and over again, both in taxation, liquidation and other disputes, have always made that distinction.</P>
      <P>Our system of law makes a clear distinction between the two and only look at the share.  Basically, our approach on this&mdash;I am not talking from the point of view of tax, I am talking from the point of view of everyday lawyers and businessmen dealing with this&mdash;is a just and fair way.  I understand that on the Continent there are other more sophisticated methods looked at but if I was a banker advancing money to a company I would feel very happy about the way the Irish Revenue Commissioners value shares because one knows where one is going.  Under the common law system we have an elastic mind in business.  I am not using that phrase in a nasty way.</P>
      <P>Dealing with what we deal with outside this House, as lawyers and accountants, we have a very good <i>modus vivendi</i> with Revenue.  I am sure Deputy de Valera will admit that there is a good understanding in practical terms in valuation of property which is what we are dealing with under this section.</P>

      <P>Fair enough.  On the valuation of shares there are so many imponderables.  My experience, and a lot of lawyers and accountants will agree with me, is that there has been a fair and reasonable understanding in particular cases.  Basically, the Revenue Commissioners approach the matter on the basis, &ldquo;there is the share, maybe one in a hundred, that is the valuation and that is the way the company stands&rdquo;.  I have had a lot of experience dealing with the Valuation Office and they have always understood a special case.  If they want to knock one they will always tell that person why they are doing it and they will give the evidence.  If a man stands back and likes to do it by way of distant correspondence and threatening writs and so on he gets into trouble, fair enough but if a man is fair and straight with the Revenue Commissioners they will be fair and straight with him.</P>
      <P>I can tell Deputy de Valera, he may know about the case, that in the last six months where there was a question of value&mdash;I am talking about companies and so on&mdash;it meant a difference of 33 per cent and 24 per cent for estate duty after arguments across the table and a full disclosure of facts on both sides, there was fair treatment given.  We were giving the better and fairer treatment.  The Revenue Commissioners if given the law and a means of doing it will do it.  Under this section they are given every liberality to be fair, as they have shown themselves to be up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only trouble that has occurred to date is that in certain cases the Revenue Commissioners have been restricted on valuation.  Section 8, if I may use the phrase, is a grand old liberal section that gives us fair room to play with from the taxpayers' point of view.  I would not like to see anything else there.  I would be afraid that Deputy Colley might be bringing in a restrictive element rather like slicing little elements under a microscope, and I do not like seeing that where valuation is concerned.  We have always had a tradition of the rounded term and the rounded valuation. <Col N="1782" /> It suited most people.  That is a factual statement and it will be borne out by any other practising lawyer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that subsection (1) takes the relevant wording from the Finance Act of 1894 and that that wording has been judicially criticised in Britain, as recently as 1967, as going too far.  The words in this subsection have been judicially held to mean that the valuation is to be based on a price that would be paid by a purchaser with a particular interest in the property.  In one case where there was a residence adjoining an institution it was agreed that the value of the house as a residence was £750 but the trustees of the adjoining institution were anxious to acquire it for the purpose of extending their premises and were willing to pay at least £1,000 for the house.  It was held in court that the statutory value of that house was £1,000.  I mention that as an illustration of the effect of the words used in this subsection which have been judicially criticised.  It seems unfortunate that they should be repeated again without an effort made to find a formula that would not go rather as far, than use a formula that was criticised for going too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that there is a major omission in the section which deals with the method by which the market value of property is established.  That major omission is that there is no provision made in the case of a business which is making a loss or for a reduction in the early years of a business when, in almost all cases, it cannot be expected to make a profit.  It may be argued that wealth tax is totally unrelated to income.  In one sense it is but in reality the ability to pay wealth tax must be related to income or alternatively <Col N="1783" /> the whole object of wealth tax is, in such cases, to cause property to be sold up for the purpose of paying wealth tax.  I would not have thought that that was an avowed purpose of this Bill.  If it is not then this omission is a serious one.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the consequences of section 3, subsection (4), in relation to reversionary interests and to suggest that section 8 ought to contain provision to the effect that a reversionary interest would be valued as such and not as property in possession, which it is deemed to be under section 3 (4).  It does not seem on the face of the section that there is any provision for that and that, consequently following out the earlier provisions of the Bill, where there is a reversionary interest it is likely to be valued as such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that section 3 (4) refers to (ii).  That is the note I have.  This has been dealt with a few times.  Section 3 (4) is dealing with an artificially created situation. In regard to an artificially created situation we were talking about the avoidance measures that could be created.  Are we going to go into that, to value that artificial situation, when the whole tenor of the Act is to catch that as one unit, an artificially created situation by the owner of the property? That makes no sense at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy is being unfair to himself because he saw there was an avoidance measure that could be created here.  His remarks, or those of his adviser, in regard to section 3, subsection (4), are wrong on this.  The Deputy agreed in this House that that (ii) at the top of page 3 was to avoid abuse, an artificially created situation.  I may be wrong in this, but the Deputy agreed to this earlier on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we are at cross purposes on this, but let me make it quite clear.  First, I have no adviser who suggested I put forward <Col N="1784" /> this particular point; I am putting it forward of my own volition.  I am doing so because while I recognise the purpose of the provision of section 3, subsection (4), and the provision at the top of page 3, I did at the time, and subsequently, and I now again say that the consequences of this is to have two persons liable for wealth tax in respect of the same property at the same time.  The Minister for Finance &mdash;it may not have been he&mdash;in connection with that spelled out that in those circumstances the Revenue Commissioners would opt as to which one they would go for.  That is not the point at issue here.  The point at issue is this: that because of those provisions a person who is the owner of a reversionary interest is deemed for the purpose of the Bill to be entitled in possession.  If the nature of his ownership is a reversionary interest it should be valued as a reversionary interest and not as if he were in possession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  The provisions in the Bill cover limited interests of all types, not merely the reversionary expectant on the determination of a limited interest created by the person.  Section 3, subsection (4), provides:</P>
      <P>Where the property to which an individual is beneficially entitled in possession includes a reversion expectant on the determination of a limited interest, the individual shall himself be deemed to be entitled in possession to that limited interest and the provisions of this section shall apply accordingly.</P>
      <P>That is quite independent of whether he created a limited interest or not.  If what is in effect a limited interest but is artificially deemed to be an interest in possession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree it is.  I have no desire whatever to get back on to section 1 or section 3.  The only reason I made any reference to it was to point out that the earlier provisions of the Bill provide what is, as Deputy Esmonde said, an artificial determination in certain circumstances, not just the ones he mentioned, in others too. All I am saying in relation to this section is that, because there is such an artificial situation deemed to exist, does not mean that in valuing interests one is to ignore the reality of what the interest is worth.  That is the only point I am making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is no changing of the rules between estate duty and assessment of value for wealth tax.  These rules have stood the experience of some 81 years&mdash;a fair period of time&mdash;and they have caused little difficulty.  During that period, certainly since 1910, there was only one appeal to the courts from the assessments which were made on the value.</P>
      <P>If the Revenue Commissioners do not accept the assessment of the taxpayer, the Revenue Commissioners suggest another figure.  The normal practice is for a compromise to be reached.  Speaking as a practitioner, it was my usual experience that clients were content to accept the compromise figure, and they felt that if they pushed it to an appeal they might do worse.  That is the practice that is going to operate under wealth tax also.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Commissioners may call in a valuer to give an assessment and may be responsible for the fee of the valuer.  The provisions are extremely reasonable.  Supposing we try to legislate rules for valuation, I am certain we would end up in an artificial situation.  The rules of valuation, the relevant considerations of 1975, might not be those of 1980, 1985 or 1995.  If we try to fit all valuations into a straitjacket it might do injustice to private citizens as well as to the Revenue Commissioners.  In fact, what section 8 says is that the rules of the market place will apply.  Of course, there is always room for argument about what is the appropriate value of a property.  Every vendor thinks he is not getting enough, and every purchaser thinks he is paying too much.</P>

      <P>Human avarice and human need blend and the correct figures are struck.  I was not quite in sympathy with the point Deputy Colley was making.  He suggested that it was wrong if the value of a particular property was to be inflated because the neighbouring owner to that property wanted it more than anybody else in the world and was prepared to outbid everybody else.  So be it.  That is the value of the property, and if that property did not have its proximity to the person who was prepared to pay that high price, it would not have that value.  That is what is relevant&mdash;its proximity to an occasion of demand; its proximity to an area which would command the high price.  That is as relevant as fashion, as any other factor which determines the price.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners would look into the Deputy's <i>bona fide</i> as a bidder.  Obviously, they would not take the random demand or indication because if that were to be allowed every mischievous neighbour could create great embarrassment. It is the factors that operate on the market.  These things cannot be legislated for, and I think that in trying to do it you would end up in a bigger mess than even the worst nightmares that the people might be dreaming for themselves at the moment.</P>

      <P>In view of what Deputy de Valera just mentioned there what I might call the special purchaser Deputies were thinking of, I have to admit as a professional man that I settled the case on the basis of a bid made and I could have kicked myself afterwards when I thought that I was a little negligent in not examining behind the bid that was made.  I am dealing with the strict terms of market value for estate duty purposes.  I walked into it a little bit. Part of the reason why I walked into it&mdash;this is a confession now of a professional man talking and not mentioning clients&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all had experience of this.  I was in the Land Commission Appeals Tribunal one day and the price, we will say, was 70X, and in went my valuer into the witness box and produced a telegram: &ldquo;I have got a bid for 80X as the price of the place&rdquo;, so that fixed the value and the Tribunal fixed the value on that basis.  Of course neither the Tribunal nor myself nor the Land Commission examined behind that 80X.  I took it as axiomatic and I used the same approach in another case in which I was at the paying end.  I was at the grabber's end in the first one, at the paying end, and I did not twig it, and <Col N="1788" /> my clients paid the duty.  Fair enough, on my advice, solicitor's advice, valuer's advice, and we agreed.  Deputy de Valera is quite right to raise this question of the special purchase, particularly as we are a developing country.  Anybody who has been involved in property evaluation realises that there are about 20 different areas that command 20 different prices and there are 20 different types of soil and 20 areas of climate.  Open market values are what have to be considered. This is what has to be considered without limitations being written into the Act.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said this section gives far too much power to the valuation commissioners.  When I first looked at this Bill I wanted limitations. Section 8 is based on all the sections that are relevant to the valuing of assets for estate duty purposes.  We all know estate duty was an unjust tax.  The actual instruments in relation to valuing the property that was possibly subject to estate duty worked, and worked very well.</P>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned various cases.  As far as my knowledge as a lawyer goes, there were only three reported cases since the beginning of the century that dealt with the value of the shares in a company.  They are the only ones that give difficulty, because the other ones can be dealt with by auctioneers' valuation by the national arbitrator.  As regards going to court on the assessment values of shares in a company and in private companies, there are only three reported cases over that long period of time.  I think I am right in saying that the three cases were the Jameson case, the Smith case and the McNamee case.  The McNamee case was in 1948.  If any layman is concerned about the powers of the Revenue Commissioners, he will see in the judgment of the late Martin Maguire a very good judgment in relation to what is evasion and avoidance and the way you value shares in a private company and all the possible matters that can come into the consideration of the valuation of the shares of a company. I would add one that may not appear in the report, that is, the historical interest of a company, and that can go back to Tib's eve.  There is no limit on how far it can go back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> If one is a private practitioner acting for a person in relation to assets that have got to be valued for revenue purposes, this is the one skeleton in the cupboard or the unknown terror that we all have in relation to property. It is due to the fact that a lot of transactions take place rather under cover.  Property is not sold by public auction or if it is sold by public auction, people do not appreciate all the conditions that are attendant on the title and value of the property. People say a property of 40 acres was sold for such and such but Jim Ryan's was sold for another price.  How do you make that out?  From my experience of negotiating professionally with the Valuation Office&mdash;I should not stigmatise it as the Valuation Office but the Commissioners always refer a case to the Valuation Office unless it is agreed in the first instance &mdash;I can say they are skilled in this matter.  Might I say that the valuers are not just valuers; a lot of them have other sciences to their credit, agriculture, and so on.  They take a very reasonable and liberal view provided they are presented with the proper facts and the proper case.</P>
    <P>If some smart aleck comes in and <Col N="1790" /> tries to get away with portion of the value, fair enough, he will be resisted, but if a fair case is put to them they will understand it.  They always have in my experience.  I am not criticising them on this but in fairness they have always, if there was a doubt, because estate duty was such a criminal tax, erred in favour of the alleged criminals, to use the old common law principle; they have always erred in favour of the taxpayer.  It is most important that that should have been their attitude to the matter.  All I can say is that I have the highest praise for them.  I know taxpayers may not think that way but talking to them as a professional man I know the difficulties they have to contend with.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to what may be a difficulty in this matter, but if he is satisfied I am not going to push it any further.  It seems to me that the definition of a &ldquo;private non-trading company&rdquo; is defined in section 6 only for the purposes of section 6.  I do not know, therefore, what carries that definition into section 9.  The Minister will note, in illustration of the point, that in subsection (2) (c) (ii) of <Col N="1793" /> this section, the references in both sections 6 and 9 are carried in.  I cannot see how the definition of the &ldquo;private non-trading company&rdquo; is carried into this section in the absence of the words the Minister is proposing to delete.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (1) there is a reference that the market value of each share shall be ascertained in a particular way.  It would appear that that has the effect of determining the method by which the market value of each share in the company will be ascertained, not merely each share in the holding of the assessable person referred to earlier in the subsection. Am I interpreting that correctly?  The subsection provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where there are included in the taxable wealth of an assessable person on a valuation date shares in a private trading company which is a company controlled by that assessable <Col N="1794" /> person on that date, the market value of each share shall be ascertained.</P>
    <P>I take it that that means the market value of each share in the company, as distinct from the market value of each share in his holding?  If it means as the Minister says, the market value of each share in the company, which I think is correct&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The market value of his shares would be related to the value of any control that he might have.  So one has to look at the control he has and see how that should be reflected in the share values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not questioning that part of it, but what I am saying is that it seems to me that if the conditions laid down in the subsection are fulfilled, then the subsection is saying that each share in that company is to be valued as if it formed part of a group of shares sufficient in number to give the owner of the group control of the company, and that that provision applies not just to the assessable person mentioned in the subsection but to every single share in the company.  I would like to be clear that I am interpreting this correctly because certain consequences follow if I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy would agree with me that there would be a different valuation on the shares of a person who has control of the company and the shares of a minority holder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The shares of the person with control would have a greater value than those of the person without that control.  So you have to look at the value of the shares of the person with control and not merely take an average of the value of the shares of the company.  That is quite a different thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was a minority shareholder, say, a holder of 5 per cent of the shares, who was an outsider to the assessable person referred <Col N="1795" /> to and was not a relative of his, would that outsider's 5 per cent of the shares be valued as though they formed part of a group of shares sufficient in number to give that outsider, the owner of the shares, control of the company?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is not so, that is the right approach.  I am a little concerned because if each share referred to refers only to each share of the shares held by the assessable person, which follows from what the Minister is now saying, there does not appear to be much point in the subsection. It starts by saying &ldquo;Where there are included in the taxable wealth of an assessable person on a valuation date shares in a private trading company which is a company controlled by that assessable person&rdquo; then you treat the shares as if the owner of the shares had control of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too concerned about that.  I am more concerned that a minority interest would not be valued as if it formed part of a group of shares which gave the owner control.  If that seems to be what the Minister wants to achieve in it, I suggest that there should be clarification in regard to that phrase &ldquo;each share&rdquo;.  It should revert to something like &ldquo;each share in such holding&rdquo; or some such phrase, to make it clear that it is not referring to each share in the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister make it clear, because it has been interpreted differently?  One of the contributory reasons for interpreting it differently is that the meaning the Minister says it has seems to make the whole purpose of the subsection meaningless.  In effect it is saying a person who has control is going to be valued as if he has control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To put it beyond doubt, he cannot come along and argue that the shares have a different value or a value which is dependent on the control.  I will certainly look at the point raised by the Deputy but I am giving notice that I do not think that there is any room for confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Deputy privately who raised it with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell him that.  It might have been raised with the Minister's office.  In subsection (3), line 54, the wording there again may be somewhat ambiguous.  It reads:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section a company shall be deemed to be a company controlled by an assessable person on a valuation date if it is a company controlled by that person on that date or if it was a company so controlled at any time in a period of 12 months prior to that date and, having ceased to be so controlled on that date, again becomes so controlled at any time in the period of 12 months subsequent to that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phrase with which I am concerned is &ldquo;having ceased to be so controlled on that date&rdquo;.  It might possibly be interpreted in a restrictive way as meaning that it actually had to cease being so controlled on the valuation date and not any other date.  That I am certain, is not what is intended. If so, it might be advisable to change that wording to &ldquo;not being so controlled on that date&rdquo;.  This would obviate any doubt that might arise. When the Minister gets a chance to look at it I think he will realise that if there is any danger of the interpretation <Col N="1797" /> as suggested a large loophole would be created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18a:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1) (a) (i), line 7, to delete &ldquo;lesser&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;greater&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section we are dealing with agricultural property comprised in the taxable wealth of an individual, who is a farmer, or fishing boats comprised in the taxable wealth of an individual, or hotel premises as defined in the section as comprising taxable wealth of an individual.  In subsection (1) there is a provision that in ascertaining the market value of property of this kind one of the steps in approaching it is to deduct from the market value of the property an amount equal to 50 per cent of the <Col N="1798" /> market value of the property or a sum of £100,000, whichever is the lesser.  This amendment is designed to substitute &ldquo;greater&rdquo; for &ldquo;lesser&rdquo;; in other words, to deduct a sum of £100,000 or 50 per cent, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that if he wants to put the properties of the kind dealt with in this part of the section I have outlined in a special category such as hotels, and so on, he should do the job right. The position, particularly in relation to hotels at the moment, could fairly be described as being one in which a valuation of hotel buildings and contents could very well figure in many cases much higher than their value as a hotel viewed from the point of view of a potential purchaser of the premises and contents as a hotel, if there was any such purchaser.  He would have to take account of losses in the hotel industry at the moment and the considerable risk of loss, and could very well, therefore, in taking this into account in putting forward an offer for the premises as a hotel, come up with a realistic figure which would be considerably less than the valuation which would be put on the premises and contents taken in their own right.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that this being the situation, the valuation arrived at under this section in the case of such hotels would turn out to be far too high in some cases and that it is not the way to go about the kind of relief that the Minister is seeking to give in this section, unless, of course, he wanted to drive hoteliers out of business altogether.</P>
    <P>In considering this, it is important to note also that there is a restriction provided on the amount of debts which may be deducted.  There are many hotels&mdash;this applies to the other properties mentioned, but particularly to hotels&mdash;which represent very heavy investment at this time at very considerable risk.  That being so, I am suggesting that the effect of this amendment would be to give a more realistic relief in such cases than is given by the subsection as drafted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let us begin where we should begin.  The value of any property will reflect any current boom or current depression. If there is a depression in the hotel market, as unfortunately there is, that will be reflected in the value of hotel property.  So that the value that would have been assessable for wealth tax purposes will not be that of the halcyon days of 1970 to 1973 but the value in 1975.  That is point (1).</P>
      <P>Point (2) is that no country with wealth tax is providing the generous thresholds of exemptions which are being provided here.

      <P>Subsection (1) of section 10 provides for special relief for agricultural property, hotel premises, fishing boats as defined, up to a value of £500,000.  It is intended to benefit the comparatively small man, the hotelier, the farmer, the businessman who has properties under that value.  There are not many in our community above that value and if they are above that value it is not unreasonable that they should pay wealth tax.  The wealth tax on a hotel or some other property which is providing employment will operate at the rate of .8 per cent.  Again, I take the lowest standard wealth tax rate.  Once the value of the exemption is exceeded, the taxpayer is entitled to a 20 per cent relief because the property is providing employment and it permits a deduction of the lesser of 50 per cent or £100,000 in the market value of the property.  By any standards this is very generous relief.  It has no counterpart elsewhere.  If, in addition, regard is had to the high thresholds and the other reliefs and exemptions, it would obviously be very difficult to justify any further concessions and still talk about having a wealth tax at all.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to exempt all such property under £100,000 and exempt 50 per cent of all property of a market value higher than that, irrespective of the total value of the property.</P>

      <P>If it is £200,000 under the Bill, its value after the £100,000 exemption would be <Col N="1801" /> £100,000.  Indeed, as I have just noticed, the amendment works out at the same figure in that particular case.  At £300,000, the value under the Bill would be £200,000 and under the amendment, £150,000.  At £400,000, the value under the Bill would be £300,000; under the amendment, £200,000.  It is certainly proposing to give further exemptions which are not warranted in the circumstances in which the wealth tax is going to bite in Ireland.  It is unrealistic. If we intend to have a wealth tax it must begin to bite at some threshold and the threshold at which it will operate here is, by any standards, generous and in certain categories extremely generous.</P>

      <P>That is appreciated. I do not think the Minister has answered yet the case that Deputy Colley is putting.  He has answered it by giving examples that are a bit misleading from elsewhere.  What he is suggesting is that in the case of the hotel premises there should be in view of the present situation a maximum allowance.  The Minister has not said what the valuation would be.  I admit that the Minister has indicated that it is valued as a hotel.  The valuation, as he said himself, compared to the halcyon days of 1970 could be considerably lower and that could influence the situation.  If it is going to be permissible to take the value of a building which at the moment is a hotel and ignore its real value but take its value as a hotel, that could influence the position.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Could I point out to the Minister and Deputy Esmonde that the hotels in this country are in a critical condition?  This amendment is trying in a small way to exempt them from wealth tax.  They should not be liable to wealth tax at all at this stage of our development.  Any productive assets which generate employment should also be completely exempt from wealth tax. We have tried to impress on the Minister the appalling conditions the tourist trade and hotels in general find themselves in today.  I was pointing out to the Minister that, under this section, Irish people who own hotels are at a <Col N="1809" /> disadvantage because they are levied with wealth tax and foreign companies owning hotels are exempt.  I agree, A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that it is a bit removed from Deputy Colley's amendment, but you will find that the substance of Deputy Colley's amendment tries to help the tourist industry.  I appeal to the Minister to defer the levying of taxation on the hotel industry and give them some encouragement to get on their feet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 13, subsection (1) (a) (ii), <Col N="1810" /> lines 8 and 9, to delete &ldquo;a proportion of&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The object of these amendments is in regard to the proposed deductions of debts and encumbrances to place no restriction on them.  In other words to allow to be deducted from the market value arrived at in accordance with (i) in this paragraph all genuine debts and encumbrances outstanding, and not to restrict the deductions in the way proposed in the Bill.  Why restrict the deduction of genuine debts at all?  If the debts are very heavy&mdash;and they will be in some of the cases we have been talking about &mdash;this restriction on deduction may well be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  The Minister said in relation to the previous amendment, which relates to the same property, that this part of the section was designed to assist the smaller man.  The formula provided here in regard to restrictions on deductions of debts favours the larger business.  The highest proportion of debts may be deducted by the most wealthy individual. That is, in fact, what the restriction is doing.</P>
    <P>My two amendments are designed to take away all restrictions and to say in the case of the properties covered in this subsection to which, according to the layout of the section, the Minister is trying to give special treatment, that if he is trying to give them special treatment, there should be allowed to be deducted all genuine debts and encumbrances incurred as indicated in the Bill, with no restrictions on those deductions.  I think that is a reasonable proposition, and to restrict them in this way is, to some extent, taking back with one hand what is given with the other in the earlier part of the subsection.</P>

      <P>Let me give an example.  If this does not correctly reflect the situation no doubt the Deputy will tell me.  Suppose A owns land valued at £100,000 and other assets of £80,000, that is, a total of £180,000.  The land would be taken as half the value which would mean that the value for tax purposes would be £50,000, other assets £80,000, that is, £130,000 would be its total value. Wealth tax would be £300.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are speaking about land which is agricultural property owned by an individual who is a farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Assume A borrows £100,000 to buy land of the value of £100,000.  Land and borrowing would cancel out each other so that, in equity, A should still pay the same amount of tax since his net assets are unchanged at £180,000. However, if the full debt was to be allowed, the following would be the position: value for tax, land, £100,000, other assets £80,000, totalling £180,000, less the entire debt, £100,000, would leave a net value of only £80,000 and therefore no tax would be payable.  Under the Bill the land would have a value for tax of £100,000, other assets £80,000, giving <Col N="1812" /> a total of £180,000.  You would deduct half of the debt, £50,000, total £130,000, and wealth tax therefore would be £300.  I would respectfully submit that that more truly reflects the position than the amendment.</P>

      <P>Unless I misunderstood the Minister, he was talking about a situation where a farmer had land worth £100,000 and other assets worth £80,000, and he then borrowed £100,000 to purchase additional land. Have I got that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, there might be some doubt as to whether in such a case this could be deemed to be a debt which was deductible unless he is farming out the whole lot together. And it is clear it is the one business he is engaged in.  What about the situation of an hotelier who is in a business which is giving virtually no return on his investment and which may be running at a loss who, in order to keep going has to borrow very considerably?  The Minister is saying: &ldquo;It is too bad.  You may have very heavy debts but you are not going to deduct them all, because we are already giving you a concession in regard to the valuation of the property&rdquo;.  In cases like that, why not allow the full deduction of debts, because failure to do so is, to some extent, taking back with one hand what is being given with the other in allowances in relation to the valuation of the property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1813" /> The Minister did not deny, and I would assume, therefore, that he agrees with my contention, that the formula involved here favours the more wealthy individual and that the greater the value of the property the higher the proportion of debt one is allowed to deduct.  Is that true?  That is my reading of the formula in (ii).</P>
    <P>If the property was worth £60,000 the deduction under (i) would be £30,000, 50 per cent, and the proportion of debts allowed to be deducted then would be a half.  On the other hand, if the property was worth £400,000 the deduction would be £100,000 and the proportion of debt deduction allowed would be three-quarters, that is £300,000 over £400,000.  In other words, the proportion of the balance remaining to the original value of the property, would seem to be the three-quarters and, therefore, the higher the value of the property the higher the proportion of debts allowed to be deducted.  Is there any quarrel with that argument?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy intending that the greater the proportion of the total property liable to tax the greater the debt deduction can be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if that amounts to the same thing I am saying, which is, that the higher the value of the property the higher the proportion of debt allowed to be deducted.  Does the Minister agree?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that he said, in relation to the reliefs in this subsection, they were intended to benefit the smaller man involved in this kind of business.  The admission he has just made shows that that is not so.  It does not work that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It applies to the others too, but particularly in the case of hotels at present to be placing restrictions on the amount of debt which they may deduct is unrealistic.  It is not recognising what their position is.  If they must be subjected to wealth tax, and as Deputy Fitzpatrick indicated in our view no <Col N="1814" /> productive assets should be subjected to wealth tax.  Hotels, particularly, should be treated as gently as possible or we will put even more of them out of business.  For that reason I am urging the Minister to accept these amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 13, subsection (1) (b) (i), line 21, to delete &ldquo;which is&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;and farm machinery which are&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give to farm machinery the same relief as is given to agricultural property under section 10 (1).  Agricultural property and hotel premises are entitled to a reduction of 50 per cent or £100,000 if owned by a genuine farmer.  If agricultural property is owned by an individual who is not a farmer or if valued at over £500,000, it is entitled to a reduction of 20 per cent under section 10 subsection (3). As the Bill stood, farm machinery was entitled only to the 20 per cent relief as productive property.  By the inclusion of farm machinery in subsection (1) the farm machinery and agricultural property in the ownership of a genuine farmer is entitled to 50 per cent or £100,000 reduction in value.  This relief will in fact apply where the value of the land or machinery is less than £500,000.</P>

      <P>Section 10 (3).  It is a consequence, as the Deputy will appreciate once the £500,000 is exceeded. The 50 per cent or the £100,000, when it goes over the £500,000 is less than 20 per cent.  It has less of a value than 20 per cent on assets above £500,000.</P>

      <P>I was just wondering. The Minister had referred to this earlier.  I did not see any provision to that effect.  As far as this amendment is concerned I welcome it because it is a step in the right direction.  I do not think it goes far enough.  Could I ask the Minister why, if he decided as he did in this amendment to include agricultural machinery or farm machinery with agricultural property, he did not also include such things as stocks of feed and fertiliser which are similarly part of a farmer's stock in trade.  How does he distinguish between farm machinery on the one hand and stocks of feed and fertiliser on the other?</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not show any reluctance heretofore to talk at some length on various topics. I am rather surprised that he did not even very briefly spell out what exactly he had in mind.  However, the point at issue before us on the Minister's amendment is to add to agricultural property farm machinery. As I have indicated, I consider that is a step in the right direction, but I am asking the Minister why he distinguishes between farm machinery on the one hand, and such things as stocks of feed and fertilisers on the other.  I am taking them as examples of part of the stock in trade of a farmer, which seems to me to be the same as farm machinery.  We did have an answer from Deputy Esmonde for which we are grateful, but I addressed the question to the Minister and I do not think the difficulties involved would be so insurmountable that the Minister would not be able to do this if he decided to do it.  I have no doubt that if this amendment put down by me were not down Deputy Esmonde would be telling us it would not be possible to do this and that people could sneak in other people's farm machinery who were not liable and so on.  I know there are all these possibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every time arguments like this come from the Opposition I say, there is another argument against giving any concession at all, <Col N="1821" /> because once you give one concession you are asked for another and you end up by not having any wealth tax at all.  That is not the Government's intention.  We have to draw the line somewhere and it is drawn now with great liberality.  The machinery is obviously substantial machinery, which is what is in mind here, and is something which is easily recorded and identified.  Its acquisition and disposal are easily dealt with in accounts and so on.  It is traceable, but quite a different area of uncertainty arises if one wants to visualise extending it into the areas that Deputy Colley has suggested.  I certainly am strengthened by the intimate knowledge of agricultural activity which Deputy Esmonde has, and his endorsement and wisdom is a great consolation to me.  Deputy Colley will understand if I am unable to find the same consolation from the advice that he has proffered in this regard, because I think he has about as much intimate knowledge as I have in this field.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that section, first of all I think that this amendment will be welcomed by very large numbers of the farming community. Would it be possible to explain to me later on the position in regard to agricultural property which was somewhat enlarged upon there?</P>
      <P>What is the position in regard to buildings which are distinct from the normal residence and the normal type of buildings attached to a farm house, say, silage pits and other such buildings?  Are they all exempted as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends where they are.  If they are within the acre they will be exempted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is why I would like the Minister to clarify it for me.  The position can arise that the dwelling house and a normal <Col N="1822" /> range of agricultural outhouses are in close proximity to the dwelling house but a farm may have a particular portion of land away from the dwelling house; even though it is distinct it forms part of a composite holding.  A farmer for convenience may have erected a silage pit, which is expensive.  A very considerable amount of money is being spent on erecting these silage pits.  I wonder if they come in under this subsection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is very difficult to produce laws which will cover every asset used and deal with the location of every asset.  For the vast majority of farm buildings the exemption of property within an acre contiguous to the main building would ensure that it would be exempt.  I can understand that there could be very good reasons for the location of a silage pit further removed from the house than the boundary of one acre, but when you have regard for the fact that agricultural land will enjoy 50 per cent exemption anyway, a reduction in value, there will be comparatively few cases in which the silage pit as such would be separately valued and given a specific value.  The silage pit in isolation is probably a valueless article.  It is something which is intrinsically part of the farm and is directly related to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am telling the Deputy what its effect would be, so that if the buildings to which Deputy Enright refers are within that area then they are certainly exempt.  If they are further removed from the house their value is probably less on that account and I consider, having regard to the very generous exemption, the special difficulty to which he adverts would not be a real one in the overwhelming majority of cases.  It could happen, but, as I say, it would be very exceptional that it should mean that a person would be paying significantly any greater tax in respect of the silage pit because it is some distance from the house rather than immediately beside it.</P>

For reasons of pollution it has to be removed and it is of great importance because even a reasonably small one costs in the region of £21,000. That is a surprising figure but that is true.  It will mean a big difference in <Col N="1824" /> the taxation.  I understand now from the Minister that they are not excluded unless they are within the acre.  I can assure you that none of them will be within the acre, because you cannot erect that type of a building so near a residence as that.</P>
