      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to replace the home assistance service, provided under the terms of the Public Assistance Act of 1939, by a new scheme of supplementary welfare allowances to be operated under the general direction of the Minister for Social Welfare and administered by the regional health boards.</P>
      <P>This is a somewhat technical Bill, of 29 sections, and I hope that the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill has been of assistance to Deputies in their consideration of the detailed proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes the repeal, for all practical purposes, of the Public <Col N="1330" /> Assistance Act, 1939 and thus the removal from our social welfare legislation of the remaining vestiges of the poor law.  I regard this as an important step forward in the development of the social services and one that is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The poor law was the legal embodiment of the attitudes of the last century, harsh and unfeeling attitudes which should have no place in the society of today.</P>
    <P>As Séamus Ó Cinnéide wrote in his study, <i>A Law for the Poor,</i> which is the standard work on the history of home assistance:</P>
    <P>under the Poor Law the assistance given was minimal, people were discouraged in every way from seeking assistance and the assistance was given in a miserly way. Practice may have varied over time and from place to place but the philosophy of the Poor Law was repressive and inhumane.  We must have a new philosophy now.</P>
    <P>I see this Bill as a realistic attempt at a radical overhaul of the home assistance service which I proposed as a major aim of my Department, when introducing the 1974 Estimate in this House.  The supplementary welfare allowances scheme is designed to fulfill a necessary residual and support role within the overall and income maintenance structure.  It is essential within any national system of social welfare to have a support service of last resort which can enable immediate and relatively flexible assistance to be provided for those in need who do not qualify for payments under other State schemes.  Such a service should also help those whose needs are inadequately met under the major schemes and those confronted with emergency situations.</P>
    <P>Thus, the supplementary welfare allowances scheme will become an effective part of the overall national social welfare service and will no longer be seen as an unconnected, poor relation of that service.  It will, however, retain and develop its local, community-based element which is a most important potential strength.  The <Col N="1331" /> problems of those who will need to avail of these allowances will, in most cases, be of a nature calling for more than a mere cash response.  Social services, social work support and genuine community care are also needed which can help the recipients to cope with the situations in which they find themselves and to find a place of dignity and full integration in our society.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a further step forward in the planned realisation of the Government's objective of creating a genuinely comprehensive social security system catering for the needs of all citizens.  Its effect will be to provide assistance, as of right, to a further substantial number of persons and families and to bring us nearer to the desired aim of giving income maintenance coverage to all.  It is another positive element in the Government's policy of alleviating and eliminating poverty and ending social injustice. This policy is being implemented progressively and systematically.</P>
    <P>The proposals contained in this Bill should be put in their proper perspective. While very considerable progress has been made in the development of the social welfare system by substantial improvements and extensions, designed to meet immediate and obvious social needs, it cannot be denied that the existing home assistance scheme has fulfilled, and continues to fulfill, a vitally important support role in areas where poverty is encountered in its most acute form.</P>
    <P>Home assistance, which is now provided under the Public Assistance Act, 1939, had its origins in the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1847, and was the only statutory form of assistance, other than institutional assistance, provided for persons in need until the beginning of this century.  Since then the overall need for the service has been eroded as State social insurance and assistance services, catering in different ways for loss of income arising from specific contingencies such as old age, sickness, unemployment, widowhood, were gradually introduced and expanded.  This is reflected in the numbers of beneficiaries, including dependants, which have fallen from <Col N="1332" /> 75,000, 30 years ago to around 30,000 at present.  The nature of the service has also changed in that the majority of recipients nowadays are persons who receive assistance to supplement payments under some other service or while awaiting other payments.  As a result of this evolution home assistance is financially a relatively small service, the cost in the last full year&mdash;1973-74&mdash;being approximately £2 million, as against expenditure on the State benefit and assistance schemes in 1975 of the order of £350 million.  The home assistance service which is financed from the rates is administered&mdash;as Deputies are aware&mdash;by 31 public assistance authorities, or by health boards acting on their behalf, subject to the general direction and control of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>A person is eligible for home assistance if he is unable, by his own industry or other lawful means, to provide the necessities of life for himself or his dependants.</P>
    <P>Applications for assistance are made to the local assistance officer who implements the service in an assistance district of convenient size within each administrative area.  In urgent cases, and pending decision by the appropriate authority, the assistance officer can grant to eligible applicants assistance in food, fuel and other necessaries.  All applications are dealt with by the appropriate authority which decides whether a person is eligible and what assistance should be given.</P>
    <P>Generally grants of home assistance are not made for more than one month at a time but in cases of permanent infirmity they may be renewed every three months.  The home assistance service, as at present operated, has been the subject of widespread criticism for years.  My own views on the service have been expressed quite unequivocally in this House.</P>
    <P>Surveys of the service have shown that, because of major defects in its structure, it operates in an arbitrary and far from satisfactory manner. Major inequalities exist as regards the <Col N="1333" /> standards of eligibility and levels of payments as between one authority and another and even within the same authority in the treatment of basic needs.  Similarly, in the manner of supplementation, wide differences in the treatment of similar cases are evident. This scope for local variation and for arbitrary exclusion stems from the wide differences in the financial circumstances of the various local authorities involved, as well as from the fact that the existing law does not, with any precision, define the circumstances in which assistance may be paid or the amount of assistance to be provided.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most serious criticism of home assistance has been that its operation has always been discretionary, with no right to assistance existing for the applicant.  Arguing for the extension of social assistance to cover all social contingencies and needs, Professor Kaim-Caudle&mdash;in his important survey of social policy in the Irish Republic&mdash;has made the point that discretionary allowances, without any right of appeal or review, have all the unpleasant flavour of the poor law.</P>
    <P>Criticism of the home assistance service has been a feature of social and political comment for many years. Indeed, the debate in this House on the Public Assistance Bill, 1939, contained some striking contributions which reflected the existence even then of much disquiet about various features of the scheme.  Speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill&mdash;on 6th June, 1939, at columns 537 and 538 of the Official Report&mdash; the then Leader of the Labour Party, the late Deputy William Norton, said that:</P>
    <P>Here in this country, both in our approach to the workhouse system and to the manner in which we distribute relief, as well as in the low scale of relief which we provide, we proceed to assume, I am afraid, in our approach to that problem, that poverty is something on which you are entitled to upbraid a person... there is very little real effort made to raise either the conception of life or the conditions of life of those who are unfortunately compelled to resort to it for sustenance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> That criticism was made 36 years ago in the course of a Dáil debate on a measure which was designed to do more than codify and co-ordinate the poor law code.  These words very clearly summed up the underlying philosophy of the poor law and its defects.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most striking criticism of the service is that contained in Séamus Ó Cinnéide's study, <i>A Law for the poor,</i> published in 1970.  In this he stated that:</P>
    <P>It may be argued that home assistance is very different from the outdoor relief given under the Poor Law from 1847 but the facts contradict this.  Now, as then, persons in need have no right to assistance; they are dependent on the goodwill of the authority which gives assistance and cannot have recourse to any appeals machinery, including the courts.  Now, as then, no great effort is made to seek those in need and the public image of the service is forbidding.  Now, as then, the emphasis is on saving the ratepayer's money.  Now, as then, the method by which assistance is given is inconvenient and compromising of the self-esteem of those who must avail themselves of it.</P>
    <P>If it can be said of any social service that it is compromising of the self-esteem of citizens of our country, then surely the time for reform cannot be further delayed.</P>
    <P>One recent social survey among poor people showed quite clearly that more than a quarter of persons who were actually receiving home assistance at the time of interview did not admit this fact to the interviewers and the author of the survey was forced to the conclusion that this was due to a basic feeling of shame associated with the service.</P>
    <P>Another survey has underlined this most serious issue of the stigma attaching to a poor law type of service. A pensioner was quoted as saying: &ldquo;I wouldn't go within a mile of the home assistance&mdash;it has the brand of poverty on it&rdquo;, and a young mother was quoted as describing her feelings: &ldquo;People make you feel like an outcast when you are on assistance <Col N="1335" />&mdash;you would think it was out of their own pockets the money was coming.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the technical or theoretical criticisms of the existing home assistance service, I believe that this element of stigma is by far the most important reason for reform. Improvements such as those proposed in the Bill cannot change attitudes but they can contribute to removing the most obvious causes of those attitudes and to ending the social division between home assistance recipients and the members of the community which appears to be an inevitable result of the present system. The present law, therefore, includes provisions deriving from the poor law which are unacceptable in a modern welfare system.  I can refer here to provisions such as that which makes it an offence, punishable by imprisonment, for a person in receipt of assistance to refuse or neglect to perform a task of work which he is required by the Act to perform.  Such provisions, which go back to the poor law, have been inoperative for many years but their existence demonstrates the need for radical reform.</P>
    <P>In proposing this reform, I want to state again that a scheme such as home assistance has always been necessary and that it has been an essential service for many people.  Its inherent defects have, however, rendered the service to a large degree ineffective in human and community terms.</P>
    <P>The general criticism of home assistance to which I have referred has, at times, involved criticism of the officers who have had the task of implementing it over the years.  I cannot go along with such criticism and I wish, at this stage, to place on record my appreciation of the work of the home assistance officers throughout the country who have sought to apply the terms of an outdated and thoroughly defective scheme with humanity and with concern to relieve the deep-seated problems of many individuals and families in distress. I hope that the new proposals contained in the Bill will provide all who will work to implement them <Col N="1336" /> with a more suitable framework for their efforts in the future.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the detailed provisions of the Bill which will introduce the new system of supplementary welfare allowances.  The reforms envisaged by this Bill are designed to meet pressing need in a flexible and speedy manner while at the same time guaranteeing to all persons who have to depend on the service a standard basic minimum income as of right in place of the arbitrary and variable payments they may receive at present.  These basic payments would be subject to a standard means test.</P>
    <P>While uniform basic rates must be a fundamental feature of the new service, the diversity of recipients and the variety of the circumstances which cause them to seek assistance require that there must also be a considerable element of flexibility in the service to meet particular needs.  The service must, therefore, include provision to permit the basic rates of allowance, or, indeed, the payments under the various State income maintenance services, to be supplemented so that the special needs of individual claimants may be met.  Similarly, there must be flexible provision for special aid in emergencies.</P>
    <P>Another objective of the new service is that it must be capable of being co-ordinated on a family-oriented basis with a comprehensive range of non-monetary social work services, the overall objective of which will be to break the cycle of poverty in which some families find themselves.  There must also, of course, be the maximum possible co-ordination between the service and the social insurance and assistance income maintenance services administered by my Department.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to achieve the broad uniformity of approach required in dealing with these matters if they were left to a number of independent administrative authorities to work out for themselves.  Administration of the new supplementary welfare allowances scheme through the health boards, which will apply national standards and national guidelines, will eliminate the territorial inequalities <Col N="1337" /> of the existing system in relation to standards of eligibility and payments, and will enable the service to be operated within the framework of the community care services of these boards.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and those of his dependants will be entitled to supplementary welfare allowances. Providing allowances as of right will remove one of the main poor law connotations of the Public Assistance Act, 1959, under which assistance is provided purely on a discretionary basis.</P>
    <P>As I have stated earlier, the home assistance service has over the years been replaced in very large measure by special schemes which give rights to benefit to specified categories of persons in need.  The provisions of benefit as of right for persons in need who happen to be excluded from such special schemes is a feature of corresponding residual benefit services in other countries with highly developed systems and is long overdue in this country.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements whereby an allowance is available as of right, instead of at discreation, means that specific exceptions must be made to ensure that only cases of genuine need are covered.  An exception is, therefore, made in the case of students receiving full-time education who as individuals could be regarded as having no means but who are, in fact, normally the responsibility of their parents.  Provision is also made to exclude persons in full-time work and persons directly involved in trade disputes.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear, however, that these exclusions are not absolute.  In the first place, a person in any of the categories excluded may receive an allowance where there is urgent need.  Also, even where urgent need does not exist, a person receiving full-time education could in exceptional circumstances be paid an allowances, an example being a student who is the head of a household. Similarly, although persons in <Col N="1338" /> full-time employment will normally be excluded, a person who has been receiving an allowance while out of work may, under regulations to be made by the Minister, have his allowance continued for a short period after he starts work to help him in the transitional period.  The provisions for exclusion of persons directly involved in trade disputes are similar to those applying in relation to unemployment benefit and assistance, except that power is included to allow payments in respect of dependants to be made during a trade dispute.</P>
    <P>While the administration of the home assistance schemes is, under the Public Assistance Act, 1939, a function of the public assistance authorities, that is, the corporations of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford and 27 county councils including North and South Tipperary, these authorities have, except, in the case of ten county councils, transferred their functions in that respect to the health boards under powers given by the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>The new supplementary welfare allowances will be administered by the health boards subject to the general direction and control of the Minister for Social Welfare.  Claims for the new allowance will be determined by the chief executive officer or other officers of each board acting on his behalf.</P>
    <P>Subjects to regulations to be made by the Minister, a health board may determine that a person shall not be entitled to the new allowance unless he is registered for employment.  It is intended that provision will be made in regulations for general exemptions from this rule in the case of persons incapable of work, persons over pensionable age, women with dependent children and other classes of persons where the condition of seeking employment would be inappropriate.  Persons who make application for the supplementary welfare allowance may also be required to make application for any statutory or other benefits or assistance to which they may be entitled.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that home assistance is given at the <Col N="1339" /> discretion of the public assistance authority, an approach which follows closely the antiquated tradition of poor relief.  Another notably repugnant feature of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, is that there is no provision for appeals by persons against the decisions of the authorities in relation to their applications for assistance.  As I have already explained, the Bill provides that persons in need will be entitled as of right to allowances under the new scheme.  The corollory to this proposal is that there should be provision for appeals.  I am glad, therefore, to include in the Bill a proposal that where a person is dissatisfied with the determination by an officer of a health board of his claim for supplementary welfare allowance, an appeal shall lie against such determination to a person appointed by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The basic standard amount of supplementary welfare allowance which will be payable to a person without means will be equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment assistance applicable in rural areas.  Thus a person who has no means and no dependants will be paid £7.35 a week and a person with an adult dependent will receive £12.80 a week.  Increases for dependent children will be payable at the same rates as those which apply under the unemployment assistance code.</P>
    <P>A man, wife and two children shall, therefore, receive £17.50 or, if there are four children, £21.10.  A single person with four children could receive £15.80.  In the case of persons who have some means those basic rates will be reduced by the amount of such weekly means.</P>
    <P>These proposed rates compare very favourably with the national average of payments made by way of home assistance.  In a survey made some months ago it was ascertained that the average payment to a person receiving home assistance, otherwise than as an addition to other statutory benefit or assistance, was £4.91 to a person without dependents, or £9.11 in the case of a recipient with dependants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> Whilst uniform basic rates of allowance will constitute an essential feature of the new service, there must, as I have already mentioned, also be an element of flexibility in the new scheme to enable it to meet a wide variety of individual needs and circumstances and to enable appropriate additional payments to be made over and above the basic weekly rates of allowances.  The Bill includes provision for supplementation where the basic weekly rates of the new allowance or the weekly rates of other statutory social insurance or assistance payments are insufficient to meet individual needs.  Such special needs could, for example, arise in relation to rent payments, heating or diet requirements, or in the case of persons living alone or dependent on an allowance over a prolonged period.</P>
    <P>While the amounts of supplements will fall to be determined by the health boards having regards to the particular circumstances of individual claimants, it is desirable that the provision of supplements should, where practicable, be standardised for all health board areas.  The Bill, therefore, enables the Minister, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, to specify by regulations circumstances which will give rise to supplements and the amounts to be paid in relation to particular classes of claimants. These regulations may provide for additional help in the form of assistance in kind.</P>
    <P>Another essential requirement of the new scheme is that there should be standard uniform rules for the assessment of means, and the Bill includes provision for these.  The rules for calculating means will, in general be on the same lines as those used to calculate means for entitlement to unemployment assistance, but it may be found necessary, in the light of experience of the new scheme, to vary the rules if these are inadequate to deal with particular circumstances which may arise.  Provision is, accordingly, included in the Bill to enable the means rules to be varied by regulations with the sanction of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> I have been speaking thus far about supplementary welfare allowances in the category of normal weekly payments and I would like to refer briefly now to provisions in the Bill for other forms of payment of the allowance. First, allowances in kind may be granted in lieu of case where a health board considers that the needs of a person can best be met in that way. Secondly, a single payment may, where a health board sees fit, be made to meet an exceptional need arising on a single occasion as opposed to continuing special expenses which would be met by an increase in the weekly payment.</P>
    <P>I should like now to say a few words on the question of liability to maintain dependants.  The Bill provides that, without prejudice to other obligations imposed by law or otherwise, each spouse will be required to support the other and either will be liable to maintain his or her children under the age of 16.  these provisions are broadly similar to those in the existing legislation but the further provisions of the 1939 Act which stipulate that every legitimate person is liable to maintain his father and mother and every illegitimate person his mother are being dropped.  The proposals in the Bill restrict the liability to maintain to the immediate family unit and this represents a departure, for the purposes of the new scheme, from the extended and outmoded concept of liability under the Public Assistance Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I might mention that the liability of a child to support his parents for the purpose of entitlement to disabled person's (maintenance) allowance under the Health Acts was eliminated in the revised provision made in the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>It follows from the provisions regarding liability to maintain dependants that, where a person receives supplementary welfare allowance, every person who is liable to maintain that person should be liable to contribute according to his ability to the allowance granted.  The Bill includes provision accordingly and empowers a health board to apply, where necessary, to a district court for recovery of allowances from the persons liable to <Col N="1342" /> maintain who are in a position to pay, or make some contribution towards, the cost of the allowance paid.  The court would, in such case, fix the amount of the contribution to be made by the relative who is liable.</P>
    <P>At present public assistance authorities are responsible for the burial of deceased persons who died leaving insufficient resources to provide for their burial, or whose relatives, if any, are unable to meet the cost.  The Bill includes provisions to enable health boards to make arrangements for burials in such circumstances and empowers them to obtain repayment of expenses incurred where appropriate from the estate of the deceased person or from any person who was liable to maintain the deceased person.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of the financing of the new scheme.  At present public assistance authorities meet the full cost of home assistance expenditure from the rates.  I have already mentioned that one of the reasons for the lack of uniformity in the treatment of applications for assistance in the different public assistance districts is the fact that poorer countries cannot afford the same level of assistance as is provided elsewhere.  If, following the present system of financing, each local authority had to bear the full cost of the new service in their area there would be a very substantial increase in the local rates in the poorer counties where home assistance standards of payments are generally lowest and, consequently, where the cost of bringing the levels of payment up to the national standards envisaged for supplementary welfare allowance would weigh most heavily on ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The Government have examined very carefully the question of the financing of the new scheme and consider that it is not unreasonable to require local authorities to bear the cost which they are now required to meet for home assistance, together with a share of the additional cost of supplementary welfare allowance. Under the proposals in this Bill each local authority's contribution to the total amount to be paid by all <Col N="1343" /> authorities will be determined by reference to what they are now spending on home assistance so that the poorer areas will not have to contribute a higher proportion of the total cost than they are doing at present.</P>
    <P>The new financing proposals are briefly that expenditure under the new scheme will be met partly by payments to the health boards from the local authorities which are at present public assistance authorities and partly by grants from the Exchequer. I will explain now in greater detail how these proposals will operate.</P>
    <P>Local authorities who are at present public assistance authorities will in respect of each full year of the operation of the new scheme pay to the health board in whose area they are situated a sum equivalent to their expenditure on home assistance in the year 1975.  In addition, 40 per cent of the amount by which the total expenditure of all health boards on supplementary welfare allowances in the year in question exceeds the total expenditure by all public assistance authorities on home assistance in 1975 will be borne by the local authorities concerned.  Each such authority will pay to the appropriate health board a share of that 40 per cent.  The allocation between the authorities of the 40 per cent of the excess cost will be determined by the proportions in which total expenditure by all public assistance authorities on home assistance in 1975 was shared between them.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, therefore, if the expenditure of a public assistance authority on home assistance in 1975 is one-twentieth of the total expenditure by all public assistance authorities in that year, the local authority concerned will be required to pay one-twentieth of 40 per cent of the excess cost in question.  Expenditure by health boards on supplementary welfare allowances over and above that covered by receipts from the local authorities, that is, 60 per cent of the excess cost will be met by grants from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> If the new scheme commences other than at the beginning of a year the arrangements I have outlined will apply on a <i>pro rata</i> basis in respect of whatever part of a year is involved.</P>
    <P>The administration costs of the new scheme will also be paid by the local authorities who at present are public assistance authorities.  Local authorities in each health board area will share the administration costs in similar manner to that in which local authorities share their contributions to the health boards under the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>I want, in this connection, to stress again the importance which must be attached to the local involvement in the working of this new scheme.  If the grave social problems which lead to eligibility for supplementary welfare allowances are to be solved and if the persons concerned are to be supported and helped to achieve their rightful place in the community, then there must be a genuine connection between the income maintenance service and personal social services.  It is generally accepted that effective personal services should have a sound community basis which can be ensured by the work of the community care sections of the health boards.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the cost of the new scheme.  The cost of home assistance in 1973-74, the last complete financial year for which figures are available, was, as I have said earlier, about £2 million.  The proposals which I have outlined envisage the termination of the home assistance scheme and the substitution for it of a new service, and the statistical and other information necessary for an accurate estimate of cost is not available.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to gauge with any degree of accuracy the effects of the replacement of a purely discretionary service at local level, by a service providing standard payments as of right to be applied uniformly on a nation-wide basis.  On the basis of the available information, however, it is estimated that the overall yearly cost of the Bill proposals, excluding the cost of administration, will be of the order of £4.5 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> Taking the estimated cost of home assistance in 1975 to be £2 million, the additional cost of the new scheme will, therefore, be about £2.5 million. On the cost-sharing basis which I have described, the local authorities will be required to bear 40 per cent of the excess cost, that is, 40 per cent of about £2.5 million which is £1 million. Thus the cost to the Exchequer in a full year will be approximately £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>On the commencement of the new scheme, the staff of public assistance authorities who have been engaged on the administration of home assistance will be transferred to the health boards. The Bill includes provision to safeguard the employment and superannuation rights of the staff so transferred. I might mention in this regard that some public assistance authorities who have transferred their home assistance functions to health boards have also transferred their staff, so that the transfer of staff to be affected as a result of this Bill will apply only to the remaining authorities.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the work of the home assistance officers in the operation of the existing scheme.  If the proposed new service is to achieve its objectives it will depend to a considerable extent on the day-to-day efforts of the staffs engaged in its implementation. I look forward to the preparatory work which will be needed in coming months prior to the introduction of the new scheme&mdash;work which will call for close collaboration between the staffs of involved, the community care staffs of the health boards, the appropriate unions and representative organisations and the officials of my Department.</P>
    <P>All property of public assistance authorities which was used solely or mainly in pursuance of their functions under the Public Assistance Act, 1939, will on the commencement become the property of health boards and with the exception of two sections which are still required in connection with the administration of the health services the Act itself will be repealed.</P>
    <P>To meet any difficulties which may arise in bringing the new service into operation, the Bill includes a provision empowering the Minister to take <Col N="1346" /> appropriate action by order to remove any such difficulty.  This power will continue for one year from the commencement of the new scheme.  Similar provision was included in other social welfare legislation introducing new services, for example, the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966 and the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973.  Any order made under this provision must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and could be annulled by resolution of either House within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes transitional provisions which will enable reference in other statutes, orders or regulations to matters affected by this Bill to be modified where necessary, as a result of the replacement of home assistance by supplementary welfare allowances. These provisions also include measures designed to protect the interests of persons claiming or receiving home assisttance at the transition stage.</P>
    <P>Other proposals in the Bill deal with the Minister's power to make regulations for the purposes of the new scheme.  Provision is also included for bringing the Act into operation by order.  I am anxious that the new scheme should be brought into operation as soon as possible.  However, before doing so it will be necessary to complete the organisational arrangements and to make the regulations which, as shown in the explanatory memorandum, will cover a wide variety of matters.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to an important, and relevant, element in the work programme of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty. The Committee have decided to undertake a project designed to assess the effectiveness of the reformed scheme proposed in this Bill and to indicate ways in which further and improved services could be brought about for the groups and individuals concerned. The project will seek, also, to ascertain through experimentation the best methods of providing for the total needs of recipients of the new allowances with a view to ending the cycle of poverty experienced by such persons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> This scheme has been submitted by the committee to the Commission in Brussels for inclusion in the programme of pilot schemes and studies to combat poverty which was approved by the Social Affairs Council in Luxembourg last week.</P>
    <P>I regard this project of actionresearch as having a most important role in relation to the development of our policy in this area of hard-core poverty and deprivation.  There will be a &ldquo;before-and-after&rdquo; survey of recipients which will enable the research workers of the committee to evaluate the practical changes brought about by the implementation of the changes provided for by the Bill and to assess their effectiveness.  There will also be a survey aimed at categorising problems, identifying proximate causes and seeking appropriate services to deal with them.  The whole project will be carried out in close collaboration with appropriate specialist personnel, such as public health nurses, psychiatrists, health board staffs, officials of national manpower services, and so on.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the project areas will consist of one urban, or largely urban, and one rural assistance officer functional area in each of two counties.  The counties chosen for the project will be probably characterised by high and low levels of payments under the existing home assistance scheme.  Planning and preparatory work in connection with this project is proceeding and the field work will commence in the autumn period.  I see this project as a most imaginative contribution to our policy-making and review procedures.</P>
    <P>In the overall planning of the social welfare system, it is my concern to see developed a single assistance scheme, envisaged and operated in such a way as to be an adequate complement to the comprehensive scheme of social insurance which is being created.  This assistance scheme would provide supplementary income maintenance to any person in genuine need.</P>
    <P>Supplementary support should, of course, be available as a social right <Col N="1348" /> and should be backed up with a proper set of personal and community social services geared to the long-term solution of social problems.  It would eventually encompass the existing assistance payments service and would have responsibility for the various ancillary services such as the provision of free transport, free electricity, and so on.  The criteria would be simplified, as far as possible, to become equated to need.</P>
    <P>I believe that it should be the task of social assistance to enable the recipient to lead a life in keeping with his dignity.  Social assistance must, therefore, enable the recipient as far as possible to live independently of it and should be an aid to self-help.  In all cases, aid under such a scheme should be concerned not only with specific payments and actions designed to meet material and care needs, but also with the prevention of isolation and with including the individual as far as possible in the full life of the community.</P>
    <P>I can say, at this stage, that the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty are planning to undertake research into the adequacy of certain social welfare payments as part of their welfare rights project. This study will be carried out in the context of a programme of practical intervention aimed at ensuring that all existing social rights are obtained by those who are eligible.  I hope that this project will contribute to our understanding of the way in which our social welfare system works and of the degree to which it meets its stated objectives.  The work of the national committee will, in this way, be directed in all its aspects to provision of useful information for policy makers at local and national levels, and, indeed, at Community level.</P>
    <P>I have on other occasions, described the home assistance service as a disaster, thus echoing the opinions of many informed critics over the years, and the reform of this outdated scheme has been a priority in my approach to the development of a comprehensive social welfare system. <Col N="1349" /> In the context of the Government's programme to combat poverty, this Bill is one of major importance in that it proposes to eliminate from our social legislation the last vestiges of the Victorian poor law.</P>
    <P>The Bill breaks new ground and provides for a number of important reforms to which I have already referred. While these improvements will free beneficiaries from the stigma of the poor law tradition, I am conscious that the Bill is not an end but a beginning. It is only reasonable to expect that operational experience of the new scheme will indicate areas in which improvements are necessary and the provisions will, therefore, be subject to constant review towards that end.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope that the reform initiated by this Bill will have a positive effect upon public attitudes and, thus, in helping the overall thrust of policy in the fight against poverty.  It cannot be said often enough that policy changes in the social area depend upon widespread public awareness and understanding which can lead both to acceptance of the cost of social services and to real involvement in them.  Without this support and involvement the most radical policies and programmes will not get to grips with the human problems experienced by individuals, families and groups in our cities and towns and throughout the country. This is particularly true in respect of the proposed new scheme of supplementary welfare allowances which are intended to deal with the problems of perhaps the most deprived groups in our national community.</P>
    <P>It gives me great pleasure to recommend this Bill to Dáil Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has given a very comprehensive explanation of the Bill.  I should like to pay tribute to the parliamentary draftsmen who drafted the explanatory memorandum.  In the past they have not distinguished themselves in their drafting.  This is the second occasion in my membership of Leinster House, and particularly in <Col N="1350" /> my capacity as Opposition spokesman, when I had the pleasure of understanding the explanatory memorandum on a second reading of it. The first time I read it in a cursory fashion but on the second occasion I read it in a more detailed way and understood most of what was in it. The explanatory memorandum to this Bill has one single distinguishing feature above most of the other explanatory memoranda in that it is readable and can be understood. Therefore I wish to compliment those who are responsible for it.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is inclined to dwell to a great extent on the financial aspects of this Bill.  We know the money being paid is being categorised in the same way as that paid under unemployment assistance. The same scales of entitlement apply. The Parliamentary Secretary is inclined to fall into the trap&mdash;I do not think it is deliberate on his part but it is readily apparent in the emphasis he places on it&mdash;that the Government should continue to take great credit for the money they are paying into the social welfare kitty.</P>
      <P>This Bill is about poverty.  Proposals regarding the transfer of the administration of the public assistance boards from the local authorities to the health boards, the transfer of staff, property and contracts revolve around the one issue of poverty.  That is what this Bill is about and it is what should concern this House.  In his speech the Parliamentary Secretary used the phrase &ldquo;the cycle of poverty&rdquo; at least three times.  If this House did nothing other than discuss poverty in the context of this Bill it would be fulfilling a very important function.</P>
      <P>What is poverty?  Is it to be equated with a lack of finance, of education, a lack of decent living accommodation or a decent environment?  It is to be equated with all of those factors and it must be spoken of in the same breath as these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With certain exceptions this Bill gives statutory effect to the amount of money to be paid&mdash;no more and no less.  There can be a once-and-forall <Col N="1351" /> payment in certain instances where there is a situation of hardship. If an individual who would be entitled to allowances has not signed at the Labour Exchange this Bill envisages that he will not be entitled to supplementary welfare allowances, but there are certain exceptions made in this case also.  It is quite proper that should be the case.  Like the Parliamentary Secretary, I do not think this Bill means the complete abandonment of the stigma of the public assistance syndrome but it goes some way towards bringing about the abandonment of that stigma.  That is not a bad thing.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned a number of people who have made a study of the cycle of poverty, what constitutes that cycle, how they define poverty and its effect on individuals. I am very glad to see the debate will be based on the family unit.  Quite properly, this country holds the view that the family is sacrosanct and should be protected at all times.  However, one wonders if we have discharged our responsibility in that regard in the total sense.  We pay lip-service to the concept of the protection of the family, but do we protect all families equally?  To be absolutely honest, the answer is that we do not.</P>
    <P>Other speakers, by virtue of being public representatives, will be in a position to say what the cycle of poverty means to them.  There is one definition, that in relation to a family, poverty is transferred from generation to generation.  The grandfather cannot get out of the abyss of poverty and transfers his hopelessness to his child and the child in turn transfers it to his children and the cycle continues.  The itinerants are an example of what happens if persons are not attended to, are not recognised, are not given the equal opportunity by the State to which they are entitled.  They are an example of the family cycle of poverty.  The grandparents living in a shack or a tent on the side of the road did not get the educational opportunity that would help them to uplift themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> Consequently, they could not uplift their children and improve their way of life.  By so-called civilised standards they were not acceptable to their better off brothers who, up to recently, did little or nothing to help them out of their situation.  Now there is a proper awareness of this problem and there is very good work being done by various committees for the travelling people.  Tribute should be paid to these committees for their efforts to bring the travelling people, or itinerants, or tinkers, out of the family cycle of poverty.</P>
    <P>There is a campaign by the Catholic Church to raise money for projects, the theme of which is &ldquo;Every man is my brother&rdquo;.  When we come to discuss this Bill publicly one wonders whether or not full force is being given to that doctrine, particularly in the context of one of the most deprived sections of the community, the travelling people.</P>
    <P>One wonders whether the Bill will improve the situation of this and other deprived sections of the community. I am taking the itinerants as a <i>bona fide</i> example of a deprived community and relating their situation to the Bill as a clearly identifiable and accessible example.  Will the Bill improve the condition of the travelling people?  Will it integrate them into society?  If it is a beginning, it is a good thing.  If it does not achieve that objective, amongst others, it is a bad beginning.  Will it improve the situation for the next generation of travelling people?  Will the next generation, as a result of the Bill, become full members of society?  Will they have the educational opportunities which their elders were deprived of?  Certainly, the lack of opportunities, particularly in relation to living accommodation, for some of these people is a national scandal.  We are all to blame for it. No section of the community can wash their hands of the responsibility.  Let us accept the responsibility.</P>
    <P>Poverty in the context of the people I am speaking about is the poverty of lack of education, of inadequate living accommodation, of lack of environmental amenities, of lack of cash.  The travelling people are poor within the <Col N="1353" /> definition of poverty that I have given. There are people who have gone into this question much more deeply than I have.  I can only speak on the basis of what I have seen and experienced and know in my capacity as public representative.</P>
    <P>The condition of persons living in some centre city areas of Dublin does not fill me with pride, quite the contrary. These people do not want sympathy or pity.  They want a decent opportunity to live and to make their contribution to society.  I shall not describe some of the centre city housing as slum dwellings because I do not want to insult the decent people living in them.  If there were a more modern word than &ldquo;slum&rdquo;, I would use it so as not to give offence.  That is the type of poverty we are speaking about: the centre city areas where there are no open spaces, where the nearest community hall is a pub.  I mean no disrespect to our publican friends.  They are entitled to a living. Nevertheless, there should be alternatives to public houses as community centres where people would be able to breathe fresh air rather than cigarette smoke.  That is the sort of environment that people have to endure in some areas of this city.</P>
    <P>Poverty does not begin and end there.  There are other areas, in the cities and in the country, where people are living in poverty of one description or another.  It does not all relate to finance.  You could give a man £100 a week and he would still be poor in the sense of the definition I have tried to tease out.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Bill can go even a small way towards uplifting people. All it does is offer money.  That is not the panacea.  As it has been described elsewhere, the answer is a comprehensive survey into the identification of poverty in the community. The Parliamentary Secretary will be setting up a home assistance project in the autumn.  I would appeal to him to begin that project within a month or two of the operation of this Bill. I would envisage that the Bill will get a quick and urgent passage through the House, within the normal time limits of any debate we wish to have <Col N="1354" /> on it.  Certain aspects of the Bill concern us and we will be considering the introduction of amendments.  When the Bill becomes law the home assistance project will come into operation almost immediately.  I would like to see it coming into operation immediately. One could understand that it may not come into operation immediately until we see how it works.  In some areas a home assistance project is already in operation through the health boards.</P>
    <P>An effort was made to define poverty at a conference on poverty in Kilkenny from 19th to 21st November, 1971.  This was a very comprehensive study and, among others, it was one of the first efforts to define the real meaning of poverty to people who are affected by it.  There are many definitions.  Professor James Kavanagh of the Department of Social Science in University College, Dublin, asked at the beginning of his article what did being poor mean.  He said he thought they could agree it means being deprived of something which one might reasonably hope to have.  He suggested that when you go into the definition of poverty you go into an area of confusion and debate. Many Deputies will have their own definition of what poverty is.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting description here which supports what I have been saying.  He said there are some people who might possess a fortune of £1 million and who might feel deprived when they thought of others with £2 million.  The professor is reminded of the story of the American billionaire who appeared at breakfast in a very bad humour.  Apparently something had upset his digestion.  He said to his wife: &ldquo;I feel lousy.  I feel like a million dollars.&rdquo;  For him to descend from being a billionaire to being a millionaire would represent severe deprivation. For most people, this kind of deprivation would evoke little sympathy but rather derision.  If a billionaire feels like a million dollars he feels deprived and that is his definition of poverty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be caught for 10 per cent of one million dollars. He would not vote for Fine Gael.  The professor then goes on to describe the characteristics of poverty and he makes a plea for a widening of the concept of poverty so that it will include not only the bare subsistence nutritional levels which have been regarded as the indicators of poverty but which for other theorists are the cutting off lines of poverty.  He says that the ordinary decencies of living such as having a roof over one's head, health, educational opportunities, recreational facilities, participation in decision making at the industrial and community level, are basically human rights.  I agree.</P>
      <P>What we are speaking about in this Bill is the right of a person not to be poor.  Of course, people are entitled not to be poor.  The old cliché that the poor we will always have with us is a lot of nonsense.  We should work towards a society in which we will not have any poor people in the sense of the deprivations I have been speaking about.  There are people who because of their make up and their character will always be poor in the intellectual sense or in the sense that they will not be able to provide for themselves.  No matter what people do on their behalf they cannot get above themselves.  In those circumstances the State has an obligation.  They are the lost people in society in the sense that they are lost to themselves.  They should not be lost to society.  Society is entitled to seek them out and give them the opportunities within their own limitations to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary accepted a very nice booklet from the national committee on pilot schemes to combat poverty.  It is a very comprehensive booklet, set out in a very pithy and understandable form.  I am all for that.  I do not think booklets or schemes should be produced to confuse people.  They should be there to help them.  This booklet envisages a home assistance project.  This project relates to the Government's recent decision to introduce a new scheme of home assistance to replace the present one.  The committee is offered a <Col N="1356" /> unique opportunity to assess the manner in which the new provisions will change the lives of those who now depend on home assistance.  The home assistance project will have two aims: (1) to assist the new scheme of home assistance and suggest ways in which it may be further improved and (2) to ascertain, by experimentation, improved methods of providing for the needs of home assistance recipients.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said somewhere in the region of 30,000 people are being assisted in this regard and that the cost of providing these people with the very minimum in cash or in kind is somewhere in the region of £2 million.  We wonder if this Bill will make any difference when it is implemented.  Certainly, it gives statutory effect to what already exists to a great degree and it introduces a number of new provisions, such as the appeals mechanism in respect of an amount awarded by a health board officer in his new capacity, as distinct from a home assistance officer. Another departure is in regard to being able to pursue the husband, or the provider of a family to maintain his family, to be able to go to court and obtain the money by court order and, in the event of the money being paid out by the health board, to enable the money to be recoverable by the health board.  That is a proper provision.</P>
    <P>Some time ago we were discussing the 19th interim report on Court Practice and Procedure which deals with maintenance and desertion, an area in which the Government have fallen down badly.  We have been promised something by the Minister for Justice before the summer recess in regard to maintenance and desertion but, perhaps, when the Parliamentary Secretary, is replying he might refer to this.  Section 17 will not affect the wife's entitlement to pursue the husband for maintenance and anything obtained in the courts by way of maintenance would not be affected by section 17.  I may not be quite clear on this point but I shall come back to it later when I refer specifically to my notes in regard to points that I consider must be raised on the Bill.</P>
    <P>Social welfare, as the Parliamentary <Col N="1357" /> Secretary said indicates a society concerned about its citizens.  This Bill is all about poverty and the effort to come to grips with it, not so much an effort to alleviate poverty by some form of financial entitlement.  There is more to poverty than this.  To return to the conference on poverty held in November, 1971, Seamus Ó Cinnéide of the Institue of Public Administration submitted a paper, <i>The Extent of Poverty in Ireland.</i> The purpose of his paper, as he said, was an effort to quantify the extent of poverty in Ireland meaning the Twenty-six Counties.  It was an effort by him and his colleagues to come to grips with the nitty gritty of poverty and get down to its real meaning. In his effort to quantify the extent of poverty he focusses on material poverty which he says one would assume is more easily definable and measurable than poverty in a wider psychological or cultural sense.  Even in regard to material poverty there are, he says, major problems of definition and methodology.</P>
    <P>That is the real problem : you cannot stick to one concept or one definition of poverty and Mr. Ó Cinnéide and others have decided on this. When he decides to quantify the extent of poverty, having regard to his discipline, he recognises that the cycle of poverty is not limited to one concept but includes cultural, environmental&mdash;to some extent these are intermixed&mdash;educational, social and so on.  He tries to treat poverty in the material sense and he sets out to define and estimate it.  Traditionally &mdash;and traditions in poverty research are not much older than this century, to quote the article&mdash;have been based either on nutritional standards or income levels or a combination of both. That tradition has now been exploded and for the purposes of this debate we might as well accept that the traditional concept of poverty has now gone; we must redefine poverty.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ó Cinnéide says that one can define poverty by nutritional standards and find out the number of persons whose intake of food is traditionally inadequate and call them poor.  This gets away from the idea of <Col N="1358" /> income and takes account instead of how people use their income to meet their basic physical needs.  On the other hand, it does not take account of needs other than food and the extent to which people, whether they achieve an adequate nutritional standard or not, can meet them.  A nutrition survey is very time-consuming and expensive.  The last extensive nutrition survey was done in the late forties and the reports were published in 1948-50.  These results gave no cause for alarm at the time.  Alternatively, he says, one can define poverty by level of income with variations according to income unit and estimate the extent of poverty by doing a comprehensive income survey which would show the distribution of income throughout the population. The only thing approaching this was the household budget inquiry in Ireland which was conducted in 1965-66 and previous to that in 1951-52.</P>
    <P>One of the most revealing statistics in the paper comes at the very conclusion of this article on the extent of poverty in Ireland where it is stated that the estimate of 24 per cent of persons being poor considering basic family units is put forward as a minimum.  The actual proportion of persons who are poor on this basis is probably nearer 30 per cent.  On the other hand, some of the poverty, he says, as estimated in relation to basic family units is undoubtedly relieved by transfers between households.  Even with such transfers, the proportion of persons who are poor by the standards set out in this article is probably in the region of 20 per cent. More accurate estimates would require detailed research and, perhaps, a useful start on this would be the standardisation of definitions of units in respect of which income data is calculated.</P>
    <P>Having given a lengthy discourse on his definition of poverty, Mr. Ó Cinnéide came up with the conclusion that in 1971 the estimate of 24 per cent of persons being poor, considering basic family units, &ldquo;is put forward as a minimum&rdquo;.  On the basis of his compilation, the actual number was probably 30 per cent.  So much for the <Col N="1359" /> definition of poverty in an effort by those individuals to quantify poverty.</P>
    <P>One could go on giving different definitions and interpretations of what poverty means.  Of course the effects of poverty are another thing and this Bill does not give succour other than the very basic financial help which is envsaged in it for those people about whom so much concern was expressed in Kilkenny in November, 1971. One wonders whether the home assistance project under the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty, when they go into the field to operate their proposals, will find any difference pre the Supplementary Allowances Bill of 1975 and post that Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill certainly does not propose any revolutionary changes.  It sets out to transfer the operation of home assistance schemes under the local authorities to the health boards.  It proposes the transferring of property held by the various local authorities in this connection to the health boards and the transferring of home assistance officers to the boards and to reestablish them in the health boards with their previous term of reference in relation to duties and other matters.</P>
    <P>In this respect I join with the Parliamentary Secretary in his tribute to the home assistance officers.  As he said, the home assistance scheme was basically codified in the 1939 Public Assistance Act and this Bill is repealing that Act with the exception of section 3, the definition section, and section 86 which deals with the transfer of the county fever hospitals and other related matters.</P>
    <P>One wonders why section 86 is not also being repealed by this Bill.  It is understandable why section 39 should not be.  The Bill introduced a number of new features, such as the right of appeal from public assistance or health board officers, and the idea of recovery of contributions to supplement the welfare allowances by the making of applications to the district court by the health boards.  There are new features in regard to burials.  The idea of a <Col N="1360" /> pauper's grave is still in the Bill&mdash;the poor man will still be buried wherever he is found.  It is an awful and tragic thought.  When an unfortunate individual dies he could be a miser with a hoard of money and the health board can pursue the estate to recover expenditure on the burial.</P>
    <P>This Government are wont to give lip service to the idea of equal pay for women and to the abandonment of various discriminations under various codes, particularly the social welfare code, but there is very clear discrimination in section 10 (2) of the Bill.  I know that when I put down an amendment to it I will have the full support of the Government having regard to the effect of the subsection and the oft-stated wish of the Government to translate into legislation their position in regard to women.  In this section there are a number of references to a married man, his wife, his qualified adult dependants. I quote:</P>
    <P>(2)  In this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of a married man, his wife if she is living with him or is wholly or mainly maintained by him,</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of a married woman, her husband if he is incapable of self-support by reason of some physical or mental infirmity and is wholly or mainly maintained by her, and</P>
    <P>(c)  in the case of a widower or unmarried man, a female person (being a person who has attained the age of sixteen years) having the care of his child dependants and wholly or mainly maintained by him. </P>
    <P>I am open to correction and if the Parliamentary Secretary has an adequate explanation I will accept it but this seems to put an unemployed married woman into an inferior position.  Why not use the terms &ldquo;man&rdquo; and &ldquo;woman&rdquo; in the Bill? What is the reason for the phrase &ldquo;female person&rdquo;?  This Bill is supposed to be bringing us into line with today's thinking but, instead, it goes <Col N="1361" /> back to the 1840s.  However, I expect now that I have raised this question of the phraseology in this subsection, an amendment will be accepted on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>While there is provision for a widower or unmarried man in this section there is no reference to a widow or to an unmarried mother. What is the reason for this discrimination? Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will give us an adequate explanation for this but as it stands this discrimination exists.  Within recent days the widows have written both to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Social Welfare enumerating their complaints but their main one, discrimination, is being carried on in this Bill.  We must stop this discrimination against both widows and unmarried mothers?</P>

      <P>This is the situation known to anybody in touch with the <Col N="1362" /> grass roots.  The type of legislation being continued here is that which the Government indicated their intention of abandoning.  Deputy O'Brien has said that the Government must be given credit for some improvements.  That is so.  They introduced allowances for unmarried mothers but it was Fianna Fáil who recognised the existence of deserted wives.  Deputy Haughey, in his 1968 budget, and at my urging, introduced this allowance but we are prepared to give credit where it is due.  We must consider, though, how effective is the system and in this context we must draw attention to the discrimination against widows and unmarried mothers in this Bill.  On Committee Stage Fianna Fáil will introduce an amendment to deal with this situation, that is, if the Government do not pre-empt us by introducing an amendment to deal with the glaring discrimination to which I have drawn attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole concept of social welfare is that of a caring for society. Every citizen should be included in this sphere.  Unfortunately, it would appear that the social welfare code applies only to those who are in need of financial assistance.  As the Parliamentary Secretary stated, our social welfare system has evolved from the middle of the last century.  It has evolved from Victorian times when the horrific situation of the poor became so obvious that aid was initiated by the philanthropists for the socially deprived who, subsequently, became the responsibility of the government and gave us the system we have today. However, we are at a relatively early stage of development in this area and we must continue to evolve to a point where social welfare will take on its true meaning&mdash;the good of society.  We must endeavour to remove the emphasis from the monetary consideration and direct it towards a caring concept.  Of course, the monetary aspect cannot be abandoned. Nobody would suggest I was attempting to do that.  Rather we should be re-directing our energies towards the education of people into a caring community.  There is, in the <Col N="1363" /> public mind and in the minds of many people in this House, the idea that the total function of the social welfare system is that of financial entitlement.  That is not its total function and should not be seen as such.</P>
    <P>In addition to whatever financial benefits to which our social welfare recipients are entitled, we must cultivate within the community a sense of involvement, by the community for the community, bearing in mind that such beneficiaries are of the community and live in the same community as other individuals who may be better off or who may have better opportunities. Consequently, it is the total function of the community to care for the less well off.</P>
    <P>Many people have a feeling about becoming involved in voluntary organisations, about caring, but that is not sufficient.  One must have a commitment. The only way in which one can commit oneself, in the community care sense, is to get out into the community, involve oneself in an organisation and commit oneself fully to whatever may be the ideal one wishes to see fulfilled.  Most ideals and hopes are capable of achievement.  But, in the community care sense, the only way people can commit themselves is by becoming involved.</P>
    <P>We should now be sowing the seeds of future development by making people aware of their own and others' needs, through research into methods of community work at present in operation in other countries to ascertain how best they could be adapted to suit our needs.  We should also encourage communities to use facilities already available in their areas, such as parish halls, community centres and so on.  Schools might also be made more useful.  People seem to think the only function of a school building is for the education of children.  Certainly that is its primary function but a school building should not merely open at 9 o'clock in the morning and close at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.  From 5 o'clock in the afternoon until 10.30 or 11 p.m. it should be open for use by the rest of the community, in the sense <Col N="1364" /> that it could continue with adult education courses and so on.  There could be use made also of a community hall, if such were available within that building or group of buildings.</P>
    <P>It would be naïve of us in this House to assume that any programme involving community participation could be activated without proper planning by experts in this area.  It is for this reason that we in Fianna Fáil have initiated a study group to examine the needs about which I have already spoken, to examine the whole concept of community care.  We are doing so as one of the proper roles of an Opposition and on a voluntary basis.  We do not have the machinery of the civil service at our backs, for the time being &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have given a loan of the machinery to the present outfit.  We will be back; there is nothing surer than that.</P>
      <P>If I may conclude on the theme of social welfare, on how it is seen to operate and is understood, we see it as being in a very embryonic stage evolving towards a concept of community care where each member is asked not so much what he can get out of it but what he can contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien asked what we had done during our 16 years in office.  We built up a social welfare code which typified a decent attitude.  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments introduced many new schemes to care for the less well off sections of the community.  If there is one, and one only criticism of the evolvement of the social welfare code it is that there was not a certain unity of approach in relation to the whole concept.  The present Government have introduced two, three or four schemes.  If one measures what they have introduced against Fianna Fáil's contribution over 16 years, one <Col N="1365" /> will find that it pales into insignificance. Of course, the Government have introduced a couple of flashy new schemes.  I exclude in that respect those introduced for the unmarried mothers, prisoners' wives and such people.  But there is one thing which distinguishes this Government from that of previous ones and that is, that any scheme on any given topic, by any Department, is announced almost out of existence.  They announce they will set up a scheme, and if they do so once, they do it 20 or 25 times.  It is like the announcement of the local defence force scheme which they announced approximately ten times&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that has been announced on many occasions.  But those are perfect examples of a Government announcing things out of existence.  Certainly, were credit to be given for blowing their own trumpets at every given opportunity and for doing nothing, the Government would deservedly receive full credit.</P>
      <P>There is another area about which we must be concerned in the light of this Bill.  That is, that fewer people are contributing more indirectly to the fund from which social welfare entitlements are paid.  We have now over 102,000 people unemployed in our community, which is a very serious situation.  My view is that those people would much prefer the dignity of work to the indignity of the unemployment dole queues.  I would decry any suggestion that the main bulk of the unemployed working force are so unemployed because that is what they want.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  They are there because the Government have no policy in relation to the provision of employment.  After Thursday we shall see.  They are then introducing their third official budget since the first official one at the beginning of the year.  Of course, there is an unofficial budget every other day of the week.  They will be introducing their third official budget then.  Or is it their fourth?  One tends to lose track&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understand the Bill completely and the Parliamentary Secretary will find that out on Committee Stage.  He has been caught out now in regard to his discrimination against women and he will be exposed on this occasion from this side of the House on Second Reading and he will also be exposed on Committee Stage.  He need not introduce an element of glee.  This Bill is not a panacea and it does not necessarily eliminate the stigma of public assistance.  When the Parliamentary party discussed the Bill last Wednesday I said that the Parliamentary Secretary would introduce the Bill with the words &ldquo;This Bill is being introduced to abandon the stigma of public assistance&rdquo;.  Those are the very words he used.  We hope it does.  We will give any support to ensure that it abandons the stigma of public assistance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find that out when the matter is put to the House and not before then.  We will have to see what the attitude of the Government and the Deputy Esmondes of this world is in relation to the Bill and how honest they will be about it.  Our attitude will then be taken up.  The Deputy can take it that the Second Stage will be passed without too much dissent.  We are entitled to be critical of it during Second Stage <Col N="1367" /> but we will not obstruct it by dividing on it.</P>
      <P>Any Bill that goes some small way towards the beginning of the abandonment of the public assistance attitude is to be welcomed.  It is on that basis that we would not vote against the Second Stage.  It is not correct to suggest that this Bill is the beginning of a new era.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty are undertaking research into the adequacy of some social welfare payments. The people going out to do the home assistance project will find the Bill does not change the lives, the environment, the housing accommodation, the educational standards and opportunities of these people.  We are concerned about that.</P>
      <P>A person living on his own without a dependant will get £7.35 a week.  It is not good enough if the people engaged on this project only find that this man is getting £7.35 more than he got before the introduction of this Bill.  It is important the man should get a very basic sum of money but will the Bill change the previous method of the distribution of home assistance?</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and I paid tribute to the work done by the home assistance officers and the manner in which they discharged their duties over the years.  Before the introduction of this Bill the home assistance officer was entitled to give any individual who came to him an amount of money which he considered proper to give that person the very basic necessities of life.  If the home assistance project team see such an individual after the introduction of this Bill and if they see an improvement in his living accommodation, his environmental condition and so on, then the Bill may have achieved something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill basically gives statutory effect to the amounts already payable by the home assistance officer.  I have known a man to get £8 from a home assistance officer and I have also known a man to get £8, a few extra shillings for the children and clothes from a home assistance officer.  The Parliamentary Secretary also knows <Col N="1368" /> this has happened.  I hope I know something about this particular subject. The Parliamentary Secretary knows well that home assistance varies from county to county, having regard to the rates element and the amount of rates which go towards home assistance. In poorer areas the home assistance officer gives less money because he has not much money available to him.  In the so-called wealthy areas he can give more because he has more money available to him.  If we are abandoning home assistance and introducing a new element of dignity into the entitlements envisaged by this Bill, would the Parliamentary Secretary consider, by regulation, abandoning the idea of people queueing up for social assistance benefits or social welfare supplementary welfare allowances?</P>
    <P>I know in some areas the money is delivered to the individuals concerned but there are areas where people have to queue for the money.  It is an appalling concept in 1975 that people should go cap in hand to some individual, no matter how good he may be in his particular job, and queue up, no doubt in full view of every passer-by who knows very well what is going on.  If this Bill solves that problem it has real meaning but if it does not we are only humbugging.</P>
    <P>I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to introduce a scheme <i>de novo</i> to provide that these people are paid by cheque or visitation from the new health officer operating this scheme. We should stop the dole queue with the begging bowl in the hand attitude. These people have their dignity.  That is one method of protecting them. From time to time we are inclined to be hurtful about the less well off sections of our community and inclined to adopt the penny halfpenny syndrome of looking down on a penny.  The amounts to be paid under the Bill are given statutory effect. These amounts will last for as long as a person is not able to provide by his own work for his own wellbeing. That could last for a long time; so, consequently, the system would not break down if these people were to be paid by cheque or by any other <Col N="1369" /> system other than the queueing system.  We should eliminate the system whereby they must go to the hole in the wall to be paid what they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>There are many facets of the Bill which are of some concern to us, and we will be dealing with them on Committee Stage.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to explain the financing of the health board expenditure as set out in section 20 of the Bill.  We understand that the 1975 figure for expenditure of public assistance will be taken as a base and that that figure, plus 40 per cent of anything paid over and above that for successive years, will be the amount paid by the local authority to the health boards.  The explanatory memorandum states that provision is made whereby the local authorities will also pay the costs of administration by health boards of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of his speech, stated:</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the cost of the new scheme.  The cost of home assistance in 1973-74, the last complete financial year for which figures are available, was, as I have said earlier, about £2 million. The proposals which I have outlined to you envisage the termination of the Home Assistance Scheme and the substitution for it of a new service, and the statistical and other information necessary for an accurate estimate of cost is not available.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to gauge with any degree of accuracy the effects of the replacement of a purely discretionary service at local level, by a service providing standard payments as of right to be applied uniformly on a nation-wide basis.</P>
    <P>This again proves my point that it is giving statutory effect to what is already in existence.  The Parliamentary Secretary continued:</P>
    <P>On the basis of the available information, however, it is estimated that the overall yearly cost of the Bill proposals, excluding the <Col N="1370" /> cost of administration, will be of the order of £4.5 million.</P>
    <P>Taking the estimated cost of home assistance in 1975 to be £2 million, the additional cost of the new scheme will therefore be about £2.5 million.  On the cost-sharing basis which I have described, the local authorities will be required to bear 40 per cent of the excess cost, that is, 40 per cent of about £2.5 million which is £1 million.</P>
    <P>Thus the cost to the Exchequer in a full year will be approximately £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware public assistance at present is taken from the rates.  The Government, in discharge of a promise, have taken the health charges off the rates, as we understand it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Health charges were taken off the rates and we are fulfilling all our promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that another day.  We ask the Government to abandon altogether the payment by suburban dwellers of rates on dwellings. The Government are, by stealth, adding to the rates burden of our people.  Having regard to the good envisaged in this Bill the people will not have a great objection to paying. However, it has to be pointed out that this Bill envisages an increase in rates.  We have already heard that the middle income group are being burdened continuously.  The middle income group have about had it; they are exhausted by the rates and other taxes imposed upon them by the Government.  They cannot go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The lower income group pay income tax and rates also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, and I would prefer if the Deputy awaited his opportunity to make his speech.  I know Deputy O'Brien is as concerned about income taxation, and the proposed increases on Thursday, as I am. I know he is as concerned as I am that this dreadful Government are going to impose further taxes on our people.  The people seem to be paying <Col N="1371" /> for the Government's mistakes.  When the last budget was introduced we were told that there would be no difficulties and that the employment situation would be better than ever.  Now the Government have to introduce another budget but again they give us the promise that things will be better than before.  If we were to equate the future with the past the future would not be much to look forward to.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the middle income and lower income groups will pay their rates and discharge their income taxation, without any great objection to paying an equitable contribution to the Exchequer.  They are willing to pay their due share as citizens and are as patriotic in doing so as any other sections of the community that Deputy O'Brien or others may have in mind.  What I am saying is that they have had enough and cannot soak up any more.  When the Government come to introduce whatever penal laws they intend introducing on Thursday, will they keep in mind the two sections of the community I am speaking about?  The average decent artisan or manual labourer can go thus far and no further.  The Government are taking every drain of incentive out of the country with the present policy.  This Bill before us was introduced with the usual Coalitionese and verbiage as to what a great improvement it is going to be: &ldquo;happy days are here again&rdquo; and &ldquo;things have never been better&rdquo;, to use two current clichés.</P>
      <P>On the financing of the health board expenditure, if the Government are serious about transferring health charges from the rates to the Central Exchequer, they should accept responsibility for the charges envisaged by this Bill.  They are transferring the functions, the staff, the contracts, the buildings and anything else within the corporate ownership of the public assistance local authorities from the public assistance local authorities to the health boards.  Therefore there is no reason why the charges on the rates should not be transferred from the local authorities to the health boards and consequently be paid from the Central Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> The rates are liable not only for the financing of the health board expenditure in the payment of social welfare supplementary allowances, but also for the administration cost of the payment of those allowances.  Of course there is nothing in the Bill about the liability for the payment of the officers who will be taken over by the health boards, and the Parliamentary Secretary might give us information on that.</P>
    <P>The Bill is seen by the Government and by the Opposition as a new scheme in the sense that it now transfers the operation of public assistance to the health boards and all things deriving therefrom, but let me return to the provisions of the Bill and not take up too much time in its examination because we shall have another opportunity of discussing it on Committee Stage.  There is an anomaly in section 16 which provides:</P>
    <P> (1)  For the purposes of this Act and without prejudice to any obligations imposed by law or otherwise, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  every man shall be liable to maintain such of his legitimate children as are under the age of sixteen years;</P>
    <P>(b)  every woman shall be liable to maintain such of her children as are under the age of sixteen years;</P>
    <P>(c)  every married man shall be liable to maintain his wife and any child of his wife, who was born before her marriage to him and is under the age of sixteen years; and</P>
    <P>(d)  every married woman shall be liable to maintain her husband.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every reference in this Act to a person who is liable to maintain another person shall be construed as meaning a person who by virtue of subsection (1) of this section is liable to maintain such other person. </P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every man shall be liable to maintain such of his legitimate children as are under the age of 16 years.&rdquo;  Why <Col N="1373" /> not &ldquo;every man shall be liable to maintain such of his children as are under the age of 16 years?&rdquo;  I appreciate that, under the Illegitimate Children's Act of 1930, a man has a statutory obligation to provide for the welfare of his child up to the age of 16, but why does the Bill exclude illegitimate children?  The Minister may have an adequate explanation for this, but in the meantime we shall be putting in an amendment, and if there is not an explanation for it then surely the Minister must accept the amendment.  When there is enshrined in legislation the idea that a man is liable to maintain his wife and so on and that every married woman shall be liable to maintain her husband in certain circumstances, I think it is merely a statement of intent, and it is a section which probably could have been left out of the Bill.  It would not have made that much difference.  However, it would have some real meaning if the provision stated &ldquo;Every man shall be liable to maintain such of his children as are under the age of 16 years&rdquo; and exclude the word &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I understand it the man is not liable to maintain his illegitimate children under the age of 16 years. Does this mean he is not liable to maintain&mdash;and Deputy Esmonde, if he was here, would be able to help me on this&mdash;his illegitimate children under the age of 16 years but is liable to maintain his illegitimate children over the age of 16 years?  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to exclude the word &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with the recovery of contributions to supplementary welfare allowance.  If there is an immediate sort of fire-brigade situation where the husband deserts his wife and the provisions of the deserted wife's allowance do not apply immediately in that event then section 17 can be brought into immediate effect.  It is a worthy section.  It is a section which gives health boards an opportunity.  It is a new departure to a great extent in the context of our legislation.  As I understand it, certain local authorities have a right against an individual who <Col N="1374" /> does not discharge his debts.  To bring this concept, however, into a Bill of this nature is a good idea and all praise is due to the Parliamentary Secretary in this respect.  Where a person is found to be neglecting his wife and children and former Acts or regulations do not actually provide for that wife and child or children, then section 17 is a worthy section.  It provides an opportunity to proceed against that individual; in the first instance, to let the individual know that they want the money back from him for his wife; that, in the event of his not paying it they will go to the District Court to get a court order against him to claim payment of that money.  That is as it should be Everybody will welcome that section.</P>
    <P>The only other matter of concern to this side of the House is the position of the staff officers who will be transferred from the public assistance authority to the health boards.  It is not quite clear in the Bill but we would hope that the conditions of employment will not be affected in any way and that superannuation will be fully protected; in no way should job opportunities or promotion be adversely affected.  All these matters must be fully protected when these staff officers are transferred from the public assistance authority to the health board.  It is extremely important that the Parliamentary Secretary should keep that in mind.</P>
    <P>Another cause for gratification is the provision ensuring that where difficulties arise under section 27, the Minister may by order made within one year of the appointed day do anything which appears to be necessary or expedient, including modification of the Act.  Any such order will, of course, be laid before both Houses and, if it is not challenged or annulled, effect will be given to it.  It is a good idea that the Minister should have a regard to the social welfare and the beneficial aspects of the Bill and have that power under section 27.  If the Bill is found not to be working in a particular direction the Minister will try to cure that and in curing it he will bring an order <Col N="1375" /> before both Houses and, after 21 days, that Order becomes effective.</P>
    <P>I should like once more to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for giving us an opportunity of making a contribution to a Bill of this nature.  It is not often the House has an opportunity of discussing what this Bill is all about, namely, poverty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I welcome this Bill.  It is long overdue to anyone who has any experience at all of how home assistance works.  It definitely makes the recipient feel poor and, as a result a large number of people who are in need and want money will not approach the home assistance officer because of the stigma attaching to it.  Deputy Andrews raised the point as to how claims will be made.  We are also concerned about that because upping the ante or giving an increase is all very well but, if the system is basically the same, they will at least now be entitled to assistance by statute.  If, however, they have to go to the same building, the stigma will remain.  They will not want to go to this establishment if they do not qualify for any other form of social welfare, and we should have a look at how we are going to deal with this aspect&mdash;where people will apply and how they will get paid.  There is then the question of where people find themselves in an emergency situation. It is important that the red tape must be cut to meet emergencies.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of supplementary welfare benefit is to meet particular types of hardship and, to achieve that, one must have humanity and flexibility.  I realise it is not always easy to have flexibility but, in schemes such as this, it is desirable that flexibility be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a man who was on disability benefit and was knocked off for some reason or other.  He is unable to work because he has a particular complaint. I was informed he was knocked off for 13 weeks because he had not the requisite number of stamps.  He approached the home assistance officer: he had no money and the home assistance officer gave him a food voucher.  It is a good thing that <Col N="1376" /> approach is now being got rid of because rent and other financial commitments have to be met.  Being handed a food voucher is degrading to the applicant for help.</P>
    <P>This Bill will neither eradicate nor make any great impact on poverty. The elimination of poverty could take a considerable time and this is only one step towards eliminating poverty. The Bill does not set out to eliminate poverty.  I am glad pilot schemes are getting under way and that we can expect to see some positive action in the field of eliminating poverty at some stage.  It is a question of what is poverty and how do you define poverty.  There are degrees of poverty. There is the poverty of lack of the necessities of life, the poverty of bad housing, of education and of culture. These aspects are all intertwined, not one is separate from the other.  When we discuss poverty, we have to look at the reasons why there is poverty. Somebody once said that poverty is an attitude of mind.  I suppose in many ways it is.  If you think poor, you will be poor.  No matter what assistance we give some people they will remain poor.</P>
    <P>That brings us to something I am always talking about&mdash;education, the philosophy of life, why we are here and what contribution can we make. Affluence has brought a degree of comfort to many people but it has also brought a degree of selfishness.  People tend to want for themselves and are not terribly concerned about poverty in certain areas of this city, which, on the surface, look reasonably well off but behind the doors there is quite a degree of poverty.  There are elderly people living on fixed incomes who are not aware of their entitlements. This morning I came across a 77-yearold lady who was living in very poor circumstances&mdash;on the old age pension. She was not aware that she could get a waiver of rates.  The top portion of the house in which she lives is completely dilapidated because she cannot afford the repairs.  We talk about community care, but this is part of it.  Community care is all right when people know where to go, but are we doing enough field work in seeking out problems? <Col N="1377" /> Even if these people are aware of their entitlements they are nervous to approach people in authority.  A great amount of case work should be done to ensure that the people we are talking about, the genuinely poor&mdash; are aware of their entitlements, their rights and the help that should be given to them, such as home assistance. In the case I saw this morning, there should be some way by which the portion of her house which cannot be lived in because of its condition could be repaired.  That could be considered as part of our community care.  Liaison between the health boards, the communities and the people involved at community level should take place. Only by this type of involvement can we know about poverty and take the necessary steps to rid our society of it. Housing conditions have improved over the years.</P>
    <P>The present Government are committed to a housing programme, particularly a centre-city housing programme in Dublin.  We are in the process of acquiring 150 acres of land, when this is developed community life in the centre of the city will be working.  Even in poorer parts of Dublin poverty is not as great as we might think, because of the community spirit and the way people help one another.  All these community organisations should be co-operating with the health boards and other organisations towards a common end &mdash;the elimination of hardship and poverty.  Only by doing this can we hope to rid ourselves of poverty.  It is easy to write many well chosen words about poverty and how we propose to rid the community of it.</P>
    <P>I welcome and look forward to the reports on poverty that have come in, and the quick action to be taken to ensure that we are working towards a just society.  The Fine Gael Party, since 1965 have advocated a policy of &ldquo;Towards a Just Society&rdquo;.  This is the type of society basically people want.  They do not want a society with tags attached to it.  They want a society which is a friend with all the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy David Andrews was concerned about the middle income <Col N="1378" /> group who were being soaked by the rates.  I reminded him that the lower income groups also paid rates and taxes.  By and large the people realise that if they want services they have to pay for them.  There is no other way around this.  If we have to improve service, it has to be paid for and people expect this.  There is not any good saying they cannot soak up any more.  I believe that where worth-while policies are being implemented the people will support them.</P>
    <P>What amazes me is that over the last couple of months capital gains and wealth taxes have been bitterly opposed in this House.  People have made vast fortunes on land acquisition and sales, and have not been paying tax.  We have introduced this legislation to ensure that this type of tax reform takes place, that the middle income group, who are being soaked, will realise that we are aiming at the upper level for money to implement a better social welfare system.  We can only do that by implementing a better form of tax.  This is being done very graciously by the Minister for Finance despite very articulate opposition from inside and outside this House.  If this tax reform had been done a number of years ago we would have more money today to devote to social welfare, and industrial development which require furthering from time to time.</P>
    <P>It ill behoves Deputy Andrews to talk about better social welfare schemes, better this and better that, when they must be paid for.  When we ask the people whom we believe can pay the money Fianna Fáil oppose the legislation.  I believe this is hypocritical and shamming of the worst type.  I would like that to be recorded in this House.  I have no time for that type of thing.  If we want to change our society and make it a better place to live in, we must pay for it.  The people who can afford to pay make their money from the less well off in our society&mdash; the working class.  I believe they are entitled to their share of whatever there is to be shared and that can be by social welfare benefits or better income tax or in some way like that.  I believe even the other side of the House would <Col N="1379" /> want a better social welfare system but we must pay for it.  The Opposition spoke about the great reforms carried out by them.  We are only in office a couple of years but if we consider the amount of money the Government have donated for social welfare payments and compare it with what the Opposition, when in Government, paid out, it makes them look like a party who were not very concerned.</P>
    <P>We must introduce legislation of this kind where we see it is necessary. I felt all along that this type of legislation was desirable, as was the home assistance scheme.  As the Parliamentary Secretary said, it was not the home assistance officers who were responsible because they were only carrying out instructions.  Where assistance is on a discretionary basis it puts the onus on an individual which in my view, he should not have.  From now on the limits will be set out and even if the health board officer decides a person is not entitled to benefit that is not the end because the person concerned can appeal.  By giving people the benefit of this appeal system we are making this a more humane Bill.  We are concerned and we will go as far as we can to ensure that the people will get their entitlement.</P>
    <P>The appeals system in the Department of Social Welfare is fair; indeed, it has tended to bend over backwards to ensure that people got their benefits and, as far as we can afford that system, that is the way it should be.  I was surprised at the small amount of money&mdash;£2 million&mdash;that was paid out in the present home assistance system. Of course the introduction of all the other schemes tends to cut down the number of people seeking home assistance. This is good and it highlights the fact that we have a first-class social welfare code.  Obviously it will always need improvement, but the fact that the sum is so small indicates that, in general, people are catered for in some way or other in the area of social welfare and that is encouraging.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews mentioned discrimination against the widows and <Col N="1380" /> unmarried mothers and he more or less indicated that it was discrimination against women.  My reading of the Bill was, that a widow or an unmarried mother was already entitled to an allowance and that normally she would not come under the new supplementary welfare system.  However, where the deserted wife or the widow might find herself without any money to meet her commitments, I should imagine that this Bill would cater for her as well.  It has not been the intention of this Government to introduce any discriminatory legislation and I would not see this as legislation that intends to discriminate against women.  I would like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary's view on this.  Generally, as I said earlier, I am very happy with this Bill for the reasons that I gave.  We must be careful in our new system to ensure that the stigma that formerly attached to home assistance is not perpetrated. People should not be obliged to queue up at the health board offices for their benefits.  One should apply for a form, fill it in, have it examined and the payments should be posted out to the applicant.  Many needy people will not apply for benefits because of the stigma attaching to the procedure. We have got to look at the whole system.</P>
    <P>It is a question of giving the system some semblance of humanity.  I do not think that the human being should conform to the system, because that would kill the whole desire to help.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that this will not happen.  If it does not this Bill will be a tremendous step forward in that area of social welfare.  It is just one of the vast areas involved in the social welfare spectrum, but I am most concerned about it.</P>
    <P>First of all, it is ridding the statute book of another aspect of poor law legislation.  It is something that should have been got rid of long ago but for lack of will or something else we did not do it.  It is important that the whole aura of the poor law system be eradicated from all aspects of social welfare as quickly as possible <Col N="1381" /> to give people a sense of dignity.  If people require assistance it is their right.  It is not a hand-out, it is not something a Government have given them because it is the right time to give a hand-out.  They are getting a payment because they are entitled to it, because they are citizens of the nation.  They have a right to live and to provide for their families and that should be done by giving our services a real sense of dignity and of humanity.  I think this Bill will be a tremendous success.  I should like to commend the Parliamentary Secretary for this and for all the previous work he has brought before the House.  Knowing him we can look forward to more to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would join with the other Deputies who welcome the parts of the Bill that we on this side of the House agree with.  I am sure every Member of the House and every citizen will welcome and appreciate any genuine effort to change our code of social welfare but I do take to task people, including, perhaps, myself, for being inclined to adopt a superior attitude, that we are going to do something great, that we in the National Assembly are bringing in legislation which it is our duty to introduce. We seem to start on the wrong premise, implying that we are giving out largesse and that we are great people here to have thought of this. In adopting this attitude, we are undoing some of the work we might do. We are instilling into the minds of people who will benefit from the Bill the fact that the State, big brother, is dispensing alms.  We often criticise people who lived 100 or 150 or even 50 years ago for their attitude to social welfare.  You will find on examination that our attitude is not much better than theirs was.  We have a lot more wealth to distribute or redistribute and our educational system has advanced very much.  We may find that the people who genuinely tried to operate the old poor law acts were just as good as we are.  They had to pioneer the way in this field.  We tend to deride them and to call them &ldquo;do-gooders.&rdquo;  They may have been but we also fall into that category if <Col N="1382" /> we take credit for the fact that we have a Bill which will, I hope, mean something better for the people who will benefit by it.</P>
      <P>I should like to see our attitude towards social welfare one of help and education, that every one who will draw benefit under this Bill will be made to believe that he or she is wanted, and that we are not just doing it for the sake of appearances but are genuinely concerned for each person, man, woman, boy or girl and, having a community spirit, want to help them and to educate them and, when they are old, to show that they have a place in society.  If people believe that they have a place in society and that, no matter what age they are or what disability they suffer from, they contribute something towards the creation of a better society, they will be better citizens.  Our social welfare code will be seen as having a soul and will not be merely a disbursement of money, food or clothing through the State agencies.  This is where we fall down in our attitude to social welfare. It is a kind of cheque-book conscience. We issue the pension each week and we say that is that, we have done our duty.  But, of course, we have done no such thing.  We have given some money which, having worked as good book-keepers, we find we can afford to give and to the old age pensioner who goes back to her garret room in this city after drawing her pension we say: &ldquo;We have given you your pension.  You must now try to live in a rather competitive jungle which we call society.&rdquo; While this Bill will bring some improvement we should look at it very critically, calmly and coldly to see has it got any soul whatsoever, that it is not merely the extension of the cheque-book conscience.  I feel we are not doing our job.  We are doing a kind of a job.  We are not giving the people the social welfare code which we with our beliefs should try to fashion, so that we as a small country, not very wealthy, would be healthy in our attitude to the people who are going to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary quoted <Col N="1383" /> Séamus Ó Cinnéide in his study&mdash;<i>A Law for the Poor:</i></P>
    <P>Practice may have varied over time and from place to place but the philosophy of the Poor Law was repressive and inhumane.  We must have a new philosophy now.</P>
    <P>In 20 or 25 years' time, whoever stands here and discusses social welfare may well find themselves agreeing with Séamus Ó Cinnéide.  I believe we are just as culpable and deserve as much censure as Séamus Ó Cinnéide wrote in his book of the people who went before him.</P>
    <P>How smug we feel when we read a book by Charles Dickens.  We think of Oliver Twist.  Because a boy asked for more they beat him and said he was a fool.  We have the same attitude. A person who would now demand more from the State would be another Oliver Twist, who had the audacity to ask for more.  Maybe the financial pensions to be given under this Bill, meet some of our modern standards.  We do not know if those standards are high enough.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we will propose amendments, and we hope they will be passed to perfect the Bill.  There are some good things in the Bill and there are things that are not good.  If we want to wipe out the old memory of the poor law system, how do we do it?  It is very fashionable to criticise people who have to administer Acts.  Are we giving them a proper system whereby any poor law stigma will be removed and people will be encouraged to avail themselves of the new benefits?  The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>One recent social survey among poor people showed quite clearly that more than a quarter of persons who were actually receiving home assistance at the time of interview did not admit this fact to the interviewers and the author of the survey was forced to the conclusion that this was due to a basic feeling of shame associated with the service.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is made in the first and second lines they refer to &ldquo;a <Col N="1384" /> recent social survey among poor people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Any 19th century do-gooder could not have put it any better than to refer to a social survey among poor people. That condescending attitude is in this Bill.  We could refer to people who are deprived of wealth, or health, or people who are handicapped in some way.  We have not got rid of our attitude to the poor law system.  This is a basic weakness in our legislation.</P>
    <P>We should ensure that nobody wants for the basic necessaries of life.  We should also try to find out why people will not admit that they draw home assistance.  We know that very often gentle people who have seen better days are ashamed to admit that they are in need now.  We should find out why they are ashamed.  To my mind there is nothing to be ashamed of.  Perhaps it is that they mistrust the establishment and would rather not take anything from it.  The fact is if they do not want to starve they must accept assistance, but will not admit this.</P>
    <P>Before we have a proper social welfare code we must examine not what we give to people, not how much money we give, or what service we give, but our whole attitude to social welfare.  We are just as culpable, just as guilty of being do-gooders and creating that atmosphere among people who must avail of the State services.  If we went back to the Middle Ages when they practised a much more civilised form of assistance we could learn from history what our attitude should be.  We should find out why people cannot cope with our present day society, why people become recluses and do not want to avail of our services.  If a person is suffering from an ailment he should get the very best treatment that will restore him to health.  If an old lady, an old age pensioner, has to live in the top room of a tenement in this city, what is wrong with our housing situation?  She should be given a proper dwelling to live in.</P>
    <P>We have to go much deeper into our whole attitude towards that section of our people who have not got sufficient means and who cannot, by their own endeavours, provide themselves <Col N="1385" /> with a proper income to enable them to live, at least, a frugal existence. Looking at society today in Ireland or, indeed, elsewhere, many people would become rather frightened of what we see emerging.  We admit there is world depression.  I find in the city that much is lacking on the social scene.  Many youngsters are living and sleeping rough because they have no homes to go to.  If a boy appears before a court and is remanded on bail because there is nowhere else to send him, he goes out on the streets and lives rough and ends up in court again.  This is not in the Bill, but the point I am making is that this is all part of our social welfare code.  I have talked to some of these youngsters and they have no home to go to.  If they demanded a home, I suppose we would regard them as the people of Dickens's time regarded Oliver Twist &mdash;the boy who asked for more.  This runs right through our social welfare system.  We are &ldquo;upping&rdquo; the payments under this Bill for certain categories. At the moment home assistance officers can give relief to people over and above what is spelled out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There was a case last week of a strike, or a lock out, and people were debarred from getting relief.  That is covered in this Bill.  The point is that we went through the motions of getting in touch with the Department and saying: &ldquo;These men's wives and children have no food.  Will you give them some help?&rdquo;  The civil servants rightly said they had to test it out because under the law the civil servants cannot say: &ldquo;Yes; give these men help or their wives and children help&rdquo;.  That was done about this day week and the applications were rejected.  I got a man to go to the local health board to see if they could give him anything.  Again, he was rejected there, which leaves a great big gap which the Bill will fill to some extent.  Can you imagine that there were women and children in this city last week who could well have been deprived of food because there was an industrial dispute?  Their menfolk were not working.  They were not drawing any wages or salary and therefore their wives and children suffered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> If this Bill helps in this respect, fair enough, but I hope it helps in the proper way.  We will be examining that section very critically.  The point I am making is that it was brought home to me last week how grim things can be for a person in this city in 1975.  On any occasion on which we get a chance to speak here we cannot be complacent because there may be some other section of the people who are suffering just as badly as these people suffered last week.</P>
    <P>I hold the local home assistance officers in great respect.  I found them to be men and women who were concerned and who would express their concern and would do anything possible to help.  I would say the same of the Department of Social Welfare. Very often there are seemingly very long delays in dealing with applications for benefit.  I know the Department must, of course, satisfy themselves that the cases are genuine but we should have a speeding up in the decision making and in the actual despatch of benefit to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>We must encourage old people&mdash; we will call them genteel people&mdash; who do not like queuing for benefits. Deputy Andrews mentioned that payment by cheque would help.  It would. Apart from anything else, cheques would curb to some extent the activities of people who rob depots and banks and post offices nowadays with great frequency.  A cheque would give a pensioner a great sense of satisfaction. It would be a status symbol that a cheque was arriving each week by post.  This might cost more money and it might cause extra work in the Department, but it would be well worth while.</P>
    <P>I am sure no party in this House have a monopoly of concern for what people really want, and the people generally who can afford to be taxed to pay the benefits, do not want any demeaning condition attached to any payment or State pension.  Therefore, the post office or the health centre should be a real community centre where people will come to be helped, and they should be encouraged to come there and if they cannot <Col N="1387" /> come, the pension will be sent out to them.</P>
    <P>Before we begin congratulating ourselves on our enlightened attitude, we must change our whole basic attitude to the disbursement of the State funds which we apportion to social welfare.  Perhaps someone will come up with a nice new title for social welfare. This evolved over the years and I am sure the people who first called it &ldquo;poor law assistance&rdquo; thought it was a good thing.  At that time we had a much more distinct cleavage between the haves and the have-nots. It is still very much present today but not as evident.  Today, we have a sort of hidden poverty.</P>
    <P>If one goes through the city one can see many different forms of poverty.  I can remember, when I was a boy in the city, that poverty was much more rampant and it was really grim then.  Thank God, we have advanced from that, but there are still pockets of poverty which we must alleviate.  We should underline all our social welfare legislation by saying that we believe there is more to social welfare than merely the payment of benefits.  Social welfare should be a Christian approach to our fellow men and women who temporarily&mdash;I stress the word &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo;&mdash;cannot provide for their own welfare.  I would write into every social welfare Act an educational clause whereby any person could be taught even a hobby, or a trade, whereby he would be preparing himself for the day when he could again become a contributing member of our society.  The State should have evolved a system of social welfare&mdash; I would even call it human welfare&mdash; of which we could say: this is our code: it is a code designed to help people who need help at the moment. Further than that, it is a code which will help them to help themselves, that no person who cannot, by his own industry, provide for himself will be neglected.  I am sure that every person who needs the help of the State to survive in some way in the past helped to create the wealth which we are now redistributing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> Our attitude towards State welfare should not be just to provide pensions for all those entitled to pensions.  We do not want to create the idea that these people are depending on the State and therefore they will accept their pension and commit their lives. We must show them that the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is given a much broader scope and that a person who perhaps because of lack of education, cannot take up good employment, is trained as part of welfare to enable him to take up good employment; or the person who is handicapped by some physical ailment is taught a trade or even a hobby to give him the feeling that he is contributing something to the national wealth.</P>
    <P>We say that the various organisations do all this.  They do, but the point is that we are not doing enough of it. Many a person ends up unemployed because of the neglect of somebody to take the trouble to ensure that person was trained when he was young to fit him for some useful occupation.  People may salve their consciences by saying &ldquo;We pay tax so that that person can be helped&rdquo;.  It is true that we did not let them starve and we gave them some clothes and shelter but we did not emphasise that the person also requires the dignity of being useful to society. The State should preserve that dignity and encourage such a person to stand up and be counted among his fellowmen who are contributing by their efforts towards making a greater State which could disburse more.</P>
    <P>As I already mentioned, none of us in this House has a monopoly of concern for the betterment of our social welfare services.  It behoves each of us to try to improve this Bill.  I hope my colleagues on this side of the House&mdash; and I know they will&mdash;will try to make it a better Bill on the next stage.  I hope that when the Bill is passed in its amended form it will appear to those who are being helped that this is not merely another social welfare Bill. Perhaps we have been a little patronising in condemning the poor law system and the do-gooders' attitude. The people who went before, taking the circumstances of their times into account, were perhaps just as good or <Col N="1389" /> as bad as we are.  We should stop looking down our noses at the people who, 150 years ago, tried to do something. Recently, I read a criticism of the English reformer, Elizabeth Frye, and the work she was doing in the prisons.  Some of the comments are a bit trite but then against the background of those awful times of the English prison system, we see she was trying to do what we are now trying to do but we have the benefit of 150 years of hindsight and therefore we should do better.  We have more wealth to distribute than these people had.</P>
    <P>I will be studying the Bill with my colleagues on this side of the House. We accept the good parts and will try to amend even them.  I hope that we will drop this attitude of trying to create the impression that this is a benign State disbursing largesse to the people who need it.  The Bill will fail and all other Bills will fail unless we get it across to the people who are going to benefit by this that we are doing this because we believe society owes these people a debt in some form or another.  We must try to give these people the best form of social services we can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for introducing the Bill.  I was amazed at the begrudging attitude of Deputy Andrews, Shadow Minister for Social Welfare, towards this Bill which I consider is a step in the right direction. As I sat here and listened to him bemoaning the fact that this Government's achievements in the social welfare field had been very meagre&mdash;I have been in politics for 20 years&mdash; I had to pinch myself listening to a man who had been part of a Government for 16 years and in that time I can well remember the budgets and the benefits in social welfare&mdash;half-a-crown for the old age pensioner and a penny on the pint and 2d on the plug of tobacco.  I was amazed at his attitude.  In many aspects of his speech he contributed in a good way but his attitude at the outset was one that does not become a shadow Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> This Bill shows concern for the under-privileged and is a genuine effort to reduce the poverty endured by the less well-off and by so doing to bring dignity into their lives.  I know from my involvement in local authorities that the term &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo; was a degrading description of this very necessary assistance for people who had to come cap-in-hand to the home assistance officer looking for money to keep body and soul together in bad times.  Thank God, this reminder of the bad days is now gone.  Today we can say to the old age pensioner or persons living on their own, &ldquo;It is now your right.  You do not have to go begging and you do not have to go with cap-in-hand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the home assistance officers who were the agents by which this home assistance programme was carried out.  These people were deeply involved in the community, knew the people who needed the relief and were prepared to do all in their power to assist them in their times of emergency.  I should like to compliment them on their work in community care.  They have become involved in this new aspect of rural Ireland where groups of people get together in voluntary organisations and help to the best of their ability the people living on their own in rural areas and others who are badly off.</P>
    <P>This is the start of our fight against poverty, but there is a lot more to be done.  Poverty is not money alone. Poverty is the position a person can find himself in when he has not a house, when he has been badly educated or has not a job.  In the last two-and-a-half years our Government have achieved substantial progress in the field of housing and education. Today is one of innovation in social welfare development in our community. We have a lot more to do but I believe that with the goodwill of community care groups and with the work of voluntary organisations in each parish, this terribly degrading situation can be beaten so that people who are in such dire need can raise their heads and be proud of their situation in the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> I am concerned at one aspect of this Bill.  Perhaps at this stage nothing can be done.  In 1970 when the Health Act was introduced and when health boards were formed, the Government gave the option to county councils to opt out of home assistance or to keep home assistance as their own responsibility, and from hindsight, having served on health boards and being involved in county councils, I am satisfied that my county, which was one of the ten that opted to hold on to home assistance, did the right thing.  Our officers were concerned, they were among the people and were doing a good job. From my experience of the health boards since their inauguration I am not at all satisfied that this very important work of looking after the people who need looking after will be done to the best of the ability of the health board.  I consider that the officers of regional boards are too far removed from the people and from the illnesses and the defects of the community around them.  This Bill would have done a much better job if it had given the option to county councils to opt out and to continue with the service of caring for the poverty-stricken.</P>
    <P>If at this stage the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary are not in a position to give this option, I would urge the Minister, in the light of my experience, to make it clear to the CEOs and the executives of the health boards that they are not dealing with numbers when they are dealing with cases such as have been dealt with under home assistance who are now going to be dealt with under this Bill. These are poor people who need assistance. Unless we can get this message conveyed to them and unless a separate body is established within the health boards to look after the application of this Bill, the people who need it most will receive the least, as has often happened before.  With the best intentions in the world, administration can take most of the money and the people that need it will not get it.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the cost. Deputy Andrews referred also to the <Col N="1392" /> health charges.  I do not think anyone can be fooled by such a statement.  It is apparent from our achievements in the last two years that the health charges have been transferred from the backs of the ratepayers.  In the past year this Government have proved their concern to ensure that this inequality of rates burden and tax burden should be spread over a wider area. Despite the remarks of Deputy Andrews, these same Bills and enactments which are there for the betterment and the improvement of all our people have been bitterly opposed by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I wanted to be brief but I had to speak on the position of health boards looking after this Bill.  I am worried about it, and I would appeal to the Minister concerned to ensure that this very important Bill be properly and humanely handled by the health boards to ensure the best good for the people concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the introduction of this Bill.  This is a very important piece of legislation as far as the poorer sections of our community are concerned.  When this Bill becomes law people will be entitled to something by right of statute.  They will not be going, as has been said, cap-in-hand looking for a favour.  This is a very important thing in the field in which it operates.  For very many years, even people who were in serious need were reluctant to approach a home assistance officer because of the stigma that was attached to seeking help and also because of the attitudes adopted by some, and I specify the word &ldquo;some&rdquo;, home assistance officers. The interrogation people were subjected to in order to get the paltry shillings necessary to keep body and soul together was unjustifiable.  This, thank God, has changed recently and I think this Bill should be the finish of it. People will now go to a home assistance officer, knowing they have a statutory right to benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The category of persons to whom this Bill applies has been downtrodden for many many years.  I am glad that the kind of benefit they can expect <Col N="1393" /> now is being stated clearly.  They know that they can appeal to the health board against a decision which goes against them.  That is a very important aspect of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It was extraordinary to hear from the other side of the House that what is being done is not a lot.  Their record in this field has not been good, this Bill is an attempt to give at least basic rights to people in need.  It spells out the right of the individual who finds himself in the awful position of not having the necessities of life.  It gives the individual the right to know what he is entitled to.</P>
    <P>In most rural areas benefit is paid direct by post.  Sometimes, however, a person's eligibility expires but he is not notified of this, so that suddenly, one Friday morning, payment does not arrive and he begins to wonder whether it was a delay in the post that was the reason.  He waits for his postman on Saturday morning but still the cheque does not arrive.  At that stage he goes to look for the home assistance officer which, I suppose, is unfair to that man, too, because it is Saturday and his day off. Even when he finds him, he has no proof that he did not get his cheque the day before.  He is likely to be told that the cheque cannot be got out before Monday.  That unfortunate man who has not been blessed with a lot of this world's goods for the past while back because he has been on disability benefit finds himself in the position of having no means at all for that weekend.  This is a very serious mistake on the part of the Department of Social Welfare.  If a man is on disability benefit he should have at least a month's notice as to when it is due to expire, whereas he probably is notified three weeks afterwards. There should be some scheme whereby the Department would notify the local home assistance officer of the expiry of an eligibility period. Then it would be the duty of that officer to see that the man knew his position and that he could be assessed for some other form of benefit. We just cannot leave people who are surviving on ordinary disability benefits for a number of weeks without <Col N="1394" /> any benefits.  In this area there would have to be co-operation between the officer of the health board and the officer from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Some home assistance officers have been fairly severe in interrogating people who have applied for home assistance but in the main the officers have operated the system in difficult circumstances and I congratulate them on that.</P>
    <P>So long as the Government continue to show their concern for the less well-off they will have my full support. This Bill is a further measure of that concern for the less well off, not only for their needs but for their dignity. That is very important to anyone who finds himself in the unfortunate position of being in need of home assistance or supplementary allowance. They should be able to go manfully to the officer, knowing their rights.  It is very important also that they have the right of appeal if the officer feels they should not be helped.</P>
    <P>In regard to the health boards I am inclined to gree with the last speaker, Deputy J. Ryan, that they have become colossal and, very often, are remote from the ordinary people.  In such circumstances the home assistance officers and section can be operated in such a way that they will be familiar with the needs of the people and the different areas.  In general terms I believe the movement to health boards did not bring about the desired improvement of our services and did not warrant the cost involved. Having said that, if there is an officer in each area operating the scheme properly he will know his people.  He will know, even in the circumstances I described earlier, whether he can take people's word.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope also that the benefits mentioned within the scheme are minimal and that, in certain circumstances, more will be allowed.  There are many reasons I can point out why there should be extra benefits in certain cases.  For example, if a man finds himself in the position that he has to apply for help under this Bill &mdash;he may be in a flat paying £8 to £10 for that accommodation for himself <Col N="1395" /> and his family.  That is a possibility, and something that would have to be taken into account in the amounts to be paid out under the Bill. I know this has been operating to a certain extent.  I think a previous speaker said it has been operating with regard to rents and other expenses a person normally has to pay &mdash;with the limit laid down here there would be exceptions where the officer on the spot giving the money, would be familiar with the situation; could check on it himself, and would be able to go outside the limits if the applicant's necessities so required.  In certain circumstances a person must get his needs and even if boosted by the type of situation I have outlined must be allowed with the limit being exceeded.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I believe this Bill is the first breakthrough since the old poor law days, removes the former stigma attached to home assistance, and gives a man the basic right to apply, knowing what are those rights, knowing that he can appeal if his rights, as he sees them, are refused by the officer concerned.  Up to now he did not know what he should get, how much he should get.  As far as I can ascertain, up to now the home assistance officer merely pulled a figure out of his head even if he recognised that the man was in dire need.  For that reason, I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on introducing this Bill.  I welcome it and feel it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose nor do I think it is necessary that one need speak at any great length.  One need do no more than welcome the proposals contained in this Bill, as has been said in the Minister's speech, not as a new comprehensive policy on social welfare but as another step forward, another step added to all those which have taken place, again in accordance with the Minister's speech, since 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ideally we would all strive for a society in which there would not be any need for that which is described as home assistance.  The greatest contribution I might make is to appeal to <Col N="1396" /> all to stop referring to the stigma that was attached to home assistance because the more often we refer to it and the more often we use the word &ldquo;stigma&rdquo;, the rose under any name will still remain, and there will remain an unwarranted stigma attached to any efforts made towards redressing the situation.  It is an extraordinary position in a country with a society prepared to subsidise the medical student to the extent of almost £1,000 a year apart from his own fee&mdash;again it must be remembered that any third-level student does not pay for the service he gets.  I had the opportunity of attending UCD and my indebtedness is not entirely to UCD but to the rest of the community who subsidised me while I was there.  In every walk of life we have such evidence.  We know what subsidies are paid and help is given.  For some unknown reason we do not attach any stigma if it is given for third-level education but, if given for first-level education, there seems to be some reason why it should be stigmatised.  I do not see why that should happen.  Perhaps we are at fault by continually referring back to the poor law system, to the home assistance that is gone.  Human nature being what it is, nobody wants&mdash;well, I will not say nobody but very few people want&mdash;to be associated with that which does not bring some form of compliment to themselves. I appeal to all sides that if we want to do what is proposed here and that contained in other legislation; if we want to indicate society's preparedness to admit that there are people in our community who for one reason or another cannot enjoy that which would be regarded as a normal standard of living&mdash;and there is a preparedness and an obligation on the rest of the community to so assist that group&mdash;there should be no question of any form of stigma, lack of dignity or anything of that nature being attached.  Every day of the week we have subsidies and assistance being given in other areas. We have assistance being given to the strongest industries in the country. Nobody suggests that the managing directors of those industries should hang their heads because they are <Col N="1397" /> enjoying a form of assistance from the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>We should not endeavour to make any cheap political points out of what we think the people are prepared to do for less well-off people.  We should be prepared to indicate on behalf of the people that what is being done is for certain people who are in need of it.  We want the system organised so that other members of society, who can live without this assistance will be unable to present themselves as true applicants for it.  Nobody should lack the courage to say that we want whatever resources are there&mdash;we all know these resources are not unlimited&mdash; directed to the proper destination.  We do not want other people, for whom they were not intended, trying to make an academic or technical case for their eligibility in this field.</P>
    <P>I feel inclined at times to give up when I find myself pleading the case of an applicant who finds himself confronted with the terrible institutions which have been created to administer the schemes.  If there is one thing contributing to the frustration, annoyance and the ultimate breakdown in the health of some of our people today it is the terrible anonymity which they feel, the terrible uselessness they feel, when contending with some of our institutions and some of our Departments that are there <i>prima facie</i> to help them but which, ultimately, seem to be there to thwart them.</P>
    <P>I had occasion during the week to make what we politicians describe as appropriate inquiries, recommendations and representations to the Department of Social Welfare and employment exchanges in respect of a lady who finds herself in search of home assistance which she cannot get because the legislation which was intended to help her has been so overgrown with red tape and green ivy that it is not possible to identify her specific problem. Because of its link with home assistance and social welfare benefits I ask you to bear with me while I refer to it briefly, especially in the presence of the Parliamentary Secretary whom I know to be genuinely interested in this field.</P>
    <P>This lady was employed for the last <Col N="1398" /> five years and at the beginning of this month she was declared redundant. She made application for unemployment benefit and because somewhere in the Department of Social Welfare her 1973-74 card had been mislaid that young, single lady is forced to go without any money until such time as her card is found.  I have been told, having made inquiries, that &ldquo;Action, Card Missing&rdquo; has been put into operation.  No money can be paid until all the relevant, bureaucratic regulations have been put into effect. Here we have legislation aimed at helping a person at the time when he or she is most in need of it yet we have this young lady, who unfortunately has no family, dependent on the charity of neighbours and other people so that she can remain alive. When she goes to the home assistance officer he, understandably, is exercising certain caution with her and there is a certain reluctance on his part to help.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the spirit of the legislation will be carried out as expeditiously as possible.  We hope we will not find ourselves ultimately confronted with a situation where that which is the normal right of the person under the legislation will be delayed because of some health board, Department or other institutional regulation.</P>
    <P>We should be clear about what exactly we mean when we use the word &ldquo;right&rdquo;.  The right to what? The right to some form of assistance today having been satisfied some new need will be generated tomorrow. There is need for a specific definition as to what exactly we mean when we say that the person is entitled to this &ldquo;by right&rdquo;.  We have to clarify the special right and that to which he or she is entitled the better to clarify in the minds of the people from whom basically and ultimately the money must be obtained.  This will bring to the legislation the sympathy of the people.  The Parliamentary Secretary's speech refers to the anticipated defence of the ratepayers in this regard in so far as they are being obliged to pay 40 per cent of the proposed excess.  It is no harm to ponder <Col N="1399" /> for a moment and satisfy ourselves on the extent to which the people in that category today are able to pay.  We have in the rate-paying category&mdash;I do not intend to exaggerate the position&mdash;some people who are in need of home assistance.</P>
    <P>Obviously, we must have some regard for their ability to pay.  I do not want to labour the position of the present unhealthy state of the economy but we know, to say the least, it is not healthy and it is not going to be much more healthy or virile next year. I hope the contributions will continue. To date the home assistance has been paid by ratepayers, but we should satisfy ourselves that in respect of whatever additional amounts have to be paid we know that the ratepayers are in a position to pay the amount required. If not I revert to the point I made earlier regarding the caution we should exercise, that at least that which is available will be directed to those most worthy, and those who are most worthy will get it.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that as of right they will get it and will be welcome to it by the rest of the community and that we will all resolve here, if we do nothing else, that if we want to remove the alleged stigma and lack of dignity which is attached to home assistance we should give the good example and stop using those words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Fundamentally, this Bill is to replace the old Poor Law home assistance structure.  It does not completely abolish the Acts which have gone before but it modernises, brings up to date or refurbishes the legislation that enables the Government to provide assistance at home level.  It is an extraordinary fact that there has been virtually no modern thinking in relation to home assistance from this House.  The last Act to deal with this was in 1939.  There have been various amendments and additions but nothing of what one could call a proper, modern restructuring of the thought that goes behind public assistance and its practical applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill can be described as one which gives people who are in circumstances <Col N="1400" /> of necessity, very often through no fault of their own, the right to assistance at the hands of the State.  Prior to this it relied on discreation of those officers and local committees to decide whether a person was even entitled to assistance, not to talk about the amount.  As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out there have been grave disparities in the interpretation of that discretion at local level.</P>
    <P>I suppose that variation in interpretation and exercise of the discretion has been due to various factors, including possibly the personnel that went to make up local committees, the individual characteristics of the various officers who applied the assistance code as we have known it to date.  The Parliamentary Secretary has rightly paid a compliment to those who have applied home assistance and local assistance to date. That does not get away from the fact that there have been grave imbalances in interpretation of the circumstances that permitted the payment of home assistance.</P>
    <P>Over the years a great deal of lip service has been paid to what should be done for those sections of our society that are not able to provide for themselves.  There can be varying reasons why people cannot provide for themselves, but anybody who has been in public life, or has had anything to do with the administration of social welfare or assistance, or has had anything to do with committees engaged in charitable work, have been virtually horrified at the hardships which certain people have to contend with.  Where there has been an altogether inadequate provision for these hardship cases, the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Health and the local authorities, have done their best with the limited powers, facilities and finances at their disposal to deal with these cases.</P>
    <P>How many of us in this House have gone into a shop on shopping day, seen a mother with her family going in to buy the essentials of life&mdash;food and clothes?  How many times have we seen that type of poor person ordering the goods, having them prepared and then <Col N="1401" /> on going to her purse finding that the mite she had there was not sufficient to meet these essentials, with the result that she had to put back some of them. None of us need to be a social worker to have observed that fact.  I doubt if there is any Deputy in this House who has not seen that situation occur.  I doubt if there is any citizen who has not seen that situation occur.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is important that Members see what the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to get at.  He is trying to give the God-given right these people have to have human dignity and the fundamental necessities of life. They have that right if all citizens are to be equal in the fundamental rights of citizens under our Constitution.  I noted that the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the family unit.  It is well for us to remember that the prime unit of our society is the family, and that is written into our Constitution.  This Bill honours that, acknowledges it, and applies that principle in realistic terms. As Deputy Andrews said, one cannot look at this in a vague abstract way, one must look at it in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, the financial requirements that go in to give the minimal necessary relief.</P>
    <P>There is not a Deputy who is not aware of the hardships that occur in any society, particularly in our own. We have had a history of foreign occupation which has not been conducive to easing the situation.  There is a long backlog of Government indebtedness in relation to this type of relief, this type of scheme and this type of work.  We will not see the completion of what is started in this Bill in our lifetime but it is a very necessary and essential step to put us on the right road.</P>
    <P>I know, as others do, that there are a lot of people who are ashamed, if not afraid, to apply for home assistance. Deputy Tunney quite rightly used the word &ldquo;stigma&rdquo;.  I am afraid it has been there because of the old aura of the poor law, county home and all that went with it.  I would describe it as back-handed charity, and that is all it was in real terms when it was examined.  If it were not for societies like St. Vincent de Paul, <Col N="1402" /> our society could be held up for indictment on our failure in this sphere.  It is only right that we should give acknowledgment and thanks to these charitable committees that have gone a long way to assisting in real terms the people who have suffered hardship.  No doubt, the societies will continue to find a place.  The fact that the State now acknowledges, in today's terms, its responsibilities in this sphere does not mean there will not be room for these societies to play their part. We are all grateful to them and we will continue to be grateful, because they have the wonderful facility of treating problems in human terms and in the individual terms and circumstances of the particular case.  I suppose nearly every Deputy here has had some contact, either as a working member, subscribing member or something or other, with various charitable societies.  It is not sufficient to put the money on the plate outside the church on Sunday or to subscribe when the collector comes to the door. All of us as citizens have a duty to provide, through the State, for the necessitous person.  That duty goes further than a mere token or part payment by way of alleviation.  It requires an overall community or State involvement.  Society has always been complex, but as standards improve, the disparity between the haves and the have-nots becomes all the greater.  In today's society it is no longer a matter for the individual citizen to say there are charitable organisations to deal with this, that and the other.  We are involved and we are responsible as legislators in this House.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one aspect of this matter of assistance.  It is difficult to put it in words and difficult for me to state it without misstating the situation.  We have all heard of the hurler on the ditch, the critic.  We have always heard and will continue to hear people saying: &ldquo;I work hard, I pay my tax, but there is that publican down the road who is doing the State by getting assistance to which he is not entitled.&rdquo;  If people believe that they are right in that criticism they should be able to go to the <Col N="1403" /> authority that dispenses the social assistance and say that such-and-such is not entitled to it.</P>
    <P>Another thing I should like to point out is that a lot of the critics about the allocation of assistance speak without knowledge of the inner workings and the inner circumstances of a family that is getting assistance.  They do not know because they are speaking from outside.  Many of them are people who have never had to worry as to where their next article of clothing is going to come from, or whether the roof is going to stay over their heads; whether they are going to have sufficient food; whether that child is going to be fed properly.  In the past we all saw the small paperboy around the city of Dublin collecting the coppers and giving the money in to the home.  Those of us who worked in St. Vincent de Paul in Dublin know that money may not have gone to the right cause, but we do know there are a lot of small people who have had to go out to work under very difficult circumstances, in circumstances of bad weather as a result of which many of them broke down in health and suffered afterwards in life.  They had to work because the State did not provide the necessary assistance to give their families the necessary wherewithal to provide a minimum degree of, may I call it, existence, not even comfort.</P>
    <P>But to get back again to some of the hurlers on the ditch who think that things should be done a certain way, most of their statements are short-lived; they do not get support, they get a quiet rumble of support. They are never able to follow it up because they are not prepared to spend the time or give the attention to trying to solve the real social problem that underlies their so-called complaint.</P>
    <P>A lot of these people who are so quick to criticise anything of an assistance or social welfare nature are the very people who are giving rise to the necessity for the social welfare measures.  A lot of these people are not <Col N="1404" /> making their fair contribution to society.  We all know of the people who can stuff a lot of their income into their hip pocket, make no return and not pay their due contribution to society.  Many of these people are people who have a very high standard of living.  I wonder how they manage to maintain it.  These are the sort of currents that run across any situation or anybody advocating an improvement in social welfare benefits.  For instance, there was a great deal of criticism in relation to pay-related benefit.  This is very relevant to this Bill because, despite all its criticisms, the pay-related benefit and the extension of the period of time in the particular circumstances in which we now find ourselves, has had the direct or indirect effect of lessening the load of assistance that would otherwise be called to be paid by the local authority under the assistance scheme as heretofore existed.  The future contribution from the local authority will be judged in relation to the amount of assistance that is disbursed this year.  In effect, therefore, that Bill that dealt with pay-related benefit will greatly alleviate the load that might otherwise have been placed on the ratepayers' shoulders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney need not be concerned whether the ratepayer will be able to meet the small additional amounts that will be required under this Bill.  The calculations that have been made by the Parliamentary Secretary and which appear in his opening statement are very accurate ones, as the Department have been extremely accurate in their calculations in the social welfare field to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy has in mind the scheme of social assistance allowances for elderly single <Col N="1412" /> women.  I cannot, however, accept the implied comparison between the position of the women for whom this scheme caters and that of widows. The single women's scheme was, of course, designed to meet a specific need and stands on its own feet but I would suggest that if comparisons are being sought, one must look to the unemployment assistance scheme rather than to widows' pensions.  The maximum rate of single women's allowance is the same as the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable to single persons, male or female, in an urban area and the means assessment is broadly similar to that which operates for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>
      <P>The scheme of social assistance allowances for single women has been in operation only since July, 1974, and I have no proposals at present for changing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why his Department recognises for credited contributions medical certificates submitted since 11th December, 1974, by a person in County Laois (details supplied) when he was not credited for certificates of incapacity from April, 1973, onwards when he was equally medically incapable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Credited contributions were not awarded to the person referred to by the Deputy in respect of medical certificates covering the <Col N="1413" /> period from April, 1973 to 10th December, 1974 as it was found on investigation that he was self-employed during that period to the extent that he could not be regarded as incapable of work.  This decision was upheld on appeal.  For the purpose of allowing credited contributions from 11th December, 1974 his self-employment was accepted as having ceased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary give me any idea how this claimant can be genuinely considered to be incapable of work from 11th December when his medical condition was exactly the same as it had been from April, 1973 to that date? In view of the fact that it would appear that the deciding officer's decision has been overridden departmentally, could he not decide to extend that disqualification of the deciding officer's decision retrospectively to April, 1973 in order to meet the requirements of this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this case has been the subject of a decision by a deciding officer and, on appeal, by an appeals officer. These officers are independent of ministerial direction or control, as I am sure the Deputy will agree is the proper position for them to be in, and without additional or fresh evidence it is not possible for me to intervene in the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Parliamentary Secretary says but is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that on 7th March of this year I received a letter from his Department saying that the appeals officer had decided that the claimant was not entitled and that it was subsequent to that date that a further decision was taken which determined that certificates submitted from 11th December were allowable?  I agree with the decision which was made subsequent to the appeals officer's decision.  What I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary is, could that 11th December date be altered to April, 1973?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing that was decided was that from 11th <Col N="1414" /> December he would be given credits but the decision of both the deciding officer and the appeals officer was that up to and including 10th December the man was, in fact, self-employed. I understand he ran a garage business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

I have to accept questions and surely it is reasonable that they should accept the answers.  The 102,000 unemployed in the present economic climate compares reasonably favourably with the figures during an economic boom right through from 1945 with 65,000&mdash;75,000 unemployed which was accepted by Fianna Fáil as normal and acceptable plus&mdash;up to the mid 1960s&mdash;30,000 emigrating annually.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the principle adopted in ascertaining means in those circumstances is that which was laid down by the previous administration.  The only difference is that while 50 pence per week or over it did affect a person's means, that means test has now been very considerably eased under the present administration.</P>

      <P>The person named by the Deputy applied for a widow's contributory pension on 5th March, 1975. Although her late husband was employed in this country for approximately seven years before his death, he was not insured for widows' and orphans' pension purposes until April, 1974, when the insurability limit on earnings was abolished.  The widow was not at any stage insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  She is not, therefore, entitled to a contributory pension on the basis of either her own or her late husband's Irish insurance position.</P>
      <P>Enquiries are, however, continuing as to the slight possibility of an effective insurance record in respect of her late husband's employment abroad.  In the meantime, the question of her entitlement to a non-contributory pension is being examined.</P>

I am aware of the dissatisfaction in the FCA because the study in question has not been completed but I, too, am thoroughly dissatisfied with the present situation regarding the FCA.

In relation to security duties there was a situation in my Department whereby it was indicated that the cost of FCA men coming into barracks had rocketed to three or four times the figure it had been.  Without my knowledge there was, not a directive, but an indication given that there should be greater and more careful examination of the barrack guard duties which the FCA were undertaking before very considerable expense should be engaged in in this regard.  As soon as I became aware of this, I indicated that because of the Border situation and the need for the guards to be helped in their security duties, we should not penny-pinch in any way in relation to FCA men coming into barracks to carry out some security duties, thereby releasing members of the Permanent Defence Force for security duties.

I said that as soon as this became known to me&mdash;this would have been about two months ago&mdash;I immediately called in the civil servants in my Department together with the military authorities concerned and indicated that because of the necessity for members of the Permanent Defence Force to be engaged on security duties in greater numbers, there should be no such restriction. Indeed, there was not even a restriction but merely an indication that the cost had risen to three or four times its previous figure and that, therefore, a situation should be assessed carefully before calling in FCA men.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>While the maximum facilities will be provided for annual training of the FCA during the summer period of this year there may be difficulty in providing staffs and accommodation for such training because of the necessity to house and train the influx of recruits to the Permanent Defence Force arising from the recruiting campaign.  If such a situation arises priority for training will be given to personnel with long service who reported for training last year.  It is, however, too early as yet to say whether annual training of the FCA this year will be restricted to any appreciable extent.</P>

However, it has become necessary to make changes but these changes will be made in the best way possible.

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the plans he has for the manufacture of the Timoney armoured car in the light of the present employment and economic situation, taking into consideration the interest shown by prospective purchasers from other nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>Panhard armoured cars and Panhard armoured personnel carriers were selected as being the most suitable vehicles of their respective types for the Defence Forces that were available when it was first decided to purchase them in 1964 and 1971 respectively.  Their mechanical performance is satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with a decision taken in 1972, three prototype vehicles, known colloquially as Timoney <Col N="1433" /> armoured personnel carriers, have been produced in Ireland for my Department and have been delivered to the Defence Forces.  The vehicles have not completed all their tests and unless they do so satisfactorily the production of a number of vehicles based on them, for use by the forces, could not be justified on military, social or economic grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Panhard, could the Minister indicate whether the selection of such equipment was done by a committee or was the decision of one man?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 22 and the Panhard armoured car, could the Minister indicate the percentage of vehicles operational at all times?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that only 60 per cent of these are operational at all times?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that all sorts of military vehicles and equipment require constant attention and servicing.  As long as we have the number of Panhard armoured cars on the road that we need to combat any eventuality, I am satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate what type of eventuality he has in mind?  Does the Minister think that 50 per cent of such eventualities would be those he envisages, or does he think the type of eventuality he envisages the only type that can happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>An armoured personnel carrier is not a pugnacious sort of weapon or anything of that type.  It is a vehicle in which one can safely move personnel in conditions of crowd control from one place to another, let out personnel if one wants or observe without letting out personnel at all.  They will withstand considerable attack by bombs and almost any attack by small arms fire.  Therefore, one can safely move personnel <Col N="1434" /> in riot conditions.  As long as I am told by the military authorities that I have a sufficiency of such vehicles to combat any situation of riot or crowd control in any part of the country, then I am happy with the number I have.  I am so informed and, therefore, am happy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to the Timoney armoured vehicle is that I had a conference with persons involved at the very top of the Army structure, the Civil Service, Professor Timoney and his people some weeks ago.  At that time the Timoney vehicles had been on test constantly&mdash;when they had been handed over&mdash;by fairly skilled Army personnel.  The last test, and there were also some small matters needing attention, would be sending them out on command where, in ordinary combat conditions, they would do a certain number of miles and so prove they were efficient vehicles and ready for production.  That is the point at which they are at present.  At present prototypes 2 and 3 are not being used. Prototype 1 is being used.  When it has completed some thousands of miles with the commands, then we shall be able to have an appraisal.  I will receive that appraisal from the military authorities and hopefully, at that stage, proceed with an order for some of these vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  In fact, the low loader to which the Deputy referred was not similar.  It did not have a tilting platform and was higher, making loading that much more difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to change the existing arrangements under which fishery protection is carried out by the Naval Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1440" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House if any costing has been made in relation to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any costing having been made but it will be obvious to the House that to set up a coastguard service would be highly expensive.  I do not think that is what disqualifies it.  It is a question of how best one can do the job and that would seem to me to involve naval vessels to patrol the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it costs a considerable sum to provide the existing vessels, would not the Minister agree that the provision of smaller vessels located at various points around the coast would be the best service that could be provided for fishery protection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not so agree. In fact, that is the hoariest old chestnut that ever was.  Everybody raises it over the years.  In fact, I brought it up myself here.  The position as I see it, and as I am advised, is that the weather around our coast, particularly the west, is such that we need all-weather fishery protection vessels.  We really have one only. The minesweeper we have does not operate in very heavy weather conditions. As the possible extension of our boundaries will involve greater areas to be patrolled farther from the coast, the idea of men with field-glasses on ground does not seem to me something that would constitute a proper departure in 1975.  The proper departure in 1975 would be if the law of the sea permitted us to do not merely surveillance but possibly arrest, or define, recognise and possibly prosecute a foreign State from aircraft.  That might happen if the law of the sea were changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law of the sea conference has gone on for two years and resumes next March and it looks to me as if it will be a long time before we get that.  In the meantime we are limited to the definition of where the fellow is, the boarding, arresting and bringing to port.  That is a big limitation which can only be carried out by naval vessels, not only naval vessels, <Col N="1441" /> but those that can take all sorts of weathers and operate further from the coast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that he is giving protection at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not go that far.  I am satisfied I am giving protection, having been left on my bare feet two-and-a-half years ago, but I am satisfied I am giving fully adequate protection.</P>

      <P>The laying down of new all-weather fishery protection vessels costing a lot of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they actually being laid down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Irish Shipping are acting as agents for us in this and they are working with Verolme. The day I see the keels laid down in Cork or somewhere else, but preferably in Cork, will be a happy day for me.  There is no question of the Government stopping it.  I have Government sanction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's reply that no consideration at all has been given to the possibility of providing a coastguard service or a proper fishery protection service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration has been given over the years to every aspect of this particular problem.  The position is that it is quite obvious that <Col N="1442" /> a coastguard service all around our coasts would cost a lot of money.  We must also remember that sometimes visibility is down to a few yards and a coastguard service does not give the sort of protection that an all-weather fishery protection vessel does.  Small vessels are not practical because the best fishing times in the year are very often the heaviest weather times of the year so we need vessels that can go out.  We are limited by the law of the sea, as I have said, to how we can stop these fellows from poaching. The law of the sea says that you have got to board, arrest and bring to port. I do not know how you can do that with a coastguard service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point outlined by the Minister in relation to the law of the sea that you must board and arrest.  Even allowing for that would it not be possible for the helicopter service to come to the aid of the fishing patrol vessel through spotting?  Even though it would not actually arrest it could direct.</P>

      <P>I would call the Deputy's attention to the fact that Deputy Blaney said that even with the fishery protection vessel the poacher was gone outside our limits before he could be arrested.  The sight of a helicopter arriving means that you slip out.  At the present moment the limits are quite restrictive.  They are either six miles or 12 miles.  If the law of the sea changes it may be possible to identify a poacher and prosecute him in his own country.  We are not masters of this.  As I understand the law of the sea conference at the moment every nation wants everything it wants and nothing anybody else wants.  Until they have clarified their position and made new international laws we are limited to the situation of board, arrest and bring to port.</P>

I made a decision that we would fly a Dove aircraft over them and shove them out.  They went out like a flash but, of course, we could not arrest them.  This is the dilemma. We will do our very best in this matter.</P>

    <P>The offices of the National Manpower Service are available to all exservicemen in the matter of seeking suitable employment and they are advised to use them.

      <P>The Minister indicated in his reply that he is not prepared to go on the lines suggested by Deputy Davern.  Is he aware that many personnel leaving the Defence Forces at the moment end up attending petrol pumps because of the lack of advice and guidance in the pre-discharge days?  Would he have another look at the situation to ensure that men who have served this nation loyally over the years are properly provided for and assisted to obtain suitable employment so that they will not have to accept menial jobs such as they have to at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. The situation is that preference is given to members of the Defence Forces who are leaving those forces. They are in a scheme which provides for the awarding of extra marks and the extension of the normal upper age limit in competitions, such as the general service clerical officer, Departmental clerical officer and tax officer in the Civil Service, assistant preventive officer, prison officer, male attendant in Dundrum hospital, postman and driver tester.  I am also aware that commanding officers are very good in their concern for non-commissioned officers and men who are leaving the forces.  I am aware of their very good efforts to try and place these men.  I am limited in what I can do in training with the Defence Forces at the present moment by the demands of security duties.  That means that what I wish to do cannot be done in full.  The introduction of a placement officer would not be very much use.  You would want a very large organisation to do this.  The commanding officers do it in conjunction with the resettlement assistance scheme of the National Manpower Service.  The men are put in touch with this and in their pre-discharge period are told what jobs they can get or registered with the resettlement assistance scheme of the National Manpower Service.  They are helped by the commanding officers in every way.  I have had non-commissioned <Col N="1445" /> officers and men express to me their thanks for the way in which their commanding officers helped them during their pre-discharge period.</P>

      <P>The National Manpower Service is available to everyone so there is no extra assistance given by referring a man to that service. This is a question of assisting a man for resettlement after giving a long period of service.  While the Minister has indicated that certain preference is given in certain Departments there are many men who leave the Defence Forces with absolutely nothing to their credit so far as skills are concerned.

The only difference between the Deputy, his colleague and me is that I do not accept that the appointment of such a placement officer would have any great effect.  The commanding officers do their best.  As well as that we have a scheme whereby local authorities give preference.  We have registered apprentices in courses as fitters, bricklayers, decorators, painters and plasterers at the AnCO service.  We have a number of men with the corps of engineers who have attended courses in the AnCO service.  We have an informal settlement scheme in the Curragh and employers in the area are <Col N="1446" /> encouraged to employ people who are leaving the Army.  This is all being well done.

    <Title>Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Bill, 1975: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was referring to the &ldquo;hurlers on the ditch&rdquo; as having been critical in the past in relation to social welfare and assistance payments.  I mentioned that these people were inclined to talk in generalities, in particular about their own area, in relation to cases they knew of.  There seemed to be little information forthcoming in relation to the specific cases they were <Col N="1454" /> talking about.  For fear that these people may have had further fuel added to their fears, be they real or unreal, I should like to point out that there are specific exclusions of certain categories for the purposes of relief under this Bill.  When they are examined and brought to light on Committee Stage it will be seen that they are reasonable.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in the Bill dealing with this matter and it was referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary who stated:</P>
      <P>Subject to regulations to be made by the Minister, a health board may determine that a person shall not be entitled to the new allowance unless he is registered for employment.</P>
      <P>As I understand it this is one of the complaints people have been voicing. They say that people are drawing relief while doing &ldquo;nixers&rdquo;.  These critics say that these people with the combined social payments, plus the earnings from &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; are better financially than they were if they had a full-time job.  This provision is a necessary safeguard.  It should put at rest the worries of certain people.</P>
      <P>Basically, this Bill is an instrument to attack poverty.  Poverty is a crime committed by the nation, if it is allowed to continue.  It is not sufficient to say we will always have the poor with us; I do not think we have to accept that.  When we use the word &ldquo;poor&rdquo; we are dealing in quantitative and quantity terms.  It becomes a loose word to use when dealing with matters of poverty.  The question that faces us is: are we going to allow poverty to continue?  If we are not; what are we going to do about it? Are we going to adopt the attitude that what will be will be and let us have it as a running sore, a thing that politicians and social workers talk and declaim about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When dealing with hardship and poverty we must realise that there are some who can help themselves.  We have the means to improve our lot, but there are others who have not and will not have help to bring succour to themselves.  This is a facet <Col N="1455" /> of human nature; a facet of the circumstances in which people find themselves. I hope poverty is not made the plaything of politics.  Please God it will not be the plaything of politics and politicians in future.  I am aware that certain politicians and public representatives cash in on hardship situations under the social welfare code and various pension committees. I know certain people make it their business to get advance information and dash out to tell the person involved that they have got them a pension. It is not they who have got the pension but the fact that certain standards have been complied with and that the person involved is entitled to the relief or pension award. It has nothing to do with the person who likes to cash in on other people's hardship.</P>
    <P>As public representatives we should shake off the shadow of the social gaol that has heretofore surrounded and put in bondage the poor of our society.  The Parliamentary Secretary at the outset made a deliberately restrained statement.  The Bill is a small part of what the Parliamentary Secretary's ultimate ambitions are in this sphere.  I am sure all Deputies will try and make this Bill a useful one and one that achieves something in real terms for those who incur hardship.</P>
    <P>When I became a Member of this House the first Act of Parliament I looked at in the Library was the Assistance Act, 1939.  I am amazed that although 35 years have passed our social thinking and action in this sphere have virtually stood still. People in hardship situations have to rely upon local authority charity.  I should like to underline the word charity, spelt with a small &ldquo;c&rdquo;. Wherever there was an entitlement to relief it was so circumscribed by limitations and prohibitions that it was virtually not of much assistance, if it could be called assistance at all.</P>
    <P>This Bill is important in so far as it deals with the problem that has been experienced and observed by anybody who has taken any interest in this side of public policy.  There must be <Col N="1456" /> no disparity in the application of the system where it is properly required. It has always been a service of last resort, and in some areas and circumstances where it was needed it was not worthwhile applying for it as it was so unrealistic and so minimal.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the Bill is that it will establish overall national standards.  It will no longer be given on the basis of putting gruel in the poor house beggar's bowl.  It will be given as a right to those justly entitled to it, and it will be given on the basis that the person receiving it will be treated as a human being with all the dignity and respect that is his just entitlement.  There will not be this shadow of guilt and shame over it.</P>
    <P>We have the evidence here in the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement of the research workers coming across that invisible barrier of shame, where people were ashamed, if not afraid, to provide the material and the particulars that would enable a full and proper inquiry to be made in certain areas of poverty.  It is a frightful indictment of us in this nation that we have allowed things to progress so far.  One must bear in mind that the shame people feel where assistance is called for and sought very often originates from circumstances for which the applicant is in no way responsible.  Very often the applicant for this assistance has been reduced to the circumstances by the acts or omissions of other people or by our society and our so-called standards.  It is as well for the critics of our social welfare code to bear those facts in mind.</P>
    <P>When I speak in those terms I do not speak as a person apart from the situation.  I must, as a public representative dealing with my constituents, admit that I have come across those circumstances, and I do not think there is any Deputy who does his constituency work that has not experienced that situation, and it has been a sore indictment of our society that that situation should have been allowed to develop.  This Bill, as I said, will establish overall national <Col N="1457" /> standards.  Committees have been seen to take different standards, make different judgments, where the circumstances have been the same.</P>
    <P>This Bill also speaks with a conscience in that it recognises the prime unit as being the family, and it recognises that members of a family have a duty to other near members of the family.  There is a provision that a person should provide for his family and it enables the health board to compel those people to make a contribution. If they have not got a conscience there is provision in the Bill that enables people to have a conscience. It is unfortunate in what we regard as a Christian society that such a provision has to be inserted, but I suppose the frailty of human nature requires that these things be done.  I am sure it is no pleasure for those responsible for such a Bill to have to insert such a provision, but the drafters of the Bill have exercised a proper conscience in their application to the problem.</P>
    <P>In case people might have the idea that this Bill is one that provides purely monetary assistance, I want to dispel that idea, as there are provisions in the Bill for giving other assistance, and there is a certain elasticity which enables the Minister to exercise a discretion in circumstances that are possibly contemplated by the administrators of this Bill when it becomes law or also in other case where circumstances arise which have not been provided for or not thought of.  In other words, it is not a static measure. It is one that intends to be a viable arm in providing assistance, and although in many cases it will be the assistance of last resort, there is ample provision for appeals and for the authorities to exercise discretion.  As the Parliamentary Secretary says in his opening statement:</P>
    <P>... an element of flexibility in the new scheme to enable it to meet a wide variety of individual needs and circumstances and to enable appropriate additional payments to be made over and above the basic weekly rates of allowance.</P>
    <P>He instanced cases such as a rise in rent payments, heating or diet requirements <Col N="1458" /> in the case of a person living alone or dependent on an allowance over a prolonged period.  Those of us who have experience of assistance to date know that, in the first instance, the assistance has very often been fixed for only a month, a further application being required for possibly extending it for three or six months depending on the circumstances of the case.  All that necessary elasticity is provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews referred to the question of burial in a pauper's grave. I do not think he should have said what he did say.  Maybe I took him up wrongly, but, as I understood it, he criticised the Bill.  I think any person who has lived his life is entitled to know that he is not going to be dependent on charity and that he will have the right to have his mortal remains put at rest with proper and due accord.  That is provided for in this Bill.  Previously it depended upon the charity of the local authority.</P>
    <P>I have referred also to the question of finance.  Finance will now be gauged on what the various local authorities will subscribe to assistance in 1975.  I have said that great ease has been experienced and will be experienced by the local authorities in view of the further extension of unemployment assistance and relief that has been provided for in the recent Act.  Despite the fact that national standards are incorporated in the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary has been careful to emphasise the requirement of local thinking and local administration because circumstances can differ from area to area and assistance may be required in an emergency due to some tragedy or difficulty in an area. This can be provided for under the Bill, in view of the very wide discretion allowed to health boards.  It is good to see an overseer's right on the part of the Department to control and see to the administration of schemes under the Bill.  It is only right that this should be so as part of the finance will come from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>One could speak about individual cases and individual circumstances but <Col N="1459" /> the message should go out clearly from this House that this is a Bill of conscience.  Our conscience, possibly, has been somewhat tardy over the years.  This Bill gives us the opportunity of making amends as all parties, I would hope, will give every assistance in getting the Bill through the House and making it as good as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, of course.  Anybody who has any moral conscience must welcome the Bill as another step forward in the care of the under-privileged.  Many Deputies have referred to the stigma attaching to home assistance at one time.  As Deputy Tunney said, &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; means different things to different people.  Years ago when a poor person would get a scholarship, some snob would come along later and say that the State had educated him.  The State gives every form of assistance.  State assistance has been given to industry and to farmers, by way of agricultural subsidies.  The only case where there was a suggestion of a stigma was when a person received what was known as home assistance. I see in the Bill a change of name and a slight improvement in the allowances. Personally, I would never allow any reflection to be made because a person was in receipt of home assistance. Everyone gets some form of State assistance either directly or indirectly. The name will be &ldquo;supplemental social welfare&rdquo; henceforward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I am very interested to know the type of people it will cover.  I understand that it is intended to supplement income which is not up to the standard required for a person to live on.  Take, for instance, a person in receipt of small farm social welfare.  When such a person was available for work and able to work he was entitled to £12.10 a week.  I know of a case where the person got a heart attack and, subsequently, when he went to sign for the small farm social welfare he would not be allowed to do so because he was not available for work.  He had to go on disability allowance.  The net result <Col N="1460" /> was that his income dropped to £8.60. Does the supplemental social welfare cover such a case?</P>

      <P>I am delighted.  For that I am very grateful because there was an injustice.</P>
      <P>There is another type of assistance that was operated by the Western Health Board&mdash;prescribed relative allowance.  I have been informed that this allowance will be discontinued, that if persons do not qualify for the supplemental social welfare they cannot get the prescribed relative allowance. I want to be clear on that.  The prescribed relative allowance was given in certain circumstances.  I criticised the scheme on the ground that the person concerned had to be a relative.  If a neighbour made a cup of tea for a person the health board would pay her something.  A daughter-in-law who had six in family and looking after an aged parent got nothing if the person was not bedridden.  I pointed out that sometimes it is more difficult to look after a person who is not bedridden.  I understand that the prescribed relative allowance is being discontinued.  Will there be a means test in regard to the supplemental social welfare?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

      <P>There are two prescribed relative allowances.  There was one that was added to the old age pension&mdash;a care-of-the-aged allowance. There was another one operated by the health board which was not a care-of-the-aged allowance.  This is the one to which I am referring.  The care-of-the-aged allowance has not been dropped; it was the one operated by the health board.  These are the things I wanted to clarify.  I am delighted that the person who was at a disadvantage by getting only disability benefit will now be able to supplement his income from supplementary social welfare benefit.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bermingham spoke of the position when people fail to get their cheques and go to the social welfare officer, as he will now be known. Deputy Bermingham was right; this official does not know what to do about them.  This may happen on a Saturday and it is unfair to him to be called on when he is off.  He does not know what amount to give.  There should be some system in the Department whereby some three or four weeks before a person's stamps are exhausted he would be notified to apply to his social welfare officer immediately so that he could switch over from unemployment benefit to social welfare on the very day on which his stamps were exhausted and so that there would be no break in payments and he would not, perhaps, have to wait a whole week.  I must be a nuisance to the Parliamentary Secretary because of the number of letters I have had to write in such cases, some of them urgent cases with sheer poverty involved.  This should not happen.  The social welfare payment should come immediately the stamp payments finish.  Deputy Bermingham covered this point so well that I would only be repeating what he said if I were to pursue the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be fair to those who operated the home assistance scheme. They did a good job and were very sympathetic although there may have been the odd exception.  The provision <Col N="1462" /> for an appeal to the health board in the case where a person is dissatisfied, as provided for in the Bill, is an excellent idea.  It is important to consider human nature.  A person may think that he does not get on with the local officer or that he has a cause for grievance against him.  These are facts although we may try to hide them here.  They exist, as we all know.  Such a person will now know that if the local officer does not give him fair treatment or what he considers is fair treatment, he can appeal and everybody cannot be against him.  That man cannot blame the local official and say: &ldquo;He never liked our family.&rdquo; That is a great advance in the Bill.  I am not saying anything against assistance officers.  I have been dealing with them since I became a public representative and they are a fine type of people who do their work well.</P>
    <P>Taking the Bill as a whole I think all sides of the House will welcome it as a move forward by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Since social welfare was initiated we have been moving gradually forward as we should be.  We must keep up with inflation.  I am delighted that this Bill has been introduced. My ambition has been to see the under-privileged getting a fair deal, and any legislation that will help to secure that aim will have my support and that of the majority of those on this side of the House.  I welcome the right to appeal and the supplementary assistance to people who are ill and cannot work who were at a disadvantage previously when they lost social welfare and went on to DPA. Also, under the Bill the status of the former home assistance officer will be raised.  Will his title be changed?</P>

      <P>That is what I thought.  This is another advance in the Bill.  In general, everybody in the House will welcome the Bill.  We are all human beings and nobody stands up to make political capital out of the legislation; at least, I shall never do that.  Where credit is due I shall always give it and I think this Bill is something we should all support. <Col N="1463" /> Having read the Bill I thought it was just the type of legislation that any progressive Government would introduce. If we were in Government I am positive we would be moving in the same direction.  Successive Governments have moved with the times and this is a further move which is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on this Bill which is an excellent piece of legislation. At a time like this when we are being asked to tighten our belts it is a good thing that the Parliamentary Secretary saw fit not to ask the more vulnerable section of the community to make any more sacrifices.  They could teach us about belt-tightening. All of us working in our constituencies come in contact with these people and it is heart-rending at times to find that for one reason or another we cannot help them as we would like.  Sometimes what we can do is very little and certainly not nearly enough.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a step in the right direction, regardless of any economic problems or recessions, because this is the area in which a government with a social conscience must keep step with inflationary trends and look after the people in most need.  To look at this in a cold, economic manner, it is good business to look after those people in this fashion.  In the case of home assistance, prescribed relatives' allowances or whatever it may be, the money provided in this Bill will help people to help themselves in their own homes and it will help keep many out of institutions where they would be a much greater burden on the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Callanan on his reference to stigmas.  We are all getting State help of one kind or another, whether we are industrialists or farmers, so none of us can point the finger at those who are getting social assistance.  I particularly liked the point made by the Parliamentary Secretary about the effort to break the poverty link.  That is what we have to aim at in all social legislation.  If this money is to be paid out in the <Col N="1464" /> requisite amounts and if widows with young families get sufficient help at the right times&mdash;for instance, to put their children through school&mdash;then we will be going along a new road. We will be creating a new situation, like the Chinese proverb which stated that you can give a man a fish and he will live for a day, but teach him to fish and he will live for a long time.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an effort to break the poverty link, and that should be our continuous ambition.  I am not one who favours doling out money unnecessarily to anyone.  We hear a lot about abuses but they will always be there.  Where these benefits are being applied, however, the social welfare officer should not be tied to specific amounts or be over-hampered by regulations.  It has been one of the faults in our social welfare legislation that genuine, deserving cases have been found not to be entitled to benefits.  For instance, under the present regulations dealing with prescribed relatives' allowance, a 31st cousin looking after an old person is not entitled to benefit.  Anybody who looks after an old person in his home should get this allowance.  If necessary we should call it by another name. Otherwise we will have a situation where such old people will have to be put into institutions.  It is from that point of view that legislation of this kind becomes logical.</P>
    <P>I should like to see social welfare officers not being tied to firm decisions. The Parliamentary Secretary said that a young mother pointed out that one would think the social welfare officer was paying the money out of his own pocket.  I am afraid that is a widespread comment, and I hope the new appeals system will eliminate a lot of the difficulties.  It is hardly fair to ask any one man to sort out the legislation in regard to gray areas that exist, particularly in regard to social welfare.  Perhaps local bodies like the old age pension committees would be a better idea.</P>
    <P>I like this elasticity.  In my travelling around I often find people being disqualified from benefit because they are a fraction above the regulated <Col N="1465" /> amount.  This Bill should bring within its ambit many more people for supplementary social welfare payments. Some people spoke about changing the name &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo;. I do not think there is any need to do that.  Indeed I like the expression because the emphasis is on &ldquo;home&rdquo;, and that is the important thing about this Bill: it helps people to look after their kinfolk and their families at home in a reasonable manner.  I suppose it is as good as we can afford, and I am sure the fine social conscience of the Parliamentary Secretary will ensure that the poorer people will be looked after, the people whose voices rarely have been heard in an organised manner, people who have only me and those like me in the House to speak for them.  In my short time in politics, living in a rural area I was not properly aware of the type of poverty and deprivation that has existed in our larger towns side by side with wealth, very often vulgar wealth.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should mention that if it were left entirely to what the State could do I am convinced that help for the needy would be totally inadequate, and in this respect I compliment the various voluntary organisations such as St. Vincent de Paul, the good nuns and the groups who try to help out old people.  At times we have heard them described as &ldquo;do-gooders&rdquo;. Were it not for these people there would be many old people in want in my area.</P>
    <P>We are a great nation for surveys, but we would do well to have carried out a survey on the problems of the aged.  While this Bill is going a long way, it is not getting to the root of the problem.  As a nation becomes more affluent, its people become very materialistic and do not often have enough regard for the problems of the aged.  It may be that in the past old people were looked after better in their own homes than is the case today.  Many old people would ask for nothing more than a little flat in which to spend the remainder of their days.  I am glad that there is increasing development of this kind. It is something that should be encouraged as much as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> Other Deputies have spoken of the reluctance on the part of some people to seek help.  Because of a sort of pride some old people would starve to death before letting anyone know of their plight.  There is not much we can do about that except to make every effort to find out about such people and, having found them, to approach them gently with offers of help.</P>
    <P>Very often old people live in houses that are inadequate.  Sometimes these houses have no electricity, and in cases where this facility is available, one finds often that the appliances are out of order.  Sometimes it is the ESB official who calls to read the meter who becomes aware first of a person's plight.  This whole area is a very difficult one.  It is one that will require all the expertise and help that can be applied if we are to help the people concerned.  Every help, financial and otherwise, should be given to those people who are engaged voluntarily in work in this field.  One million pounds would go a long way in this regard.  Wonderful services are being provided at the geriatric hospitals, many of which are run by nuns and some which are under the control of the health authorities.  The religious orders concerned have been carrying on work for many years which is the responsibility of the State.  They should be given more financial aid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde said it is not good enough to say that the poor will always be with us.  I agree totally with him, because to accept that premise would be a negative attitude. The elimination of poverty must be a priority.  It is a project which requires a massive injection of money but which requires such virtues, also, as concern for our aged.  In this context, education is very important. Young people should be taught to be concerned for our senior citizens and should be encouraged to do everything possible to help them.  We know that the Minister is doing everything possible to help this section, but in order to be successful he will need to have the interest of the younger generation. Very often it is the kind word that helps an old person most when he <Col N="1467" /> is depressed.  I compliment the Minister and his team on producing this Bill.  It is a further indication of the social conscience of this Government.</P>
    <P>One small criticism of the system up to now is that it was hampered to some extent by petty regulations.  Every situation should be assessed on its merits. One cannot work a cut-and-dried system.  A person in need is a person in need. It is as simple as that and anybody in need should receive help from the State. Perhaps that is an over-simplification but that is my interpretation of it.</P>
    <P>I would be in favour of giving plenty of latitude to what we might call the field men, the social welfare officers.  I would not advocate coming down hard on them if they erred on the lenient side.  Perhaps in the past their terms of reference stipulated that they should not be lenient.  In future, whatever their terms of reference, they should be told to be lenient because I could recite a litany of individuals who were deprived of social welfare benefit because they were merely 25p or some such amount above the qualifying limit. I know we must draw the line somewhere but there are varying circumstances.</P>
    <P>If this legislation does not measure up financially to its ambition, the Minister should not hesitate to come back to the House.  He might come back every two months, if necessary, to help this section of the community to whom I am sure both sides of the House would be very happy to render assistance.  In terms of total spending it is really pin-money only about which we are speaking today.  If we could make a good job of it with an extra £1 million or £2 million, that amount should and must be found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all look back with a sense of shame at the manner in which we neglected the weaker sections of the community over the years.  This Bill does not go far enough. Indeed, the changing of terms in a Bill of this nature is no real solution to the problem.  A more comprehensive measure is required to deal with the problem and with those who served the <Col N="1468" /> nation so well during the dark, difficult days.  I believe we should have made a more positive approach to the problem than is done in this Bill, worthy though it may be.  In the past we did not do sufficient and, if we continue on the basis suggested in the Bill, we will not be doing sufficient either.  Terms used in the past were objectionable to people and tended to turn them away from seeking that to which they were entitled.  This is something that must be corrected now.  Updating of legislation is something that must be done continuously.  In order to do so we must carry out in-depth examinations and in any conclusions we may reach show that we have a positive approach. I do not feel this Bill measures up to what I believe to be necessary.</P>
      <P>Taking various statements that have been made, we must deal first of all with the dignity of the human person, have a person feel that he or she has a stake in the community, that there are services available to them in their hour of need, freely administered and theirs by right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The uniformity of any scheme is desirable also.  The Parliamentary Secretary has made an effort under this Bill to ensure that there will be uniformity of approach to the benefits to be given in the future.  That is a substantial advance on the past and means that those in need in the future can rest assured they will receive that to which they are entitled, with no scaling down of the benefits by officials.  The terms used in the past, the poor house and others, have caused people to hesitate in their applications and their elimination is both necessary and desirable.  It is necessary to update legislation in order to eliminate such objectionable terms or ones which tend to become objectionable in the modern usage of language. Let us examine some of the terms used in the past in relation to illnesses.  When a person was told he had, for example, consumption he felt he was on the way to the grave. In time that has changed to a person being on the &ldquo;decline&rdquo; but, after a time, he figured out that it meant the same thing.  Then he may have been told he had tuberculosis.  Now he may <Col N="1469" /> be told he has a spot on the lung but it does not mean the same as did the terrifying terms of the past.  Those terms mean the same thing.  Some of them put terror into the hearts of some people when used in a certain context.  The elimination of such terms will encourage people to make application where they feel they are entitled to benefit without having the tag applied in the past.</P>
    <P>We know how people were treated in the past when they applied for help under the home assistance code.  In many cases a probe was conducted into their lives or that of members of their families.  People were refused benefit because, perhaps, their house was clean or because they may have had a television set or some other type of household appliance which was deemed to be something they could have done without because of their poor circumstances.  But an individual's circumstances change rapidly from time to time.  Therefore it is necessary to take into consideration items which are now part and parcel of every household, items that may be given by a kind son or daughter or, indeed, some organisation.  Indeed, I have known of cases in the past where such items were taken into consideration in the assessment of a case.  I hope the new system will eliminate that type of probe and that such things will not constitute an impediment to the obtaining of assistance.  It has been said to me and to other public representatives frequently that if one has a dirty house one will certainly receive some assistance.  Each case should be examined on its merits.  The terms used in the past tended to colour the situation.  I am glad to note the termination of that type of approach, which, indeed, prompted some official examining cases and dealing with them in a way never intended.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the inequalities that exist. I hope they will be eliminated in the future.  We must all ensure that there is uniformity.  However, we must indicate in very clear terms that a number of people have responsibilities in relation to the weaker sections of the community and those in need of <Col N="1470" /> different forms of assistance.  There are many children who have pushed their parents aside and thrown them on to local authorities and the State for support.  Many of them are in a position to assist their parents who in the past did everything for them. It is great shame on those people who neglect their parents.</P>
    <P>Far too many parents rely on State assistance because they have been pushed aside by their children.  Those of us who have served on hospital boards know of many such cases.  I know of a case in this city where an old lady was dispossessed and her daughter, who was well married and lives in a very fashionable part of the city, would not allow her mother to go into accommodation offered to her by Dublin Corporation.  She took her into her own home but only maintained her for a few days and then pushed her into hospital.  When the time came for the discharge of that elderly person, who was suffering from fatigue and mental strain resulting from her being dispossessed, and the hospital contacted her daughter she did not respond.  After a number of further contacts from the hospital asking the daughter to take her mother home, and her mother was finally presented at her door, she said: &ldquo;That is not my mother&rdquo;.  This is the unfortunate case of a woman who was taken away screaming: &ldquo;Take me home, Mary&rdquo; but her daughter denied her.  Far too many parents have been denied by their families in this city and throughout the country.  There is a responsibility on each and every one of us to meet our full responsibilities in relation to our families.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have services provided to meet the tragic case I have just referred to.  It is also necessary to update the legislation to meet the crying needs we have from children neglecting their parents.  We should do everything in our power to rouse the consciences of those who have responsibility for their parents.</P>
    <P>The supplementary supports the Parliamentary Secretary spoke about and the changing attitudes are very laudable.  There was also mention in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief of <Col N="1471" /> the right of appeal.  I appeal to those who have to make decisions on important cases to err on the side of the applicant rather than push it aside and say the person has power to appeal. The time factor is very important in those cases because a decision must be made at the earliest possible moment in order to ensure that the applicant will not suffer from undue fatigue or undue want.  I hope the officers who will be examining those cases in the future will ensure that decisions are made as early as possible and if there is a doubt in the officer's mind the person who makes the application will have the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    <P>The updating of this legislation is very necessary and desirable.  I feel it should have been more comprehensive to meet the real needs of the situation.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to those today as well as on other occasions when he spoke of the number of people living below the poverty line.  I hope when we have a full assessment of the situation that this Bill will only be regarded as a stepping stone, one which normalises the situation at the moment and that we will have in the future additional legislation which will bring the problem into full focus so that we can have something which will give entire satisfaction to every Deputy in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in welcoming this Bill as one of the most progressive and enlightened pieces of legislation to appear before the House.  One of the reasons I campaigned for a new Government was that I hoped we would bring in enlightened and progressive legislation such as this.  It, therefore, gives me great pleasure to welcome the Bill.  I hope it will be extended and will be followed by more progressive legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies have dealt with the terms of the home assistance regulations. I, like them, can say I have nothing but contempt for the system because it was left to the discretion of an officer who, if he did not like <Col N="1472" /> the look on the person's face, had the power to refuse home assistance to him.  I have seen some very genuine cases of poverty deprived of home assistance by home assistance officers. I have also seen people humiliated in seeking home assistance who were turned away crying because the man said they might be getting assistance somewhere else.</P>
    <P>Many people were inhibited from seeking home assistance because they found it a humiliating experience when their personal affairs were discussed in public.  I know of many people in need of assistance who would not apply for it.  They said they could not stand the humiliation of it and also that their neighbours might see them.  These cases were sufficient to warrant changes to bring about a proper form of assistance to people in need.  Despite what we hear about Ireland being a rich man's club and there being affluence in abundance I see a considerable amount of poverty. I have had conversations with lots of people who are afflicted with poverty and they disagree with the method whereby they clothe their children by calling to the health board office.  It is humiliating for them.  These people are told that they cannot have the money to buy these clothes.</P>
    <P>Many families are in need of help, in need of clothing for their children going for First Communion but they are humiliated into seeking clothes from these depots.  In many cases the clothes are not suited to the needs of the children.  It all smacked of the poor law Act, an Act which was in need of reform.  This Bill will be welcomed by those in need, by those who were inhibited from seeking home assistance who will now know that as a right they are entitled to this assistance. It will give some solace to those who are poverty stricken and who find they cannot get out of their state of despair and despondency.  It will ensure that they can get this assistance as of right and will not have to beg for it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the limitations of home assistance officers and the fact that they have to operate the old system. However, what apparently is not <Col N="1473" /> known is the fact that the number of hours they worked is far short of the requisite 40 hours.  One assistance officer told me that they work less than a 20-hour week in many cases.  In other instances they provide money from their own resources.  They use some of their salary to pay people and hope they can recoup it from the authority.  The system was wrong and it could not operate properly.  It amazed me that the Fianna Fáil Party who were in Government for 16 years did not see this and did not listen or harken to the request from Members for a change.  I am pleased to know that the Government for which I campaigned have taken upon themselves to bring in this enlightened piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to give an example of how badly the home assistance scheme worked.  Recently a widow with a number of children was faced with a problem when one of her children died suddenly in a home.  Unfortunately, most of these people are ignorant of the benefits they are entitled to.  After a lot of representations on behalf of this widow the authorities concerned agreed to pay the cost of the funeral but the widow had to go on the bus to the graveyard to meet the hearse.  That is an example of how this system operated.  The official told me that was the only way he could operate the system.  That is an indication of how damnable a system it was. I am sure other Members can recount instances where people were humiliated or found they could do nothing to break through that terrible system.</P>
    <P>Under the old system a young bachelor who was unemployed and did not have stamps was subjected to a means test.  That young man, if he was living with his father who was employed, could find himself in receipt of 15p a week.  This happended in many cases in the city.  I am worried that there will be a means test under this Bill.  I hope it will not apply.  We are told that the basic standard amount of supplementary welfare allowance which will be payable to a person without means will be equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment assistance applicable in rural areas.  I <Col N="1474" /> have a little doubt in this regard but the more I read this statement the more I believe this will not apply and that the person concerned will be entitled to a full allowance.  Under the present system he could get as low as 15p to 30p a week.</P>
    <P>We tried to get round this by suggesting that the person concerned go to a hostel but the cost of a hostel is such that if he got full unemployment assistance he could not pay his way there.  This Bill will put an end to that system.  It will be welcomed by those in need, those who are not able to articulate their needs or their wants.  There is no problem for those who can lobby us on different legislation but we should be legislating for those who do not know their rights and who cannot put forward their case forcefully.  For that reason I am surprised at the Opposition Member who described the Bill as not being progressive.  It is progressive and it is one step in the line of progressive social legislation.  The only extension of this I should like to see would be income supplements; that we might establish a poverty line and where a man's income falls below that it would be supplemented.  We should aim at this and I hope it will follow. Knowing the Parliamentary Secretary, I am confident the time will not be far distant when he will introduce this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill may be regarded as a necessary addition to the social welfare code.  As Minister for Social Welfare, I had to deal with criticism from the Opposition which was centred around suggestions that we should have a new comprehensive social welfare code.  I always countered by saying there was no such necessity, we had all the basics and it was only a matter of making up the gaps that were not filled.  We had all the necessary things which a social welfare service requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No debate in this House was so full of hypocritical criticism as was the debate on social welfare.  I hope I do not appear hypocritical in anything I say in relation to this Bill because up to now debates on social <Col N="1475" /> welfare smacked of somebody using the circumstances of the poorer sections of our community to exhibit a social conscience.  All the talk about poverty and the poverty line&mdash;I am not referring to the last speaker&mdash; often has a lot of nonsense attached to it.  Poverty is a relative thing.  As time goes on people who might be regarded as in reasonably good circumstances today will be below the poverty line in ten or 20 years' time, that is, if there is the same rate of change in living standards as there has been in the last 20 years.  As I say, poverty is a relative thing relating to what one section of the community can enjoy to what the other sections have.  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill says in regard to persons eligible:</P>
    <P>As a general rule any person in the State whose means are not sufficient to meet his needs and those of his dependants will be eligible for a supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>That is only in the memorandum.  If it was incorporated in the Bill we would all be eligible.  I think we could all prove at any given time that our resources are not sufficient to meet our needs.</P>
    <P>The change that has taken place now is necessitated, in the first instance, by the regional health boards being established.  We have been working in a kind of dual capacity for some time in regard to home assistance, in that the different authorities were administering it and the health authorities were, in fact, the people responsible.  While this is a change, it does not go as far as I thought it might have gone.  I had been struggling for some time in the Department to find a means whereby something substantial or worthwhile might be done in relation to the whole field of unemployment assistance, home assistance and unemployment benefits.  We did reach the stage in the Department where a memorandum was prepared for consideration by the Government, but I have to admit it did not contain the type of thing I visualised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> The question which everybody is asking himself today in relation to social welfare is, how does it come about that when you go into any district in any part of Ireland you will find thousands and thousands of necessary public amenities awaiting sanction and jobs for which there is no money available to carry them out, while at the same time thousands of people are queuing up to draw unemployment assistance.  The Minister for Social Welfare who reconciles these two problems will be the man who will really provide the solutions for the most important aspects of the whole social welfare system.  The present situation does not make sense when the economy is on its knees to the extent that emergency action has to be taken.</P>
    <P>We talk about removing the stigma of the system.  Any system that requires poor people to subject themselves to a means test and become the victims of cross-questioning by an official will in time take on a stigma irrespective of how we many change its name.  Changing it does help for a time.  With a new name it may look a little better, but it is the same wine in different bottles.  We can only hope that, side by side with the necessary provision in the welfare code for the implementation of improvements from time to time, the best economic brains in the country will get down to the provision of the proper type of welfare, that, is the provision of opportunities for work for all the people that can avail of it and the reduction in the number of those who have to go hat in hand looking for State assistance. This is the real effort that should be made by any Government or any authority, local or otherwise, in order to eliminate the need for assistance of any type, call it what you will.</P>
    <P>If the galloping inflation we have been experiencing for so long now is not kept in check we shall rapidly reach the stage where the number of people in the Department of Social Welfare will have to be trebled in order to provide assistance for the thousands who are progressively dropping below what might be regarded <Col N="1477" /> as the poverty line.  The real way to tackle this is to create as many opportunities as possible and enlarge the source from which the redistribution of wealth will spring.  In Government we are inclined to talk about money that has to be paid out as if we were paying it out of our own pockets.  It is money taken from the Irish people to give to the less fortunate sections of the community, and we must do our utmost to create greater social consciousness, so that the contribution is not made grudgingly. As was pointed out as far back as the time of <i>Rerum Novarum,</i> people must realise it is part of their responsibility to society to give some of their wealth to the needy.</P>
    <P>This Bill takes steps towards improving the home assistance code which is an essential part of the social welfare services.  I was not in the House to hear whether the payment will be made directly through the post or whether the old queue will still form outside the home assistance officer's clinic or what form payment will take.  I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary has arranged this, but until he can abolish this queue he will not have removed any stigma that might have been carried into the welfare system by the Home Assistance Act of 1847 and the amending Act of 1839.</P>
    <P>In regard to the cost, if, as the last speaker suggested, there is a poverty line drawn, it will have to be drawn much higher than anything we have visualised in the past, because again poverty is a relative thing, and this Bill must ensure very big increases in home assistance payments, 40 per cent of which will have to be met out of local rates.</P>
    <P>We had much discussion about the inequity of the rating system and before we proceed to load the rates with more payments and add to the responsibility of the local ratepayer we should first give a good deal of attention to the system of collecting rates, the most inequitable tax we have and get it on an equitable basis. Strictly speaking, under the terms and in the spirit of the Constitution I do not think we have the right to add to <Col N="1478" /> the rates burden with new charges. That 40 per cent of the cost of this scheme over the 1975 allocation could be quite a substantial sum.  That is not a great prospect for those saddled with ever-increasing rates bills.  However good the intentions of the Minister for Social Welfare and the Parliamentary Secretary may be in changing to this supplementary system, it is not in keeping with the 14-point programme&mdash;if we are to consider that document as a basis of Government policy any longer.  It is certainly not in keeping with that part of the programme which pointed to the reduction that would take place in local rates and the removal of charges from them.  This definitely adds a further charge to them.</P>
    <P>The main benefit of the home assistance system was the fire-brigade effect, as we knew it, whereby you could quickly send somebody to bring immediate relief to a distressed family or person.  That element is retained in this legislation which would not otherwise have the desired effect.  Any system of applying, waiting weeks or months to know if you are qualified and in the end receiving some money or a notice that you are not qualified, would not have the effect of home assistance however much maligned it may have been and whatever stigma was associated with it.  Nothing could replace it if the community element and the immediate approach were removed.  When a misfortune such as a road accident befalls a family rendering them penniless or destitute overnight only something like the home assistance system can bring immediate relief.  Irrespective of the future outlook it enabled payment to be made on the spot or as soon as possible and a chance to be taken on recoupment if this proved possible on further examination.  That element is retained in the legislation now before the House.  That is nothing new; it is one of the outstanding and most effective features of the home assistance code in the past.  I hope this element will be retained because otherwise the legislation will be less beneficial.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent one <Col N="1479" /> can remove discretionary power from any social welfare system which requires a means test: I do not think it is possible.  Human nature being as it is, investigation officers experience so many devices and ruses that they become sceptical.  They come to the people concerned giving the impression that they come to prevent them getting something rather than to find out for what assistance they would qualify and help them to a decision. I had occasion frequently to look at files and discuss with those responsible for investigation the interesting experiences they had.  We have heard of the woman who set the dog on her own cattle pretending it was the neighbours' cattle that were trespassing when the investigation officer arrived.  Incidents like that gave investigation officers a rather poor impression and often resulted in their carrying out their work rather severely.</P>
    <P>Nobody can deny that a good deal of discretion is involved.  One investigation officer may find an applicant entitled to benefit while another may take a completely different view. Uniformity is not always possible in this respect because it is not possible to set absolutely effective guidelines and conditions vary from county to county.  I am not sure that any recent adjustment has taken account of conditions generally in regard to applicants for home assistance.  A particular figure of income is mentioned in regard to means in the case of certain benefits.  So far as farmers, particularly small farmers, are concerned, the number of cattle that would produce that income 20 years ago is quite different from what it is today.</P>
    <P>Notice is not taken of the cost of what the applicant has to purchase while notice is taken of the actual income from the number of cattle sold. In simpler terms, the means test for the old age pension has been considerably eased but just as many people in rural Ireland today fail to get the old age pension as in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  As a matter of fact, I think the Deputy is <Col N="1480" /> making one of the most dishonest speeches I have ever heard in this House from an ex-Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for saying that a number of people fail to secure benefits is because of my empirical experience.  There is no use in those of us who are in constant contact with the public denying that we meet a number of cases in which we have to make appeals or applications or contact the Department.  It is mainly due to the belief that practically everybody now qualifies for one or other benefit. That is not true and if the Parliamentary Secretary thinks I am making a dishonest statement I can give him sufficient instances from my experiences to prove that I am not.</P>
      <P>The benefits paid to social welfare applicants have been improved but the cost of the necessities of life has increased and we have got to keep it ahead of the posse.  That is what we are doing here, to some extent, in a supplementary way.  Provision is made in the Bill to compel people first of all to apply for any other benefits to which they may be entitled before falling back on the supplemental payments. We will be giving this closer examination on Committee Stage but it appears to me that if the home assistance officer finds that a person is entitled to unemployment assistance, disability allowance or anything else, he will compel that person to apply to receive such benefits first.  Anything provided in the Bill will be supplemental to such social welfare benefits and if that is not sufficient to meet a person's circumstances at the time, payments may be made pending receipt of other benefits and then recoupment can be effected afterwards.  That was always the position and, therefore, it is not a change in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main change in the Bill, apart from giving a new name to home assistance, is that it makes it possible for home assistance officers to bring to court a person responsible for the maintenance of an old person if he has shirked his responsibility in that respect or misused the payments made to him in respect of a dependant or dependants. That provision could be revolutionary if it is used in the way <Col N="1481" /> we hope it will be.  It could be very far reaching if administered in the spirit as well as the letter because it will bring to heel those people who shirk their responsibilities in relation to the aged.</P>
    <P>Most of the Bill can be discussed more effectively in Committee.  One fault I have to find with it is that it does not lay down how payments will be made.  I was not in the House for the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement and I have not had time to study it properly.  Therefore, I hope he will clarify that in his reply.  I am referring to the queues drawing their weekly allowances outside home assistance offices.  I trust that in future their allowances will be paid in the same way as other social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Another criticism I have is that 40 per cent of the expenditure over and above that of 1975 will fall on local rates.  This is happening at a time when we should be seeking to take as much as possible off local charges.  It is true that no matter how charges are made it is the taxpayer who will pay in the long run, but the taxpayers have a broader back than local ratepayers. There is also the haphazard valuation system.  One house built last year could be valued at £25, whereas the house beside it of better quality but built 30 years ago could enjoy a valuation of £1.  The rating system is, therefore, a most inequitable one and is not the system by which payments of this sort, which should be nationalised, should be financed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Local Government to increase substantially financial investment in the building industry, with special provision for the private housebuilding sector, in view of the serious decline in the numbers employed in the industry over the past 12 months and the urgent need to create jobs to cope with the high level of general unemployment in the country.</P>
      <P>The building and construction industry is facing a crisis.  It is self-evident. All the indications show a downward trend and inquiries from building contractors reveal a fall in demand and a consequent drop in employment.  This, of course, is nothing new.  We have been urging the Minister for the past year to do something about the situation in the building industry but our urgings have been to no avail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Local Government estimate a drop in real output in the industry of 5 per cent for 1975. This figure has been challenged by the industry and with good reason. The figure they give, after careful consideration, is 12 per cent.  This figure is very close to my own estimate which I worked out on the figures available to me.  This being so there is no need for me to stress the seriousness of the situation.  The Minister has, on many occasions, boasted that the Coalition made more money available for housing than was made available by Fianna Fáil but in real terms and at constant prices the actual amount <Col N="1483" /> of money has now declined below that which was provided by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The building cost index for the construction industry published by the CSO for 1973 was 270.3 and for 1974, 357.3 which is an increase of 32 per cent.  This shows that the inflation in the construction industry is much higher than the inflation rate in any other sector.  The building and construction industry is our second largest industry with a total output of more than £500 million this year and a labour force of 80,000.  There are also about 20,000 jobs in auxiliary industries depending on it, such as the industries which manufacture building materials.  These are directly responsible to the health of the construction industry.  Therefore, anything adversely affecting the construction industry has serious repercussions throughout the whole economy, not only in relation to those who are employed in the industry itself, or to those who are employed in auxiliary industries, but because a fall-off in employment in these industries results in less purchasing power, it directly and indirectly affects other industries and trade and commerce generally. For that reason it is vitally important that the decline in the industry should be corrected immediately.</P>
    <P>Further to this, in situations where we have a massive unemployment problem, with more than 102,000 people unemployed in a tiny population of 3,000,000, we must fully utilise the industry to produce jobs quickly and to absorb not only those who are at present unemployed in the industry itself but also many more unemployed people who have little hope of other employment in the foreseeable future. We have no lead industries apart from the building and the construction industry, no other industry which could so quickly or so effectively expand. Therefore, at a time of severe unemployment, a massive injection of money is needed.  All those engaged in the industry, workers and management alike, are convinced that a worthwhile financial investment by the State in the industry would have farreaching effects on the economy and <Col N="1484" /> would provide the much-needed boost which is so sadly lacking today.  The framework is there, readymade.  The builders are there, the workers are there, the plans are there and the machinery is there.  It only needs this extra financial investment by the Government to achieve the much-needed objective of getting our people back to work.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to become involved in the numbers game when discussing the activities of the Department of Local Government, particularly in the field of housing.  The constant repetition of housing statistics by the powerful media available to the Minister had almost achieved its aim of so engrossing the attention of the public in these figures that they were in danger of losing touch with the reality and gravity of the situation.  What is of real and vital importance to the public, is whether the industry is in a healthy condition, whether it is expanding or contracting, and whether it is employing more or fewer workers. The basic concern must be whether the industry is contributing to the extent to which it is capable, to the development of the economy, to the provision of employment, to ensuring that those without homes will be provided with homes.  The answer must be that far from contributing to the full its contribution is lessening, and this, as I said earlier, is a very serious matter in the present circumstances in which we find ourselves. Money is needed at once, I ask the Minister, when speaking in this debate, not to waste the time of the House with his oft repeated figures showing that the Coalition, since taking office, spent more money on the building and construction industry than Fianna Fáil spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when we have the dubious banner of being at the top of the EEC inflation league, with prices rising more rapidly here than even in Britain, with the inflationary rate in the building industry at 32 per cent, this type of argument has no relevance.  It would be an <Col N="1485" /> insult to the intelligence of the people. We are entitled to a constructive reply.  The continued repetition of this type of case will indicate to me, and I am sure will also indicate to the public generally, that the Minister simply wants to cloud the issue so that he can put on the long finger the very necessary action which must be taken by him and indeed which should have been taken by him long ago.</P>
      <P>The two main planks in the Minister's case have been that he built more houses annually and he spent more money on the building and construction industry than was the case under Fianna Fáil.  He seems to conclude from this that he has done his share.  Be that as it may, the fact is that during Fianna Fáil's term of office the building industry was in a healthy condition.  There was steady progress with increasing employment whereas today there is a decline with all the signs that the decline is accelerating. In normal times this would be a serious situation but in the highly inflationary abnormal times in which we are living it can be a disaster.</P>
      <P>I now point to the factors which are causing anxiety because they show clearly a downturn in production which is having a detrimental effect on employment both in the industry and in auxiliary industries.  Cement sales have always been regarded as one of the best indicators of the output of the construction industry. There is a particular reason why cement should be a good indicator because, unlike most materials, it cannot be stored indefinitely on a building site.  The builder, therefore, orders cement only as he needs it and his current orders for cement reflect his current intention in regard to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to distinguish the sales of cement for house building as distinct from other sectors of the industry but for the purpose of the case I am making the total sales on the home market are what matters.  The sale of cement in 1973 was about 1.6 million tons which was an increase of 13 per cent compared with 1972. We left office in 1973, but it is only fair to say that even the most biased supporter <Col N="1486" /> of the Coalition would have to concede that this increase must be attributed to the building work in hands at that time and to the preparatory work being done on other schemes of houses and construction work generally in our last year of office.  It is interesting to note that in 1974 the sale of cement on the home market fell to 1.56 million tons, a drop of 3 per cent and that since the second quarter of 1974 there has been a continuous decline in the amount of cement sold.  In February, 1975 as compared with February, 1974 there was a decline of 12 per cent in the sale of cement on the home market and in March, 1975, the latest month for which I have figures available, there was a decline in the sale of cement, compared with the figure for March, 1974 of 36 per cent.  Certainly that gives food for thought.  When we come to judge the health of the building and construction industry, these are the really significant figures.  The fall in sales of cement, which was very significant in February and March, 1975, underline the employment situation.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with this aspect of the matter.  Since August, 1974 there has been a continuous drop in the number of persons employed in the private sector of the industry.  It is worth nothing that this sector accounts for 75 per cent of the employment in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>In April, 1974, there were 62,119 persons employed while, in April, 1975, the number had dropped to 56,802.  If we take note of the number employed in that sector of the industry in April, 1974, the drop of 5,317 is a very serious matter indeed.  The week before last we castigated the Minister for Industry and Commerce because of his failure to protect the footwear industry, and rightly so, pointing out the serious loss of jobs due to lack of initiative and effort on his part.  When we take note of the fact that the number who lost employment in one year in the building industry is greater than the total employed in the whole footwear industry, we begin to appreciate the magnitude of the loss in employment.  The reason that the volume of protest in <Col N="1487" /> the case of building workers is less is that they are scattered around the country in relatively small groups, and have not the same strength to be found in a more closely-knit working force.</P>
    <P>Just as I protested on behalf of the footwear workers here, on a previous Private Members' Motion, I protest now in the name of the building workers. We, in this party, demand that the Minister take immediate and effective steps to alleviate their condition. Might I point out also, as I did previously in a supplementary question that these include both skilled and unskilled workers.</P>
    <P>Let me now deal with the problem of unemployment in the building industry. To put it mildly, the trend in this respect is very depressing.  In March, 1974, 13,509 building workers were listed as unemployed.  In March, 1975, the latest date for which I have figures available, the number had increased to 19,887, which is a rise of 6,378.  This is practically a 50 per cent increase in unemployment in one year.  Since April, 1974, the pattern has been very clear.  Month after month more and more building workers became unemployed.  There was no sudden increase in the numbers unemployed; there was a steady erosion over that period.  It was clear to everybody what was happening.  On site after site, men were being let go in a steady stream.  Yet over that long period the Minister continued to assert that there were no problems in the industry.  We were deluged from every possible publicity avenue with figures of 25,000 and 26,000 houses. As I said before the Minister with the help of a well-oiled, politically orientated misnamed Government Information Bureau bombarded our people with these figures.  I will admit that, for a time, he succeeded in lulling the unthinking into the mistaken belief that all was well, while thousands of unfortunate building workers were being handed their cards and were joining the queues outside the employment exchanges, forgotten completely by the Government and by the Minister for Local Government whose responsibility <Col N="1488" /> they are.  At the same time the Coalition continued to bask in a rather euphoric type of acclamation from those who did not understand the position then but who I have no doubt understand it now.</P>
    <P>The cruel fact of the matter is that whatever the number of houses built, 20 per cent of the total direct labour force of building and construction workers is unemployed today and no playing around with figures will change that one bit.  These are people trying to exist now on social welfare, at a time when the inflation rate has reached a fantastic level.  It is high time the Minister accepted the facts so apparent to everybody else and did something to help these workers back into employment.</P>
    <P>In a speech the Minister made during the week he used selective figures to show that there was an increase in the number of workers employed building local authority houses.  That was completely misleading and of very little assistance to the unemployed. These are workers who simply were transferred from private schemes to local authority schemes.  Might I also add that the very increase mentioned by the Minister was neutralised on the same day, in the same newspaper, by the news that one single building and construction firm had cut its workforce from 2,093 to 991.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the fall in the sales of cement in the home market and with employment and unemployment in the industry.  I have shown that there is a general contraction in the industry.  There are, of course, other indicators of the malaise in this industry.  There is less demand for materials, for timber, for concrete, bricks, chipboard, PVC piping to name but a few.  The result is that many factories producing building materials and requirements have introduced short-time working and many of their workers have been laid off. Due to a slackening of business, builders' providers have cut back their staffs.  It should be noted that the unemployment figures I have given relate only to those directly employed in the industry.  Were we to add the numbers who lost employment in ancillary <Col N="1489" /> industries and in shops which retail building materials, then the number of unemployed would be very much greater.  Evidence of the statements I have made relevant to unemployment in the industry, and ancillary industries, can be found in the annual reports of the public companies engaged in the industry and also in the CSO employment and unemployment statistics.</P>
    <P>I have given the facts.  The Minister and the Government continue to insist that there is no problem in the industry.  It is high time they faced up to their responsibilities, accepted the situation and took the necessary remedial steps.  Of course, were I to judge by the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of the boot and shoe workers, I could not be very confident that the Government would do very much to help. Economists and others experienced in such matters all accept the beneficial effect of a resurgence in the building industry.  I have no doubt that if the Minister faces this in a realistic way, very considerable benefit can accrue to the economy generally.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated on the general situation in the industry.  In a nutshell the picture presented can be described as reduced demand and, as a result, much smaller numbers of people employed; a Government which completely fails to face reality assisted by a hard-working publicity machine which has succeeded in focusing the attention of the public on certain aspects resulting in a complete overshadowing of the real position.  I hope I have, by my contribution today, pierced the propaganda bubble to some extent.  If I have I will feel I have been of considerable service to those who are at present unemployed in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims to have built over 26,000 houses in 1974-75.  I do not propose to query these figures as such.  That would be an exercise in futility and would not change attitudes&mdash;some would believe it and some would not.  However, I must point to the fact that there was a consistent fall in the sales of cement over the same year.  There was a <Col N="1490" /> large fall in the numbers employed in the building industry over the same year; sales of building materials were drastically cut back.  Unemployment increased considerably in ancillary industries and in the retail stores.  Allied to this, the Minister&mdash;when opening the Childers Estate at Dungarvan, in reply to critics who claimed that there was serious unemployment in the house building sector, said that house building accounted for only 40 per cent of the total output of the construction industry.</P>
    <P>My interpretation of that statement is that the Minister was saying in effect that employment in the other sector of the construction industry was all right and would counterbalance any loss there was in the house building industry.  If this interpretation is correct and if the Minister's statement that he built more houses in the local authority area than ever before is a fact then clearly the area that is in real trouble is the private house building sector.  It is in that area that most of the workers have lost employment.  Having stated that much it is for the public generally to come to their own conclusions.</P>
    <P>To get back to the figure claimed by the Minister of over 26,000 houses completed, as I said I do not propose to query that, but I am saying that even if these figures were correct, they do not in the circumstances represent any exceptional achievement. The efforts of the Minister to boost his own figures by comparing his figures with an average of the number of houses built over a five-year period by the Fianna Fáil administration shows that he does not really regard it as a real achievement.  This effort by him points to an element of uncertainty and doubt in his mind which forces him to make the best comparison possible instead of simply relying on his own figure or making a proper comparison such as comparing the 1973-74 with the 1972-73 figure.</P>
    <P>The Minister's comparative figures take the form of 25,000 houses built by him in 1973-74 as compared with 14,000 houses averaged over a five-year period of the Fianna Fáil administration. <Col N="1491" /> There is no way of legitimately comparing a single figure with an average figure.  Let me also add, that it is equally true that there is no way which the Minister could have completed 25,000 houses in 1973-74 had they not been in the course of erection or in an advanced stage of planning while Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    <P>Perhaps an analogy, which may in a sense be a personal one, comes to mind, that is the claim of the Minister for Education to have reduced the pupil-teacher ratio in 1973 and 1974 without any reference to the fact that the Fianna Fáil administration was responsible for the extra teachers.  Of course neither the Minister for Local Government nor the Minister for Education would worry about making his claim over such awkward facts as that.</P>
    <P>I did not propose to devote much of my time to that aspect of the matter but as the Minister for Local Government has devoted so much propaganda effort to it I should at least put the real facts on record.  The real facts are that 25,365 houses were completed in 1973-74 under the present Minister and 21,647 houses in 1972-73 under the former Minister, Deputy Molloy.  There is much more to it than that.  Further facts are the basis of the present critical situation which faces the industry.</P>
    <P>In 1971-72 15,921 houses were completed. In 1972-73 21,647 houses were completed, an increase of 36 per cent. In 1973-74 25,365 houses were completed and the rate of increase had fallen to 17.2 per cent.  Last year, 1974-75, there were 26,509 houses completed, an increase of less than 5 per cent over the previous year and if one is to judge by the hints and the leaks and by the kites that are being flown the number of houses to be built next year will be in the region of 25,000, which would be a reduction on the previous year. It is well to note that during the Fianna Fáil time in Government there was a progressive increase in house building and a firm foundation was laid at that time for the 25,000 houses.</P>
    <P>During the Coalition term of office the fall in the percentage increase has <Col N="1492" /> been quite considerable and this, in my view, is the basic cause for the present critical situation and for the rising unemployment in the industry.  Anybody with any knowledge of industrial development knows that steady consistent planned growth, at whatever level, is vital to the health of the industry and there is no such thing as standing still and retaining your position.  Once the growth stops decline sets in.  If the Minister fails to recognise that and fails to make money available the situation will become progressively worse.</P>
    <P>Whatever inflationary millions the Minister may quote for housing finance is now the major problem in the industry.  It is a problem which has been facing it for the past year.  Without finance builders cannot build. Without finance individuals cannot buy houses.  Without purchasers builders will not build.  Again, speaking at the opening of a housing estate in Dungarvan and later in the Dáil, the Minister said that he would not provide local authorities with all the money they had applied for for local authority housing because they had not the necessary preparations made to enable them to spend it.</P>
    <P>I think, knowing the situation as he did in relation to unemployment generally the Minister should have seen to it that the proper preparations were more advanced.  In any case his statement seems to imply that even if he had more money available to him at this point he would not be able to use it in that sector.  That is one reason we emphasised private house building in the motion.  The private sector of house building on which we must rely to quite an extent to provide increased employment is greatly in need of finance to overcome the critical problems facing it.</P>
    <P>The average cost of a house purchased by means of a loan from a local authority is £7,500 and I take those figures from the quarterly bulletin. If this house is purchased from a speculative builder the State grant is included in the price.  The purchaser to be entitled to a supplementary grant must have an income of less than £1,950 and if he is a man with a <Col N="1493" /> family of a certain number the limit is £2,350.  Now, if we assume that the purchaser is a family man and he is entitled to a supplementary grant, then the net price of his house will be £7,175.  The maximum local authority loan available to him is £4,500.  To purchase the house he must find £2,675.  His income qualifying limit is £2,350 so that the balance to be paid on this house is greater than a year's salary and, of course, I do not have to state that this is absolutely unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The question now arises as to where he will get the £2,675.  I note in a booklet, <i>A Home of your Own,</i> issued by the Department of Local Government emphasis is laid on savings as the key to house purchase and I agree, generally speaking.  Is it likely that a family man earning less than £2,350 would be able to save more than his own annual salary?  If we stretch our imagination to the limit and assume that he saves £1,000&mdash;mind you, this is some assumption at the present time on an income that is less than £2,350 &mdash;the question arises as to where he will get the remaining £1,675.  If he is lucky and there is a credit union functioning in his area he may get some of it there but in the main he is thrown back on finance companies. Banks, as a rule, are not willing to lend money for this purpose.  Even if they did the position would not be much better.  The finance company loan is always short-term with a very high interest rate and the repayment of principle and interest is backbreaking. The repayment on a £4,500 SDA loan is something over £9 per week but the repayment on the remainder of the money is exceptionally high.</P>
    <P>When we raised this matter on previous occasions the Minister's counter argument to this case has always been that all the money which was made available for SDA loans was fully taken up and that, therefore, there was no need to increase the loan levels.  Of course the simple answer to that is, at a time when the unemployment situation is so desperate in this country, to say to the Minister that he should increase the amount of money available <Col N="1494" /> and if the present allocation is fully taken up then obviously if more money were available the extra money would also be taken up and very particularly so if the loan level were increased.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are all fully aware of what the Minister wishes to imply in the answer he gives but what he is saying in effect is that if all the money made available for SDA loans is taken up by purchasers or people building their own houses with income limits of £2,350 and with maximum loans of £4,500 why increase either?</P>
    <P>If people, in such circumstances, take up these loans then surely they must be satisfied with the situation. Of course, the answer to that particular query is that where a man with a family is concerned the hardships these conditions impose on him are exceptional and grossly unfair.  The efforts to meet the total rent bring pressures to bear and the resulting stress and strain cause severe anxiety and worry and sometimes cause the marriage to break up. Families are sometimes deprived of proper meals because of the outlay on the house, with detrimental effects on the children's health.  Sometimes the wife must go out to work or continue to work after marriage.  I have no objection to married women going out to work if they so desire but I have a decided objection to wives having to go out to work because of economic necessity.  It is the business of the State to ensure that the necessity will not arise, and where the State fails in a matter such as this it is failing in a constitutional obligation.  Making better loans available would help to discharge this obligation.</P>
    <P>On many occasions we stressed the fact that the loans were too low.  This is not the first time that we have proposed to the Minister that they should be increased.  One might ask why people put this type of burden on their shoulders.  Of course, the fact is that they have no alternative if they are to have a home of their own.  The number of houses built by the local authorities is about one-third of the total number of houses completed each <Col N="1495" /> year and, therefore, for many people the alternative to waiting for a considerable number of years for a house is to provide one for themselves through loans and grants.  In effect, the Minister is failing, on the one hand, to provide sufficient local authority houses and, on the other, he is keeping loans and grants at such a low level that people are forced into going ahead with the house even at the expense of spending years afterwards struggling even to exist.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that when I am talking about the price of a house I am talking about the house alone and not the furniture and other necessities. I should like to ask the Minister to explain an important matter relating to the financing of local authority houses which has arisen from the figures within the Quarterly Bulletin. The Quarterly Bulletin of Housing Statistics of 31st December, 1974, gave total expenditure on housing in 1975 at £101.55 million, including £51 million for local authority housing. A footnote there states that these figures do not include the additional £7 million for local authority housing which was stated to have been made available since the budget.  The March figures in the Quarterly Bulletin should therefore read: total expenditure, £108.55 million, including £58 million for local authority housing. In fact, they read: total expenditure, £104.55 million and for local authority housing, £54 million.  I should like to know from the Minister where is the missing £4 million.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I asked the Minister, in a Dáil question, the average percentage increase in the price of all houses serviced for loans from all lending agencies from May, 1973, to 31st March, 1975.  The figure he gave me was 37 per cent.  On the same day the Taoiseach gave me a figure in relation to the construction industry, generally of 58 per cent.  There is a discrepancy here.  However, if we deal only with the 37 per cent how can the Minister possibly, in all justice, continue to hold that the loans and grants introduced in May, 1973, can still be adequate in June, 1975, when <Col N="1496" /> the increase in costs must now be 40 per cent at least?  How can he claim, if he regarded £2,350 as the maximum income to qualify for a local authority loan in May, 1973, that this is still sufficiently high when he is fully aware of the enormous increase in living costs since then?  To enjoy a standard of living equal to that enjoyed by a person with an income of £2,350 in May, 1973, today one would need a greatly increased money income. In effect, the Minister is debarring from SDA loans many people from a category who were entitled to loans two years ago.  It is not just or fair that this discrimination should be continued.</P>
    <P>With regard to those who are borrowing from building societies&mdash;the building societies need more money &mdash;one of the big problems facing them is that because those with over £2,350 per annum have no alternative but to borrow from building societies an inordinate amount of their income goes out on housing each week.  If we were to assume that the weekly repayment is £15 per week and the income about £45 per week, which is roughly the figure of £2,350, then 33? per cent of their income goes on housing.  This is very unreasonable.  I noted from some research I did that in America they regarded 15 per cent of the income as being reasonable to spend on housing and above that needed some assistance.</P>
    <P>I have shown that all the indicators point to a downturn in the building and construction industry with a consequent grave effect on employment and the hopes of many who are anxious to build or buy their own houses.  The Minister stated at the opening of the Childers estate in Dungarvan that the full claim by the local authorities for money for housing would not be granted because the sum sought was more than the local authorities should possibly spend.  If this is so then we gave him advice about six months ago and on many other occasions as to where extra money could be used to the benefit of the person who wished to build his own house and to the benefit of the building worker.  We suggested that the Minister <Col N="1497" /> put more money into private housing.  So as to encourage more people to buy their own houses, to build their own houses and to put more people into employment, we advocate a number of things.  Firstly, we propose that the loan limit be increased to £6,000.  I have heard an objection to this proposal and, indeed, the Minister referred obliquely to this during replies to supplementary questions.</P>
    <P>The objection was that the borrower would not be able to pay back the interest rate on the principal because the total would be too high.  Of course, this argument might be valid if a new house could be built for £5,000.  But the fact is that a new house cannot be built for less than £7,500 and, therefore, the borrower must look for more than £2,500 over and above the local authority loan.  I stress that this extra money he needs does not include furniture or other necessities.  The combined payments in such a case would be far and away above the repayment on the £6,000 SDA loan.</P>
    <P>We are also proposing that the qualifying income limit should be increased to at least £3,000.  I do not think there is any need for me to justify this when we consider the violent increase in living costs.  We advocate that all new house and reconstruction grants should be increased by 50 per cent.  With regard to the building societies the existing mortgage interest rates should be reduced by the removal of income tax liability on building societies.  Fianna Fáil believe that there should be a fundamental reappraisal of the whole area of housing finance, and we are doing just that.</P>
    <P>There is a serious unemployment problem in the industry and in auxiliary industries.  Repeating again the number of houses built and the totals of money spent by the National Coaltion does not alter this situation. We are proposing that a worth-while injection of money should be made into the construction industry with emphasis on the private housing sector to ensure that the unemployment situation will be improved and a guarantee to many people who are in need of <Col N="1498" /> houses and who are anxious to buy or build their own houses that they will be able to do so.  More money, of course, must also be made available for general construction purposes, to build more schools, more Garda stations and to erect more factories. More money must be made available for water and sewerage purposes, for road building and so on.</P>
    <P>I suggested previously that, in this architectural heritage year, we should invest in labour intensive work of reconstructing old buildings and converting them to other uses.  I do not have to go into the advantages of increased spending in the building industry. Apart from the fact that it would increase employment quickly, it has the added advantage that the main raw materials are home produced. This, at a time when we have balance of payments problems, is something which should weigh heavily with the Minister.</P>
    <P>In prevailing circumstances if the Minister takes the various proposals we have put forward and puts them into effect, they will have worthwhile effects on the building and construction industry and on the economy generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Begley)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to put it on the record that the Government regard the building and construction industry as one of the most important in the country.  In fact, it has a key role in the whole economy, representing about 13 per cent of the gross national product.  If you look at it closely, it is only second to agriculture as far as employment content is concerned.  Deputy Faulkner made the statement that he did not want to be blinded by figures, yet he used figures whenever they suited his own argument. More than likely, the Minister and I will do the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>At present there are about 77,000 people employed in industry, both in the private and public sectors.  In the public sector&mdash;that includes the ESB, Bord na Móna, all the semi-State bodies&mdash;there are something in the region of 20,000 employed. In the private sector the figure is in the region of 56,802.  That is a fall of 8.5 per cent on the corresponding figure for 1974.  It is not 20 per cent, as Deputy Faulkner said.  There are no statistics available for the private sector of the house building industry. However, it is fair to say that when Deputy Faulkner was making his contribution, he passed over the public sector which has increased substantially, and there are about 6,670 working there now.  That figure speaks for itself.  In the public sector in 1969-70 there were only 4,580 working there; in 1973-74 there were 4,970; in 1974 for nine months there were 6,293 and in 1975, for the first four months, there were 6,594.  That is a dramatic increase in the public sector.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Faulkner in regard to the building and construction industry.  It ranges far afield, to the merchant, the carpenter, the plasterer, the man who buys the furniture, the offices; in fact everywhere you turn, it will have an effect.  If something goes wrong with it the effect will be seen down the line.  In the first nine months to 31st December, 1974, the Government provided about £240 million to generate work for the industry. Of this, a yearly equivalent of £93 million was provided for houses. In 1975, a record £300 million has been provided for the public capital programme to stimulate work for this industry.  £104.53 million of this was allocated for houses.  Included in this was the £54 million which Deputy Faulkner mentioned and a further £4 million which was granted since the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means there is £58 million for local authority housing.  These are figures for new house grants, which cannot be disputed.  The number of full grant payments in the first five months in 1975 compares favourably with the corresponding period for 1974 as the following figures show: In <Col N="1500" /> January, 1975: 1,792; January, 1974: 1,318.  In February, 1975: 1,702; February, 1974: 1,211.  In March, 1975: 1,528; March, 1974: 2,103.  In April, 1975: 1,090; April, 1974: 1,086.  May, 1975: 1,316; May, 1974, 1,079.  The total for 1975 was 7,428. The total for 1974 was 6,797.  That is certainly an improvement and these are statistics that will stand up.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the figures for dwellings for the first five months in 1975, are not as high as they were in 1974.  However, the margin is not that great.  The comparable figures are: January, 1975: 1,565; January, 1974: 1,378.  February, 1975: 1,251; February, 1974: 1,158.  March, 1975: 1,358; March, 1974: 1,297.  April, 1975: 1,231; April, 1974: 1,626.  May, 1975: 1,241; May, 1974: 1,320.  The total for 1975 was 6,339.  The total for 1974 was 6,966.</P>
    <P>In regard to the amount of instalment grants paid, I should like to show to the House that there is no great difference between 1974 and 1975.  In January, 1975, it was 1,565; January, 1974: 1,378.  February, 1975: 1,380; February, 1974: 1,284.  March, 1975: 972; March, 1974: 1,303.  April, 1975: 1,102; April, 1974: 787.  May, 1975: 931; May, 1974: 1,273.  The total for 1975 was 5,950 and the total for 1974 was 6,025.  These are figures which withstand any argument.  No matter what Deputy Faulkner may say they run very close to one another.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell Deputy Faulkner that the local authorities are providing very valuable assistance to the private house building sector by means of their purchase loans and supplementary grants.  In fact, an indication of the extent to which the loan system is being utilised is that the latest available figures show that at 30th March, 1975 applications totalling 17,097 valued at £67.85 million were held as against 15,239 valued at £49.88 million in the corresponding period in 1974. The amount provided for these schemes from the public capital programme has increased substantially during the past three years.  For 1972-73 it was £9.3 million; it is £37.5 million in the current financial year. Nobody can refute those figures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1501" /> Deputy Faulkner made a case for an increase in loans up to £6,000.  One would think from his argument that the £4,500 was more or less hindering housing.  We cannot accept that because if that were so the demand for loans would not have continued to expand.</P>

Experience has shown that the builders have redesigned their houses to cater for the type of person who can qualify for that loan.  These figures speak for themselves.  As the Minister pointed out in reply to a Dáil question from Deputy Moore, the whole question is under review.  If the Minister feels that action should be taken, I have no doubt that he will take the appropriate action.</P>

      <P>It is expected that payments by building societies in 1975 will exceed £65 million compared with £43 million in 1972-73.  During the first five months of 1975 the societies approved loans totalling £32 million. I am very glad to inform the House that the net flow of funds into the societies during the past six months has shown a dramatic increase.  It reached a record level of £19.8 million. The figures for the different quarters in the comparable years are most interesting: in 1972, for the first quarter, it was £7.5 million; in 1973, it was £5.3 million; in 1974 it was £4.1 million and in 1975, it is £8.6 <Col N="1502" /> million; for April and May a further £11 million has come in, bringing it up to £19.8 million for that period.</P>
      <P>This Government have treated building societies very well.  It is no harm to put on the record of the House things that the Government have done and which some people would wish to forget about.  In March, 1973, a special tax arrangement was operated by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to societies and confined to societies charging them a rate of interest on housing loans not exceeding a rate specified by the Minister for Local Government.  In May, 1973, a special subsidy was introduced which enabled societies in present circumstances to offer an increased rate to investors by containing at 11¼ per cent the mortgage rates on home loans not exceeding £9,000.  If this subsidy was not available, the mortgage rates would be 12½ per cent.  One of the conditions attached to that subsidy is that loans made by the societies must relate exclusively to housing purposes.</P>
      <P>Again, in October, 1973, the Government made a special arrangement with the Central Bank and associated banks for a special borrowing facility of £11 million for certain societies. This enabled those societies to expand their loan commitments beyond what they would have been able to do on the basis of the net inflow of funds at that time.  Further, the Government secured the discontinuance of an arrangement operated by some societies whereby some builders paid them a handsome commission or a fee in return for an assurance that loans would be available in due course for houses constructed by those builders. This is all good work done by the Government as far as the building industry is concerned.  There is no point glossing over it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the public capital programme in respect of the water and sewerage programme is concerned, it is worth while giving the figures here. All this is related directly or indirectly to the building industry.  In 1971-72 the figure was £6.26 million; in 1972-73 it was £8.23 million; in 1973-74 it was £12.95 million and in 1974, for the nine-months' period, it was £11.45 <Col N="1503" /> million.  In 1975, it is £16.75 million. These are staggering increases by any standard and due tribute should be paid to the Government for providing so much money in three years.</P>
    <P>In 1974 local authorities were allowed to submit programmes which cost less than £20,000 to the Department. They are no longer required to submit technical details for small works; instead they can submit towards the end of the year a statement setting out the small works which they propose to carry out during the following financial year.</P>

      <P>As far as employment content in water and sewerage schemes is concerned, it is about 35 to 40 per cent of the cost of the water scheme and about 50 per cent of the cost of the sewerage scheme.  An analysis of the employment content of certain capital expenditure carried out by the Department of Finance in 1975 confirmed these figures.  On the basis of a representative survey we got the following results: water supply scheme, labour as a percentage of total cost, 36 per cent; of a sewerage scheme, 55 per cent.  The direct employment content percentage of sewerage schemes was the highest for the varied type of projects examined. Further on that, it is quite fair to say that in the group water schemes you have another 400 or 500 people employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this is proof positive that the Government are very concerned about the building industry and the works leading off it, and as far as we are <Col N="1504" /> concerned we are putting the capital allocation into it and we are showing beyond doubt that we are building the houses.  As far as local authority and private housing output is concerned, in the Government's target in their programme of intent, they said they would build 25,000 dwellings.  This figure was achieved in 1973-1974. Again, in 1974-75, we built 26,393.  It is worth while to go back a few years and compare figures.  In 1970-1971 the number of local authority houses completed was 3,875; the number of private was 9,796.  In 1971-72 the total was, local authority, 5,106, private, 10,815, total 15,921.  In 1972-73, local authority, 5,784, private, 15,863, total 21,647.</P>

I think we have clearly demonstrated the dramatic increase from 1970-71 to 1974-75, from 13,671 to 26,396. Again it is proof positive that we are really building the houses.  I think Deputy Falkner will admit from the figures I have given him, and these are authentic figures, that the National Coalition have built the houses.</P>
      <P>But it must be remembered what is happening in other countries and that a certain amount of it will rub off on this country.  There is no point in getting away from that, because as far as Britain is concerned she is really in trouble.  According to the quarterly bulletin of the International Federation of Builders and Woodworkers, there is very serious unemployment in the industry.  The same is true in Austria, Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and in parts of Spain where 10 per cent of the building work force is currently unemployed. It is estimated that this figure may rise to 50 per cent in the Federal Republic of Germany.</P>

      <P>Housing is the business of us all but the Government have no body or organisation which can direct the necessary moneys into it.  That is what we are asking them to do.  Deputy Faulkner gave a masterly analysis of the construction industry on a nationwide basis and if I have a parochial view it is because in this city we have a housing problem of great worry to us.  The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary cannot say that under Fianna Fáil we had not full employment.  In fact, not so long ago, with Fianna Fáil in power, one of the biggest builders in the country was advertising in the English papers in order to attract some of the emigrant workers home to join in the great housing drive.  To contrast that position with what obtains today is to sadden us.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary very vaguely poured forth many statistics which left me cold, and I would say for the person seeking a dwelling, whether it be a purchased dwelling or a rented dwelling, it would leave him cold also.  There are figures which nobody can dispute taken from the live register of unemployed that at the moment there are about 6,000 building workers unemployed.  They are only the ones which are registered. There are many who do not register. We may not like the lumpers in the trade but they are in the trade, and many of them do not register.  There is the tragic picture that while these men stand idle, we still have a pressing housing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner mentioned the ancillary industries.  Take even the service industries, the builders' providers, those who manufacture materials for house building, these all are in the trade.  At the same time, we have in the city alone about 6,000 families waiting to be housed.  These are the families which were accepted by the <Col N="1506" /> corporation in the city and are eligible for housing.  That figure does not include those young couples who are seeking an SDA loan so that they can purchase their houses.  I put down a question not long ago on the availability of loans and asked whether the Minister would increase the limits. He said there was no need to because all the moneys made available were being taken up.  That was probably true but the money allegedly being put forward at the disposal of young couples could not be availed of by many of them because of the difference between the loan limit and the average price of a house today.  This is the situation not only in this city but in every major urban area in the country.  Young people want to purchase their own homes but cannot do so.  The average price of a house today is £7,000 and the loan limit is £4,500.  Therefore, the young couple must make up the difference by way of deposit.</P>
    <P>A more serious factor has emerged with the publication today of a booklet by the Department of Finance.  In this publication we read that between 1973 and 1974 national savings are down by about £90 million.  In that figure must be included the non-savings of many young couples who could not reach the deposits required and who are now living in rooms and paying exorbitant rents.  Perhaps it is in this sector that we see the greatest savagery of a non-housing programme by the Government.  These young couples who have scrimped and saved a certain amount of money cannot reach the amount required for a deposit on a house.  They want to get married and settle down but they must take a so-called flat in the suburbs or inner city areas where they pay a lot more than they would pay for a house but the point is that they cannot get the house.  This is why we have been pressing the Government to increase the loan limit so that these young couples can avail of the SDA operations to acquire a house and to start their lives on a good basis.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why any Government would not pour every penny the country could afford into the housebuilding end of the construction industry, <Col N="1507" /> the ramifications of which are so great that a buoyant construction industry can be of enormous benefit not alone economically but socially.</P>
    <P>If we have this grave and continuing housing problem, its repercussions will be experienced in every stratum of our society.  The Government started off with a great fanfare of trumpets about housebuilding.  No doubt at the time they meant what they said, but it is performance which counts and not mere promises or wishful thinking.</P>
    <P>The danger of the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary is that he probably believes what he says.  This is a great tragedy.  He is complacent so far as figures are concerned.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary might leave the Custom House and go and talk to people who are looking for these loans, or even talk to some of the unemployed.  In that way they would get the real picture. We must not pay any heed to the statistics which were poured forth in the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary.  If he did not believe it there would be some hope that this would be more than mere political talking, but the fact that he believes it means that he will not be concerned with doing anything about the situation.</P>
      <P>In Dungarvan the Minister stated recently that because of the fact that some local authorities would not be able to use the housing moneys this year, they would not get them.</P>

      <P>By tomorrow night I hope to have the exact wording.  The point is for such a statement to be made at a time like this when we have a kind of admission that things are not good here.  It is no comfort to people to tell them, as Deputy Begley told them, that things are bad in Austria or Spain.  They may be bad in those places but for different reasons.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary that matters are becoming worse.  There are £90 million less in the savings funds.  This could be repeated in other sectors also.  We are looking forward to the massive injection some people have suggested will be made.  The time has come for the Minister to have a look at the whole construction industry and ask why it is that only a little more than two years ago we had practically full employment but now we have chronic under-employment.  At the same time the housing waiting list grows.  In spite of the efforts of Dublin Corporation we find at the moment a mere 1,500 dwellings under construction while the approved waiting list is more than 5,000.  When I say approved housing list I refer to the number of families who have been accepted by the Corporation as complying with their regulations for housing eligibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure every city has this problem.  No childless couple would appear on that list unless they lived in a dangerous building.  Lots of young married couples who apply for inclusion are told that in the present circumstances they are not eligible for housing.  They may be living with their parents and this is not always the best arrangement, or they may be living in some room paying the highest rent they can afford.  They may be trying to save for and awaiting the SDA loan, but it is not forthcoming.  We charge the Government with falling down on the job of housing.  No matter what statistics are put before us, we go back to those which show that the work force in the construction trade has fallen by <Col N="1509" /> about 6,000.  It is not improving, and more and more people cannot save for a deposit on a house.</P>
      <P>I suppose the Opposition should suggest to the Government something they might do in easement of the situation. On the local authority housing scene, the Government must come forward with more capital.  I said a few years ago here that had we had all the money we needed we could not have accelerated the housing drive because the labour force was fully employed and one could not get more workers, even though many had come back from abroad.  The position today is that if the Minister will provide the money we will put those 6,000 unemployed men to work in the construction industry, and there is room for plenty more if we are even to overcome the present housing problem.  I reiterate that we will always have some type of housing problem.  Any living city or country will have a certain problem but we do not accept that we should allow the problem to continue while men wither through unemployment and allow the boast to be made that the men who are unemployed are being paid adequate social welfare benefit.  I am sure these men would prefer to be working, building houses or other kinds of building rather than merely drawing the dole while the housing waiting lists mount and mount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the task of the Government, and they must so organise their financial resources and allocations to ensure that our second largest industry will not grind to a standstill because we have not sufficient money. It is not my job to tell the Government where to get the money. They have got their financial advisers and the Department of Finance at their backs.  But we do say they are failing gravely in their duty on which they will be judged if they do not try to revitalise the construction industry. We heard in the last year Fianna Fáil were in power the jeering about the office blocks being built. But one will note in recent times even they are not being built, practically all the large cranes that used to be <Col N="1510" /> seen on the city skyline have disappeared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They are buying racecourses instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>So also is the employment of building workers diminishing.</P>
      <P>Were we to swap office blocks for houses we would not mind.  I would be in favour of it.  If the high-rise cranes have disappeared from the office block sites, the ordinary scaffolding of the two-storey dwelling is also disappearing. We are left with the tantalising situation where we have masses of unemployed workers while the housing waiting list grows and its attendant misery grows also.</P>
      <P>It would be very easy to criticise a Government were they inexperienced or with no history on which to work in regard to housing construction.  But there are plenty of records in the Department of Local Government to show the various phases of fluctuation in the housing drive.  If we have reached a record number of unemployed in all sectors&mdash;and who knows whether we have yet reached the limit, I hope we have&mdash;who could excuse a Government, whether they be socialist or capitalist, who will stand and do little while our building operatives become unemployed, while the housing waiting list grows and people become despondent about the prospects of the housing drive being maintained as it was a few years ago?</P>
      <P>There are people who cast grave doubt on the statistics issued by the Parliamentary Secretary, or indeed through publications.  I am not a great believer in masses of statistics being thrown out in defence of any case.</P>

      <P>There is not alone the fact that these men are unemployed but that they could be employed in turning out more dwellings for the people who need them.  But the men are being kept idle because the Government's housing policy has failed. No matter how much it is boosted by statistics issued by the Department, I do not think anybody believes it any more.  If one passes Gardiner Street or Werburgh Street employment exchanges, one sees statistics there, not cold figures but men standing there who could be employed in building homes for their families, relations or friends.</P>
      <P>We demand that the Government shake themselves.  When I say that we demand that, I will admit there are plenty of Deputies on the Government benches also who are not at all satisfied with the Government's handling of the housing situation.  We will continue to urge, even to plead with the Government, to get down, cut out the gimmicks and find the money to put into the construction industry so that we may again see the housing drive well under way because a fact of all of this is that the building trade is not now employing young apprentices. The ESB had to get rid of many of their apprentices long ago.  We find that young people cannot find a trade. If this continues long enough we will eventually have a grave shortage of craftsmen, not because there is not work for them in the future but because there has now been created a gap in training.  Despite the best efforts of AnCO unless there is full employment for apprentices we shall feel the pinch in the future.  Think also of the anxiety of parents who see their sons wanting to become carpenters, bricklayers, electricians or plasters, who cannot be placed in any job in the construction industry.  If youth become cynical and sceptical who can blame them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The onus is clearly on the Government to devise ways and means of getting sufficient capital for the construction industry.  Any Government with any sense would get the money <Col N="1512" /> somewhere to put into this industry because not alone does it help to cut out social evils but it also provides gainful employment and if today the Government feel despondent at their lack of progress the people will blame them mostly for their failure to handle the whole construction industry. It is starved of capital.  Because the whole situation was mishandled we now have rising unemployment in the industry, despondency in the young couples who seek houses and bewilderment among the people who thought the Government would keep up the good work of the previous Administration in the building drive.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to the conclusion of what I had to say about the Bill in relation to what I thought it might contain rather than what it contains.  That is not to say that I do not welcome the provisions in the Bill particularly the legal provision compelling the person responsible for dependants, under court order, to contribute to the dependants who may be neglected.  This would possibly go a long way to meet some of the demands made by community organisations that have been advocating this type of thing from time to time.  On examination on Committee Stage one would be in a better position to get an interpretation of each section.  In that respect I do not propose to make statements regarding the Bill now which might not be absolutely correct, on closer examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that the necessity for the home assistance scheme was to a great extent eroded by the coming into effect of the various social welfare schemes, which did not exist when home assistance legislation was first provided. This is quite true.  The evolution of social welfare, particularly since the end of the last war, has been fairly dramatic in that it encompassed most <Col N="1513" /> of the people who should be brought under the community umbrella in relation to the obligations of society to the less well off members.  At the same time, it was found necessary to retain the home assistance scheme in order to give on the spot assistance and give <i>ad hoc</i> assistance in relation to temporary destitution and in circumstances which were not covered by any of the other social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that a national assistance scheme would have to replace the home assistance scheme as we knew it up to now.  I was always of the opinion that those chronically unemployed persons who were receiving unemployment assistance but who on a strict interpretation of the unemployment assistance legislation would not actually qualify for unemployment assistance at all should be brought within the scope of another type of payment, a national assistance payment which would not require them to fulfil the usual requirement of the weekly certificate in order to qualify for unemployment benefit. That would remove from the register of unemployed those chronic cases who are not in a position to accept work even if it were offered to them tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I had personal experience of this when I brought back the employment period orders.  We provided at that time £500,000 extra for amenity schemes in rural areas which would to some extent affect the losses sustained by the categories of single men who were held under the employment period orders not to be qualified during certain months for unemployment assistance.  It was a very interesting experiment.  It provided a certain amount of useful information. We found that many people to whom this extra money was directed by way of employment did not or could not avail of it.  Many of them at the time, when there was a good deal of protest about the employment period orders being restored, admitted that no system of employment would suit them.  They were actually availing themselves of a scheme for which they were not quite, on a strict interpretation <Col N="1514" /> of the legislation and the legal requirements, qualified.  If this payment were taken from them they would be left in severe stress.  It would be better if they could be brought within the scope of the national assistance scheme and thereby removed from the unemployed register entirely.  There is a limited number of such people.  A scheme like this could easily reach out to them.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in this Bill which makes it essential for the assistance officer to require the applicant to apply for any other benefits to which he may be entitled under the social welfare code.  He, too, could easily have re-examined cases of persons, now that the payments will be equal in both cases, who are chronically unemployed or, perhaps, using the scheme for the purpose of getting some means to meet the necessities of life and they would change to this scheme.  That is one of the reasons why I basically object to the rates having to carry 40 per cent of the added cost.  If this new supplementary benefit scheme is availed of to the fullest extent, I think it can be used to take in those chronically unemployed who, under a strict interpretation of the Act, are not unemployed. It could cost considerably more and add a considerable amount to the basic 1975 figure at which the cost to the rates has been frozen.  The 40 per cent could represent a very heavy contribution for the taxpayer.  If the scheme is used to the fullest extent. These are important factors and possibilities within the ambit of this legislation and the Parliamentary Secretary might explain them to us.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary also to deal with the method of payment and the legal provisions in the Bill compelling persons to contribute for those for whom they are responsible.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to a community body carrying out a pilot scheme to see to what extent this legislation might be used for the elimination of poverty. What will the pilot scheme be?  Will an area within an electoral division or county be chosen or will he use the overall application of the legislation <Col N="1515" /> for the purpose of deriving the information they think would be helpful to them under their terms of reference?</P>
    <P>Other speakers complimented the Parliamentary Secretary on carrying out another advance in the social welfare code.  I welcome it as one of the many steps taken to improve the social welfare code down through the years.  I hope it is not the last.  The Parliamentary Secretary may accuse the former Government and previous Minister for not doing everything, but I can assure him that when he leaves office there will be things left to be done by his successors.</P>
    <P>This is an evolving code which turns up new problems requiring new remedies and new approaches which will be interminable as far as the improvement of the scheme is concerned. I am glad that those people who used approach debates in my time on the grounds that they wanted a new social welfare code, are found to be completely incorrect in their assumption as I thought then.  We have the basics of a good sound social welfare code and to add the cosmetics to it is not a difficult job.  It only requires the resources to do it.  So far as the social conscience of the people are concerned, we have that in plenty.  It was never lacking.  The approach to social welfare is not any different from that in any other period.  The question of the poverty line is purely a relative one.  If we have, as has been advocated by Deputy O'Connell, the establishment of a poverty line it would not need to be static but moveable, because as the general standard of living improves one is inclined to put the line higher. I am talking about relativity in the matter of means and the enjoyment of standards in life.  It is the question of the difference between two or a variety of people in social standing and circumstances and the right of a particular sector to enjoy certain privileges and benefits enjoyed by another. The poverty line set here 50 years ago would be a very different one from that which we would set today. Those held to be below the poverty <Col N="1516" /> line today would be regarded as being in the middle income group 50 years ago.  Any line set in relation to people's standards of living would need to be moveable.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will come under close scrutiny on a Committee Stage.  I hope the necessary time will be permitted to enable their spokesman on social welfare on this side to submit any amendment he may see fit.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will not be deaf to any proposal made in that respect.  He should seriously consider going the whole hog and nationalising the scheme.  He should take it from the broader base of taxation rather than from local rates and have the payments made through the post.  I believe he will have those payments made through the post.  This is essential if the old stigma is to be removed in so far as home assistance is concerned.  The humiliating feature about home assistance payments was having to queue up for payments on appointed days.</P>
    <P>Many other things could be in the Bill but I welcome anything that is in it.  There will be other opportunities to have other matters inserted and I hope the problem, so far as social welfare payments are concerned&mdash;the declining standards of living&mdash;will not be too long with us.  By resorting to the progress and expansion of the economic system, as we were experiencing in the past, the line will be shortened in so far as those in need of assistance are concerned and the general improvement in living standards will resume its progress.  Fewer people will be left below the poverty line, which nobody, as yet, has really established.  The Minister can rest assured of full assistance from this side of the House in any legislation of that kind, but we deem it our duty to point out what we think are the defects at any time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this very progressive piece of legislation.  It is distressing to find that the Public Assistance Act, commonly known as home assistance, has not been revised since 1939, over 36 years ago.  No better word than &ldquo;stigma&rdquo; can describe the old home assistance. <Col N="1517" /> We also had that type of stigma as far as the county homes were concerned and we are delighted to see that since the name was changed from county homes to welfare homes and the buildings modernised the older people in our society do not feel the same stigma as they did in the past.</P>
      <P>The kernel of this Bill is that people who are not by their own means able to provide their needs will get benefit. There were loopholes in the social welfare code whereby people did not get assistance they were entitled to. Now they will get this assistance.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the single women under the age of 58.  Every Deputy in this House has had cases of women in the 30 to 40 age group who have had good steady jobs in Dublin and London and other places but have had to leave these jobs and come home to look after an old person.  They find they are not entitled to benefit, and the reason is that there are probably two or three brothers working at home and that person, in her own right, is not entitled to the care allowance.  I hope that under this Bill such persons will now be entitled to the benefit which they have for so long needed and deserved.</P>
      <P>The second type of person who has not been covered up to this under the social welfare benefits has been the deserted wife.  The problem is that the deserted wife has to wait for three months after her husband has left her before she is entitled to benefit. Admittedly she is entitled to home assistance but once again a lot of these people are proud, and quite rightly so, and do not want to go to the local assistance officer to be told, as his whim, how much she will get until the three months is up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third person that I found not entitled to benefit particularly in our constituency is the person who claims unemployment benefit but has not got enough stamps in this country and therefore a check has to be made with Newcastle-on-Tyne as well.  That person might have to wait 12 or even 15 weeks before he can benefit.  Once again, admittedly, that person is entitled to go to the local assistance officer and claim home assistance but <Col N="1518" /> usually he does not wish to do that. I have seen people with practically nothing in the house on a Friday who will not go to claim home assistance under the old stigma.  I would like to welcome this Bill as further progressive legislation from the National Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The one criticism I have of the Bill is that, as set out in paragraph (8) (d) of the explanatory memorandum, any person who has the benefit of free board will have its value deducted from assistance.  Take the case of a single woman who has come home from, say, Dublin and is living with a crippled mother and two brothers. Is it right that this person would not be entitled to money under this Bill? I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have another look at this and see if an amendment could be put down entitling such a person to full benefit.</P>
    <P>One of the anomalies under the old Home Assistance Act was that local assistance officers decided at their own whim, how much applicants would get.  It is not unknown in cases which are exactly the same to have one person receiving £1.50 per week more than some other person living in a different district, because the local assistance officers at their whim so decide.  This is wrong, and I am glad to see that this new legislation will be administered by the health boards.</P>
    <P>In many cases disability allowance is now being paid by cheque, and I would suggest, like the speakers before me, that the new payment should be made by cheque posted to the person's home.  It is absolutely demoralising for people to have to queue up at the home assistance office.</P>
    <P>I must agree with my counterpart from Donegal on his point about unemployable people.  When new industrialists come to towns, say, on the western seaboard, the one thing they are interested in finding out is how many people are on the unemployment register.  It is very misleading at the present time.  You could have 200 or 300 people entitled to unemployment assistance.  If the figure is 200, that industrialist goes away with the idea that there are 200 people available <Col N="1519" /> for work in that district.  This is wrong.</P>
    <P>If we are to be realistic about it, we will all agree that about 40 per cent of the people on the unemployment register are probably not employable. Therefore a new scheme, as I have stated many times before, should be brought in to cover this type of people so that industrialists, in particular, will not be fooled in any way with regard to the number of employable people in an area.</P>
    <P>In the country at the present time there is a climate of opinion against unemployment assistance as such.  I have a lot of reservations about granting unemployment assistance on farm valuation.  It is not uncommon that people earning perhaps £4,000 or £5,000 from their farm, quite legally and rightly so, are, at the same time, collecting unemployment assistance. This Bill is to help the weakest section of our community.  I am delighted to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on his progressive legislation. I am also delighted to see that all parties in this House seem to welcome the Bill.  It is high time it was introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to add my voice to the voices of those who have already welcomed this new Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Bill, 1975. It is a measure which has been called for from all sides of the House and by all who have experience of the very great need that some of the population have found themselves in down through the years.  It can truly be said that this legislation is long overdue.  It is, as the Parliamentary Secretary said in reading his introductory speech, designed to remove the remaining vestiges of the poor law in this country.  For that all of us must have a hearty welcome.  There must be a new philosophy in regard to our attitudes towards these people in our society who, because of the society structure and very often by the actions of other human beings in society, have not been allowed to enjoy the standard of living which <Col N="1520" /> many of us in this House and outside the House consider our due.  We have said with justification down through the years that the home assistance programme which was operated in this country was one which had scant respect for the dignity of the human being.  It was operated in a most arbitrary manner.  The unfortunate person and, perhaps, that person's family were totally dependent on the judgment of an officer of the health board or of the public authority to decide whether they were in need of the assistance doled out to them.</P>
      <P>The poor, who are dependent on this scheme of payments, feel a sense of shame and, indeed, a very unnecessary sense of shame because poverty is something one should not be ashamed of.  Our society was so structured that all the aid we had down through the years to relieve poverty was based on the thought that it was a crime to be poor.  Bit by bit we are getting away from that.  I sincerely hope that this legislation before the House is the final step in the removal of the stigma that has existed within the social welfare code with regard to those who are in dire need in our society.  There is built into this new legislation a device for appeal which will enable the person who will from now on get this allowance, to get it by right rather than as charity.  This is a very welcome development.</P>

    <P>It is very important that those who are framing the device for appeal should make this a simple device and that it should be readily available to people concerned and that its existence should be made known to those who need it.  I was not surprised, in listening to the Parliamentary Secretary to hear that a quarter of those surveyed did not admit to being in receipt of home assistance allowances. This, as a public representative, has been my experience.  Unfortunately, people have tended to regard receipt of home assistance as something to be ashamed of.  I think it was Deputy Brennan who said in his speech that he hoped they would be paid by cheque and that there would not be queues for home assistance as there were in the past.  I am happy to report <Col N="1521" /> that in the area I come from the queues have ceased for quite some time.  Cash is paid on request only to meet a very immediate need and in the ordinary course where the payment of home assistance is established, that payment is made through the post as has been done for some time past.  I am quite sure that when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying to the query, he will make the point that payment will be made through the post and that there will be no need for the recipient to queue.  That would be completely contrary to the spirit of the measure the Parliamentary Secretary has introduced.</P>
    <P>It does appear to me that there is a very good concept in that legislation which the Parliamentary Secretary has put before us.  There should be a basic rate and supplementary supports.</P>
    <P>In many of the allowances we have for a single person the rates at all levels seem extremely low.  Admitting, however, that considerable improvement has been made in recent years, particularly since the present Parliamentary Secretary took office, in all areas of social welfare, yet we have the situation where the person living alone will get the present rate of £7.34 a week.  This is in keeping with other allowances of that nature.  It seems to me that in the case of the allowance for a single person, particularly if it is not a person in the old age category who would not therefore qualify for free transport, free electricity and the other supports they get, the supplementary supports should apply to them to cover these basic needs.  If this happens&mdash;and I presume that the Parliamentary Secretary when replying will elucidate that point and let us know that that is the intention&mdash;it will meet a very great need in society at this time because as a public representative I come across daily cases of people in receipt of allowances such as single women's allowances, unmarried mothers' allowance and indeed, other such allowances, and persons who are not yet in the age bracket where they qualify for the facilities such as free electricity, which is a very substantial cost to them.  They find electricity bills a tremendous draw on their resources. <Col N="1522" /> I would anticipate the extension of these supplementary supports to cover such items as electricity charges, transport charges, and so on.</P>
    <P>There have been people operating the old home assistance code who have been very humane and have done their best within a very bad system to provide the best services possible for the people who are dependent on them.  There have been others who have been pretty draconian in their attitude towards the unfortunates dependent on them.  That is the experience of everybody who has had experience of this system.</P>
    <P>As well as the shame of which I spoke earlier there is also this mistrust in the minds of the people receiving this assistance.  The home assistance officer is very often wrongly accused of being biased on political grounds or on other grounds.  Sometimes there was some justification in that; sometimes there was not, but a system should not have existed where this could have been suspected.</P>
    <P>In so far as the central authority is concerned we had a very pecuniary attitude towards those who received assistance.  I have one case in mind where a lady lived in a small wooden bunglow which had a very bad roof. She had some employment on and off during her life, sometimes qualified for unemployment benefit, sometimes home assistance.  When she became 50 and was lucky enough to be able to qualify for the recently-introduced scheme of allowances for such women, she applied for her single women's allowance and that was duly granted. When it was granted to her some arrears were due to her and these totalled £50 to £53.  This was very welcome news to this woman and she looked forward to repairing the roof of her house with the money from the arrears.  But her delight was short-lived because, as soon as her allowance came through she was notified by the home assistance authority that out of the £53 arrears which were due to her since her single woman's allowance came through, she had to pay back such home assistance as had been paid to her in the interval. We tried by every means in our power <Col N="1523" />&mdash;everyone concerned in community affairs and I, as her public representative&mdash;to reverse that decision.  We knew that that £53 meant the difference between a roof over her head and the rain coming down on her. But we were met with this attitude, that is to say, it was the home assistance code that had gone on for so many years.  We are getting away from that and for that reason we are praising this measure.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told us that this is part of a comprehensive code of legislation on social services. I am glad of that.  It is notable that in the paragraph where he speaks about the residual and support role of this Bill, he spoke of those who will be exempted from the regulation and that a person must be registered for employment.  It is intended to make provision for exemptions in respect of persons incapable of work, mothers with children to care for, persons over pensionable age and others where the condition of applying for work would be inappropriate.  It is an important development and it has meant that people, the man for instance who cannot even read, has the same right to benefit as those who are more favourably situated in society.  I am very glad of that being catered for in this measure.</P>
    <P>We must have new thinking in this area of financial support.  This Bill supplants the 1939 Home Assistance Act.  Since that Act was passed we have had a reduction from 75,000 to 30,000 in the number of beneficiaries under schemes to supplement payments under other services.  There have been three substantial reductions in the term of office of Deputy Cluskey as Parliamentary Secretary. During those years we have had added to the lists of those persons dependent on assistance such people as those who had devoted their lives to the care of elderly parents or others and who during those years were unable to take up employment and who had nobody to turn to but the assistance officer, when the parents died or when the families they had ceased to be.  The many <Col N="1524" /> people in that category are now being catered for.</P>
    <P>Up to very recently unmarried mothers had to depend on social welfare until the Parliamentary Secretary provided for a special allowance for them.  There is now provision for special assistance for widows in the early days of widowhood.  During that period, between widowhood and the widow's pension becoming payable, the only recourse they had up to very recently was to their local home assistance officer.  This applies particularly in cases of widows whose husbands had been ill for quite a considerable time before their deaths.  This had reduced the family resources considerably and left wives ill-equipped to meet the additional burdens of widowhood at that time.  The extension of the payment of disability and unemployment benefit to such widows for a period of six weeks after their husbands' deaths has met a very real need and has removed these people from the list of those who had to depend on home assistance.  We had the raising of the income limit for all the other social welfare payments and this brought more people into the net and it has reduced considerably the number of persons solely dependent on home assistance.</P>
    <P>Bit by bit the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary have reduced the number of persons who were dependent on home assistance.  While the old code remains, it will be necessary to introduce more Bills of this kind.</P>
    <P>We are very pleased that today the Parliamentary Secretary has honoured a pledge which he gave in 1974 and has introduced this measure.  No scheme is perfect but this is certainly a big step in the right direction and because of that I want to add my voice to those who have already given it a warm welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other Deputies in complimenting the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department and through them the Government on the progress that has been made in the entire field of social welfare and I welcome this Bill.  It is most desirable legislation.  It is good to see <Col N="1525" /> that the Department have got around to thinking in this new way about the problems of people who are poor and, we hope, temporarily in the under-privileged class.  It is a healthy philosophy to give these supplementary allowances a new description and a new heading.  This measure removes many of the anomalies we have had to contend with over the years.  Great strides have been made in the past two years by the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary in this field. Everybody is anxious to see people being well looked after, especially those who are not able to care for or look after themselves.</P>
      <P>A greater effort needs to be made to explain to a large percentage of the public who are themselves hard working and industrious the social philosophy of helping the underprivileged and those who temporarily cannot look after themselves.  I am glad to see that there are extra moneys being made available for supplementary welfare allowances and that every effort is being made to provide the maximum assistance for people who are unable to fully look after themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>At the same time, we need to look at the entire problem of social welfare assistance and the various schemes more in depth.  In many parts of the world we have examples of great strides and varying degrees of progress being made in the social welfare State.  There are many areas in many countries that we, having regard to our outlook on life and to our basic philosophy, would not wish to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the benefits and assistance but I would like to see them being raised to a higher extent.  Perhaps, too, we could request county councils to introduce direct labour works in order to offer people chances of obtaining work, whether on water or forestry schemes, so that they can become fully independent.  There is what has been referred to in many cases as the English disease where you have a small minority of people who would appear, by careful examination of the various schemes, to be able to work along much better than if they <Col N="1526" /> were employed in a job paying the minimum wage.  It is important to look on these kind of schemes and at the same time have regard to the minimum wage that is obtaining throughout the country.  Many workers and indeed the taxpayers are of the opinion that there might be greater supervision in areas of the dole and assistance.  There are a very small number of people who appear to be working full time while drawing benefits.  It is a disincentive to the people who are working hard full time and contributing their normal rates of taxation to see these other people enjoying, perhaps, a higher standard of living because of being in a position to draw unemployment benefit and being able to do nixers.  these are a small minority but they upset some people who find it difficult to meet their tax demands, their mortgages and their weekly social welfare contributions. However, I sympathise with all those people who find themselves unemployed for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>Many problems appear to arise and a lot of people take an unfortunate view of the farm dole.  The fact that some people presently qualifying for small farm dole appear to enjoy the trappings of a modest wealth is misunderstood by many people.  I would like to see the regulations being changed so that this category of deserving people would come under a wider-spread disadvantaged area type scheme. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might consider looking at the completely wider categories and endeavour to change the system radically.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the vast amount of work the Department undertake, every effort should be made to expedite adjudication on claims, especially in the case of widows.  While I welcome the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has for some time now continued the payment of whatever allowances were being paid to a family for the six weeks' period, there is always additional anxiety to widows until they get everything straightened out in their own names.  I would ask the Department to pay special consideration to this category of deserving cases.  Perhaps in the occasional unfortunate <Col N="1527" /> case where the husband and wife may not be hitting it off together, there should be an easier form of dividing the allowances.  It is important that where this happens there should be a simple and a very fast way of apportioning the allowances accruing to a family.  This is not a very common complaint but occasionally one comes across a situation like this.  I would hope that the people concerned would take a sympathetic view to such applications.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill is a very worthwhile and important one.  I hope that the people who will be putting it into force will use the fullest discretion possible.  It is important that the people for whom this provision is designed to help should get the maximum benefit from it.  There will be quite a number of people, perhaps disabled or retarded, and it is most desirable that they should get the maximum benefit from whatever assistance is made available to them.</P>
    <P>Under section 14 would it be possible to use the section to supplement the special reconstruction grants that are available to disabled categories of persons so that these people may be able to remain in their own homes even if these fall into disrepair?  It is very important to maintain people in their own homes for as long as possible and to assist them in every way.  It is rather difficult for a person living on a small income to be able to undertake repairs to any great extent.  Under section 14 I would hope that repairs to a house of a person qualifying under this Bill might be included.  Granted it would only be a once and for all contribution but nevertheless it would be an important one.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the home assistance officers.  Over the years these people have done a remarkable job with very limited funds.  I should hope we would have the closest co-operation and co-ordination between these officers and, perhaps, the public health nurses or people working full-time looking after people in all these categories.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the health boards are being given the task of <Col N="1528" /> operating the provisions of this Bill because this will allow for the maximum co-ordination of effort.  Through the general administration of these funds it should be possible to greatly assist the people who will qualify for this.  Unfortunately, in the past, and this has been said already on many occasions, supplementary allowances such as these have been given in a very niggardly fashion.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will insist that this kind of attitude towards the people who qualify under this Bill will be changed, that we will be able to sell the idea to the health boards, if they are to implement these provisions, that the people for whom these funds and assistance are intended have a right to the moneys that are set out in the Bill or under whatever regulations the Parliamentary Secretary may from time to time introduce.</P>
    <P>Again, I compliment Deputy Cluskey on the tremendous advances and great progress he has made in his Department since he was charged with responsibility for that office.  Over the last two years, with the many perhaps, novel provisions he has introduced, completely new headings under which he is paying assistance, he has taken a very brave step.  He has shown great Christian charity towards many categories of people who in the past Irish society was not too brave in recognising.  This has been long overdue in our society.  I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on introducing a great degree of justice and humanity in our social service structure. I wish him continued success in the valuable work he is doing.  I hope in so doing he will have the support of the entire House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long but I must compliment the Parliamentary Secretary for having introduced this Bill.  In the past home assistance carried a certain stigma because if a man was on home assistance that classified him among the poorer members of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was changed in 1939.  Before that it carried an even greater stigma when it was known as outdoor relief. We can all be very happy to learn that <Col N="1529" /> the change is coming gradually but surely to improve the dimensions of those payments and eliminate the stigma it carried.  The very words used to describe it were sufficient to classify some people among the poorer classes.</P>
    <P>When interviews were carried out, it was noticeable that more than a quarter of the people who had been interviewed denied they had been recipients of home assistance for no other reason than that they were ashamed to think that they were home assistance recipients.  With the change introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare and his Parliamentary Secretary we can look forward to a substantial increase in the amount of money being paid to those people. I congratulate both the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary on this.  The numbers involved in former days were considerable.  Later than 1939&mdash;30 years ago&mdash;we had 75,000 people in receipt of home assistance.  That meant there was a very heavy drain on the finances of the local authorities. The ratepayers had to meet a very heavy demand from the home assistance scheme.  We are, indeed, glad to note that it has come down to 30,000.  I can see this being reduced further because when the last budget was introduced, the position had improved considerably.  There were sections of our community included for benefit never before included.  At present there are people throughout the country receiving home assistance. Unfortunately, we have too many people today seeking unemployment benefit because of the unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>The number of old age pensioners has been increased considerably because such people are now eligible at 67 years of age.  We hope that in two years' time we will be able to grant them old age pensions at 65 years of age.  That must take very heavy pressure off the people who will have to administer the scheme we are now debating.</P>
    <P>We have also a large number of people who are in receipt of blind pensions.  There are pensions for single women.  Heretofore, many such people were ineligible for home assistance because <Col N="1530" /> they had lived with their father, mother or some invalid sister or brother and found themselves almost deserted later in life.  Today such people are eligible and receiving a comfortable allowance.  There are widows' pensions, Old IRA pensions, care allowances, deserted wife's allowances, children's allowances, disabled persons' allowances and so on.  This is bound to reduce the demand on this new supplementary welfare allowance. That is all for the better.  It will save a demand on the county councils.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise at this stage that I should like to see this scheme retained for administration by local authorities because quite an amount of power has been handed over to the regional health boards. This is a scheme where the elected representatives are very much in touch with the local authorities and with the officials who administer those schemes.  I should like to pay tribute to the home assistance superintendents and to the home assistance officers throughout the country for the trojan work they have done.  The further we go back on this scheme the more dedicated were the home assistance officers.  In those days we had roads of a very inferior type and transport was usually the bicycle.</P>
    <P>I know one home assistance officer who gave 38 years' service to the Leitrim County Council and for many years his bicycle was his only transport. He is alive and enjoying his pension today.  It is only right that we should pay tribute to those types of people and to the lads who are administering the scheme today.  The superintendents and the home assistance officers are men whom we can approach as county councillors or as TDs or whoever we may be.  We can discuss a problem with them.  That will not be the case if this scheme is handed over to the regional health boards.  I strongly urge on the Minister, if it is within his power, to retain that power and let it be left in the hands of the county councils.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan, the former Minister for Social Welfare, mentioned earlier about the number of people who are now being denied old age <Col N="1531" /> pensions and widows' pensions due to the means tests.  I cannot agree with that because I am on a pensions committee and at those committee meetings we usually sign old age pension allowances for a number ranging between 30 and 40 each month.  In almost all cases they qualify for the maximum allowance.  That speaks for itself.  Those people find little difficulty in many parts of the country today as far as the means test is concerned. They are free to have an income of £6 per week and get the maximum old age pension.  Many of those people who reach 67 are eligible and have no problems in getting the old age pension.  My experience is that we have a very considerable increase in the number qualifying today.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that the allowance to be allocated is certainly very generous to most people.  I remember in years gone by when times were not as good as they are today this money was given in shillings, not in pounds. It is good to see that the change has come.  As other speakers have said, all of us would like to see it being sent out to the recipients by cheque through the post.  I remember the time when those unfortunate people were lucky enough to get their small allowance but it meant that they were expected to travel a journey of eight or ten miles.  The home assistance officer usually used his good offices to have this money sent out to those people.</P>
    <P>According to the rules and regulations, those people were expected to travel to the centre where payment was due to them.  I know that under present circumstances and with the generous allowance that is being given, that will not be expected of those people in future.  Those people had to travel to town on a Thursday morning.  If they got seats in cars they were all right but if they did not they could not pay for car fares.</P>
    <P>In the past, of course, we must admit that home assistance was payable to an old age pensioner if he was able to prove that his circumstances were poor and that the old age pension was not able to maintain <Col N="1532" /> him.  Very rarely did old age pensioners get such an allowance.  They were not encouraged to apply for home assistance because it would be added to the rates.  If they had anything at all they were told they could not get home assistance.</P>
    <P>Everybody is very satisfied to see the name of this scheme being changed from home assistance because it certainly carried a stigma that most people did not like.  In conclusion, I should like to mention that recently I was told of widows who were notified that their pensions had ceased even though they are not old age pension age until well into July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McLaughlin, in concluding his remarks, said that he was sure that everybody would be glad to know that the name home assistance was changed to social welfare. In my view, there is not very much else changed.  I must admit that I was disappointed with this Bill.  I had hoped for much more fundamental changes in the system.  While I accept that there are some good points in the Bill, which I welcome, I am unhappy that the problem has not been tackled in the manner in which it might have been.  I fear that the measure was brought before the House before sufficient thought was given to it.  It makes one suspicious that it may have been rushed through here to counterbalance in some way measures which may be introduced on Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil administration were actively considering a measure to secure changes in the home assistance scheme for some time before leaving office.  A considerable amount of work was done on it by the then Minister for Social Welfare.  Over the past few years under both Administrations many categories of persons who were dependent entirely on home assistance were brought under the social welfare code directly.  For example, deserted wives and unmarried mothers.  This was a considerable improvement in that these people were then getting assistance as of right from the State, and the emphasis is on &ldquo;as of right&rdquo;. <Col N="1533" /> It did not necessarily mean they were much better off financially but the fact that they received their money through the post office by presenting their books was not only a change in the method of payment but also raised the status of the persons concerned. Those persons no longer had the feeling that they were getting something for which they had no real entitlement.  I was pleased with the changes made in this respect although it might not be, and very often was not, that the person benefited financially. Very often they got an equal amount under the old home assistance scheme as they got under the new dispensation, but because it was being given to them as of right their morale was boosted and their self-respect and status improved immensely.</P>
    <P>A greater effort should have been made in this Bill to give, as far as possible, the same consideration to those still dependent on home assistance as was given to those who had been on home assistance and who are now paid in a different fashion.  The vast changes that have taken place in people's attitudes to this matter since the poor law system was first instituted in 1838 are noteworthy.  At that time its purpose was to assist the destitute.  An interesting aspect I noted when doing research into this matter was that it was not particularly out of concern for the destitute that the money was being made available but rather to curb the number of beggars in an area and to remove what might be termed an irritant to the better off.</P>
    <P>From what I read in relation to this it did not appear that those who initiated it were particularly charitable. Their attitude was not anything like the attitude that people thankfully have today in relation to the same problem.  At that time the relief could only be obtained in what was then known as the &ldquo;workhouse&rdquo;.  It is probably from that that the words indoor relief came.</P>
    <P>Under the 1847 Act provision was made to grant relief outside the workhouse. This was mainly caused by the fact that there were so many people destitute as a result of the Famine <Col N="1534" /> that they probably had not sufficient institutions in which to put them all. Some time after the Famine they reverted to the old system of providing relief only in the workhouse.  In 1898 the newly formed county councils took over the administration of the poor law and the Public Assistance Act, 1939, consolidated all the existing legislation relating to public assistance.  We can all be thankful that the attitudes towards those who are less well off have changed so immeasurably over the years.  It is recognised that in the various Bills brought before this House over the years the attitudes of not only Parliament but of society generally have changed for the better.</P>
    <P>In the 1939 Act the Minister is expressly excluded from directing or withholding assistance in particular cases.  This, more or less, continued the system as it related to the Poor Law Commissioners.  There were probably good enough reasons for this but the effect of it appeared to be that it excluded the right of appeal. I am glad to note in this Bill that there is a right of appeal.  Up to now the decision as to whether a person would be entitled to home assistance or not depended on the decision of one man.  There was no appeal from this decision.  The effect of this could be seen by the fact that most of those who were refused home assistance tended to leave it at that and not go any further.  While I accept that the decisions made were in conformity with the regulation as laid down mistakes could be made and I am sure were made.  I welcome the fact that there is a right of appeal here but there is a difficulty in my view in relation to this.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that claims will be decided by the chief executive officers of health boards who may delegate their functions. That part is all right but I wonder if it is decided by the Minister to appoint another officer of the health board as the appeals officer what will the situation be where he has to decide on an appeal in relation to a matter already decided on by the chief executive officer of the health <Col N="1535" /> board?  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might let me know what the situation will be in relation to that aspect.  Another aspect in which the change made in the Bill will be helpful is in relation to a national standard of assessment.  Research shows that the poorer the area the less money was devoted to home assistance.  In that respect we will have more conformity but the amount permissible&mdash; for example, a person without a dependant will get up to £7.35&mdash;is much too low in present inflationary circumstances.  While I recognise that this amount is similar to that granted to a person on unemployment assistance nevertheless it is too low in respect of the home assistance and, equally, in respect of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>While I know that there are provisions in the Bill to permit the home assistance officer to make a higher amount available in special circumstances, the fear I have is that once a particular amount of money is accepted that will become the maximum as well as the minimum.  It is noteworthy that the amount that is at present payable to a person on home assistance in low circumstances is roughly the same as that which is laid down here in statutory form.  From research I did on this matter I find that the home assistance officers tend to make about that amount available, so that, here again from the financial point of view the recipient will not be any better off than he has been.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fact that most of the money will still come from the rates, I think that at a time when the general tendency is towards removing any further liabilities from rates this is a retrograde step.  It is one thing to say that the money all came from the rates previous to this, but the fact of the matter is we could say the same about many other aspects of the financial provisions for various things which at one time came from some other source and at present come from the Exchequer.  More consideration ought to have been given to providing a greater allocation from the <Col N="1536" /> Central Fund.  As it is, the ratepayers will still have to bear the same amount as they bear this year, plus 40 per cent of any increases that are given in the future.  When the general tendency is to accept that rates are not an equitable form of taxation, more consideration ought to have been given to transferring the cost to a much greater degree to the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of that particular matter that I should like to mention, and that is that in some counties where they took their responsibilities to heart, the amount of money available was relatively high while in others it was very low. I should like to know how the Department proposes to deal with this type of situation, because in so far as the rates are concerned those who did their job well in the past would, under this particular section, be penalised in the sense that they would only get 40 per cent over and above the expenditure of 1975, which might possibly be reasonably high, while another area would get 40 per cent over the extra expenditure on a basic sum which would be relatively low.  I should just like to know what is proposed in relation to that.</P>
    <P>The home assistance officers have little training for the kind of work they have to do.  It is very much to their credit that, taking a general view of the situation, they have worked the system as well as it has been worked. In the circumstances they have done an exceptionally good job.  I would like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that the officials themselves recognise the need for training and are very anxious that they should be given the opportunity to train.  Training in this very delicate field is a matter of vital importance.  Home assistance officers are dealing with groups of people who are in need and, in the main, are very sensitive as to their position.  Sympathetic consideration of their cases is essential, and to achieve this one must have a deep understanding of the various problems which confront people in this situation, and they should be trained on how to approach these problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> Very few people are happy to be in such circumstances as to need help, and a wrong approach can mean that the opportunity to provide psychological comfort as well as financial aid is lost.  Indeed, it can result in the person concerned withdrawing the application and continuing to exist in, perhaps, serious deprivation.  It should not be difficult to provide courses and refresher courses for existing officers and to lay down qualifications for future appointments which could ensure that well-trained social workers would be available and willing to enter this service and that the salaries of the home assistance officers would be commensurate with the very important work they do.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of those who are in receipt of, or in need of, home assistance are over 60 years of age and very many of them are unable to provide for themselves because of age or ill health.  A survey that I studied showed that a high percentage of the recipients were women, but I would take it that since the introduction of the special allowance for single women this number has been considerably reduced.  I should like to point out that in this survey it was noted that many of these women lived alone and were never visited and, in some instances, were visited by neighbours, but even some of them who had families of their own were never visited by members of the family.  Quite clearly there are many problems involved here which cannot be dealt with by the provisions of financial assistance alone.  In our so-called affluent society it is true to say that those who are living alone are more alone than even their counterparts were in previous generations.</P>
    <P>Another point that might be emphasised is that very often the loneliness of these people and the apparent neglect of them by society often forces them to adopt an aggressive attitude which is simply a protective shell and is often no indication at all of the real nature of the person underneath who is, very often, craving for sympathy and company. To the untrained eye this person is difficult, awkward and aggressive, but the trained person with the sympathetic approach can see underneath <Col N="1538" /> this crust and can often, by long and difficult endeavour, break it down and reveal the real person underneath and bring that person, as it were, back to life and perhaps, renew his place in humanity.</P>
    <P>As I say, the home assistance officers whom I know are very dedicated people, are doing an exceptionally good job in the circumstances but even they recognise that they must be trained which they are entitled to and which would enable them to do a very much more effective job.  No matter how good a natural bent a person may have in this direction, nevertheless, it can be very much improved by a proper course of training.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems we have always had in relation to home assistance relates to the means test.  An applicant for home assistance has to undergo a means test.  Here again a careful approach is vital, and very sympathetic consideration should be given to an application.  Very few people apply for home assistance for the purpose of getting easy money. The vast majority of applicants either have a very clear case or at least a case which is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary the fact that there are means tests for many different purposes&mdash;for medical cards, for differential rents, for non-contributory pensions, for unemployment assistance and for home assistance. Would it not be possible to rationalise this whole situation?  In many instances, the same person has to undergo a number of means tests. It would be to the advantage of everyone concerned if we could have some form of co-ordination.  If we did this we might find in many instances those who need to apply for home assistance had already undergone a means test for some other purpose.  In that eventuality it would be a kindness to the applicant if a previous means test were taken as sufficient.  Most of those in need of home assistance are in this situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the payment of home assistance, which has been mentioned by some other Deputies, <Col N="1539" /> the position is that in many instances particularly in towns, the people still have to queue up at the local dispensary for payment.  There is often no shelter at the dispensaries, some of which are relatively small.  There is no privacy and recipients of home assistance possibly need privacy more than any other facility.  In the vast majority of cases, they are there for home assistance through no fault of their own.  They are deserving of and perhaps more entitled to a sympathetic approach than their more fortunate neighbours.  For that reason it is essential that this aspect of home assistance be reviewed immediately.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why people who are on home assistance for quite a considerable time and quite obviously will be for the rest of their lives should not get payment in the same manner as those who are now fortunate enough to be in receipt of social welfare from other sources but who, at one time, were in need of home assistance themselves.</P>
    <P>A dietitian should be appointed in each area to draw up a proper diet for particular categories of people eligible for home assistance&mdash;people in ill-health, people unemployed, with families and so on.  The cost of food should be the first priority.  Other needs should then be taken into consideration&mdash;the need for warmth, clothes and so on.  All of these things should be considered in coming to a decision on the amount of money they ought to be paid and should be based on the cost of these various matters.  We should also concern ourselves about including some little luxury to be purchased out of the total amount of money that is necessary to cover the various matters I mentioned.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that according to research done in urban areas one in four people would not admit that they were in receipt of home assistance. I came across that matter myself and would assume that we were both studying the same document.  We have to face up to the fact that home <Col N="1540" /> assistance has not a particularly pleasant face.  It is our duty to try and improve the appearance of that face.  From what I have seen of the Bill, it is not likely to go anything like as far as I would like it to.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, a number of social welfare benefits and allowances operated by the Department of Social Welfare have taken the place of home assistance; nevertheless a considerable number of those in need of help are still dependent on home assistance and many more are in receipt of home assistance to supplement their incomes. Very often their income consists of some money from the State.  The importance of home assistance in the lives of many of our people is obvious and so is the need to change the situation where so many are in receipt of payment to which they have no positive right, such as they have in relation to social welfare benefits.  People who find themselves in such a situation are below the poverty line.  If we are serious in efforts to accord to them the dignity which is the right of every human being then we must not only increase the income but change the procedures that go with it.</P>
    <P>We have also the problem of inflation at present to contend with.  When prices were relatively stable it was at least possible to decide on a figure which would bear a reasonable relation to prices.  While it is far from saying that the amounts made available were sufficient, it was possible to make some assessment of the situation. But with prices constantly rising at a very rapid rate, and hitting those with low incomes, it is vitally necessary that we should decide on an amount which will at least keep the recipient of home assistance in reasonable comfort.  I do not think the amounts specified in the table in the Bill are sufficient for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the home assistance scheme should remain flexible.  If the approach to a scheme of this kind is too legalistic it defeats its purpose and the efforts to help those in need can be frustrated. Claimants have a right and this right is not just a legal right : they have social rights as well.  They have rights <Col N="1541" /> as people, and it is true that society has often tended to forget these people simply because they happen to be poor in the way very often we tend to regard a person whom we do not know very well who is severely physically handicapped to be mentally handicapped as well and to treat him as such, even though the facts might be that our own intellects might fade into insignificance compared with his.  Similarly, the strength of character of a person who has the misfortune to be poor may be something which those who look down on them might never hope to aspire to. Therefore, what I would be anxious to achieve is that we would have a humane approach to this matter.  Because of my feeling in relation to the necessity that this scheme be flexible, I have some doubts about the list of payments described in the Bill.  The fact that the same payments are prescribed for home assistance recipients says nothing for them because I have always regarded these payments as being too low in the present inflationary situation.  I feel therefore that laying down these levels in the Bill will mean, as I said before, that they can easily become the maximum as well as the minimum payments.  While I accept that there are discretionary powers in the Bill relating to the granting of higher amounts, our experience shows that this is very often the exception.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that the operation of the home assistance scheme would remain flexible so that it could be possible to make payments in particular circumstances which would be over and above the amounts which are laid down in the tables in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill must be seen as a further step in the National Coalition's ongoing battle with poverty. This might have been welcomed by the Opposition at this time of special hardship. Those of us who are in public life, especially those of us in Dáil Éireann, come across very sad cases of people in poor circumstances day after day.  We are only too well aware of the attitude that has been adopted right through the 19th and 20th centuries on the part <Col N="1542" /> of Government in relation to those who needed our help most with the help of the social welfare services of this State.  The <i>laissez faire</i> attitude of the 19th century continued on to the 20th century has been one which looked upon poverty as something wrong and something which should be blamed on the person involved.  This of course is not true and never was.</P>
      <P>The whole House welcomes this Bill which has enshrined in it that a person has an entitlement to money by right rather than by the benevolence of some social welfare officer.  Far too many times I have gone into houses, either by request or to canvass to find people living in circumstances which would shame any person in this House.  We still have many people living in hovels. They should not be allowed to live in them at all.  They are damp, falling down, the sanitary conditions have long been condemned.  They live on an income most undeserving of any Christian Government.  It may be too late for a Christian country such as Ireland to move as we are moving.  We should have tackled the problem of the real poor years ago.  The real poor need our help now more than ever because of the inflation raging in the country.  We seem to be still hesitant in tacking their problems.  We still seem to be slow to move in and to really eradicate them.</P>
      <P>Now and again it is reported in the newspapers where a person has starved to death in Ireland.  I know many people who are living below the poverty line, below the level of income which is necessary to maintain health.  We have made some such small progress.  We have given free electricity to old age pensioners and we have given single women's allowances.</P>
      <P>One of the Government's main achievements to date has been their thought on poverty.  This Bill is another move in that direction and is one which strikes at the whole philosophy of poverty.  The central theme of the Bill is stated quite clearly in section 2.  That section states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, every person in the State <Col N="1543" /> whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and the needs of any adult or child dependent of his shall be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>The assistance officers throughout the country have done a good job.  It has been a thankless job up to now because they were the sole arbiters and the sole judges of who should or should not get money.  The task is not an enviable one and I am sure they welcome this Bill where people's rights are correctly enshrined in our legislation with the right of appeal to a second authority.  This Bill is an attempt to ensure that every person and family in the State will have a minimum weekly income which will help them to maintain some kind of living standard.  As the last speaker has said, the weekly supplementary welfare allowances in the Bill are not high by any means.  Indeed, I would doubt whether they are sufficient to maintain a person above the poverty line but I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will see to it that they are changed when it is obvious that they need to be changed.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a flexible one.  It provides that the Minister may make an order under section 10 subsection (3) which can change the rates of allowance. I am confident that he would not hesitate to use this clause, if necessary.  The Bill empowers the health board authorities to be very flexible in their approach whether the payment be on a weekly basis or a once-only payment in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am wondering why the responsibility for the administration of this scheme is to be placed on the health boards.  I would prefer that it be operated by the Department of Social Welfare because the health boards, to a certain extent, are local organisations. The Department are more anonymous and less open to public scrutiny. The Bill could have provided an opportunity for the Government to reorganise the Department of Social Welfare and, perhaps, to rename it as Department of Health and Social Security.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> Many of the recipients of home assistance are wives of husbands who are drunkards or, maybe, drug addicts. I want the assurance of the Parliamentary Secretary that where necessary the allowances will be paid, either in kind or in money, to the mother of the household as opposed to the legal head of the household.  It is very important that the money be channelled to the person who needs it most and who has most control over the standard of living or the management of the family.</P>
    <P>We are still a matriarchal society in many ways.  It is the mother who, time and again, keeps the family together in very needy and humiliating circumstances where the father of the household is not, in effect, the manager of the family.  It is very important that the Bill ensures that the mother will get the money where and when this is necessary.  The question of the administration of this is important because there has been a system in existence whereby the local assistance officers had a depth of knowledge and information which they used widely and in accordance with the direction of the scheme.  I expect that the existing officers and staff who administered the home assistance scheme will be transferred to the health boards with all the necessary protection of the pension and status rights they have under the present structure.  It is important that there will be no radical change in this respect and that no one suffers because of the introduction of the Bill. There is need for a change in the philosophy in the administration of the scheme and, perhaps, it is a good opportunity of changing the premises where the allowances will be paid.  It is correct and proper that people should be allowed go to offices, not wholly connected with the supplementary welfare allowances but offices which deal with the other schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare and by the health boards.</P>
    <P>I say this because it is essential in getting rid of the atmosphere of receiving something as a gift or as something to which people are not <Col N="1545" /> entitled.  It is important to remove the atmosphere which at present surrounds the payment of home assistance. In changing the philosophy and the central core of our approach to this problem there is a very good case for ensuring that the places where the scheme will be administered will be modern and can be associated with many other schemes.  If the Bill were to be operated by the Department, it could have been merged with the administration of existing schemes and would allow the Parliamentary Secretary to develop thoroughly his policy in relation to social care and security.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting aspects in relation to the war on poverty is the national committee on pilot schemes to combat poverty.  This committee have very interesting, urgent and desirable work to do.  I hope they will be given the necessary moneys to carry out an examination and analysis of the problem and the in-depth study which is needed to help us get to the root of the problem. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, and indeed the Government, will act on its recommendation because the Government have a strong will to combat poverty.  I hope the Government will not shirk their responsibility in tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>The last speaker discussed the question of the training of assistance officers&mdash;a very valid point.  There is an on-going need for adequate training of assistance officers and for the continuing re-training of officers in the field.  We have much to learn from the experience of richer countries.  We should not hesitate to send our assistance officers to England, France or America to learn how they tackle their poverty problems.  We can learn a lot from other countries.  We always have been, and I trust always will be intelligent enough to learn from other people's mistakes.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless the question remains as to how much a person needs.  I would not accept that if a person had the maximum allowance under the Bill his needs would be met adequately.  I would rather regard the maximum allowances as being something of an emergency measure to get a person <Col N="1546" /> over a short period before he would be properly dealt with by another of the State's schemes.  This is the intention of the Bill.  I have genuine reservations about the amounts of money provided for in the Bill because we are dealing with very genuine poverty cases.  If one examines the figures involved I do not think they would be of much help to very genuine cases and would fall short of what is needed.</P>
    <P>It was said in relation to other schemes, such as the redundancy payments scheme and the unemployment benefits scheme, that in certain cases the incentive to work has been overcome by the high continuing level of unemployment benefit, plus redundancy payments.  I have heard the argument put very forcibly on a number of occasions by very responsible people, employers and others.  It is difficult to assess the strength of the argument.  I do not think we should create schemes which do away with the incentive to work.  On the other hand, we have a responsibility to ensure that people who are not working and who want to work have a sufficient income to ensure that they and their families live in a reasonable standard of living.  We must balance both sides of the question.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that some people who live on social welfare payments do not want to work.  Whether they should be punished or pitied is another valid question.  When a person reaches a stage in life where he does not want to work, where he does not want to do anything&mdash;perhaps he wants to drink or walk around the town all day&mdash;and has grown cynical about everything, he is more to be pitied than criticised because a waste of one's talents is something of which every person is aware whether it be intentional or not. I have heard arguments that the State should initiate compulsory working schemes.  I do not think I could support that attitude.  The integrity of a human being is very much damaged by looking on him as somebody to be punished.  In a Christian community I do not think we should try to punish people who, obviously, have suffered a very demoralising decrease in their standard of living and in incentive to work, whether on a temporary or permanent <Col N="1547" /> basis.  They are more to be pitied and helped&mdash;I mean helped in a very practical way&mdash;in overcoming their mental state.  The Department of Social Welfare should be more active in seeking out the reasons why people do not want to work, why we have if you like, long-term unemployment recipients in our society.  Perhaps society is to blame.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would say a few words about this whole question because it is a very live one, and one which is not being tackled.  Perhaps it is one which the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty should examine in depth.  We owe it to these people to examine their plight and to help them in any way possible to become active, and to want to become active, to get employment and realise their importance to their families and to the society in which they live.</P>
    <P>The remaining point I want to make is that the Minister foresees the payments under the scheme increase from £2 million to perhaps £4.5 million.  I am not sure if that is exact or merely an estimate the Parliamentary Secretary gave.  Not only will the present level of expenditure which the local authorities are undertaking have to be met in future years, but 40 per cent of any increase in the expenditure under the scheme will also have to be met by the local authorities.  I do not know if this is wise.  The rates system is one which is seen to be inequitable. This Government are trying to reduce and to mitigate its effectiveness.  Unfortunately their attempts to do so have not been altogether successful because of inflation.  Therefore, I wonder at the wisdom of allowing local authorities to continue financing the scheme to such an extent.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point I wish to make which is of a technical nature. Under section 27 of the Bill there is power to remove difficulties.  The Minister may &ldquo;with the sanction of the Minister for Finance and the consent of the Minister for Health by order do anything which appears to be necessary or expedient for bringing this Act into operation and any such order may <Col N="1548" /> modify the provisions of this Act&rdquo;.  I wonder at the legal correctness of this. Can an order modify the provisions of an Act of Parliament?  I doubt very much the legality or the wisdom of it. If the Act is to be an Act of Parliament an order cannot modify the Act. I feel that the Act should be supreme. However, it may be a matter of interpretation but it struck me as most unusual, to say the least of it.</P>

I we come the change in philosophy which ensures that a person has by right an entitlement to an income.  I look on the Bill as a step in the on-going battle against poverty.  As the Minister says this is only a beginning in the National Coalition Government's fight to mitigate the effects of real poverty which can be seen in every city, village and on many farms throughout the country.  It is a step to mitigate the gnawing disease of poverty.  It is also a step to ensure that man's dignity is seen to prevail and that the system is not superior to the man, that the system serves mankind. The Parlimentary Secretary is to be complimented on his foresight in introducing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House but I would like to say a few words on this Bill, particularly because it is one that is very important to all public representatives and in particular to members of local authorities, county councils, urban councils and health boards.  I regret very much that before this Bill was presented in this House we had not a system similar to the one that was planned by the Minister for Health, when the Health Act of 1970 was first introduced, whereby he went to each county council and had a discussion at the table of a council meeting with the members of the local authority and got their views on the problems <Col N="1549" /> they saw in health services.  This home assistance compares with the health services.  It is a very local problem.  It is local to county councillors and members of urban councils.</P>
      <P>I note in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief that there are still ten local authorities who have decided not to have home assistance administered by the health boards.  The reason for that I imagine is because members of county councils, as far as home assistance and as far as the Health Act are concerned, feel that it is a very human problem.  I disagree completely with the provisions in this Bill where the administration of home assistance will be handed over to the health boards because we must look at home assistance as a fire brigade system, in other words where the Department of Social Welfare, due to the fact that the certificate has not arrived, because somebody forgot to post a cheque to somebody in receipt of unemployment benefit or for some other reason a man, his wife and his family are denied on whatever day they are supposed to receive it their unemployment benefit from the local exchange, they have to go to the home assistance officer for money.  That is what I mean by a fire brigade service.  That is why it should be as local as we as legislators can make it.  A health board, whether it be the South Eastern Health Board or the Eastern Health Board, is too big a unit and the CEO of a health board is too far removed from the ordinary people of his area.  It is the county manager, the county secretary, the chief superintendent assistance officer who should be dealing with it.  They are the people who are near to a county councillor, who can pick up a telephone and possibly for a 4p call at his own expense ring the county secretary or the chief executive officer. When you think of the South Eastern Health Board, the Midland Health Board and so on you are getting further and further away from the people.  With home assistance you must be closer to the people. The public representatives understand the problem of home assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> No doubt there are wonderful things in this Bill, as far as trying to get away from the stigma of home assistance is concerned.  The stigma of home assistance is probably the reason why this Bill was introduced.  At the moment it is only a support service for the social welfare.  I will be critical of the Department of Social Welfare.  I know very well that because you have 103,000 unemployed and because of pay-related benefits, national health benefits, unemployment benefits, occupational injuries benefits and all the different benefits that have been introduced in this House certain problems can arise.  How many Deputies in this House will agree that every week they have to pick up their telephones from their constituencies to ring up to say that Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Murphy, Jim Murphy or Tom Murphy have not got their national health benefit, their occupational injuries benefit or something like that? They may get a reply on the telephone saying that the particular person will have a cheque tomorrow morning.  If this person does not get the cheque the next morning he will probably have to telephone the local home assistance officer, and he will give money.  You have all this administration then that when he gets his national health cheque or unemployment benefit part of it has to be paid back to the local authority.  That is the support service for the social welfare problem.</P>
    <P>Another point that I would like to mention is the fact that under the Health Act of 1970, thank God, we got away from the situation where the person in receipt of disabled persons' maintenance allowance had to wait for the home assistance officer to call with the cash.  Today the health boards are sending out by cheque these benefits similar to the way a person receives his national health cheque.  I can see no reason, whether this Act is administered by the county council, as I think it should be, or by the health boards why it should not be paid by cheque, particularly in rural areas, because a home assistance officer generally speaking calls to the local dispensary.  Again, Mrs. Murphy <Col N="1551" /> or Mrs. Jones has probably to walk two or three miles or cycle two or three miles to get her home assistance money.  I hope that situation will change and that they will get their cheques the same as anybody else.  I hope we can do away with the stigma we have always associated with home assistance.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should ask local authorities when a person, who owns a vested cottage, and perhaps 30 or 40 years ago was paid £15 home assistance by the county council dies and leaves the cottage to a nephew or niece, to burn the records of that payment and not send bills to the person who gets the cottage. It is a disgrace to administration to have that happening in 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my remarks by paying a well deserved tribute and compliment to the Parliamentary Secretary for the amount of work he has done in his short period of office.  He has shown that he is personally committed to this anti-poverty and social injustice war.  He has revitalised the Department of Social Welfare and has introduced reform legislation in connection with social welfare schemes.  Our people value his worth and his contribution to the battle to eliminate poverty.  We look forward to further social improvements.  At the end of this Government's term in office, we will have gone a long way towards eradicating poverty and social injustices.</P>
      <P>Tribute must also be paid to the officers in the Department of Social Welfare.  I should like to compliment the clerical staff of the Department.  We all realise the big number of people in receipt of social welfare allowances and benefits and the vast number of cheques issued daily and weekly. Naturally, an odd mistake is made and a recipient is left without his cheque on occasions.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the last speaker that on Holy Thursday the officers of the Department of Social Welfare did not take a free day because had they done so thousands of social welfare recipients would have been without their cheques that week. I should like to put on the record of the House the debt we owe them for their attention to duty.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be associated with the Government that introduced this Bill, especially as it removes the last vestige of the poor law.  The home assistance system conjures up in our minds something akin to the term &ldquo;poor house&rdquo;. It is one of the most hated terms in rural Ireland.  The recipients of home assistance are conscious of the stigma that attaches to it.  If this legislation did nothing more than remove these words &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo; from our social welfare code I would welcome it.  It is doing much more; it is giving to each of our citizens a basic and minimum standard of living.  The fear of dying in poverty, of being left totally without any income need not be held any longer by any of our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the allowances may be meagre and possibly they will be increased with each subsequent budget, but, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, this is a starting point.  Down through the years our home assistance officers have been much maligned. Like the Parliamentary Secretary I should like to pay tribute to these officers who worked an archaic, Victorian system that was meant for the last century to the best of their ability with limited funds.  No standards were set, no standards of pay with eligibility varying from area to area.  Despite all these handicaps our social assistance officers in the past worked this system conscientiously and, as a result, those in dire need got some minimum allowance. There were some home assistance officers, I suppose, who availed of their <Col N="1553" /> position for political reasons.  That is human nature.  We all know some of those but by and large the home assistance officers have given a service to our poor and we owe them a debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>This is a reform piece of legislation. It removes from our social welfare system the term &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo; and the term &ldquo;home assistance officer&rdquo;, and we welcome that.  In its implementation I hope our social workers, particularly those involved in voluntary social work in the community, will get more involved.  They are complementary to each other.  The person in need of home assistance is often in need of other assistance.  I hope that side by side with the new officer we will have the public welfare nurse and others who are there to give advice, perhaps to a young harassed housewife who is unable to manage. We could include a home economist who would advise such a housewife as to the proper management of her home.  I hope we will have a wider look at the system and incorporate the social services, social workers, all the voluntary groups, so that we can get the best return for the moneys used.</P>
    <P>I hope that this scheme is well publicised so that those in need will know of their entitlements.  Those most in need are often not aware of their full entitlements.  All Deputies have come up against the position where a person was unaware of his or her entitlements.  I hope that our public health nurses, all our voluntary groups and our community groups, will be given this information so that they in turn can feed it back to the home assistance officer.</P>
    <P>Speakers expressed the fear that we were going too far in our social welfare benefits.  All Deputies, I have no doubt, have come up against this. People claim that the incentive to work has been reduced or completely removed.  No later than today I was speaking to an employer who said his workman did not turn in last Monday. The employer mentioned it to his employee.  The employee said he would be better off on social welfare. <Col N="1554" /> It is a pity that that attitude should be adopted.  I suppose our taxpayers are concerned that people no longer have the desire to work and they do not feel it is worth their while to work.  If the margin between social welfare allowances and a worker's wage is being continually reduced, almost equated, then the people will not work.</P>
    <P>I cannot truthfully say that all the cases that have been referred to me are genuine cases, but no matter what system or what welfare allowance is introduced you will always find a person who will abuse it.  Perhaps our Parliamentary Secretary would try to ensure that those who receive social welfare benefits are entitled to them and cut out those who are availing of it without entitlement.  No one will deny that more should be done for the really needy, but what is causing a certain amount of anxiety is that ablebodied men who are capable and can work but have not the incentive to work are now drawing unemployment assistance and perhaps in the meantime doing what is known as a &ldquo;nixer&rdquo; job.  At the end of the week such a man is much better off financially than his hard-working neighbour who has to get up in the morning and work hard and diligently all day until 6 in the evening.  These are some of the pitfalls, and I know that our Parliamentary Secretary is fully aware of that.  I suppose it is better that one deserving client should get what he is entitled to even if four or five non-deserving recipients abuse it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps our Parliamentary Secretary would give that point his attention to ensure that those who are in receipt of any social welfare benefit or allowance are entitled to it.  I think our Irish people will accept that and would even wish that higher rates be given to the deserving people if the undeserving recipients would be eliminated.  I mention that because it has been drawn to my attention that we as a government are going too far in our social welfare benefits.  The position having been explained to those who are very critical of it, I hope they will see the justice of our case.  I have no doubt that the <Col N="1555" /> Parliamentary Secretary when replying will refer to that and allay the doubts and suspicions of the hardpressed taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Bill, I would like to see better facilities in these centres.  When a young mother or young married man approaches a home assistance officer it is often on a very personal level.  He would not like his private and personal matters overheard and a little room should be set aside, each person in turn being interviewed by the home assistance officer and the whole problem discussed with the discretion it deserves. In some cases it is impossible with no accommodation available.  I would like all the services to be housed as far as possible in one building, so that if the home assistance officer thought fit he could refer a particular case to a public health nurse or some other social worker or voluntary worker who would try to solve the problems of that person.  Criticism has come from the other side of the House about giving these matters to the local regional board to manage.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary. Perhaps in areas it is a bit unwieldy, but I myself cannot find fault with it. At least health boards are more central to the areas concerned and perhaps more accessible and are not quite as fussy with files as the Department of Social Welfare.  I trust that by taking it under the charge of the local health boards home assistance can be worked out satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The issuing of cheques is a more dignified method of payment.  There is something demeaning about paying out actual cash.  To hand money to a person puts him in the same class as a beggar or a recipient of charity. There is a little more pride in receiving a cheque than in being handed cash.</P>
    <P>There are some sections, especially section 13 (2), where there is provision for meeting sudden and urgent need.  That is a very valuable subsection because often an unexpected death arises, or a debt, and it is a once-and-for-all situation.  It will be <Col N="1556" /> much more helpful to everyone concerned. Section 14 says that an allowance shall be paid to a person by way of a single payment to meet an exceptional need.  I welcome those two sections because they introduce flexibility whereby the home assistance officer can give an allowance to meet a particular problem.  That is the mentality we should have with regard to any future legislation, to leave a certain discretion to the officer in charge to meet a family crisis or a particular situation.  I welcome those two sections.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like again to welcome this Bill, especially a clause in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech when he said that this allowance should be available as of right.  That sums up the whole philosophy behind this Bill: that people should have a right and need not go cringing or bowing to local home assistance officers.  If they qualify on the means test they have a right to this money and it is not given at a whim or at the discretion of the home assistance officers.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government on their on-going fight against poverty and social injustice. With the Parliamentary Secretary so committed to solving the social problems we have in our country, I have no doubt that this is only a prelude to further progressive legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very good discussion on this Bill.  I recall that in my speech last year on the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare, I said that in order to tackle some of the social injustices in our society it was necessary that full and open and, at times, controversial discussion should take place.  I am very encouraged by the general level of the debate and informed comments that we have had during the Second Reading.  There are some exceptions but, in general, I think we have had a very informed and concerned discussion.  Some were extremely good contributions, and two of them come from the far side of <Col N="1557" /> the House, from Deputy Callanan and Deputy Tunney.  I also think that the contribution of Deputy Esmonde on this side of the House was a very constructive contribution and one that was the result of considerable thought in the whole area of home assistance and the way it has operated and the great need for a reform of the Home Assistance Act.</P>
      <P>As I said, there were some exceptions. In the main, Deputies did not try to play politics with the Bill.  Their approach was one of concern and they were objective in their comments. They expressed their unreserved welcome for the reform embodied in the Bill, which does remove the old poor law approach, the last vestige of the poor law in the area of social welfare. In my opening remarks, I also said that I regarded this as a beginning and not an end, and it is true to say that while I rightly regard this as a major step in the Government's programme for a comprehensive social welfare assistance code and as a very necessary first step in the fight against poverty, it is only a beginning.</P>
      <P>Contributions broke down into two classes.  I regret to say, some of the more senior Deputies on the far side of the House, who held office in the previous Administration, did play politics with the Bill.  I should like to reply on two levels.  I must answer some of the political charges that were made but at the same time I am anxious that the major part of my reply would be concerned with those Deputies who did show concern and did successfully endeavour to be objective in their approach.  I shall confine the vast bulk of my reply to them.  I am going to deal with some of the political comment that was made and the accuracy or otherwise of that comment from the far side of the House.  I am doing so particularly because most of it came from people who had direct responsibility in this area of social welfare and who did nothing in this area over 16 unbroken years in office.  They come in here now and try to distort the actual proposals in an effort to justify their total neglect in this area over that long period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1558" /> Deputy Brennan, the former Minister for Social Welfare up to March, 1973, told us that he was disappointed in the Bill; that the Bill did not go far enough; that he would envisage a much wider concept in relation to this area; that he would have introduced a Bill that would have had far more generous provisions than those in this Bill.  Honestly, it is extremely hard to sit here and take that from a man who was Minister for Social Welfare for a considerable number of years and who did absolutely nothing in this area during all those years.</P>
    <P>The occasion of the introduction of this legislation dealing with home assistance is the first time since 1939 that any such legislation has been introduced into this House, and yet we have this kind of comment from a man who was directly responsible in that particular area.  This Bill is repealing an Act that has been considerably criticised over the years.  It has been criticised by everyone and anyone who has any connection with people who, through force of circumstances, were obliged to resort to home assistance.  It has been criticised by politicians inside and outside this House.  It has been criticised by social workers.  It has been criticised by clergy.  It has been criticised by recipients. As a matter of fact, it would be very difficult to find any category or group of persons who have not over all those years criticised that Act. All that criticism, all the defects, all the humiliations that were involved for people who had to resort to that service were unknown, apparently, to Deputy Brennan and some of his colleagues until he went into Opposition. If going into Opposition brought home to those gentlemen the light of the injustices that were inherent in that Act it was well worth their while going over there.  God knows, it was worth our while putting them over there.</P>
    <P>I sat here today and I listened to speakers, former Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Administration, talking about the large numbers of unemployed we have in this country.  We know that and I accept that there are <Col N="1559" /> exceptionally high numbers of people, unfortunately, unemployed.  But even by their tone of voice, never mind the content of their contributions, one would think that they had handed <Col N="1560" /> over to this Government a situation in which we enjoyed full employment.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 25th June, 1975.</P>
