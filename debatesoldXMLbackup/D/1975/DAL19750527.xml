      <P>In respect of No. 4, the motion seeking approval for the terms of the Agreement for Joint Financing of North Atlantic Ocean Stations, I understand it was agreed with our spokesman on foreign affairs that this be taken today as it was noncontroversial. The Taoiseach has a propensity for going to sea and bringing the Dáil with him.  I would like him to accept a reservation from me on taking that item at 2 p.m., pending the matter being cleared&mdash;we have not yet seen a copy of the agreement &mdash;and ensuring that it is not controversial.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £177,022,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants. and certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&mdash;(Minister for Health.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to speak on this Estimate, which gives us the opportunity of pointing out the fundamental differences between our policies and the policy pursued by the Coalition.  In his speech the Minister said that he had determined some major priorities.  Among those priorities he lists the provision of free hospital care for all.  This is a socialistic pipedream catering for a concept rather than for the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the face of last year's difficulties he must now agree that this is neither attainable nor desirable.  To pursue this any further can only be termed ministerial madness.  Perhaps this is not entirely the Minister's fault.  Perhaps <Col N="757" /> some of the blame can be laid at the door of the officials in his Department but that is hardly likely. In my view this blame can only rest on the Minister because this is one of his priorities and I am sure his officials have been told to bring it about, if possible.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to point out the even tenor and the results obtained during the term of office of his predecessor and the good relations which existed at that time between the nursing staff and all involved in medicine and the Department.  Much of that has been lost.  Needless to say much of the fault of the present <i>impasse</i> must rest with the Minister.  We must compare the certainty and guidelines laid down by the late Erskine Childers, the setting up of the health boards and the fact that people knew where they were going and how they would get there, with the uncertainty that exists today.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to belabour the Minister personally for I have always found him approachable, human and helpful.  The policy at present pursued in the face of difficulties, the frightful expense it would involve and the experience gained from other countries, where a free-for-all medical scheme is available, should be a salutary lesson for any Minister.  We should pursue not what other countries have tried and failed but what will suit the needs and pockets of this country.</P>
    <P>We realise that there is a limit to the amount of money available and hope that the best possible use will be made of it.  Maybe the services we are now giving to our GMS cardholders are not all we would like but the people who are not so well off and those just outside the limit of the GMS card who suffer hardship and anxiety trying to make provision for the rainy day from scarce resources are the people we should help first. Why should we provide free hospital treatment for even the very rich, if they do not want it?  The Government's priorities are seen to be wrong here.  When I wished to point out to people the difference between the Government and Fianna Fáil, this is one of the items I point to as a glaring example of the defects in the <Col N="758" /> Government's priorities.  I am positive the Irish people feel the same.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey had a Private Members' motion and many Deputies spoke on it.  I am confident that the pleas we made then had the support of the Irish people in this matter.  When people's GMS cards come up for review, in many cases they are cancelled and when the matter is brought to the notice of public representatives and when pleas are made to have the thing re-examined, it is frequently found that card holders have been on short time and have not the same earning power as they had, and they get their cards back.  The point is that the cards should never have been cancelled.</P>
    <P>According to the Eastern Health Board's guidelines, even agricultural labourers and county council road workers could be left out.  I am sure this is something nobody intended when the free GMS scheme was introduced. It is possible that a husband, wife and child, with total earnings of not more than £27 per week, would find themselves outside the category. All will agree that £27 does not go very far.  It is, therefore, essential that the Minister would extend the scope of the service.  I could quote many examples of hardship.  The hallmark of a good Government is sometimes their willingness to admit a mistake or an error in judgment and rectify it.  They should be prepared to admit that a policy they were pursuing was not right and they would correct it.</P>
    <P>There is another frightful anomaly to which I wish to draw attention.  It is the gap between national school leavers&mdash;children are now leaving national schools at 12 years&mdash;and post-primary pupils at the age of 16 in the matter of free medical and dental treatment. Children leaving the national school at 12 cease to be qualified and do not again qualify until they are 16 years, when they are able to get medical cards.  Many pupils between the ages of 12 and 16 years are denied treatment, particularly dental, at a time in their young lives when they are most vulnerable and when caries are most rampant.  It is madness that such an anomaly should exist.</P>
    <P>Since the arrival of free post-primary education and automatic blanket promotion <Col N="759" /> in national schools, the age of primary leaving has been reduced by at least two years.  Pupils who formerly would have stayed in national schools until 13½ or 14 years now leave those schools for secondary and vocational courses as young as 12 years and sometimes even 11.  At that age they are most vulnerable, as I said earlier, and because of this hiatus between the ages of 12 and 16 they are denied dental examination and treatment&mdash;they are cut off from such services for four years.  This could damage their health in the future.  Dentists and others to whom I have spoken feel that this four years of neglect can undermine the health of our children, that the damage done in those years can never be repaired.  I raised this anomaly by way of parliamentary question and pointed out that this gap should be bridged immediately.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of dentists, the Minister will have to look into the scarcity of dentists in the public service. It is very difficult to recruit dentists and because of that, dental examinations of children which should be held at least yearly in the national schools are sometimes not held at all until after many children have left those schools.  There is, therefore, no preventive treatment for those children, the only work apparently being carried out is extractions.  It is essential that an all-out effort be made to recruit dentists into the public service. The dental schools are turning out a sufficient number of dentists but many of them go abroad for experience.  It is hard to blame them because any town to which a young dentist might go to seek to earn a living seems to be full of people in private practice.</P>
    <P>In County Kildare there are 15,000 national school children and it is estimated that six dental surgeons would be needed to give them adequate service. In fact, we have one dental officer for the county and three assistants. There are 15,000 medical card holders in the county and as well there are 1,000 students from Maynooth University who have now been included in the dental programme.  In other words, four dental officers are <Col N="760" /> endeavouring to take care of 31,000 people when 12 would be needed.  The result is that children are being neglected.  If children are to be looked after properly, extra dental surgeons will have to be appointed and the conditions will have to be made right for them.  If it were the case that electricians, plumbers or stenographers were not available we would get them from outside the country, as we have done, if there was special need.  It is just because this is a soft area, an area which is not of great political consequence, that the matter is being neglected.  If a similar situation existed in any other branch of the public service or private service there would be an outcry.  The need exists for more dentists.  The present conditions are not conducive to attracting dentists into the public service. The idea that he would be able only to touch the tip of the iceberg and would never be able to get down to fundamentals would be intolerable to anyone who wished to do his job well and to fulfil himself in it.</P>
    <P>Anyone who enlists as a dentist in the public service must feel a frightful sense of frustration.  No dentist would like to spend his life in such frustrating circumstances, where he would have to confine himself to doing extractions and to dealing with cases that should never have been allowed to deteriorate to the extent that they have, never having any hope of carrying out preventive treatment because of the huge waiting list for treatment. I hope the Minister will take note of what I have said in regard to this matter.  It is time that a change was brought about in the dental service.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Minister has taken notice of a recommendation from the recent IMA seminar in Waterford to the effect that the Dentists Act, 1929, be amended to provide for the use of trained dental auxiliaries in community dentistry. The Minister should adopt this suggestion. Trained auxiliaries are employed in the dental service in England and New Zealand.  Auxiliaries would be trained to apply procedures which would reduce the incidence of dental decay.  This is a <Col N="761" /> very important aspect.  In view of the unsatisfactory position in regard to the dental service and the shortage of dentists, I hope the Minister will ensure that this amending legislation will be introduced.  The usefulness of dental auxiliaries has been proved in those countries where they are employed. Their employment here would mean that there would be more personnel helping to prevent tooth decay.</P>
    <P>The Minister stressed that one of his priorities is the training of handicapped persons for employment.  I am glad that he is aware of the problem. Many people have become increasingly aware of it within the last few years. I would hope that the Minister would lay great stress on the employment of the handicapped.  His priority should be altered somewhat to include employment as well as training.  It is a good thing to train handicapped persons for employment but it is vital that when they are trained they would be placed in jobs.  My experience is that it is not easy for handicapped persons to secure employment.  I quoted some time ago the case of a boy who was blind from birth and who had passed the Leaving Certificate examination, which must have involved very great work.  Because the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had changed their switchboard system from bells to lights it was impossible for that boy to obtain a position as telephonist in that Department. As a result, that young boy was very frustrated.  He had to wait a long time before getting a job.</P>
    <P>Government Departments should give the lead in this matter.  I am not blaming the Minister but it would appear that Government Departments have reduced the number of jobs available to handicapped persons.  It might be necessary to introduce legislation which would make it obligatory that employers would employ a percentage of handicapped persons.  This may not be the best time to make that suggestion in view of the current high rate of unemployment.  The idea did seem more sensible when we were in power.  This is an idea that may have to be shelved but it should be <Col N="762" /> kept in mind when the economy is in a better position.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the voluntary bodies who do such wonderful work for handicapped persons. The Rehabilitation Institute have a school in Naas where they train persons in upholstery and other work. The very fine training that is given represents a new lease of life to the handicapped persons and a sense of achievement.  Without this training their lives would be dull and aimless.</P>
    <P>I should like also to compliment AnCO on the progress they are making. A great deal more needs to be done.  In one week recently representations were made to me on behalf of two boys in their late teens each of whom had lost an eye and each of whom could not get employment in either of the factories in the town because of the insurance requirements. We got in touch with AnCO on their behalf.  The position must be improved. There should be more placement officers and other personnel to meet handicapped persons and to help to solve their difficulties.</P>
    <P>According to the report on the handicapped there are 100,000 adults who have long-term physical or mental handicap of whom 15,000 might benefit from preparation and training for work.  It is our long-term duty to identify these persons and then to train them in order to maximise their potential so that they could obtain employment.  The facilities at present available are not adequate to deal with the problem as we would like it to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in connection with the training of the handicapped which I have raised with the Department and with the Eastern Health Board but did not get a satisfactory answer.  It concerns boys who travel to the workshop at St. Raphael's Celbridge.  Excellent training is given at St. Raphael's.  The boys travel from different parts of the city.  Bus fares eat up the small allowance they get. The allowance is not given as payment for what they do but possibly to give them some sense of independence. In some cases the journey to Celbridge involves taking three buses.  I would <Col N="763" /> ask the Minister to interest himself in this matter and to assure me that these handicapped persons who are doing their best within their limitations will be recompensed for it and that the allowance they get will not be exhausted by way of bus fares to this special school.</P>
    <P>The misuse of drugs is a problem that has not as yet affected us to the extent that it has affected other countries.  Please God, it never will.  I had contact during the year with the Eastern Health Board with regard to a request for a lecture on drugs to be given in Kildare town to a group of youth leaders and which would be open the the public.  The attitude of the Department was that they would give lectures only to certain individuals, leaders, adults preferably, rather than young persons.  Perhaps that attitude is the correct one.  One of the recommendations in the report of the sub-committee that advised on the Misuse of Drugs Bill was that persons charged with illegal possession of drugs, peddlers or pushers, would be brought to trial speedily and dealt with within a specific time.  I hope this will be pursued and that very stern measures will be adopted against these people.  There is also provision that empowers the pharmaceutical society to inspect premises and appropriate records of all their members and any substances or drugs stored in their premises.  I would agree that that is a very good provision, although I have heard that the other provisions have not met with unanimous approval when discussed at our local health board meeting.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of verbiage and statistics in the Minister's speech indicating that he was providing more money this year.  He informed us there would be no cut-back either in services or expenditure in real terms in relation to last year.  If one pursued this, one would probably find it was statistically and clinically correct, but the reality is that the Minister has quoted many figures in order to bamboozle people.  There is no new capital expenditure except to a very minor <Col N="764" /> extent.  During a discussion recently at our Eastern Health Board branch meeting we were informed that a very limited capital grant for the present financial year had been given and that no capital development in any of the hospitals in Kildare was envisaged this year.</P>
    <P>We pointed out that we were dissatisfied with this lack of provision for capital development because there is a serious shortage of beds in St. Vincent's Hospital in Athy.  We had asked some time ago that a geriatric unit be added to the county hospital in Naas.  These two items are closely connected because, unfortunately, our county, which has so many main roads straddling it, has accident cases brought to the hospital in Naas at weekends out of proportion, I am sure, to its size as compared with any other county in Ireland.  This geriatric unit we have looked for and which the county physician pointed out was so necessary will now have to be shelved.  We had all the other facilities of staff, cooking and so forth.  All we wanted was a building with beds in it to cater for geriatric patients, which would relieve the pressure on the hospital itself and also help to relieve the pressure on St Vincent's in Athy.  I wish to place on record that we in Kildare are very disturbed that our efforts to improve the services there have been shelved.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to our ambulance service in the county.  They have always done their work efficiently and do it even more efficiently now as a result of the installation of the radio telephone communication system.  We have many voluntary workers in Maynooth and other places that deal with all calls expeditiously and efficiently.</P>
    <P>The greatest resource we have is the amount of voluntary effort available to the health services.  I wish to quote what the Minister says at column 46, volume 281 of the Official Report of 20th May, 1975:</P>
    <P>The Exchequer is now, therefore, almost the exclusive source of funds for our health services.  This situation has been brought about within a very short period of time, due <Col N="765" /> mainly to the need to remove health charges from the rates on grounds of equity.  If we add to this the fact that health services, because of their labour-intensive nature among other factors, are particularly prone to rapid cost increases, we are faced, as a society, with the need to study in depth both the future financing of the services and the need to derive the best benefits from them.</P>
    <P>Because of the rapidly rising costs, the increasing demand, and the rapidly changing technologies associated with health care, Governments all over the world are being forced to find vastly increased sums each year simply to maintain health services at their current levels.  We are not unique in this respect.  The richest countries in the world are faced with this problem and on a larger scale.  We must carefully look at the resources available for health care, so that we may continue development in the future.</P>
    <P>I would repeat to the Minister that the greatest resources we have are the dedication and unselfish devotion of the voluntary organisations many members of which are helping out through sheer love of the work they are doing.  I do not think the Minister has laid sufficient stress on the need to use voluntary effort to the maximum.  In my own county we have friends of the mentally handicapped in St. Raphael's and Moore Abbey; we have the people involved in CARE who have done such excellent work for the education of the mentally handicapped; we have the people involved with the blind and many other people who give of their services and talents free.  The Minister continually suggests in his brief that it is necessary that big brother should deal with all the problems.  I believe the work should be delegated to local communities as much as possible, and in this way much good could be done even before the harm happened.  Our health services should be made a recognised part of community life.  If we spend money on our community services and help people to get timely and preventive treatment at home, every pound we so spend will be repaid <Col N="766" /> tenfold and possibly save us £10 later if institutional care is needed.</P>
    <P>I have seen in a very small way what a local health centre can do in a town. We have such a centre in Naas which was built principally by people who each year organise a party for senior citizens with whom I was closely connected. They organised a waste paper collection and got the resources to build a health centre.  It has not been very long in existence, but we have a social worker who arranges visits, and older people and people from outlying areas come there.  There is a chiropodist and even a hair stylist for the ladies. People who had led the life of a recluse have a new lease of life.</P>
    <P>It is essential that old and infirm people, people who are handicapped, in wheelchairs, or blind people, be given an opportunity to mix with one another, to move about in society. A health centre such as this has given them that opportunity.  People in my own area have had their lives transformed and look forward to their visits each week to the health centre for the sake of the company they meet and the crafts they learn there.  Something more should be done to help the community services and to integrate these services into our health scheme. More money should be channelled in that direction where it will be repaid a hundredfold.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, a tribute that is all the more genuine when it is realised that it was the party that the Parliamentary Secretary represents that first introduced this board.  It was unfortunate that the Government in which the Parliamentary Secretary is involved did a great deal of harm to the VHI board during the year.  Voluntary health insurance is a great idea and a great help.  I am involved in it myself and I have experience of the benefits of it.  It relieves insured people of any worry about the future.  At a time like the present when money value is deteriorating and living standards are being eroded daily, nobody is very anxious to provide for the future. But in this case people were very keen on taking out insurance so that <Col N="767" /> they would be free from the worry and expense concerning problems that arise in every family.  The VHI Board provided a wonderful opportunity of doing this at a reasonable cost but when the Minister spoke of his free for all scheme during the year there was great upset and people were considering cancelling their insurance proposals.  People who had been happily insured knowing they were reasonably well covered began to doubt whether the insurance was a good thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals never reached fruition and people's plans were again upset and they had to readjust to the situation.  When the Minister discards his free for all idea &mdash;as I hope he will&mdash;I hope he realises that the voluntary health insurance is the very best scheme for all who want it.</P>
    <P>Drink is generally considered to be one of the greatest social evils of the day.  Whatever is in the Irish mentality it seems that we cannot approach drink&mdash;and possibly gambling and other matters&mdash;with any moderation; it seems to be the whole hog or nothing.  In order to change our attitude to drink an educational programme is needed.  In the present situation, apparently, all our social life centres around a lounge bar mentality and whatever we do is done either before we have a drink or after having a drink.  There has been an increase in teenage and under-age drinking.  This is an abuse which the Department must consider.  I believe the education of children, provision of lectures and control of advertising are factors that must be examined. There is advertising of a very insidious nature that would tend to give people wrong ideas about drink and it is up to us to change that.</P>
    <P>Closely allied to our drinking habits is the fact that we had 531 deaths on the road last year: there is a connection. This tremendous problem, after showing little change over a number of years, is generally seen to be increasing now and it must be examined. The Department are not giving any great lead in the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> The Minister's greatest mistake is that he has adopted this socialistic ideology.  It is time for him to admit that the free for all which he envisaged is not on.  He should get down to the ordinary work required to ensure that the very best results are obtained from the resources at our disposal.  He should use and help the voluntary organisations to a greater extent.  He should listen to the contributions from this side of the House which even, if he does not agree with them, he will find on examination indicate things that are wrong and the obvious shortcomings of the present system, the delay in dealing with dental and ophthalmic trouble and delay in getting appointments with consultants. The Minister must cut down this delay.</P>
    <P>He should also look at the structure and working of the health boards.  I realise now that the setting up of these health boards was a good thing although many on the opposite side of the House criticised them.  It was only when we got the health board in Naas that we got improved facilities including two lifts in the county hospital&mdash;something our resources did not permit previously.  Generally, our health boards have done and will continue to do good work.  When the Minister talks of the huge expenditure that goes up each year he might well examine the structure and working of these boards.  While I am confident that the work is good, I am also confident that it could be improved.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish to thank the Minister for his courtesy on every occasion when I visited him during the year. He is very approachable.  But in a year when he has been rowing with the doctors and other members of the medical profession there is grave need for him to review his own regime and give an account of his stewardship because, judging by the present political climate, it could well be that in the near future he might be steward no longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief.  The problem of health and health organisation is one which has engaged my interest for a considerable <Col N="769" /> time.  As a teacher and a Deputy, I have had some personal experience about it.  I echo the sentiments of Deputy Power in one respect although I shall take issue with him on another point later.  I hope he does not object. The Minister has shown that he is one of the most courteous and approachable Ministers on the Government benches, always available to Deputies who wish to make complaints.  I thank the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary for that.</P>
      <P>The point on which I take issue with Deputy Power is in regard to his references to the Minister's socialist ideology.  After 25 years&mdash;ever since the ill-fated mother and child scheme &mdash;of observing the progress or lack of it on the health front, I must dissent from Deputy Power.  To my mind what has bedevilled the administration of the health service in the past 25 years has been the continuance of a two-tier system of health service.  I am speaking as a socialist and also from personal experience.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, a fact which every Deputy knows that a person who goes for private treatment to a private hospital, paying for that treatment out of his own pocket or out of voluntary health insurance membership, receives a different form of treatment from what is received by the ordinary underprivileged person who goes to receive treatment as the holder of a general medical card.  The Minister's efforts to abolish this discrimination between two kinds of patients for health services are to be commended and applauded and not criticised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once on a very unfortunate occasion in this House which I am just barely old enough to remember the late Deputy Norton used the same arguments as Deputy Power when he said that the equalisation of health services would mean the provision of free medical attention for ladies with fur collars living in Fitzwilliam Square.  This was an argument which quite frankly I was unable to accept.  I would like to see the time come when I personally, as a relatively wealthy and privileged member of the community, take my place in the queue along with everybody else for the same kind of health <Col N="770" /> treatment and receive the treatment not in accordance with my means, my name, my accent or my background but simply in relation to my medical needs.  I look forward to that day.</P>
    <P>I am speaking not merely from a certain amount of study of medical services but from practical experience. I was working out with my wife the other day, if you will forgive the frivolity, Sir, that I hold the unique distinction of having been in 17 hospitals in my life.  The bulk of these involvements were the result of sporting injuries, and I am not particularly ashamed of them, but in the course of these involvements I had practical experience of what it was like to be a relatively affluent member of society and what it was like to be an ordinary person queueing up on the wooden benches in some of the aged, broken-down and appalling hospitals which are a disgrace to Dublin.  I have very little experience of rural practice in this regard.  I have noticed the way in which, where the utmost courtesies are extended in hospitals to people like myself, general medical patients are used as virtual guinea pigs by the house doctors in hospitals in this country. I admit that this process may be medically necessary to add to the experience of the doctors in question, but I cannot again forbear to remark on the distinction between the treatment offered to people like myself and the inhuman manner in which these general medical patients are treated and any effort the Minister makes to end this discrimination will receive my support.</P>
    <P>I want to make a further point with reference to the administration of Dublin hospitals.  Some discussions of the conduct of the administration of health in this city are tinged with an aura of unreality.  Anyone who for years has had experience of the administration of hospitals in this city will know that medical politics in this city are really ludicrous.</P>
    <P>The hospitalisation of Dublin city is divided between at least three groups: the concentration centred on the Mater Hospital, the concentration centred on St. Vincent's Hospital and the concentration centred on what are <Col N="771" /> known as the federated hospitals.  This triad has no logic in medical terms, other than the inheritance of a century of religious and political divisions between the hospitals.  I wonder if Deputies understand the problem of administration which the Minister faces in this regard.  Personally, I look forward to the day when hospitalisation in Dublin will be rationalised to a point which will offend a great many members of the senior consultancy profession in Ireland.  The Minister, in my view, has perhaps the most unpleasant nettle to grasp here and he is making great attempts to grasp it.  I admire him for so trying.</P>
    <P>There is one point here&mdash;and I echo the sentiments expressed by Deputy Power&mdash;that it is quite remarkable that, given the ramshackle nature of the administration of Dublin city hospitals, we have been able to attract staff of the calibre we do get for the salaries we pay.  Some of the younger consultants in Dublin, with very high qualifications in the United Kingdom and America have returned to earn salaries which are a pittance by comparison with the salaries they earned abroad.  Their retention in Ireland is only explained by their dedication to duty and their affection for this country, and I think the remarks about the row which the Minister has with the consultants must be taken in the context of the fact that we are competing on an international scale in Ireland for the services of really qualified doctors.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Power to drugs and drug addiction and this causes me to make one brief point.  What is a drug?  An American psychiatrist defined alcohol as the only sociably acceptable drug.  It is a valid point.  It is no exaggeration to say that a ridiculously large number of people are subsisting on librium and valium, tranquillisers of that kind, dispensed by doctors of all sorts in this city and I am sure the same is true of areas with which Deputy Power is more familiar than I am.  If again I may be forgiven an aside which may appear for a moment to be irrelevant but which has a certain relevance, the <Col N="772" /> other day I was staying in an extremely expensive London hotel and a group of young people came up to me and said &ldquo;Are you staying there?&rdquo; I said I was, and they said &ldquo;Are the Osmonds staying there?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;I would not know really; I have not checked the guest list&rdquo;.  They looked at me as if I were something out of the Dark Ages&mdash;I am only 39&mdash;and slowly the penny dropped.  They were referring to a pop group and I said &ldquo;I think I would just about recognise them if I saw them, but as far as I know they are not in the hotel&rdquo;, and I went on my way feeling about 70.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies with drugs. Deputy Power has inveighed against the use of drugs, but to people of 16 and 17, the smoking of cannabis is as harmless and as meaningful a pastime as for us the consumption of a gin and tonic or whiskey is the normality of life.  This is something we have to face.  It may be regrettable, and I think it is regrettable, but it is part of the generation gap.</P>
    <P>Again on that subject, I should like to make a point which will make me unpopular, perhaps, with the medical profession.  I have praised many members of that profession already but there is one sector of that profession for which I have a certain amount of contempt and that is the doctor who often works for a health board on the capitation grant system and spends his life writing prescriptions at the rate of one every three minutes.  He prescribes so much librium and so much valium. That doctor can then come back to the taxpayer and demand recompense for his service for having attended so many patients in a morning.  In my view he has not meaningfully attended them at all.  Has that man dispensed drugs?  Should we inveigh against him?  I have the greatest respect for the more honourable doctor who spends perhaps 20 or 30 minutes with a patient investigating the problem and flatly refuses to give a prescription of the kind in question.  That gets back to my point, what do we mean by drugs?</P>
    <P>On the question of alcoholism, while Deputy Power has correctly praised voluntary workers in this field <Col N="773" /> it is wrong that successive Governments have left the problem of alcoholism largely to the attention of voluntary workers.  They have made ritual speeches saying that, &ldquo;We have Alcoholics Anonymous; they are very good people and they do good work&rdquo;. When it comes to the finances of the Government very little is spent upon the curing of what is accepted to be the second major killer disease by the World Health Organisation.  It is unfortunate that we should treat this appalling disease by more or less shrugging our shoulders, appointing a few social workers but otherwise leave it to the dedicated work of individual people.</P>
    <P>The same problem applies with the care of geriatrics.  It is unfortunate that we have an inflated numerical standard by world comparison of hospital in-bed attention which is largely the consequence, though not totally so, of the fact that the geriatric patient is automatically hospitalised.  We have a reputation for our devotion to the family and our readiness to look after our aged but it is a reputation which in many cases we do not deserve.  Very often we dispatch our aged towards hospitals with the result that we have inflated statistics and the deprivation of hospital beds for people who are in more need of them.  The solution to this&mdash;this view is not solely held by me, it is held by many of my friends in the medical profession&mdash;is the extension of outside hospital home care.  The Minister should give his attention to the ever-growing need for this.  There are many people in hospital who need not be there, who could be at home if proper facilities in terms of visiting nurses were available for them.</P>
    <P>I have said enough to draw attention to the tasks which the Minister faces.  Health is perhaps the most difficult and controversial area of administration in the Government.  Even the Minister for Education, to paraphrase the British Labour MP, Ray Gunter, lies on a less painful bed of nails than does the Minister for Health who must find it almost impossible to please all the people all the time.  Too many Members, in this context, make <Col N="774" /> pleas for the retention of medical services in their own constituencies, areas where they are involved.  I look forward to the rationalisation of hospitalisation. We have far too many hospitals and a great number of them are ill-equipped.  They will never be equipped to provide the kind of general medical attention which is needed in 1975 and in the final quarter of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the Minister to a final point.  The only point on which I have to take the Minister to task is that he and his Department have not shown sufficient awareness towards the relatively costless financial involvement in unusual diseases which could be added to the category of free diseases.  I am thinking of adding them to diseases in which case no payment is required for attention; ileostomy and colostomy, the subject of questions raised by Deputy McEllistrim and myself last week, could be included.  It would cost very little to give special attention to diseases which cause people extraordinary pain, distress and inconvenience. Having made the rather jocular point about constituency references I should like to say that in my constituency the number of coeliac babies is quite remarkable.  The number of complaints I get from unfortunate young mothers who have coeliac babies and who do not feel they are getting their rights from the State is remarkable.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate Mr. Dubcek spoke of socialism with a human face and Mr. Edward Heath, who was comparably unfortunate in some ways, spoke of capitalism with a human face but one thing the Minister for Health did to his Department is to give a human face to that Department. I congratulate him on his work and I should like to add to that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and also the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare who has given a very good image to a previously rather abused Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous speakers have covered the broad spectrum of health services but I should like to deal with <Col N="775" /> one problem in my constituency even though Deputy Thornley thinks constituency interests are overdone and local problems are not of great importance. The Parliamentary Secretary will not be surprised to hear me refer to Mallow Hospital which has been the subject of debate for many years.  I hope the Minister will be able to indicate his intention in regard to the national hospital plan when replying. I would be interested to hear that Mallow Hospital will be upgraded.</P>
      <P>In view of references by the parties now comprising the Government it would be reasonable to expect that Mallow Hospital will be upgraded. The important point now is that a decision should be taken.  In the present <i>impasse</i> an atmosphere of indifference and apathy could creep into the hospital and its services, the staff and amongst the public depending on the services at that hospital.  I support the plea for continued services and an extension and upgrading of those services.  The Minister should reach a decision shortly even if that decision has to be piecemeal and Mallow is decided on separately. There is a danger that the services and facilities which exist in Mallow Hospital could deteriorate further to the loss and inconvenience of all concerned.</P>
      <P>Side by side with the plea for continued and improved general hospital services in Mallow comes the call for the provision of a full maternity unit. In years gone by there were two maternity centres in Mallow; one was at the county hospital and there was the Mount Alvernia private hospital, but neither of them exists now.  As a result, the people in Mallow and the catchment area, which extends as far as the Limerick and Kerry boundaries, have to go for maternity services to Tralee, Limerick and Cork.  A recent survey indicated there were approximately 1,500 births in the Mallow catchment area.  This figure appears to reach the guideline set down by Comhairle na nOispidéal and, therefore, there does not appear to be any good reason why a full maternity unit should not be established in Mallow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> At present expectant mothers have to travel for ante-natal attention to centres in Cork, Limerick and Tralee. In many cases this treatment is not undertaken because of the inconvenience caused by a day's absence from home to receive this medical attention. However, this situation should not be allowed to continue.  I cannot visualise any good argument against the establishment of a full maternity unit in Mallow.  This centre caters for a population of 70,000 people, it is between Limerick, Cork and Tralee and there is justification for the provision of full services in Mallow.</P>
    <P>I endorse some of the comments made by previous Deputies in relation to the availability of medical cards. The limit it too low; the bracket above the present income limit includes people who are committed to heavy medical charges.  The medical services are costly by any assessment but there are people who are barely over the limit and I would ask the Minister to extend the figure.  It is approximately £24.50 per individual, with suitable adjustment for children, and I would ask him to amend it to a more realistic figure in the light of present incomes.  Formerly medical card incomes were related to the pay of a county council worker and if this were done now it would be of some help.  At the moment there is an in-between category of people who are unable to meet their medical charges.</P>
    <P>I am not a member of a health board but it has been brought to my attention that there is considerable delay in getting patients admitted to orthopaedic hospitals.  It appears that people who can pay can jump the queue while those unable to pay must wait.  This can drag on for several months.  I know of a case recently in my constituency where a man had to go to another county in order to have a hip operation.  I would ask the Minister to work with the health boards to endeavour to reduce this delay for patients who are awaiting admission to orthopaedic hospitals.  There is a real need here and it should be attended to in the best way possible.  I make this plea in the full knowledge of the problems of getting surgeons, but the <Col N="777" /> problem is a real and urgent one and I would impress on the Minister how painful is the delay for patients who cannot get into these hospitals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thornley referred to extension of the list of long-term diseases. I have no professional knowledge that would enable me to discuss these diseases but I am concerned that one particular disease might be fully investigated, namely, congenital heart disease. By its nature this disease remains with the patients when they reach adulthood.  I know of a number of cases where these people have had to provide medicines and drugs on a continuous basis and, while there is some concession with regard to the purchase of drugs, I am convinced this disease should be included in the list of long-term diseases which have been drawn up by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have commented on the over-use of alcohol and the use of drugs.  From my ordinary knowledge and experience, I am convinced one of the greatest problems among school-leavers and students is that of boredom.  These young people have just finished school and perhaps are looking for holiday work and it appears at this stage they are liable to become easily bored.  The problem of drug-taking and the abuse of drink by young people should get special attention.  The Departments of Health and Education should get together on this matter: they have much in common and they operate jointly on many health problems such as the treatment of deaf and handicapped children. More attention should be given in the schools to train young people to use their spare time in a useful way and this might go some way towards diverting young people who might otherwise develop the habit of drug-taking and other dangers.</P>
    <P>Our nation as a whole needs to be taught and educated on how to use leisure time in a useful way.  Many people on a five-day week have no interests or hobbies and they do not know what to do with their leisure time other than betting and gambling. We have a responsibility to pattern and fashion our teaching to cater for this kind of situation.  People should <Col N="778" /> be educated in the cultivation of hobbies or activities that would absorb their spare time.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a shortage of social workers in the Southern Health Board area.  In turn, this has the effect of burdening doctors with the work that should be done by social workers. Those employed in social work are doing an excellent job and the recognise it as a vocation rather than a task or a profession.  They are doing wonderful work.  I would like to see more social workers employed by the health boards to augment and expand the work of the boards.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the work of the voluntary bodies in many spheres of health activities.  I want to put on record my endorsement of all that has been said and pay a special tribute to the nuns who quietly put in so many hours looking after people in their own homes.  What occurs in North Cork constituency is, I am sure, common to the country as a whole; these very professional, dedicated people are doing wonderful work in a very quiet way.  A tribute should be paid to them and I am taking this opportunity of paying that tribute to them now.</P>
    <P>Health services generally have been fairly well covered by previous speakers but I would like, again, to emphasise the position of the handicapped. Many can get employment but others cannot.  There is a selfish attitude being adopted by some employers where the handicapped are concerned. I know industries and factories in which a fair quota of handicapped people are employed.  If this were the general practice, the problems of the handicapped would be greatly reduced, to say nothing of their being absorbed into normal community living.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a constituency colleague of mine and so I have no trouble at any time in making contact with the Department.  Both he and his Minister have been very considerate, sympathetic and helpful at all times. I make a special plea to them now to decide the future of Mallow hospital <Col N="779" /> before the services there descend to a low level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity of complimenting the Minister, his Parliamentary Secretary and the Department for the progress that has been made.  I particularly welcome the extension of the general medical services.  Many more people now qualify for this service as a result of the raising of the ceiling.  People are, of course, inclined to look at services from the point of view of what they do not find satisfactory and are inclined to lose sight of the benefits. This is frustrating for those who are operating the services.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for the great pains he has taken to supply the House with very precise statistical information, including comparable figures with most of our European partners.  From a statistical point of view it is quite obvious we compare very favourably with our European partners in regard to both personnel and services.  Where the cost of health services is concerned, the price of drugs and medicines has escalated since the change in that particular part of the scheme.  It is now more convenient for medical card holders to collect drugs and one wonders whether or not all these drugs are used.  I have heard it said that there is a great deal of wastage of very expensive medicine and drugs.  An all-out effort should be made to educate people into looking at this service from a national point of view.  If medicines are prescribed, the patients should finish the course prescribed. Many people do themselves and their medical advisers a disservice in not following out prescriptions to the end. If they begin to feel better, they disregard the remainder of the medication prescribed.  In this they are doing an injustice to themselves.  As well as that, dangerous drugs are left lying around.  There is a certain wastage and there is need for economy in this particular field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to encourage the formation of general group practices.  Difficulty is experienced <Col N="780" /> in acquiring the services of a general practitioner at what might be described as unreasonable hours.  Difficulty is certainly experienced over weekends.  Group practices would resolve this problem.  Another method of solving the problem would be casualty units attached to the county hospitals.  It is not possible to be admitted to a hospital without a letter from a general practitioner and patients have had difficulty in getting this magic document.  A casualty unit in county hospitals would be the answer when people are taken suddenly ill.</P>
    <P>In some of the larger centres of population there is a maximum figure of 2,000 patients registered per practitioner. That is causing some difficulty particularly since the means test ceiling was raised.  Those qualifying for inclusion in the general medical services register find that, because their private doctor already has 2,000 patients registered, he cannot take them on.  This difficulty could be resolved if there was a little more flexibility in registration.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the midland region.  Since regions were established some years ago the two counties I represent are part of a region that is left over after all the other natural regions are drawn.  It is a difficult region to service because there is not a lot in common between some of the counties in it.  Communications are from east to west because everything radiates from Dublin so communications in north and south of the region are very bad. I sympathise with the Minister in his responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister has been thinking about establishing a regional hospital for this area, which is quite small when compared with some of the others.  I have given this matter a considerable amount of thought.  I am a member of a number of regional boards and I have to travel long distances from where I live in the south of the region to meetings in the north of it, so I know the problems involved. The Minister should provide a service which will be convenient for the largest number of people.  He must <Col N="781" /> provide a general hospital convenient to both the north and south of the region.  Instead of providing one regional hospital, he should provide a large general hospital based on the present county hospital in Portlaoise, which is a very fine hospital and is adjacent to a psychiatric hospital with 600 beds.  The Minister should improve the facilities in both those hospitals.  He should service the other half of the region from Mullingar, which has a large psychiatric hospital not far away.  He has not spoken about this problem but because the lines of communication radiate towards Dublin it would be much more convenient if we had both those hospitals in the region instead of having one large hospital.</P>
    <P>People who have not got their own transport and live in the south of the region, near Portlaoise, have to travel to Dublin by public transport in order to get to other parts of the region.  It is much easier for those people to go to hospital in Dublin.  A lot of time is involved for people who have not got their own transport in getting from one end of the region to the other.  There is a special problem in this area because it has not been developed over the years.  Other regions have hospitals located in large towns.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with one aspect of the social policy.  Much has been said during the debate about the services provided for handicapped and retarded people.  I should like to quote from the 1974 annual report of the Commission of the European Communities on social policy, paragraph 216. This is from the Eighth General Report on the Activities of the European Communities and states:</P>
    <P>The social year has been dominated by the preparation of a number of concrete proposals for submission to the Council in accordance with the timetable set out in the Social Action Programme adopted by the Council in its Resolution of 21 January, 1974.  The Council took its first opportunity to take decisions on these proposals at a meeting of Social Ministers in June.  It was decided to approve three proposals <Col N="782" /> relating to the opening up of Article 4 of the Social Fund for handicapped workers and migrant workers, the establishment of a General Safety Committee and the adoption of a programme aimed at the successful integration of handicapped workers into normal working life.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, who is presently president of the Council of Social Ministers in the Community, to continue to press vigorously for the inclusion of sheltered workshops in the categories of projects that warrant aid from the Social Fund.  This is very important.  It is not just a matter of having those sheltered workshops&mdash; there is a need for quite a number in this country&mdash;but they will give a very definite psychological boost to the hundreds of voluntary workers who, with the aid, assistance and co-operation of the Minister's Department, have brought the services available to handicapped people to a very fine standard, which compare more than favourably with those provided in many of the better developed countries in the Community.  If they are qualified for benefit from the Social Fund they will be given the stamina to continue on in the wonderful work they are doing.</P>
    <P>There is need for more information on what is available in the social action programme in the Community. The Minister or the Institute for Public Administration should organise seminars for the personnel of health boards and voluntary organisations to give them an idea of the kind of projects that qualify for grants from the Social Fund.  They should be given a grind on how to present applications which will get through the system of screening devices.  Perhaps the NRB might take on this function.  People from the Commission should be brought over to these seminars to answer questions, to explain the programme, and to give our people who are working in this field a closer insight into exactly what is available and what is not.</P>
    <P>I sometimes think that our civil servants who are most conscientious are a little too respectful of the Community's <Col N="783" /> rules, procedures, directives and articles.  There should be scope for a little more bending of the regulations. They might drop the stiff-upper-lip attitude they always seem to adopt, and their high standards from the point of view of the confidentiality of documents.  I had the experience of being refused a document by one Department, not the Department of Health.  Without any trouble I got it in another language from one of my European colleagues.  This put us at a disadvantage.  We should have a full and frank discussion on what is available from the Social Fund. Even if it is not the intention to extend that type of service to this country, at least we should be allowed to know exactly what is available.</P>
    <P>I could not agree with all the comments made by my colleague Deputy Thornley, especially with regard to the treatment of patients in our Dublin hospitals.  It was unfair of him to say that different treatments were meted out and that some patients were treated as guinea pigs.  Our hospitals provide an excellent service.  People who are hospitalised in a training hospital, irrespective of whether they are in a private or a public ward, must expect to see students and interns doing their rounds.  In all cases where people have raised objections, those objections have been respected.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has responsibility for the provision of detention centres for young offenders, and especially for young persons on remand.  I remember reading some months ago that it was proposed to hand over this responsibility to the Minister.  If he has assumed that responsibility, I would ask him to press ahead vigorously with the provision of these facilities.  It caused disquiet that so many young people who are on remand, and allowed out on bail, seem to continue to commit crimes and cause a considerable amount of damage.  There is a grave need for an improvement in the facilities available.</P>
    <P>Some social workers should be made available in the principal centres in the United Kingdom where there are large numbers of Irish migrant workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> I hope our Departments are not losing sight of the fact that, under the social action programme, a lot of work is being done to assist the migrant workers in the Community.  With the large number of Irish migrant workers in the UK, many people are in need of counselling and aid which would normally come under the services provided by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The public would not object if some staff were made available to work with the voluntary Irish organisations whether they be in Camden Town in London or in the other major centres where there are Irish organisations doing voluntary work.  It is time they got support from the Department and from the people at home who are able to remain in their own country.  I might have an opportunity of speaking privately to the Minister at some future date about how we can, in a very determined way, include our migrants in the new programme which is being provided and financed by the European social action programme not only for the retraining of migrant workers but also to extend many services to their families.  It is true that our people in the United Kingdom have the benefit of all the social services in the United Kingdom but, if we could extend our service to them, it would be of solace and benefit to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in defence of the health boards system.  Many people have criticised them and, on occasion, I have done so too.  This is a new venture and it needs to be sold properly not only to the public but to the public representatives.  The intention was to have the people involved in the administration of the health services as well as the elected representatives come together in the interests of the health services.  Much more needs to be done in the future to make the system work as it was intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health, perhaps to a larger extent than they should, use their influence on the health boards.  Because of this the health boards feel they have not got the control they should have in their own areas.  Many of the medical profession involved in the representation on the <Col N="785" /> health boards have not yet played the role they were intended to play.  I would urge on them to contribute in whatever way they can to the successful operation of the health boards system.  Many of those involved in the administration of the health boards are doing tremendous work in the compilation of statistics and the organisation of the services generally in their own areas.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the new system is subject to so much criticism.  The public are not being given a chance to participate in it.  Because it deals with a region the system seems removed from the man-in-the-street.  That can be argued but, in my opinion, as a member of a health board, that is not the case because the health board administration is still available more or less on the county basis and there would be similar types of offices in the county as obtained under the older system, which are still as accessible to the public.  The public are of the opinion that the health services have been taken further away from them by the establishment of the health boards.  I do not feel that to be the case and perhaps an exercise in propaganda is necessary to sell the health boards even further to the public.</P>
    <P>On the question of the overall administration of the health services by the Department of Health, Comhairle na nOspidéal, the regional hospital boards, the health boards and the local committees, it must be admitted that it is a fairly unwieldly system of administration but that all of those bodies have a role to play. It is a question of getting all of them to work together.  The local health advisory committees have a major role to play because they are composed of people on the ground in the local areas who know of the difficulties obtaining there and who are best equipped to ensure that services are brought to those local areas.  Unfortunately many of those local advisory committees, so far, have spent a lot of their time criticising the actual operation of the health boards. Because it is a new venture we have sections of the administration of the <Col N="786" /> health services criticising each other when they should be working cooperatively together in the interests of providing a better health service. I am sure that in a couple of years' time the entire population will be satisfied that the health board system is the best way of administering the health services.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's speech he mentioned that the increase in non-capital moneys is £29 million, taking the figure from £169 million to £198 million.  The Minister pointed out that that increase will not alone enable services to be maintained at the high level of last year but will allow further development and improvement. He might just as well have not said that because we all know that the increase of £29 million will hardly if at all, maintain the level of services of last year.  If one looks at the estimate for the nine months' period, it will be seen that it took something like £36 million more than was estimated to maintain the services for that period.  For this 12 months' period there is an increase of £29 million.  I should like the Minister to give us some idea of what further developments and improvements are taking place because, while the level of service might be maintained the actual amount of service is diminishing.</P>
    <P>I say that because, although the people involved in the implementation of that service are doing a fine job, they just have not the time to meet the demands on them.  Rather than merely saying that further developments and improvements will take place, perhaps the Minister would tell us exactly what these might be, because from our experience of health boards all improvements and developments tend to show a slowing down. Even in the Department's circular letter issued to the health boards in November last, they were informed that no new posts were to be created after the date of that letter without specific approval by the Department and unless recruitment was covered by special allocation from development moneys provided for 1975. vided for 1975.  That circular letter <Col N="787" /> went on to say that the health boards should pay particular attention to the need to utilise present resources in the most economical manner possible and that they should examine the extent to which it might be feasible, without having adverse repercussions on the services, to release some funds from ongoing services to supplement the additional funds allocated by the Department for development.  Therefore last November the Department of Health were telling the health boards not only that they were not to create new posts but that they should endeavour to see how they could, in effect, cut back ongoing services to make moneys available for development purposes.  That is not possible because of the enormous demands being constantly made for improved health services.  In my opinion £29 million increase in non-capital moneys this year will not do anything like what is required, and will not maintain the level of service throughout this 12-months' period.</P>
    <P>The Minister says there are no cut-backs and that extension of the services will take place as rapidly as national economic circumstances allow.  From what we read about the national economic circumstances we must conclude that there will not be any extension of the services but that there will be cutbacks.  There is no point in beating around the bush about it; that is the position.</P>
    <P>On the acute general hospitals plan that the Minister proposes to announce at the end of this debate&mdash; I feel he would have been better advised to announce it at the commencement of the debate so that the many interested parties would have had an opportunity of commenting on whatever might be the proposals involved&mdash;in the north-western region, where I come from, the acute general hospitals service would be second to none were it large enough.  There was mention in the Minister's speech about approval of the extension of the hospital at Letterkenny.  That approval is only in respect of the preparation of contract documents or of plans, which will mean that in 12 to 18 months' time all that will be <Col N="788" /> approved will be the preparation of such plans and it will be some years hence before any acute general hospital beds are available in Letterkenny. There are two general hospitals in that area, Sligo and Letterkenny. Even though Sligo hospital was extended during the last six or seven years, we find now there is not anything like the space required for the services provided there.  Letterkenny hospital caters for an equivalent population with half the number of beds.  All that we can be assured of from the Minister for Health&mdash;and this was under pressure &mdash;was approval of the preparation of plans.  When we speak about the level of services to be provided, that is not good enough.  We must be serious; we must look around and ascertain where is the possibility of finding the money with which to provide such services.</P>
    <P>We are wasting our time saying that we are providing services when we are not, in effect, bringing them up to the standards required in a given area.  The north-west, in particular, is an area which will not benefit in the overall plan for general hospitals because we are the poor relation of the country as a whole and we will be last on the list for any major financial investment in the general hospital programme.  This is a tragedy because the people in Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim are entitled to exactly the same kind of service as the people of Dublin.  The Minister said that free hospital care is to be extended to cover the entire population.  It is time we took this kind of airy-fairy, high fallutin' statement out of speeches on what is a very important aspect of life&mdash;the provision of proper health services.  In the area of the North-Western Health Board we have waiting lists for almost every service that is being provided.  I want the Minister to be aware of the fact that until such time as he can assure the people who are entitled to these services that they will get them within a reasonable time he is talking nonsense when he talks of extending free hospital care to the entire population.  It is just not on and he knows it.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned his concern for the mentally ill and the mentally <Col N="789" /> handicapped.  I have no doubt that he is concerned and all of us are concerned about the care of those people. We have a long way to go before we can be satisfied that we are even scratching the surface of the problem. There are something like 3,000 mentally handicapped people in psychiatric hospitals who should not be there.  God knows how many thousands of younger people, mainly boys in the north west, are at home because they cannot be admitted to any institution other than a psychiatirc hospital, which is not at all suitable for such people.  A major problem that has to be solved in the very near future is the provision of sufficient places for the mentally handicapped particularly those who are at home and are causing tremendous difficulty for their parents and families. This should be of major concern to the people involved in the administration of the health services.  I would urge the Minister to step up the programme of provision of places for the mentally handicapped, young children in particular. It is a terrible problem and all of us would do whatever is necessary to provide the fund to make such a service available.  Even if this meant much more taxation, I believe the people would be willing to provide the funds for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I know that the central theme in the emerging health policy of the Opposition is that greater resources should be placed in community services and in preventive services generally. They do not need to convince me of the validity of this argument.  I have held this belief since before I took office as Minister for Health, and I still hold it.  All my efforts are directed towards this end . . .</P>
    <P>We are focussing attention on this because we know it is emerging as exactly the kind of idea on which people require emphasis at this time.  The Minister may criticise the Opposition for focussing attention on this and say that he cannot go as quickly as he would like to because of financial restrictions but community care, general hospitals, psychiatric hospitals and geriatric hospitals are all bound together. <Col N="790" /> Each aspect of the health services is related to the others.  If this were approached on the basis of providing a service within the community and, to as large an extent as possible, by the community it might be found that the financial requirements are not as great as one would think.  If all aspects were working together, it could be arranged within the existing budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked of a cost benefit analysis.  This is something that cannot be done in relation to the health services.  The Office of Public Works have been talking of doing it in regard to drainage for the last six years and it has not yet been published. There are schemes being operated by the Department of Social Welfare and similar schemes by the Department of Health.  There is one Minister for both Departments and I am sure there is much that could be done in regard to people who, because they cannot make ends meet, have no alternative but to go into hospital. There are cases of old people who because the young family in the house cannot afford to keep them at home have to go into hospital.  It costs the taxpayers and ratepayers £20 to £25 a week to keep such a person in hospital, whereas the relations might be glad to keep them at home.</P>
    <P>A plan should be worked out between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health whereby these people would be fairly reimbursed for such a service. That is the best way of solving the terrible problem that exists in geriatric hospitals.  There are many people in those hospitals who could be kept at home if the people looking after them got a proper return for their services.  This would save the State £20 or £25 a week.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's figures 35.2 per cent of our people have medical cards.  He criticised the Opposition for introducing a motion to increase the guidelines for eligibility.  He knows the hardships involved when people are just outside the limit.  The limited eligibility scheme for medicines is working fairly well but much more still needs to be done in having proper guidelines set.  I have heard the Minister <Col N="791" /> say on a number of occasions in the Dáil that he has no control over the guidelines, which are a matter for the CEOs and the health boards.  He talks of the £1 increase in the guidelines costing £1 million.  Even on that basis eligibility all over the country cannot be the same.  Different health boards will have different problems.  I know the CEOs and programme managers for community care are very concerned about this.  My point is this.  Where the Minister states that it will cost so much to increase the guidelines, there should be a phased guideline rather than say that because a married person has two children and is earning £30 a week he is 50p over the limit for qualification for a medical card.  That is neither right nor fair.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ask the CEOs in their next review to have some type of limited eligibility for medical cards operate for people who are marginally outside existing limits. There should be some way of helping this section of the community.  If there is sickness in the family, these people will find the difference between having and not having a medical card unbearable and this can cause tremendous hardship.  Even if it does cause hardship, the CEOs must stick to the guidelines until such time as the Minister does what this party asked him to do, that is urge the CEOs to have a limited medical card for people just outside the limit for the full medical card.</P>
    <P>On the question of the health contribution, I understand that in the assessing of eligibility of farmers the valuation of buildings is taken into account.  For all other assessment purposes the valuation of buildings is not included.  Section 46 (c) of the Health Act, 1970, would need to be amended to have the valuation of buildings excluded for assessing eligibility.  The Minister should look at this problem and see if there is anything he can do. Because of the inclusion of the valuation of buildings rather than the valuation of land only, many people in the farming community are outside the limit for eligibility for the health contribution section.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister also <Col N="792" /> said he was not satisfied with the dental service.  He then made a startling statement when he said that he did not really know what the solution to this problem is.  This is a very serious matter.  One would expect the Minister or his advisers to have some type of solution to put forward.  Because of the shortage of staff in the North-Western Health Board area they have established a priority rating. Only expectant mothers, TB patients and patients under treatment in hospitals will get priority treatment.  In one county there are 600 people on the waiting list&mdash;non-priority patients. Some of them have been on that list for from one month to two years. This is not a service.</P>
    <P>It was stated in a report of the dental services in the north-west that to cater for the population in that area it would be necessary to have 72 dentists.  At the present time they have 23.  They are 49 dentists short.  The CEO was very anxious to point out that there was no shortage of money. They were not in a position to employ 49 more dentists because they could not get them.  This is a terrible problem. I am sure, from listening to other contributions to this debate, that the same situation exists throughout the country.  There must be something radically wrong with the terms of contract with public dentists working for health boards and the Department as against the position that obtains in the private sector.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister&mdash;this is a very important aspect of the service &mdash;to formulate some definite plan towards a solution.  It is not good enough in any area.  I speak particularly for the north-west, to have only 30 per cent of the staff required to provide a proper service.  That will not be acceptable for very long.  I urge the Minister to have the necessary discussions with the people concerned to ensure that many of our dentists will be encouraged to come home to practise either in the public or private sector.  If he fails to get sufficient numbers of them into the public service I urge him to offer sufficient remuneration to those in the private sector to encourage them <Col N="793" /> to participate in the public service. There are many ways to tackle the problem and I urge the Minister to take definite action.  It is not good enough to ask what the solution can be.  A solution will have to be found and the Minister for Health, the supreme authority in this respect, is the man who must ensure that every effort is made to improve the dental service, which is in a deplorable state.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the information centres throughout the country.  They are making citizens aware of their rights.  This is a very important development.  In the past people were not aware of their rights and had to go to their public representatives who, in turn, had to get the information for them.  It is good to see these centres staffed with people qualified to inform the public of their rights.  This service should be improved and expanded where necessary.</P>
    <P>The welfare homes programme as laid down by the Department and implemented by the health boards has been the subject of expressions of fear that the thinking in the Department is they should be dropped or not expanded at the rate they might be. I appeal to the Minister not to have this programme slowed down in any way.  It has been a most welcome development particularly in the north-west, where in Leitrim 17 per cent of the population are older than 65 years. In Dublin the percentage is five.  One can see from these figures the necessity for having proper services for those elderly people rather than having them queuing to get into geriatric hospitals.  The service provides self-contained homes for elderly people convenient to their own homes.</P>
    <P>In addition, I should like to see much greater expansion in the day hospital services at all hospitals, whether psychiatric, geriatric or general. Many people if they can get treatment in a day hospital will not take up hospital beds and this will relieve the over-crowded conditions of nearly all our hospitals.  In the north-west we had great progress under this heading and in St. Patrick's at Carrick-on-Shannon 130 day patients attended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> They would have had to be provided with accommodation in hospitals thereby aggravating already overcrowded conditions.  This aspect of the medical service has proved to be a tremendous success in Carrick-on-Shannon and to a smaller extent elsewhere throughout the north-west.  It should be vastly improved and the Minister should quickly provide equipment and money where they are required. This, too, would relieve pressure on hospital bed space.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consult with the Minister for Local Government to ensure that all water supplies, whether group or regional schemes, will be fluoridated.  There are still many water supplies throughout the country which have not been so treated.  It should be mandatory on all local authorities to have water supplies treated in this way.  It is not an excuse that the cost would fall on the rates because health boards now pay the cost of this treatment.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other small points I wish to raise.  I know the Minister and other Deputies have been concerned about paraquat poisoning and the sale of gramoxene.  The manufacturers have added a foul-smelling substance to gramoxene but it has come to my notice in recent weeks that many of the ordinary weedkillers which do not contain paraquat are now being advertised as doing so.  Most of the weedkillers which could have been described as harmless to humans are now advertised as containing paraquat and I urge the Minister to see if he can do anything in this respect. Many people now do not know whether a weedkiller is dangerous, and it is vitally important that the Minister has the whole matter examined.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the health services which do not directly involve health but are incidental to the health services.  For instance, there is the question of the telephone service in hospitals and such places.  This is usually the last thing to be considered when funds are being allocated, but it is a very serious problem.  One is aware of the problems that exist in relation to the telephone service <Col N="795" /> generally but the problems become more acute in relation to the telephone service in major hospitals.  In many cases where application was made for improved telephone service in hospitals an allocation was refused. It is just as important that a hospital should have a proper telephone service as it is that it should have a proper operating theatre.  I would urge the Minister to have regard to this very serious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his introductory statement outlining the plans in regard to the health services for the coming year.  In the two years in which he has been Minister I have found him to be very approachable despite the fact that his Department is a very difficult one to administer. In the last 12 months the Minister has been confronted with many difficulties by various sections of the medical profession.  I am delighted that he is making headway in resolving the problems that arise between himself and the medical profession.</P>
      <P>I would also compliment the Minister on the seminar that he arranged in Waterford.  It was appropriate and welcome that after three or four years of operation of health boards there should be a meeting.  I hope that cognisance will be taken of the many genuine recommendations made at the seminar as these public representatives are much more aware of the needs of the people than are the senior executives in the Custom House and in the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the question of the operation of health boards.  From my experience, both on a board and otherwise, the transfer of responsibility for health services from the county councils to these boards has been a retrograde step.  Under the former system a public representative could approach the county manager in regard to an urgent problem and could be satisfied that the matter would be dealt with expeditiously.  I want to put on record that despite the many criticisms of the county managerial system great credit is due <Col N="796" /> to those senior executives in regard to the standard of hospitals and the level of attention given in those hospitals at the time they were handed over to the health boards.</P>
    <P>The present system is unwieldly and remote from the ordinary people. The ultimate policymakers in the health boards, the CEOs, have too much power, much more power than the county managers and even more power than the Minister, from what I can gather from attending meetings. I would strongly recommend to the Minister that county health committees be given more responsibility and more say in their areas for the institutions for which prior to the inception of health boards they had responsibility.  At the moment health committees are just talk shops and discussion groups.  They have no power.  The Minister might consider the suggestion that the system could be improved by the integration of the chairman of the health committee within the region into the health board.  This would create better liaison and feed-back from the boards to the county advisory committees.</P>
    <P>The provision of welfare homes is to be welcomed as being a happy relief to many elderly persons living in isolated rural areas.  These people are cared for in these homes by staffs who are concerned for their comfort and wellbeing.  I should like to compliment them on the work they do. I would appeal to the Minister to continue to provide funds to enable health boards to build more of these homes in the smaller towns and smaller areas of populations.  This would bring contentment and happiness to elderly persons by ensuring that they would be cared for in their own locality.</P>
    <P>Community care is an aspect of the health services which needs further financial assistance from the Minister. Within the limited resources, a fine service is being provided.  My concern and the concern of rural Deputies is to ensure that regular care and attention is given to the chronically ill in their homes, especially in rural and isolated areas.  Continued improvement of this service will involve the recruitment of social workers as a <Col N="797" /> matter of urgency.  I would ask the Minister to bear this in mind when he is considering the community care service.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the health services which in my opinion is being too rigidly enforced is the home care allowance.  There are many cases in my constituency which are in need of financial assistance.  I can cite cases where married daughters have to surrender much needed part-time employment in order to look after parents and they do not qualify for the allowance. There should be more flexibility in the administration of the allowance. The matter should come within the ambit of the local health committees who are <i>au fait</i> with the needs of the people.  I would ask the Minister to consider the transfer of this service to health committees.</P>
    <P>There are the twin scourges of drug abuse and drinking.  Persons in positions of responsibility are gravely concerned about the terrible evils that flow from these abuses.  In the last couple of years the influence of drugs and drinking has reached alarming proportions, so that one must fear for the well-being of future generations. Surveys have been carried out in many parts of the country which reveal startling information as to the influence of these evils on school children from 15 years up.  Every possible means of health education should be employed to enlighten young people about the terrible consequences of addiction to drugs or drink.  I would appeal to the Minister to deal with this as a matter of grave urgency.  If the situation is allowed to deteriorate the next generation will be affected.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent raising of the ceiling in regard to qualification for a medical card.  The assessment of gross income may be unjust.  The assessment should be based on take-home pay.  There are borderline cases where it is impossible for the persons concerned to meet the prolonged cost of sickness in their homes.</P>
    <P>There is a matter which I would ask the Minister to discuss with health board CEOs and members.  Before the inception of health boards, members of county councils had power to issue <Col N="798" /> temporary medical cards for a month or a little longer to cover emergency cases which they knew to be genuine. This ceased at the changeover, and I believe this special temporary authority should be reinstituted, because the temporary medical coverage can alleviate the hardship of serious illness.</P>
    <P>Like many other Deputies, I am concerned for handicapped people. Greater efforts should be made to provide positions in State and semi-State bodies for them.  Their present job opportunities are very limited.  Steps should be taken by the Minister to ensure that they are properly trained to enable them to obtain suitable employment. I know some of these young people who have obtained such employment in my area and who are doing a great service to our community.</P>
    <P>There is a scheme operated and supervised by the health board which is in need of revision and up-dating.  It is termed the &ldquo;refund of the cost of medicines&rdquo;, which is based on the monthly cost, and a refund is made by the board over a certain figure. This system is very unwieldly and there are very long delays in the refunding of these moneys.  If there was better liaison between the chemists and the local health boards, a much better service could be provided.  I know of people who are paying between £30 and £35 a month for medicines for sick people.  They cannot afford such payments but have to find means to obtain this money to meet these costs and wait excessive periods for the refund.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment our dispensary doctors, who are providing a great service for our people living in rural areas.  I want them to know that we appreciate their very good work, as do our health board executives who are very anxious to ensure that they continue serving the needs of rural Ireland.  Too many areas lack their services.  I can assure them that any difficulties that may arise with our existing dispensary doctors will be resolved as quickly as possible by our health boards.  There is a system of late whereby dispensary doctors are being allowed to purchase the residence <Col N="799" /> to ensure their permanency in the area.  I would appeal to all health board executives to see that no difficulty will be put in the way of these doctors in relation to staying in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the impending ministerial announcement on the county hospital system, our hospital in Nenagh has a continuing important role to play in the lives of the people of North Tipperary, and I know the Minister will bear this in mind when he makes his statement.  Finally, on behalf of all our people, I compliment the health board employees on a job well done and wish them continued success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to pay tribute to the health boards. As a member of a health board from their inception may I say that valuable work has been done.  The setting up of the health boards was a great step forward, and in saying that, I am not casting any reflection on the work that was done by the county councils since the foundation of the State. When the county councils had the responsibility for health they did not have the same opportunities.  They had so much other work to do they could not get down to all the work done by the health boards.  I would urge the Minister to make his decision on the regional hospitals as soon as possible.  This matter is still causing some concern to members of the different boards, because they feel they may be left out, and this is interfering with the proper working of the health boards.  If they knew where the general hospital was going to be situated, they would be able to plan effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important aspect of community care is to provide services to keep people out of institutions rather than put them into institutions.  If proper inducements could be provided to encourage the community to keep their old people at home it would be a great saving both financially and in hospital beds.  With this in mind more day facilities should be afforded. People needing psychiatric or geriatric treatment could be brought in during <Col N="800" /> the day and go home at night.  In our area, in Castleblayney and Trim, there are two very fine hospitals in which we are able to do this work.  Last year, for example, between 500 and 600 people were treated there.  They were collected five days a week by minibus, examined, treated and left home in the evening.  From the 1st June it is intended that the same system should operate in Drogheda. In Drogheda and Dundalk we have psychiatric units.  People can come into the hospital during the day and go home at night.  There are 50 people there at the moment.  It appears that the pattern of the service in the future will be that a large number of patients will require short-term treatment. They might have to go back for six weeks at a time, but in the long run we should be able to do very good work.  Many patients could be treated on a day-to-day basis and return home at night.</P>
    <P>I believe there was some agreement recently in the dental service which would require an amendment to the Act to allow for the employment of dental hygienists.  If this were done, those people could do very valuable work in going around our schools lecturing boys and girls on dental care.</P>
    <P>There should be more emphasis on child care.  Perhaps more nurses should have some formal training in this field so that they could advise mothers and mothers-to-be on child care.  They could also better help mothers with handicapped children, mental or physical.  Those of us who in the past have been members of voluntary organisations know what this would mean to mothers of large families, some of whom are handicapped.</P>
    <P>In our area, the North-Eastern Health Board, we are increasing the number of public health nurses to eight per annum.  If public health nurses can go around advising and helping people, we can keep such people out of hospitals.  There should be continuing liaison between community and hospital services, and in this matter general practitioners could play a very important part.  I know from experience in Drogheda and Dundalk that very often people are notified to attend and <Col N="801" /> will come to a clinic from a distance of ten or 20 miles, wait a couple of hours and then find the consultant was held up perhaps through no fault of his own and might have to leave early, with the result that people who had travelled a long distance would have to return another day.  For some time I have been advocating that only a certain number of people should be notified to attend, a number that the consultant could deal with in a given time, whether the clinic lasts one hour, two hours or three hours.  People should be saved unnecessary trouble and expense particularly those without means to buy meals during their long wait.</P>
    <P>The new posts of directors of community care are very important and they should ensure co-operation within the community and between the community and the hospitals so that better liaison would be achieved.  Better out-patient facilities at hospitals could reduce admissions.  A better out-patient diagnostic service would avoid some strain on accommodation.  There is great need for more consultants in the acute and general hospitals and there could be fewer house doctors.  A better consultancy service would mean improvement in many ways.</P>
    <P>We also need services for disturbed youth.  The number affected by alcohol is now assuming very serious proportions and I would ask the Minister to give this matter consideration.  More remedial teachers are needed in both urban and rural areas for young school children.  Some children are backward and unable to keep up with their fellows in school.  Better liaison is required between the voluntary bodies, lay and religious, in devising services both in in-patient and out-patient care.  Much could be done in this field and perhaps health boards, where possible, could meet this need.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister's opening speech was very good and he gave the impression that there was money for everything, I know from experience on health boards that we have not sufficient money and the need for more funds and less departmental controls is urgent.  Boards should be allowed greater latitude and if they <Col N="802" /> are able to effect savings under any heading they should be allowed to spend their savings as they see fit. The executives and the members of boards are responsible people.  They include 16 members of county councils and 14 nominated by the Minister &mdash;all very responsible people.  Given more authority and responsibility they would achieve better results.</P>
    <P>The Local Appointments Commission deal with the appointment of staff and frequently there are delays up to 18 months before an important post is filled for a consultant or a dentist.  It is very annoying to have such a long delay.  Would the Minister see if something could be done in this regard?</P>
    <P>The ambulance service is a very important facet of the health service. I attended a meeting at the Custom House when machinery under the Health Act was first being set up and it was then announced that the ambulance services would have to be modernised by having a radio control centre in each region so that all ambulances could be radio-controlled and each ambulance going to an accident would be properly equipped and carry a doctor and a nurse so that on arrival at the scene the doctor could make a quick diagnosis and radio to the hospital which would be able to deal with the patient's injuries. Since then what happens is that an ambulance goes out with a nurse and driver and brings the injured to the nearest hospital.  Later, perhaps, it is found the patient has injuries which cannot be treated at that hospital and the patient has to be sent to another hospital.  This delay can cause loss of life.  I ask therefore that the ambulance service be brought up to date with radio control and ensure that patients are sent to the proper centre.</P>
    <P>Finally I would urge the Minister not to bring any more people into the health scheme until he is sure, and until the public can see that he is sure, that those already in the service have all the services they are supposed to have.  We know that at present with the buildings, the hospitals and the staffs we have, it is not possible to <Col N="803" /> give proper treatment to those entitled to it.  In most areas there are long lists of people waiting to go into hospital for various reasons and if we bring all the people of the country within the Act we will not have the services to give them.  Before the service is extended the Minister should ensure that there will be proper means of treating those entitled to benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister on doing an excellent job.  His work is very extensive, particularly in view of the changes that have taken place in the last few years.</P>
      <P>The health services were administered by the local authorities until about three years ago when the health boards were formed and I think we owe a lot to the people who were in charge of them&mdash;the members, the county manager, the county secretary and their able staff&mdash;for the trojan work they did in difficult circumstances. In those days they had not the accommodation and they had not the organisation, but now we see the health boards provided with offices, with staff and all the help required. We owe a lot to the people who carried on these services until the establishment of the health boards.  The Minister has quite a responsible task in conducting and administering the health services throughout the country. It is easy for us to come here and speak on behalf of the people in our constituencies.  We are more or less speaking on local level but the Minister has to deal with the problems arising throughout the Twenty-six Counties, problems which are many and difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My chief concern at all times has been the mentally-retarded child.  I live convenient to Creggs Hospital outside Sligo and I have very often been approached by parents who were desperate to have their child or children admitted to this hospital.  The hospital started as Creggs House, with a very limited number in it.  The previous Government spent a large sum of money in carrying out extensions but <Col N="804" /> there is a lot of room for further extension at the hospital because we have quite a large number on the list for admission there.  When you go to the hospital and ask for an admission, you discover that the waiting list is so long that these people have not got a hope of having their child or children admitted and this is something that needs immediate consideration.  I am speaking only from my local knowledge but what about all the other counties and areas which have the same problem, greater perhaps than what I know of? I am very anxious to see progress being made in this direction.  There is nothing more upsetting or more likely to interfere with the happiness of a home than a mentally-retarded child where the other children are concerned and where the parents are concerned and where it is often the sole responsibility of the mother to look after the child.  We all know how difficult and unmanageable these children can be.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise this because I have made recommendations to other places throughout the country, only to find that the waiting list was very long and there was no hope of having children admitted, except in the case of one, and another in 12 months' time.  I must say that we owe a lot to those people who are working on behalf of these mentally-retarded children and doing this trojan work for rehabilitation of many of our boys and girls.  The Parliamentary Secretary was in Carrick-on-Shannon last week and was approached by a very hard-working committee from Sligo who are making great progress towards the establishment of a rehabilitation centre.  They have bought two small concerns and are carrying on as best they can.  Now they have bought property which gives room for extension but money is the problem.  I know that the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary will go as far as they can towards helping those people. One of these concerns was opened by the Minister some time ago in Ballinamore in County Leitrim.  It is a great success and many people are finding useful employment there. Many of them have adjusted to normal <Col N="805" /> life despite their disabilities and handicaps, and are very happy there. This voluntary organisation has been working very hard and I want to bring it to the Minister's notice that these people will be coming from Sligo in the near future to put the case to him on behalf of the people who require treatment.</P>
    <P>I have already had discussions with the Minister about the Nazareth Home in Sligo, another centre which is doing very good work but which needs a lot of money.  That institution has now spent over £120,000, a very considerable sum, without any grant or assistance from anyone.  It is now nearly completed.  All the provisions with regard to fire prevention and so on have been approved by the fire officer and others concerned and these people will be coming to his Department in the near future for money. This in itself goes to prove how much money is required to meet the demands. A very substantial amount of money is required and we all know how prices are soaring and that what can be done this year will sometimes cost double what it would have cost last year.  The Minister has to find money to meet those demands.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that in the near future Cloonamahon monastery will be opened by his Department.  That fine hospital will cater for the needs of the people of the area.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the local demands are met in relation to the facilities to be provided there.  Local parents who are seeking to have their children admitted should be given first priority.  Local families will be in a position to visit their children regularly and take them home for weekends and holidays.  The present attitude to the caring for such children has a lot to recommend it.</P>
    <P>In the past children fortunate enough to obtain accommodation in such hospitals never got home.  The result was that they lost contact with their parents and other members of their families.  The coming and going of these children in some way compensates these parents for the hardships they must endure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> The Minister, and his Department, deserve congratulations for the services being provided in remote areas. Old people in such areas when ill were unable to call for medical attention and with the closing of neighbouring homes found themselves completely isolated from the rest of the community.  It is heartening to see public health nurses and officials of the community care service journeying to remote areas to tend to the needs of old people.  It is also pleasing to note that those in need of hospitalisation do not have to wait for any undue length of time before gaining admission.  Money is well spent in regard to the health services. The old people being cared for in hospitals and in their homes made an outstanding contribution to the development of this State and it is only right that we care for their needs in their old age.  The people in receipt of an allowance for caring for aged relatives appreciate this help.  This allowance is greatly appreciated in the rural areas of my constituency.</P>
    <P>The hospital in Sligo has been improved greatly in recent years but the Minister will be receiving a request for a further extension to it in the near future.  I visit that hospital regularly and I have seen how the existing accommodation is taxed to the limit.  The authorities there have had to put up to four more beds in each ward.  I understand that plans for an extension to the hospital have been prepared and I appeal to the Minister to do all in his power to have that work carried out without delay.  The doctors and nurses there are doing a wonderful job under difficult circumstances.  I should also like to pay tribute to the doctors and staff of Our Lady's Hospital, Manor-hamilton. Some people tried to create a scare 12 months ago by announcing that Our Lady's Hospital was to close down.  I am glad every effort is being made by the Department to up-grade Manorhamilton and improve the facilities there.  The people of the area are pleased to know that the hospital is there to stay.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost of the health services, if the services and facilities are <Col N="807" /> improved their cost must increase. Under the health boards the transporting of patients has improved. Prior to the establishment of these boards each county was responsible for the conveyance of patients in that county to the hospitals.  If a serious accident took place in a county, the only ambulance that would go to the scene of that accident was one from the county where it occurred.  It happened that people died only 30 yards away from a county where an ambulance was available.  This matter created scenes at many county council meetings.  We have a first-class ambulance service.  We should not wonder that the health boards cost a lot of money to run; we have provided services for the most remote parts of the country and where it is necessary we transport patients to Dublin for treatment.  It is a comfort to people who are in ill-health to know the health boards will arrange for treatment for them.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see the Parliamentary Secretary in Leitrim last week and to discuss the health services with him. We are proud of the services available for geriatrics in Leitrim.  There is a new geriatric home in Sligo and it is one of which any county could be proud.  We have several geriatric homes in Leitrim also: there is one at Rossinver, one at Mohill and it is proposed that the Minister for Health will open a new home at Carrick-on-Shannon in the near future.  Our county has a population of only 28,000 and approximately 17 per cent are more than 65 years. I remember some years ago we had only one geriatric home at Manor-hamilton and it was in a very delapidated condition.  I admit that a stigma attached to the old county home and, to some extent, that stigma still remains. However, the older people have now the consolation of knowing they will be cared for by concerned staff in modern homes.  It is inevitable that costs will increase and we must be prepared to pay for the services.</P>
    <P>A problem exists in my area regarding the availability of a specialist in speech therapy.  The health board were <Col N="808" /> fortunate for the last two years that they had a specialist residing in the area but now a specialist is available only once per month.  That is of no use and will not give the treatment that is necessary.  Another problem arises with regard to orthodontic treatment. This service is not provided on a wide scale in the North-Western Health Board area.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of these matters to see if anything could be done to give a more regular service in these areas of medicine to the people in the area.</P>
    <P>We should thank the Press for providing much-needed information to the people who are not familiar with the services available.  There are many people working on farms in isolated areas who may not know what is available with regard to health services. Because of pressure of work even Deputies are not always fully aware of these services.  The Press deserve our thanks for giving publicity to this matter.</P>
    <P>There are some instances of administration by the health boards that need examination and I will give one example.  A child was admitted one morning to a hospital for an eye operation but the specialist who was to carry out the operation could not do so because the child was not admitted to hospital the night before.  The parents had not been told about this regulation and, as a result, the child will have to wait 12 months before the specialist can do the operation.  The parents in this case had provided transport and it had cost them a considerable amount of money.  In such cases patients should be free to go into hospital on the morning of the operation rather than the night before.</P>
    <P>People owe a great deal to the members of the various health boards. In many cases these members of health boards have to leave their homes and their businesses and proceed to spend the day, perhaps, 100 miles away attending health board meetings and the only compensation they get for a hard day's work is travelling expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the terms of the Agreement for Joint Financing of North Atlantic Ocean Stations done at Geneva on the 15th day of November, 1974.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been associated with the operation of ocean weather stations in the North Atlantic since 1954.  At that time we were one of 18 countries which were parties to an agreement designed to establish the stations to monitor and exchange meteorological information.  This agreement was administered by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and is due to terminate on 30th June, 1975.  It is now proposed to replace the 1954 agreement and the principal object of the new agreement is to ensure the continuation of the provisions of the old agreement enabling the contracting parties to finance or to provide or operate vessels at ocean weather stations in the North Atlantic.  At formal discussions between the interested States it has been agreed that on this occasion it would be more appropriate that the World Meteorological Organisation should sponsor the new agreement and that organisation has agreed.</P>
      <P>The agreement involves a charge on public funds and consequently Dáil approval of its terms is necessary in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution before it may become binding on the State.  Ireland's contribution for the year 1974 towards the running costs of the service under the existing agreement has been calculated at £44,000.  The number of States participating in the new agreement is expected to increase from 18 to 22 and as a result Ireland's contribution in the long run should be smaller than under the old agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel sure that the importance of maintaining these weather stations in the North Atlantic will be realised and supported by the House.  It is an exercise in international cooperation which benefits contracting States, particularly in western Europe.  The constant flow of information from these <Col N="810" /> stations&mdash;which make weather observations every hour of the day&mdash;is a very important factor in the preparation of weather forecasts for Ireland, including the forecasts and gale warnings specially prepared for our fishermen. In addition, the ocean weather stations make observations of meteorological elements at upper levels, including wind up to and above 50,000 feet, four times each day.  This information on high level winds is of considerable economic benefit to airlines, including Aer Lingus, on the North Atlantic routes.</P>
    <P>Since the late 1960s meteorological information from the Atlantic Ocean is also being received in increasing volume by the Meteorological Service from weather satellites.  While this information is contributing to the improved standard of forecasting provided by the Meteorological Service, it is the opinion of the World Meteorological Organisation that information from satellites is unlikely to be adequate to make the ocean weather stations unnecessary for a considerable number of years to come.</P>
    <P>I think you will agree that, considering the advantages to be gained, Ireland should participate fully in this international agreement.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of my colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy, spokesman for Foreign Affairs, I should like to say that we support this agreement. As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, we have been a party to the previous agreement since 1954 and the continuation of this type of agreement is vitally important.  Valuable service is rendered in return in the case of our fishing industry and our national airlines.  We are the last outpost in western Europe and it is only right and proper we should be full participants in an agreement such as this.  The sum involved, £44,000, is not very large particularly when one remembers the valuable services rendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that the number of participating countries will go up from 18 to <Col N="811" /> 22.  He might let us know what four new countries are involved.  I should also say that farmers in Shannon Airport area derive benefit from this agreement because they can phone the meteorological people and get a forecast as to what weather conditions will be like.  This information is invaluable when it comes to haymaking and harvest time.  We fully support the agreement.  We are aware of the necessity for continuing the earlier agreement due to expire at the end of June.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I also fully support this agreement.  A valuable service is provided for our national airlines on transatlantic flights and the agreement is very important from the point of view of a possible extension of our fishery limits and an extension of our control of the sea up to, we hope, a limit of 200 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for my temporarily deflected attention.  I was trying to get an exact answer to Deputy Barrett's question.  I apologise to him for my inability to get an explanation of a rather complex matter.  It is not a question of four brand new countries being added to the agreement; it is a question of a larger number of countries being expected to accede to the new agreement. Some countries may be dropping out but, if they do, they will be replaced by much bigger ones. I cannot tell Deputy Barrett exactly what four countries make the difference between 18 and 22 but I can tell him that the reduction in the cost of this country's contribution towards the maintenance of these stations will be fairly substantial within the fairly modest range of money involved.  It is estimated that the cost for the first 18 months of the new agreement's operation will be, at present price levels, about £8,000 less than it was in 1974.  In that narrow range we will find ourselves for once paying less, even in absolute terms, rather than more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful for the Opposition's speedy acceptance of this motion and I share the points of view expressed <Col N="812" /> by Deputy Barrett and Deputy R.P. Burke in emphasising the importance of these weather stations to various parts of our economy.  I am sure, in so far as any of our own nationals are involved in the practical work of these stations, they have the best wishes of the House.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Health)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of years back our late President, Erskine Childers, in his role as Minister for Health, was involved in a radical restructuring of the health services.  It is appropriate, with the experience we have gained since that time, to see now if the community at large are securing the greatest benefit from the massive expenditure of 1/6th of the Exchequer expenditure on health services. It is obvious that a radical change of emphasis and a reallocation of financial resources are called for.  Medicine should be brought into the community and an increased proportion of resources should be spent on community services and preventive medicine with a corresponding reduction in the hospital admissions and institutional care.</P>
      <P>I believe health services should revolve around community care.  It is the reverse situation at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> The Minister referred to the need for community care services.  He stated that it was not in his power at this stage to make the necessary radical changes.  The present Administration, which is divided between two parties, will be incapable of making the very necessary decisions which will result in the re-direction of our health services.</P>
    <P>The radical restructuring by the late President, when he was Minister for Health, brought about alterations in the health services and the health authorities.  I believe we will have to wait for a Fianna Fáil administration to take advantage of the experience gained in the last few years in the operation of the health services and radically change the direction of the present financial expenditure in order to bring the greatest return, for the money expended, to the people.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, when speaking on this Estimate, to talk about what we have and where we are going under the present Administration.  In 1975 we have seen massive cut-backs in real terms because of inflation.  A hospital in Dublin recently was denied a grant of £5,000 for a very necessary X-ray unit.  They were told the patients could be taken to other hospitals for X-rays and brought back for operations. Surely something as elementary to the practice of medicine as an X-ray unit should not be denied any hospital, no matter how severe the financial restraints on the Department are?</P>
    <P>The general operation of the health services in my area is under the Eastern Health Board.  I would like to compliment the staff of that board for the way they administer their responsibilities, which are done in a very charitable manner.  They treat each applicant for services as a human being and not as a number.  Much of this excellent work will grind to a halt if the Minister is not prepared to provide them with the necessary money to expand.  The money they have received this year will only allow them to stand still.  You can only stand still for a short time as the service then starts to slip and it becomes less efficient. I appeal to the Minister to come <Col N="814" /> to the assistance of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>We expected north County Dublin to be serviced by the long promised Beaumont hospital.  This was announced at at least half a dozen Press Conferences. I expected to be invited to its opening long before this but unfortunately there is not even a sod turned.  This is at a time when there is a massive expansion of population in north County Dublin and the north city fringe area.  There is a young married population in that area and the existing towns are expanding rapidly.  Apparently the money is not provided by the Minister for a badly needed maternity hospital.</P>
    <P>It should be one of the aims of any administration to have local health centres as the focal point of any community. Last February I asked the Minister for Health if he was aware of the need for a clinic to deal with minor emergencies in the Donaghmede/ Grangemore area of County Dublin and the steps he proposed to take for the provision of such services.  He stated in reply:</P>
    <P>I am informed that a minor casualty service for cuts and bruises is provided at the board's health services at Edenmore and Kilbarrack.</P>
    <P>These are further cut-backs.  In an area where there are nearly 2,500 houses, people are looking for a minor emergency clinic and because of the Department's approach and the Minister's lack of decision such a basic facility is not available.  The population is comprised of a large number of children and when minor emergencies arise, such as cuts and bruises and so on, they have nowhere to go.</P>
    <P>The whole situation in the north County Dublin area must be looked at with a view to a massive expansion of the health services.  The only word to describe the expansion in the population in that area is massive and the health services have not been keeping pace.  I appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to provide extra money for the Eastern Health Board to allow them to expand as we know they want to expand.</P>
    <P>We also have a major psychiatric <Col N="815" /> problem.  Is proper use being made of our well-trained and concerned staff who are operating in St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane?  Are we to have a continuation of the institutionalised type of treatment or should we not approach the goal of basing our staff at St. Ita's Hospital and moving out amongst the people and treating psychiatric patients in their home environment rather than bringing them to a psychiatric hospital? This type of radical decision cannot be made by the present regime and we must await the election of a Fianna Fáil administration to sort out the problem of such a radical change.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, what about the conditions in which the excellent staff in St. Ita's Hospital are attempting to operate?  Last February I asked the Minister if he would instruct the Eastern Health Board to replace the present temporary buildings used for housing patients in St. Ita's Hospital at Portrane by permanent structures. The Minister went some of the way with me with regard to the provision of a new 72-bed unit.  We needed something much larger.  The Minister said that proposals for rehousing the remaining patients were being examined. Being examined for how long? Under what conditions are the nurses supposed to work?  Under what conditions are the patients supposed to be housed and treated while these proposals are being examined?  I appeal to the Minister to speed up a decision on these proposals.</P>
    <P>In north County Dublin, as in every other area, there is the problem of emergency accident facilities.  In February I asked the Minister if he would arrange for the provision of emergency accident facilities for north County Dublin to be based at St. Ita's Hospital.  The idea behind that question was that the nearest emergency facilities at the moment are based in Kilbarrack in the middle of a built-up area or at the fire stations in the city. If there is an accident along the North Road you have to call for an ambulance to come out from the city.  Major traffic congestion is not unknown on that road.  Because industries and the airport are sited there there are large traffic jams on the North Road.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> Rather than having an ambulance coming out from the city to somewhere on the Balrothery Straight and turning around to go back into Dublin, my idea was that we should have an emergency unit based at St. Ita's Hospital so that an ambulance could go to an accident without becoming involved in a traffic jam.  If necessary the unfortunate injured person could be taken to Dublin or Drogheda or to the emergency unit at St. Ita's.  The hospital facilities are there.  If they discovered at the emergency unit that they could not cope properly with the accident, the person could be taken by helicopter to a hospital in Dublin.  This would save time and, as we all know, time is of the essence in the case of accidents and the treatment of people injured in accidents.  We should have this type of facility based at St. Ita's.</P>
    <P>All those who have spoken have given their own experience of the problems in their own constituencies with regard to medical cards and their allocation.  I should like to add my voice to the chorus of calls for change in the operation of the medical card service.  Each application for a medical card should be examined on its merits and not on rigid income grounds.  I had a case recently of a child who was suffering from a rare disease.</P>
    <P>The father and mother were doing everything in their power to look after the needs of the child and they were succeeding.  It was imposing a monumental burden on the household budget to look after the child as well as they would like to.  I made representations for a medical card, on their behalf, for the child.  They realised they were not entitled to a medical card but we looked for a medical card for treatment for the child.  It was refused because of the income of the father.  This was a normal middle income family, living in a nice home and doing the best they could for the rest of the family and struggling, as most couples are, in that situation.  If a medical card could have been provided for this child with a rare disease, the situation in that household would have been improved and the problem <Col N="817" /> of the child could have been put into its proper dimension.  Because of the rigidity of the regulations with regard to the allocation of medical cards, it was not possible to achieve that very desirable goal.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise a few general points about the operation of the medical services.  One is the question of the long delay being experienced by applicants for eye tests.  I dealt with a case recently of a young first year university student.  She came from a working class background, a description I despise.  Her parents had made tremendous efforts to send her to university. That young girl was attending lectures but because of defective eyesight she found she could not read the blackboard properly and consequently was missing a lot at lectures.  She asked for an eye test and was told she would have to wait three months. Therefore, three solid months of her year's course at the university would have been wasted.  She came along to me.  I took up her case with the health authority and they sorted it out for me.  But there are many other people in the same situation who would not go to their local Deputy no matter from what side of the House he might be, and should not have to approach their local Deputy about such problems. A three months' delay for something as basic as an eye test is wrong and the Minister should endeavour to take some action in that respect.</P>
    <P>The best principle to be applied with regard to medicine is that prevention is better than cure and in relation to the problem of alcoholism and smoking that principle should be emphasised particularly.  I would appeal to the Minister to introduce and enforce a firm set of advertising codes, particularly on RTE.  I am not saving that the other forms of advertising are blameless but I am concerned particularly about the drink advertisements and the messages being put across in them on television.  Probably alcohol is the single greatest curse in this country.  Even to view it on pure economics, in terms of a national loss, the figures are dramatic.  In terms of human loss and misery experienced by families of alcoholics no money <Col N="818" /> value can be placed on it.  What do we see at present?</P>
    <P>Despite general recognition of the problem of alcoholism, advertisements are put out on television which imply that success in business or attraction to the opposite sex is related directly to the type or amount of particular drink consumed.  This is something we should abhor and about which the Minister should take some action ensuring that a proper code of advertising conduct is enforced by RTE.  I know they do have a code of conduct. I know they have regulations.  I have seen a copy of them.  In themselves they are quite good but I do not think they go far enough.  It is the flaunting of these regulations by advertisers which creates the problem.  The Minister should have firm legislation available to him which he can implement in order to prevent the problem of alcoholism becoming even greater. The same can be said also in respect of smoking advertisements in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the health service and the operations of the Department of Health to which not sufficient attention is paid is that of the health inspectors and their role.  Again, we come back to the principle of prevention being better than cure.  The health inspector should be the man preventing large-scale problems of abuse of facilities.  I would appeal to the Minister to ask the health inspectors to pay greater attention to the toilet facilities generally in pubs, hotels and public buildings, especially in premises involved in the sale of food or drink.  In many modern lounges there are to be found the plush carpets, soft lights and music in the sales area while, at the same time, the toilet accommodation is like something straight out of Dickens' time.  There is nothing more disgusting for anybody, native or tourist, than to have to use such facilities.  If the public toilet facilities being provided are that bad, what are we to assume are the facilities provided for the staff?  And it will be the same staff who will handle food and drink and serve them to the general public. Surely that constitutes a major health <Col N="819" /> hazard and comes back to the question of prevention.  I would appeal to the Minister to ask his health inspectors to place greater emphasis on the question of proper hygiene in these pubs, hotels and other public buildings.  A lot of that can be done by imposing proper regulations when granting applications for alterations or extensions to such public premises.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to pay public compliment to the doctors, nurses and others involved in the health field for their dedication and attention to the people living in my area of North County Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The field of health is very vast, indeed, in that it touches directly every member of the community. I should like to confine my few comments to the area which I represent and then, if I may, enlarge the situation in the national context.</P>
      <P>The constituency of Wicklow is difficult to administer from the health point of view.  That difficulty is borne out by the problems experienced by people depending on where they reside within the county.  Residents in the north of the county are well served by the hospitals in the south County Dublin area generally.  They do not have great mileage to cover and, as Saint Columcille's hospital in Loughlinstown&mdash;to which I shall revert in a moment&mdash;develops it will cater for the growing areas of north Wicklow and its population.  With regard to the west of the county, Baltinglass has a unit which was developed over the past few years.  It meets the immediate needs of the community there.  Not too far from Baltinglass there is a hospital in Athy and one in Carlow.  Blessington is served by the Dublin area and Naas.</P>

    <P>The people who reside in the Arklow area face special problems.  Arklow is a growing town.  Up to a short time ago it was a boom town but now it has been caught in the recession. Nevertheless, approximately 3.000 people are employed in industries there. The difficulties in that town arise because of its geographical location. Arklow is within the ambit of the Eastern Health Board and the nearest district hospital is in Gorey, ten miles <Col N="820" /> away, which comes within the ambit of the South-Eastern Health Board. The people of Arklow have grievances and, more seriously, they have worries. They are concerned because maternity cases must be brought 45 miles to Dublin, or a little less to St. Columcille's. I know the Minister is aware of this.  When he announces his plan for hospitals throughout the country I hope he will take cognisance of the fact that this is a developing area and facilities will have to be provided in the immediate neighbourhood.  If the Minister should decide to develop the district hospital in Gorey this might meet the people's needs.  Because of the risk for industries in Arklow facilities will have to be provided for the people of the area.</P>
    <P>Planning permission for a health centre in Arklow has been obtained from the Wicklow County Council. This will meet many of the day to day needs of the community.  It will provide services for the young and the aged but will not offer the maternity facilities required.  If there should be a small disaster in the area&mdash;we had one blast in the fertiliser factory which happily did not result in any loss of life or suffering&mdash;what would the Minister and his Department do?  This is a very difficult situation.  The Minister has met deputations.  We have met representatives at the local advisory committee level in Wicklow and have passed the representations to the health board.  The health board officials have met with the officials of the Department on two occasions.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this.  If he is so aware, I hope he will activate his awareness by coming up with a definite proposal for the area.</P>
    <P>There is very heavy traffic on the roads between Dublin and Rosslare. Even though these roads are being continually improved, the traffic tends to slow down the transportation of patients.  Therefore I hope the Department will give the area what it needs&mdash;a good district hospital.  Of course, I realise that the costs would be very heavy.  I would appreciate it if the Minister in his reply could give some hope to those people so that they can see that some progress, even <Col N="821" /> if it is only theoretical, is being made. As I said, it is practical progress we desire but that appears to be a little further off now due to the cut-back situation.</P>
    <P>Blessington and Dunlavin have been assigned a health centre.  Limited capital to commence operations has been made available by the health board.  This indicates exactly the cash difficulties at the moment.  It would appear that the clinic programme has been held up because of shortage of money.</P>
    <P>St. Columcille's Hospital is to be developed.  It needs developing on a few fronts.  Might I remind the Minister of the urgency of having heating, hot water, electrical and mechanical services provided for this hospital? The consulting engineer of the health board is very worried and concerned about the condition of existing services which are overdue for replacement. I hope that action will be taken on this front.</P>
    <P>I have a note in front of me which states that on 29th January, 1974, a report was given to the local visiting committee.  The members expressed concern and said that their officials were in touch with the Department of Health.  They were asking the Department to make a capital allocation available for the work which will cost in the region of £100,000. I read the Minister's speech and the documentation furnished with it but was unable to trace the £100,000 for this work in Loughlinstown hospital. I believe there is a plan with the Department for the provision of 200 beds for an adult mentally-handicapped centre in that hospital.</P>
    <P>I should be pleased to learn of the progress that has been made.  I saw a copy of the plan which seemed to have been very carefully drawn up, meeting all the needs.  I was present at the visiting committee meeting and I thought afterwards that this scheme for Loughlinstown would get the green light in the Department.  I wonder if there is some difficulty besides finance holding up the scheme.  The site is available and development could commence if the cash were there. <Col N="822" /> Perhaps the Minister will advert to it in his reply.  I know he is concerned personally with the problem of the mentally handicapped as well as being head of the Department of Health.  The Loughlinstown development would go some way towards relieving the strain in other centres such as St. Ita's.</P>
    <P>I have been looking at the allocation my health board received from the Department for this year, £23.5 million.  It was notified to us on 20th November last and the document which accompanied it stated it would maintain services at their present level.  Many Deputies have referred to the point that it is not possible to maintain services at their present level even with increased allocations. The Minister has a statement from my health board, dated 9th April last, seeking supplementary funds of £1.315 million.  This includes a number of items of excess expenditure, all of them essential.  I do not know if it is the Department's policy to make a certain sum available on the hypothesis that if pressure is put on them they will come up with more money. If that is so it is bad policy because it does not facilitate planning ahead.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to dental care and treatment.  I have details of the allocation by the Department towards dental appliances and external dental treatment.  I also have the estimated expenditure for 1975, based on trends, from the staff of my health board.  The departmental allocation towards dental appliances as listed in circular HSG 330, dated 20th November, 1974, is £22,000 whereas the estimated expenditure by the board was £32,000, a shortfall of £10,000.  For external dental treatment, the shortfall between the Department's allocation and our estimate is £24,000&mdash; £6,500 allocation as against estimated expenditure of £30,500.  Of the Department's allocation of £6,500 a large proportion would go in grants to the dental hospital.  We are concerned about dental care and if the Minister wants to try to catch up with the backlog&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree it is difficult to catch up with a backlog but if it were a receding backlog it would not be so bad.  The Minister must take a good look at this.  Perhaps he would come up with the extra money needed to remove this backlog, which is a growing one.  Not only have we lists of people seeking dental care at our various health centres but added to them are adults from the eligible non-insured section.  Has any agreement been reached with private dentists to try to erode this backlog? I understand discussions may be under way between the IDA and the Department on a fee per item basis.  Is there any indication that agreement is near?  It is only by incorporating more dentists from the private sector that we will have any hope of coping with the demand for treatment.</P>

      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The housing situation in Dún Laoghaire Borough has been receiving my close personal attention since I took office.  At that time, the corporation's housing programme was at a very low ebb because they had practically no reserve of land for housing. This major handicap has now been overcome and the present programme comprises a total of 1,044 houses or sites.</P>
      <P>Work is in progress, or ready to be started on 108 dwellings, while plans are being prepared for schemes comprising 336 dwellings.  An additional reserve of 600 sites is available.</P>
      <P>I understand from the corporation that there are 520 applicants on their general list for rehousing and a further 105 applications have been received from elderly and single persons.</P>

For instance, Dublin Corporation have been operating a monitoring station in O'Connell Street since December, 1973, to measure lead concentration in the air and a second station was established by them last year in a residential area for the same purpose.  Discussions have recently taken place with the corporation with a view to the establishment of a monitoring station to measure the concentrations of a variety of substances at a site in the city centre.</P>
      <P>The whole problem of emissions from motor vehicles is embodied in the environment programme of the EEC, with which we are keeping in close touch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A new sewage treatment works costing £269,000 is now operating satisfactorily and I understand that there is a reduction in phosphates, but it will take some time to establish what effect this reduction will have on the water quality in the lake or whether, in fact, tertiary treatment of the effluent from the works would be likely to be more effective in preventing eutrophication. When the local authority have obtained technical advice on these matters, it will be for them to initiate any scheme necessary.  There are no proposals before my Department at present.  I would remind the Deputy however that the assistance given by my Department towards the cost of sanitary services schemes is given by way of contributions to the annual loan charges incurred by the local authorities in repaying the loans raised to finance the schemes and that the rate of assistance appropriate to schemes provided by the Killarney Urban District Council is 50 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government announced last year that they would assist local voluntary groups who wished to establish information centres to be known as Community Information Centres and invited the National Social Service Council to act as the central agency in the establishment of such centres.  It is envisaged that the centres will provide an information service covering the whole range of statutory entitlements and benefits, including matters related to housing.  In the circumstances, therefore, I do not consider that separate advice bureaux for persons buying a house for the first time are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share fully, however, the Deputy's concern for house purchasers.  Because <Col N="850" /> I believe it is important that they should be well informed on the many aspects of house purchase, I have recently had published a booklet entitled &ldquo;A Home of Your Own&rdquo; which contains basic and detailed housing information. Copies of the booklet were recently circulated to all Deputies and it is available free of charge on request from my Department.  I do not, however, see any present need to sponsor television programmes specifically for the purpose of warning people of the difficulties involved in house purchase.</P>

      <Col N="857" /> Where permission has already been obtained under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, for the provision of a house which does not include such a facility, the necessary work to provide for a solid fuel fireplace or stove, with chimney or flue, will be regarded as exempt development, except in cases where it would involve major alternation in design.</P>
    <P>However, proposals for fireplaces and flues do require approval under the Dublin County Council building bye-laws and certain prefabricated chimneys with twin wall flues have been refused as the council was not satisfied that sufficient evidence was given to satisfy it that the proposals did not constitute a fire risk.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 40 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out on the last occasion this measure was being discussed the unfairness of the situation which arises under this section by virtue of the fact that, if a trustee or an assignee in bankruptcy or under a deed of arrangement, disposes of the assets of the bankrupt capital gains tax will be chargeable on those assets in the same way as if the man had never become bankrupt and the considerable <Col N="870" /> gain which, in some circumstances, might accrue to the assignee in bankruptcy, much or all of it accruing after the bankruptcy took place, becomes liable to tax.  Now the only people who suffer by that are the creditors of the bankrupt and it seems very unfair that where the creditors were fortunate enough that there was some gain in the value of the bankrupt's assets after the bankruptcy the State should come in and take 26 per cent of that gain from them.</P>
      <P>The Minister on the last occasion made the point that payments due to the State, such as income tax, or due locally, such as rates, were entitled to priority of payment before the ordinary creditors.  I am aware this is so but this is a totally different situation because the income tax that might be due, or the value-added tax, or the rates, would only have accrued due before the bankruptcy took place.  In those circumstances much of the gain might well have taken place after the bankruptcy and it seems very unfair that the creditors' dividend, which might already be a small one, is further diminished by the assets being reduced by a further 26 per cent due to the State stepping in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a wrong principle.  If the bankrupt owed capital gains tax before his bankruptcy, fair enough, let the State take that in the same way as income tax, value-added tax, or anything else due but, in the normal way, no income tax would accrue due between the time of bankruptcy and the time of the realisation or disposal of the assets by the assignee or the trustee.  I think, therefore, the same principle should apply so far as capital gains tax is concerned, namely, any gain made on the assets by the assignee should go to the people for whose benefit he is there.  The creditors, and the State should not step in and seek to take 26 per cent of that gain from creditors who already may be getting a very small payment in the pound.  As well as the creditors being affected in some cases the bankrupt himself may well be affected because he may be endeavouring to discharge his liabilities in full and it seems very unfair to him if, after he became bankrupt and when <Col N="871" /> his assets were in the hands of the assignee, some capital gain arose the State should claim 26 per cent of that capital gain to the detriment of the creditors and to the ultimate detriment of the bankrupt himself.  The Minister should amend this section to meet that kind of situation and not put the creditors at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> the State which is coming in to take more than a quarter of something that should in fact be for the benefit of the creditors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley touched on one aspect in his final remarks but he did not mention that the creditors will have the benefit of 74 per cent of any gain. That is nearly three times greater than what the State may get.  The essence of capital gains is that it is treated for tax purposes as similar to income and income earned by an official assignee on a bankrupt's assets may, under existing law, be liable to income tax. If that is a valid treatment under existing law, and I believe it is proper treatment of assets under existing law and income tax liability arises, then the same principle must be applicable to capital gains.  It does not necessarily operate to the detriment, as Deputy O'Malley suggests, of creditors because there could be many cases in which the assets when realised would yield more than the total debts.  These situations have to be borne in mind just as much as those in which the dividends might be less than the full amount of the indebtedness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I suggest that the Minister might look further at this? In the case he has just mentioned, where on the realisation of the assets there is, in fact, a surplus it is clearly a different position from that described by Deputy O'Malley.  In that case it would seem to me that, subject to something I want to say in a moment, what would happen is that the creditors should be paid in full and that the capital gains tax should be levied then on whatever balance is available over and above the amount needed to discharge all the debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a case for saying <Col N="872" /> that this kind of treatment might require that one would not make any concession if the disposal, which produces the capital gain, is to an individual or a company connected with the bankrupt or the debtor as the case may be.  Obviously, there could be abuse if that were allowed. There would not be any great difficulty in excluding cases of that kind. Therefore, confining it to genuine cases of bankruptcy and of creditors who are losing out&mdash;in some cases the loss for the creditors can be very serious&mdash;I believe there is a distinction between the collection and the giving of preferential treatment to debts due to the State for tax in respect of debts which have accrued to the State prior to the bankruptcy or the arrangement with the creditors.</P>
    <P>I consider this is different.  While the Minister says that income tax may be payable on income earned by, for example, the assignee in bankruptcy during the course of bankruptcy, I doubt if he can point to any cases where such has happened.  It seems to me to be a most unusual and most unlikely occurrence.  I urge the Minister to consider this matter strongly.  I am quite sure he is aware, from his personal experience in practice, that there is a certain amount of resentment at the fact that when a bankruptcy occurs there is a preference given to the State in regard to debts due.  That is the position as it is.</P>
    <P>Resentment would be very much greater if, as a result of the provision in this section, gains accruing after the bankruptcy become liable to capital gains tax so that either creditors are not paid in full or they are paid even less than they would be paid in respect of a tax liability, which arose after the bankruptcy took place, in cases of genuine claims, excluding disposals to persons connected with the bankrupt or the debtor.  I fully accept they must be excluded to avoid creating a loophole here.  In the genuine cases we are trying to discuss I expect the Minister to see that there is a case for saying that the State should not collect capital gains tax on a gain which <Col N="873" /> occurs after the bankruptcy to the detriment of the creditors, unless, as a result of the gain, there is solvency so that the creditors are paid in full. Then, of course, the State should get its share of the gains.  I urge the Minister to consider this matter very seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to that of Deputy Colley and Deputy O'Malley on this. The Minister must advert to the importance of principle here.  Let us go back to the root of the matter.  You have a bankruptcy.  A bankruptcy or a liquidation nearly always means that you have a position where there is a failure.  The whole idea of the operation is to try to gather in salvage for the people who are entitled to something.  If a person or a company goes into bankruptcy or liquidation and there are not funds to meet all the debts, then the trustee, assignee, liquidator or whoever it is, becomes a trustee for the debtors. The person who went into debt, the person or company responsible, ceases at that stage to have rights.  There has been failure of some person who owes something to meet commitments. After that the principle is to salvage what is to be salvaged for the benefit of those creditors who are entitled to get the proceeds and who are likely to get only part of what is justly owing to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise this point because in all other cases like this it is important to grasp what is the principle.  The principle is that there are a number of people who are in justice and in right entitled to certain payments which cannot be met because of the default of the person or concern which got into the position of being unable to meet its commitments and consequently brought about the operations appertaining to bankruptcy or liquidation.  If that is so, these creditors are on a par with anybody else.  The probability is that they are making a loss but if that is the case they are entitled to be treated in regard to that loss the same as anybody else.  If they are making a gain, they <Col N="874" /> are entitled to be treated like anybody else in that regard also.  It brings up, at this point, the question of capital gains.  The Minister cannot in this case, as I will show in a moment, confuse income tax with capital gains.  In this Bill and in this section we are dealing with the question whether there is a gain or loss on an operation. Remember, the creditors in the case&mdash; and collectively they are to be regarded as the assignee, the trustee or the liquidator&mdash;either collectively or individually will either make a loss, break even, or make a gain.</P>
    <P>I submit on this principle that if a loss is made on the overall&mdash;that is the aggregation of the loss&mdash;they are entitled to the benefit of the loss and, on a partial transaction which still leaves the realisation of the asset in a debt position, that does not justify the charging of capital gains on specific operations.  Put it this way.  If, for instance, an individual goes into bankruptcy, if he owes £100,000, and amongst his assets there are some stocks and shares which he sells at a profit, or his trustee or assignee sells them at a profit, even if there is a profit on those stocks and shares&mdash; let us say arbitrarily amounting to £50,000&mdash;if through the failure of other parts of these assets the net realisable value of the estate is below the £100,000 which he owes, a loss is being made and it is unfair to aggravate that loss by charging a capital gain on portion of the process of realisation.</P>
    <P>I think that is what my colleagues have been pointing out.  We are dealing here with capital gains.  I support the point made by Deputy Colley that, in the case of this man who owes £100,000, if through the realisation of his assets there is a gain for the creditors, or a gain for anybody beyond what was owed, by all means let the State get its capital gain, <i>pro rata.</i> If there is a loss, it is unjust and inequitable and contrary to the whole tenor of what the Minister is doing elsewhere in the Bill to charge gains on a portion and so aggravate the loss.</P>
    <P>The Minister has argued with us <Col N="875" /> throughout the debate on this Bill on the question of setting off losses and gains at many points.  I may be wrong in this, but this is the first point which strikes me very forcibly as a case where it is a question of not just setting off but using gains positively to increase a loss.  I join with Deputy Colley in making the point about solvency.  If there is solvency the question does not arise.  Let there be equality for all.  If there is insolvency the argument may stand.</P>
    <P>I realise that this is a practical difficulty for the Minister, and all my colleagues realise it too.  I am sure the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister's advisers would be apprehensive on this point.  One can easily think up possibilities of evasive tactics.  All I will say at this point is that there should be a specific examination of that problem.  Deputy Colley has said that he would accept transactions to the parties interested. In other words, what he is saying is that it should be a transaction in the open market and for the benefit of creditors who are strangers.  If there is solvency, well and good.  There must be protection against evasion. Anti-avoidance comes in here.</P>
    <P>I want to take the Minister up on a point about income tax.  As Deputy Colley said, quite rightly, there has been a certain amount of resentment about the priority given to State debts.  If the State is the creditor in the case and the State is owed a debt, it has become traditional that the State gets preferential treatment and income tax ranks to such a degree that income tax would be payable. Income tax is a totally different tax from the tax determined by a gain or a profit on a transaction.  There is a fundamental distinction in principle.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could argue with the Minister that, in such a case, income tax may be preferentially treated.  I freely concede to the Minister that income tax is a debt to the State and that the State is a creditor in the whole transaction just as much as anybody else.  I do not seek to suggest at this point that the State should forego its claim on the assets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> Whether it is a question of the priority of the State claim, or whether the State claim should be there at all is beside the point on this section.  With due respect to the Minister&mdash;and I hope he will take it in the spirit in which I say it&mdash;to advance that argument is specious.  In principle it is a totally different thing.  Here we are dealing with gains or losses on capital in a transaction. Surely the charging of gains without offsetting the losses otherwise would be wrong, if the debtors, individually or collectively, through the assignee or the trustee are at a loss overall.</P>
    <P>I shall advance a little further on that argument.  It is this: if I have opened up an argument now as to the charging of losses and gains in the hands of the assignee by the example I gave of, say, the selling of a large number of shares at an enhanced value as a capital gain and still not realising the full debt owed, I was careful not to expand in any detail as to what would be the nature of the loss concerned. At this stage anyway I do not want to confuse the issue on the question of setting off capital gains and capital losses within the meaning of this section.  I want to focus attention finally on the fact of justice.  Whatever are the technicalities of the Bill, as long as there is made an overall loss, as long as there is a settlement of the claim of the creditor of less than £1 in the £1, then the charging of a tax on capital gains in partial transactions within the overall process is indefensible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I should like to support Deputy Colley and Deputy de Valera in this matter.  I go a long way with what Deputy Colley has said in regard to a situation in which the State must always come in first and take its full pound of flesh in a bankruptcy case. I would separate the questions of income tax and capital gains tax on a liquidation property.  Anyone who has studied how manufacturers and wholesalers give extended credit will know that they do so quite often on the collateral of the person to whom they are granting it.  If one stretches one's mind back over the past seven or eight years <Col N="877" /> in this city to circumstances in which people have gone bankrupt, if one looks at their creditors, one will see the circumstances in which credit was granted.  Take the example of a man who, say, buys a property for £50,000. He has creditors of £200,000 and he goes bankrupt.  That property is then sold for £150,000, leaving a capital gain of £100,000.  On such an occasion if the State entered in, it would take £26,000.  I could visualise the case of, say, a builders' suppliers who would give extended credit in the building up a company, to one of their creditors, be it a hotel or any other type of business.  Naturally they extend such credit on the collateral of the person to whom they were granting it.  They will not give extended credit unless they are fairly sure that collateral exists where they are giving it.  If that person having received extended credit, goes bankrupt&mdash;whether the credit be granted by a builders' suppliers or anybody else&mdash;the capital gain built up on that property was done at the expense of somebody else.  Indeed, credit that might have been given by many other manufacturers and wholesalers may have been built up along the same lines.  The State has no justification for coming in there and taking 26 per cent of a liquidation sale.  The State entering in and taking 26 per cent before the assets are distributed is totally unjust.</P>
      <P>Nobody need tell me that there is not a distinct difference between that type of money due to the State and income tax.  Income tax is money earned during the time the business was in operation, and I can see a case for that, although I do not agree that the State should always get its 100 per cent and that other unfortunate creditors&mdash; as happens at present&mdash;get only 10p or 15p in the £.  That being the case, we can do nothing about it but I have always thought it to be an unjust law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But in the situation where creditors are investigating the assets of a man who has gone into liquidation, they can assess him fairly accurately&mdash;if one is owed £20,000 or £30,000, perhaps assessing it so that they will get at least 50p in the £.  Such people will receive a very rude awakening if this section is passed because, if there is <Col N="878" /> any capital gain on the sale, the State will come in and take its pound of flesh first.  The Minister should take a further look at this section because there is no justice in it, when one thinks of the unfortunate situation in which creditors will now find themselves.  The majority of companies investigate the assets of their creditors&mdash;they have to to guarantee the extent of their credit&mdash;and get a fairly shrewd idea of whether their money is safe.  Now they will have to reduce their assessment by 26 per cent of what will be the collateral if this situation materialises under the Bill. I know there are possibilities of evasion but they can be overcome.  This section if passed, would penalise many innocent people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just add this point?  Once the thing gets into the hands of the trustees, the assignee or the liquidator, there will be a net result&mdash;there will be a loss, a breakeven or a gain.  In the first two cases I suggest the simple and correct thing to do is to leave it as it is; if there is a gain take the tax.  I am pointing out that, in doing this, the State is at an advantage.  In most other cases there would be the possibility of setting off capital losses against capital gains.  But if one approaches it in the simple method advocated by Deputy Colley&mdash;because, in essence, that is what he said&mdash;taking precautions against evasion by interested parties, in the end there will be one of three results&mdash;a loss where no gain is made; a breakdown where no gain is made; a profit where a gain is made, which may be taxed.  There is no other possibility of any compensating loss which the Minister has to consider unless there were a series of bankruptcies, and I will leave it to the ingenuity of lawyers and others to think out the possibilities of that.  I grant it is an evasion tactic which might be worthy of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the principle again. Wait for the overall result.  If there is a loss, there is no gain, no tax; if there is a breakeven no gain, no tax; if it is a profit, there is a gain, then tax, but there will be no complications about the setting off of losses or anything else.  In fact waiting until the <Col N="879" /> end and taking it in that simple way would be one of the very best ways of defeating the possibility of subtle and sophisticated operations to manipulate losses and gains in bankruptcy.  The implications of the section, treating it as completely part of the code, creates certain suggestions on which I shall not elaborate here.  I should hate to spoil the chances there may be in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who otherwise would not be paid in full.  If that principle were to be universally applied there could be a situation where annual income tax might be reduced by the amount by which at the end of a financial year a debtor owed money to his creditors.  The community is entitled to a certain income under certain taxes, because that is what the State's revenue is.  It is wrong that the revenue should be surrendered in part.  It is possible that many bankrupts in the past might not have suffered bankruptcy if they had not to pay income tax, but I have never heard it argued that the State should forego its right to be paid income tax in order to make more money available for creditors.  I would ask Deputies to look very carefully at what they are arguing and they will see they are making a proposition which is not open to serious consideration because it amounts to using the public purse to meet a private debt.  That situation applies as much before bankruptcy as after.  If there are assets which yield an income after bankruptcy, an income which is liable to income tax, at the moment that tax is payable before the dividend is paid to creditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although Deputies have sought to make a distinction between income from capital assets and assets which have a capital gain, there is in principle no difference.  I could not see my way to accepting those arguments unless <Col N="880" /> they were to be universally applied.  I do not think that one should seriously entertain that suggestion.  We are taxing capital gains because capital gains are considered to be not dissimilar to income, something which is occurring and growing all the time. It is paid only at the time of disposal because it is convenient for the taxpayer to pay at that time.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council considered that the most appropriate capital gains tax might be one which would be payable, irrespective of whether gains were realised. They accepted that that might be difficult to operate in practice.  Indeed, I know of no country where such a capital gains tax operates.  We are not proposing that it should be paid until the capital gain is realised.  Suppose the principle as recommended were to be applied, then the capital gains tax would be payable on such gains as would be calculated as occurring in a specific year.  It is a recurring tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's arguments and accept them in the spirit in which he made them. First, there is a <i>non sequiter</i> where his argument in regard to income tax is concerned.  Income tax is a totally different thing and I was very careful to say I accepted that.  Here we are dealing with an ultimate capital gain. In principle when we come to a bankruptcy or a liquidation we are dealing with a capital matter.  It has come to the stage that the capital status of the person or the concern comes into question.  It is fundamentally a question of a capital transaction.  The analogy with income tax is wrong.  I made no point about the State's priority on its claims for income tax. Whether it is that of the debtor himself, or the income tax of the creditors or the income tax appropriate at any other point of the transaction concerned is not in issue.  What is in issue here is the gain or loss on a capital transaction.  In the nature of the situation we are considering this is a capital transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;the public purse to meet private debts&rdquo;. That is not the whole answer, if it is an answer at all, and for this reason: when one gets down to the basic reality one realises that debts are not an abstract thing unfortunately; they are tangible, owed to persons ascertainable. There are a number of <Col N="882" /> persons to whom money is owing.  If they get their full entitlement there is no question.  If they do not, then there is a loss.  Therefore, it is not a question of the public paying for private debts.  In principle under this Act if a man is engaged in any transaction of a capital nature and makes a gain, that gain is taxable.  If he makes a loss he will not have to pay.  Here the Minister may again join issue with me.</P>
    <P>I say that the nature of the transactions, the basic circumstances considered in sections 40 and 41, are such as to make the whole thing a capital transaction.  I will go along with the Minister initially as far as examination is concerned if he suggests that all payments arising out of bankruptcy and liquidation are to be regarded as capital payments.  I am going further along Deputy Colley's path in saying I would be in favour of blocking the loophole if the Minister were to take the approach we are advocating where somebody could say that part of a debt paid afterwards was not of a capital nature.  If the Minister sticks to his point of view it would be only just to say that when the compounding of fractions in the payment to the creditor took place it should be treated as a capital loss in his hands.</P>
    <P>We could go on arguing this forever and I do not want to delay either the House or the Minister or to develop details unnecessarily.  Income tax is different and if the Minister is to be too specious in sweeping our arguments aside we will not have a good Bill.  My net point is that if there is a gain let the Minister have the gain but if there is a loss let it be treated as a loss.  I do not think that in the end the State would lose anything but if the State attempts to put partial gains in a loss position it is defrauding creditors.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister's natural caution in this and the apprehension of his advisers.  If this House is to be of any use at all in the legislative process, it is if new ideas emerge or a different approach to that of the Minister and his advisers emerges, and it is no reflection on the <Col N="883" /> Minister or on the advice he has received.  What often happens in this House is that between us, tossing the ball and the argument across, ideas emerge that clarify a situation which at the beginning was difficult, and simplicity emerges.  Simplicity would emerge here if we were to say that at the end of the transaction it were to be treated, when the result was known, as a capital one and assessed accordingly.  In such a situation the Minister would have no trouble with losses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to comment on the case made by Deputy Fitzpatrick, which seems to me to be true in many cases, particularly in the case of trade creditors&mdash; the credit was extended in contemplation of the asset.  If that is so, is it not wrong for the State to step in and collect the tax before the benefit of that capital gain has been applied in respect of the creditor who extends his credit in contemplation of that gain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One could ask why do people extend credit.  Credit is usually extended only where the creditor is satisfied that the debtor is in good financial standing.  The debtor's assets are only one part of that.  Obviously his liability is another thing.  Which creditor knows in detail the totality of the debtor's liability? Usually a creditor does not, and his judgment is made simply on the reputation of the debtor, because he is recognised as a person who customarily pays his debts as he goes along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is from such assessment as that, which includes several different factors, that a decision is made whether a creditor would extend credit to a would-be debtor.  Even at the moment of the creation of bankruptcy under the law as it stands, creditors are frequently not in a position to know what the debtor's position is and it is only after some time, when the official assignee has gone in and made his inquiries, that the true picture is revealed of the debts and liabilities.  Even then there are uncertainties as to whether valuations <Col N="884" /> made will ultimately be realised on disposal and this can only be ascertained in the light of administration of the bankrupt estate.</P>
    <P>I would accept that Deputy Fitzpatrick is right in saying that creditors take into account the value of debtors' assets, but as I have said, that is only one thing to be taken into account. Even inquiries from other traders will not reveal the full position because, while one may have friends in the trade, that will not reveal a bankrupt's tax position.  Unfortunately, all too often in bankruptcy the Revenue Commissioners are creditors and not infrequently they can be the most substantial creditors not merely in regard to income tax but nowadays in regard to VAT and PAYE tax which is neither the property of the debtor nor his employees.  There are a multitude of different things that have to be looked into.</P>
    <P>I am not unsympathetic with the argument put forward but I would not think it proper to give an undertaking to bring in an amendment to meet the argument without looking into all the other considerations I have mentioned.  I will certainly look at it having regard to the obligations which I must discharge, which every Minister for Finance must discharge&mdash;that is, to protect the public purse.  It is the community who benefit.</P>

      <P>What is the effect of &ldquo;subsection (1) shall not apply,&rdquo; which is the last provision of subsection (3)?  Perhaps on closer analysis it might be different but on the face of it it looks to me as though the effect of subsection (1) is that where the assets vest in the trustee or assignee then any transaction by the trustee or assignee which produces a gain is subject to capital gains tax.  Is the effect of providing that subsection (1) shall not apply that in the case envisaged in subsection (3) a gain arising in those circumstances would not be subject to capital gains tax or what is the effect of saying &ldquo;subsection (1) shall not apply&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>Of course, the personal representative on the disposal of property may well have a liability to pay capital gains tax on an asset.

In subsection (3) it says that subsection (1) shall not apply in those circumstances.  In circumstances envisaged in subsection (3) if there is a disposal producing a gain will the gain be subject to tax which will be assessable on and recoverable from the person who will be regarded as the personal representative?</P>

      <P>Could I ask a further question on the wording of that subsection?  The subsection says that assets vesting in a trustee in bankruptcy after death of the bankrupt or debtor shall for the purposes of this Act be regarded as held by the personal representative of the deceased. Does that mean that for the purposes of this Act they are to be regarded as held by the personal representative? Does it mean that the personal representative is going to take the liability of the assignee? You have cut out subsection (1).  Subsection (2) for the moment appears to me to be fairly neutral in this regard. The assets vested are to be regarded as held by a personal representative of the deceased.  It is &ldquo;a personal representative&rdquo;, I grant you, but could that be construed as meaning that the whole thing was transferred to the deceased's personal representative? Suppose I have a personal representative and I happen to be bankrupt as <Col N="887" /> well; there is an assignee in my bankruptcy and there is a personal representative. Suppose I try to set up the case, if I were the assignee, that having regard to the impact of subsection (1) I could turn to the personal representative and say &ldquo;Over to you, boy&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Which is it?  The words &ldquo;vesting in&rdquo; suggest an interesting time factor as to when the vesting takes place.  Even assuming that the vesting takes place after death the drafting of the section might attract a little attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to bring into play section 14 subsection (1) which states how the assets of a deceased person are to be dealt with on death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested that to the Minister some few minutes ago. The effect of section 14 subsection (1) is to provide that death shall not constitute a disposal for the purposes of capital gains tax.  I am quoting now from the explanatory memorandum, page 5, relating to section 14.  It goes on to say that the legatee is deemed to acquire the assets at their cost to the deceased and any gain on a later disposal shall be calculated by reference to that cost.  You have there a totally different situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely why I raised this question.  It seems peculiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley is very much justified in raising this as a serious anomaly because where the <Col N="888" /> debtor dies while he is in bankruptcy and while his assets are in the possession of the assignee a completely new set of rules apply.  Why should they be allowed to apply there and not apply just because the man happens to be fortunate enough not to die?  The situation therefore is that if the debtor can survive his period in bankruptcy his creditors will not get the full benefit of any capital gain; but if he should die before he is discharged and while there are assets still in the possession of his assignee, the assignee then comes into the position of a personal representative.  Under section 14 (1), the death of the debtor should not be regarded as a disposal for the purposes of capital gains tax and the asset in question would be liable to capital gains tax in the hands of the transferee of it only on a later disposal, and the gain would then be calculated by reference to the cost to the deceased debtor.</P>
      <P>In other words, where the man dies there is a completely new set of rules, and the very arguments we were advancing in regard to the State coming in to take 26 per cent of the gain as against the creditors seem to be recognised in the case where the man dies.  Of course, in the great majority of cases the debtor does not die in the course of his bankruptcy proceedings, but if he does die why should the creditors be in this much stronger position?  If the principle is wrong when he is alive, why is it right when he is dead?  If the Minister's arguments in connection with what happens when the debtor is alive are valid, why are they invalid when he is dead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not affect at all the position of creditors.  All we are doing here is to ensure that the transition on death which is provided for in section 14 will apply notwithstanding the presence, as it were, of the assignee in bankruptcy.  We are saying that even though that person is there, the position provided for in section 14 (1) which arises on death will apply.  If we did not have this provision here, then the provisions in section 14 could not apply.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The profit is passed and <Col N="890" /> gone, but I can visualise cases where people supply the building trade, hotels and so on.  How many times have we seen a builder go bankrupt half way through the building of a scheme of houses?  How many times have we seen this in relation to hotels that have been developed considerably?  I have known cases where it has happened to an hotel, and there would be a big capital gain on the sale of that hotel, but there could be extensive credit from builders' suppliers.  That outstanding credit that was given contributed to the building of the capital gain.  It is totally unjust that the man who supplied those goods should not get the amount due to him on that hotel before the State comes in for the capital gain.  I cannot see any logic in that if that type of operation works, and according to this section, it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I could understand the Minister's attitude if it were that he wanted to have a look at the section with a view possibly to closing loopholes of the kind I mentioned earlier, perhaps providing that a disposal to a connected person or company would be excluded; or the other thing we mentioned, that if the result of the liquidation is to make the estate solvent, there should be a claim on the surplus involved.  However, I am concerned about the principle involved here which I think the Minister has not, at the moment, accepted.  I think Deputy de Valera earlier summarised the matter fairly when he said that not to accept this principle is in effect, to have the State defrauding creditors in cases of bankruptcy.  I do not want to prolong this, but I am trying to establish whether or not the Minister accepts what we are saying.  I think he has left open the possibility that he might accept the principle&mdash;I am not talking about the details but the principle.  Is the position as far as the Minister is concerned still the same, that he wishes to review the position to see if he can accept the principle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I cannot accept that there is any question of the State defrauding creditors, unless the State is defrauding creditors also in charging income tax on assets in a similar situation.  Assets, when taken over, have not only their realisable value but also their earning value.  The State is charging and has always charged tax on earnings of such capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the fundamental point of difference.  Deputy Colley has asked that this be recognised as a capital transaction and the Minister has gone a certain distance with us in recognising that there is validity in the point.  I am not seeking to commit the Minister to anything even on the words he used.  But the Minister sticks to his point that this is on all-fours with income tax.  There we fundamentally and absolutely disagree. The Minister is perfectly right in saying that income tax is chargeable on the earnings of the capital asset but it is chargeable on earnings: this tax is charged on the gains of capital which are carefully distinguished from earnings. If the Minister's point was right there would be no need for any capital taxation; it would all be captured by the Income Tax Acts.  That is the point of fundamental disagreement.  We can disagree calmly but fundamentally. This is a point of principle, as far as I am concerned.  If the Minister is right <Col N="892" /> in his contention in equating income tax with what is here, all this capital legislation is an unnecessary futility. He could have captured the whole lot under the income tax code.  Quite clearly, he cannot do so; neither could it be caught anywhere else because we have capital gains and capital taxation provided for otherwise.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we are at the crunch point; either this is a capital matter or an income matter.  We cannot have it both ways.  That summarises in principle our position with complete understanding and appreciation of the Minister's argument and, I repeat, appreciation of his apprehension and of the reluctance of people who have worked very hard&mdash;and this Bill has the sign of hard work on it&mdash;to get a consistent code.  I am not to be taken as giving any&mdash;to use the Irish word&mdash; masla in this matter but I think a matter of fundamental principle has arisen between us.  I am strongly of opinion, and I think so are my colleagues, that this, being a capital matter, the arguments put forward initially by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Colley are valid.</P>

      <P>They are held at present in the Bank of Ireland and &ldquo;or any company&rdquo; is being put into the Bill in case there should be at any time a change.

      <P>It is with something like this in mind that I raise this question.  The Minister will be aware that some years ago the account in respect of national loans was transferred from the Bank of Ireland to the Central Bank, not because of any dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Bank of Ireland conducted that business but because it was felt to be more appropriate that the Central Bank should handle that kind of business.  If a change was made at some time in the future in regard to funds in court the most likely change would be to the Central Bank and I do not know whether the phrase, &ldquo;or any company&rdquo;, would cover the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>It is somewhat outside the realm of taxation we are dealing with now; it is a matter for courts to deal with the particular location of funds in court.  I would not like to express a view as to whether the Central Bank would be the likely location of funds in future. As the Deputy knows, it is not a bank engaged in the ordinary daily commercial transactions.  As funds in court can sometimes be quite small and may cover a large number of people it might not be the best equipped to handle it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) provides that if the accountant in the course of administration of the funds under his control makes transfers of investment from one account to another, the owner of the investment and not the accountant will be liable for tax on any gains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the necessity for the provision towards the end of this subsection:</P>
      <P>&mdash;notwithstanding that the investment of funds in court standing to an account in the books of the Accountant, or the realisation of funds which have been so invested, is effected by setting off, in the Accountant's accounts, investment in one account against realisation of investment in another.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a constant movement of funds into and out of court.  That subsection is intended to cover a situation where, as in the case of moneys received for a new suit, the accountant might, instead of investing these moneys directly transfer their equivalent in investments from another account from which moneys are due to be paid out.  Under the subsection the transfer of the investments to credit of the new account would be regarded as the acquisition of an asset by the beneficiary of the new account and he would be liable to tax on any gain of a subsequent sale of the investment.  On the other hand, the transfer of the moneys to the other account would be regarded as a disposal by the beneficiary of the other account with a resultant charge to capital gains tax when necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say there could be a case in which in order to pay for one thing the accountant might transfer funds from one account to another?  I am not <Col N="898" /> clear what the Minister had in mind. It seemed there was an implication that the accountant might transfer to the account of somebody without reference to that person and, as a result, that person would be deemed to have made a disposal and, therefore, possibly become liable to tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am dealing with the case where moneys are received by the accountant.  The accountant might, instead of investing the money directly, transfer their equivalent in investments from another account from which moneys are due to be paid out.  The transfer of the investments to credit of a new account would be regarded as the acquisition of an asset by the beneficiary of the new account, by the person on whose behalf the moneys have just been received.  He would be liable to tax on any gain of a subsequent sale of the investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the position then arise that disposal and acquisitions are deemed to have taken place in these different accounts by different persons who had nothing to do with the transactions or did not decide on the transactions and subsequent disposal? If it resulted in a taxable gain it would render them liable to tax based on a base charge arising at the time of the transaction the Minister spoke of.  In the case of an account of Mr. A. the accountant might transfer securities to Mr. A's account in place of money which is coming in because money was about to be paid out from Mr. B's account.  Would the effect be that because the transfer of securities to Mr. A's account was deemed to be an acquisition by him that would determine the value of these securities for the purpose of assessment of capital gains at some time in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could Mr. A. lose out as a result of this because the acquisition was deemed to have occurred at a particular date when the securities had a certain value? Such a person may not know anything <Col N="899" /> about that transaction or certainly may not have consented to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the accountant makes the investment in whatever to him appears to be the most appropriate stock at any time.  Seldom if ever is the beneficiary a participant in the decision-making regarding where the money is lodged.  The process I am talking about is one that is engaged in to avoid the costs, delays and the extra work involved in sales and purchases. If various accounts can be credited it can be a straightforward business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an acquisition when the account is put in the name of Mr. A.  If a market transaction took place on that day it would be at the appropriate price as of that day. That is the value that is put on the account on the day it is acquired and it is taken as the starting point to assess the capital gain or loss thereafter. What we are doing is applying the rules of the market-place for what are book transactions which are engaged in because they save the people concerned the trouble and cost of a multitude of transactions in the market.</P>

      <P>This section provides that where the purchase price of an asset is payable by instalments over a period exceeding 18 months, the Revenue Commissioners may allow payment of capital gains tax to be spread over the instalment period or for a period of five years, whichever is the shorter.  To obtain this concession the taxpayer must satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that to pay the tax in one sum would cause him undue hardship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is correct. Interest will not be chargeable on the tax until the appropriate instalment is due.

There will not be interest accumulating for four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We argued the whole principle of inflation as it applies to the capital gains tax generally.  I am not trying to go back over that but where it is envisaged that the receipt of money which is to constitute the gain would be payable by instalment and where there is provision for up to five years, is this not a specific case where inflation should be considered? This is why I raised the question about not allowing any discounting in respect of future payments.  In this case the gain would be assessed in advance on present values and, as a result of the provisions here, in five years time a substantial portion of the gain would be paid.  Clearly, in five years time the value will be much less than it is now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to produce a comprehensive policy on youth development which has had a serious effect on youth organisations throughout the country and calls on the Government to announce its policy, if any, forthwith.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to try to get the Government to realise the importance of announcing a comprehensive policy for youth.  The delay in making this announcement is doing untold damage to the existing youth structure.  Despondency is now setting in in many youth organisations.  Over two years ago youth councils and organisations were asked by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bruton, to submit recommendations on youth development to assist the Department of Education in preparing a memorandum on youth policy.  This was done and I understand that all the recommendations were of tremendous value to the officials in the Department of Education.  After two years there has still been no announcement by the Government on this very important matter of youth development.  Surely, after two years, the Parliamentary Secretary and the officials must have some idea of the structure they propose to submit for a youth policy.  The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware that youth organisations have been suspended pending the announcement of the Government's comprehensive youth policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> I should like now to quote from <i>Youth Forum,</i> which is a magazine published by the National Youth Council; it is the February/March issue for this year.  Mr. Webb is chairman of the National Youth Council and he had this to say:</P>
    <P>Mr. Webb went on to give ten examples of how the delay in the publication of the national youth policy was hindering the further development of Irish youth work.</P>
    <P>1.  In Dublin the development of Comhairle ne Leas Oige, the statutory youth body, had been brought to a standstill because of the lack of a national youth policy.  Since July, 1974 a large number of the full-time youth workers had resigned due to the lack of an adequate career structure.</P>
    <P>2.  The development of attached youth work in Dublin with unattached young people, often with drug problems, had ceased because of the ill-defined role of Comhairle le Leas Oige.</P>
    <P>That is very important.  Another worthwhile point made is:</P>
    <P>5.  The recent announcement by the Minister for Local Government that no further grants were to be made under the Local Authority Amenity Grants Scheme meant that the minimal amount of finance available to support the building of youth and community centres was now no longer available.</P>
    <P>6.  The proposal by the Minister for the Gaeltacht to support the appointment of a full-time youth officer for the Connemara Gaeltacht had been vetoed by the Department of Education until the determination of a national youth policy.</P>
    <P>In Cork city the National Youth Council is in complete disorder at the moment.</P>
    <P>10.  The development of local youth services in Limerick, Kilkenny, Waterford and other areas had been placed in jeopardy by the indecision of the Department of Education on requests to sanction the appointment of full-time youth workers.  This indecision was explained <Col N="905" /> by the lack of a national youth policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister is present.  Finally:</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions in the past the Council had expressed serious concern at the under-staffing of the youth and physical recreation section of the Department of Education. At present the youth side of their work was being handled by three people, one only recently appointed.  The situation was worse than it appeared because the staff were not concerned solely with youth affairs but undertook other duties as well.  The staff complement was such that it was unable to deal efficiently with day-to-day administration let alone the added burden of implementing a national youth policy.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Council caters for thousands of young people and I have no doubt they are fully aware of the adverse affects of the lack of a youth policy on the present youth structure.  Some indication should be given of the Government's thinking on youth policy.  This would give youth organisations some idea at least of the structure the Government have in mind.  It would certainly give some encouragement to the many dedicated people who devote time and effort to promoting youth development.</P>
    <P>The total development of all our young people must be the aim of a worthwhile national youth policy.  If such a policy is to be comprehensive two conditions will have to be fulfilled. First, the policy must recognise the different needs of young people, from social survival to the fuller development of talents and, secondly, the youth services must operate from several bases, from within the schools, from youth clubs and organisations, from better facilities and adventure sports, from special services for the disadvantaged and the unattached and for the greater involvement of youth in their own local community.</P>
    <P>Nowadays great emphasis is placed on academic education with its concentration on acquiring knowledge and skills to be tested by examinations, <Col N="906" /> with a consequential apathy with regard to other aspects of education for living.  We are inclined to forget the importance of social education, the growth of the whole person; we must educate the whole person to make the most of his talents, not only his brains and manual skills but also his personality, his ability to get on well with others and to play his part in society.</P>
    <P>What are the Minister's views regarding the training of voluntary youth workers, which is a top priority in youth work?  The voluntary effort is the foundation of any worthwhile structure.  It is of vital importance that proper training facilities are made available to those who are prepared to undertake this work.  I believe there is urgent need for a full-time regional development officer, who will examine and recommend the priorities of youth work and be responsible for the training of voluntary youth leaders.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister has in mind with regard to a comprehensive youth policy or whether it will be implemented piecemeal.  We must have proper training facilities available for young people who have a love for youth leadership.  The establishment of a full-time regional development officer, who will take on the responsibility of organising and promoting youth work and who will be totally responsible for the training of youth leaders, is a top priority.</P>
    <P>Youth activities should be developed at local level.  Here youth can identify their own needs and the needs of others.  One of the most attractive aspects of young people today is their very sensitive awareness of the social ills and the failings of our society. Young people are prepared, if proper facilities are made available to them, to face the challenge of answering the needs of their local communities, such as helping the poor, the physically handicapped, the lonely and many other community services.  Surely our young people have proved their ability in this respect when they are given the proper opportunities.</P>
    <P>I have attended a number of youth <Col N="907" /> conferences throughout the country. Nearly all the resolutions submitted had a bearing on community services. This proves beyond all doubt the awareness of young people of the needs of our community.  Youth are no longer as interested as they were in playing tennis, billiards or rings.  They want a challenge.  The greatest challenge is the needs of their own communities. What better educational exercise could one have than to become totally involved in this kind of activity?</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to provide incentives for young people to become involved in youth work.  Work of such a sociological nature merits a place in the examination curriculum. Those who devote themselves to this activity should get recognition for their endeavours in such a subject if they decide to opt for it.  We have oral and practical tests in other subjects so it should not be outside the power of our educationalists to devise a system of assessing involvement in this field.  We provide incentives for many things but it would be a great incentive to young people to become involved in youth work and community services.</P>
    <P>This is a social education which is of vital importance to young people. Recently I addressed a youth seminar in University College Cork.  The theme of the seminar was to help young people finishing at university understand the community they are going into.  It is important, whether they be doctors, engineers or social workers, that our young people know the kind of community they live and earn their living in.  The views expressed at that seminar were most encouraging.</P>
    <P>We should have an announcement from the Government regarding their comprehensive youth policy.  I place a lot of emphasis on this because I know the present structure is in complete disarray.  There are the questions of financing, training and premises, which I hope to deal with this evening. Specially designed buildings are of vital importance to young people.  I am talking here of buildings which will cater for all the activities of young <Col N="908" /> people as well as the work of community associations within the one building so that both are linked together. Under the one roof we will then have the various services provided by the community and also facilities for youth activities such as physical education, a good library and all the training facilities needed.</P>
    <P>We then come to finance.  I know the Minister will probably say that there is not sufficient money available to provide the necessary facilities for young people.  I have said on many occasions, irrespective of who is in Government, that Governments will always find money.  Surely youth concils and organisations have established a strong case for finance.  I have seen many worthwhile projects organised by young people which had to be abandoned because of lack of finance.  We talk about the vandalism all around the country.  We will continue to have vandalism so long as we fail to make available the necessary money to provide proper facilities for our young people.</P>
    <P>I heard on the radio this afternoon the 50,000 young people leaving school this year will fail to secure any kind of employment.  We must have regard to the frustration which will prevail among those young people.  We know what happened in Canada when the position was similar there.  They were roaming through the streets.  There were acts of vandalism, murder, you name it.  The Canadian Government had to face that challenge.  They made money available for the employment of young people during the summer vacation.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend to the Government that a fund should be set up for the years ahead so that young boys and young girls will not have to spend three months of their vacation roaming the streets with little or nothing to do.  They have something to offer, especially students from the universities. Social scientists should be employed in the areas where they are needed.  It is important that our young people should be occupied during the long period of the school break.  This may be new thinking.  I would welcome this kind of thinking.  It is needed.  Just <Col N="909" /> imagine 50,000 school leavers who fail to secure employment this year, plus the thousands of young people who used to get holiday work which is no longer available to them.  Then we talk of frustration.  We talk of vandalism.</P>
    <P>There has been massive neglect in the field of residential care.  There has been a complete failure to provide residential care for boys and girls who need it.  We see in the evening papers that a justice has to release boys back into society because there is no place available to train them.  They are not many, but they are still there.  The unfortunate thing is that they become the leading vandals.  They recruit other young people.  We have experience of this all over the country.  People like that have gone through the streets and into the dancehalls recruiting young boys and girls to follow them.  How long more will this continue?  When a justice fails to put a boy into a residential home, within a week that boy has recruited 11 more.</P>
    <P>These boys are pleading for help. There is no guidance in the home for them, no advice.  Surely if we had properly trained people in residential homes this would be of great assistance to these young people.  When the Minister is announcing a comprehensive policy on youth I hope this will be one of his priorities.  We do not need the type of leadership to which I have referred.  We have enough of these people at the moment roving our streets.</P>
    <P>The school attendance officer is usually the first to detect when a boy or girl is going wrong.  It starts with non-attendance at school.  The Department should organise seminars for school attendance officers so that they will know exactly how to handle cases of this kind.  We have found in Cork, and I am sure it has been found elsewhere, that the first indication that a young person is going wrong is nonattendance at school.  I say that from my own experience and I am sure the Minister will agree with me.</P>
    <P>I would be very much in favour of negotiations between the Department of Education and the Department of Local Government with a view to <Col N="910" /> exempting youth clubs and community buildings from rates.  Customs and excise duty should be removed from sporting equipment which has to be imported.  People dedicate their time and their effort to providing clubs and community buildings for young people and then we levy them with a very substantial rate.  Wonderful people who are working in this field spend most of their time trying to raise sufficient money to pay the rates and keep the buildings in some kind of proper order when they should be giving of their experience and time to young people. Surely it is not beyond the capacity of the Department of Local Government to derate such buildings.</P>
    <P>I attended a function recently where I discovered that it cost something in the region of £1,500, if not more, to import a rowing boat.  Between import duty and turnover tax, or whatever you like to call it, it costs another couple of hundred pounds.  Yet it is being imported to provide a facility for young people.</P>
    <P>There are many other kinds of equipment for this specific training. There is no point in our encouraging people to give of their time and effort in organising and providing facilities for young people while, at the same time, we place a very heavy burden on them by way of rates and import duties.  This would cost little or nothing and would encourage youth organisations to develop and to expand their premises had they a guarantee that they would not be levied by the rating authorities.  I make a very special appeal to the Minister to commence negotiations with the Minister for Local Government on this very important aspect.  It would mean a great deal to people who give of their time and effort in promoting youth work.  I am inundated with people writing to me asking me if this can be done and why it should not be done.  I agree that some move must be made in this direction to ease the burden on people of that kind.</P>
    <P>While speaking about young people, it is only right also to mention the involvement of adults in their work. We hear so much about vandalism <Col N="911" /> today and it can be said we are reaping the results of past neglect because adults refused to involve themselves in the work of young people.  In the comprehensive policy we await from the Government on this important aspect I hope some reference will be made to their involvement in the work of young people.  There should be no further delay in making this announcement. It is now of vital importance and I have quoted the magazine of the National Youth Council.  I could quote many others who are pleading at this very moment with the Department of Education and with the Minister to make this announcement, or at least give us some indication what the Government have in mind where a youth policy is concerned.  We are away behind other countries.  It is little wonder that all this comes to light at the Olympics.  We may send the best we have out but, unfortunately, they do not have the same training facilities at other nations.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will make some contribution in this debate and will give us some indication before it is too late that the Government are serious about introducing a comprehensive youth policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I took office as Minister for Education in 1973 I found that though the Department of Education had since 1969 been assisting youth and sports organisations by the payment of annual grants to the governing bodies of these organisations, there was not in existence any comprehensive statement of objectives which might serve even as the basis of a youth policy.  Youth organisations had, by and large, to make their own way in a very difficult area and the absence of an overall plan or strategy was, to my mind, a serious handicap for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all passed through the adolescent stage, and we all should know that many formative experiences of young people occur in their free or leisure time and, accordingly, that the aim of youth work should be the provision of activities and facilities to <Col N="912" /> enable young people to use this time to develop personally, to appreciate the many advantages of a well-ordered society and to contribute to that society.</P>
    <P>And so with my approval on 14th August, 1973 my Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy John Bruton, who has special responsibility for youth and sport, appointed an advisory panel to assist him in the formation of a youth policy document.  This panel, which comprised educationists, sociologists and administrators, was experienced in the complexities of youth work and was conscious of the pitfalls which the ever-changing nature of youth needs presents to the policy maker in this area.  The problems which arise are of considerable complexity. They are also universal in their nature and many countries, with greater resources, have, for one reason or another, failed to find a successful solution to them.</P>
    <P>There is the further consideration that while youth work alone can never play a major role in remedying the physical and economic causes of social deprivation, it can uncover the potential of young people, encourage optimism and ambition and provide the skills for communal self-help and self-government. This potential can only be uncovered by establishing links between the potential for service inherent in young people and appropriate further guidance.  In this connection it appeared to the panel that five main objectives appeared to be deserving of further consideration as follows: (i) education, (ii) recreation, (iii) counselling, (iv) voluntary service and (v) community development.</P>
    <P>Education sets out to help people to acquire skills to cope to the maximum of their ability with the world around them.  It is more than just the acquisition of knowledge; it is the opening up of the mind to new fields of interests and the development of new skills.</P>
    <P>Education is not the sole prerogative of schools and is not limited in relation to any time or place in the life of any person.  The urge to learn is universal&mdash;the only requirements for success are that the subject is seen by the student to be useful and <Col N="913" /> is developed in an environment acceptable to him.  If formal schooling is a failure for some young people, then &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; or out-of-school education may provide the only solution to their problems at a later stage.  But out-of-school education has not got a captive audience. Neither law nor economic necessity ordains the pupils' attendance and the class will disappear unless the programme is imaginative and stimulating.</P>
    <P>The second objective of the panel was recreation for young people. Recreation plays an important part in youth work and, indeed, often prompts the creation of youth clubs. Recreation has been defined as that which &ldquo;refreshes, entertains and agreeably occupies&rdquo;.  However, successful recreation has rarely a single purpose&mdash;it usually has other attractions such as improving knowledge or enabling people to meet one another.</P>
    <P>The third objective identified was counselling for young people since it may well be in a youth club that a young person with a problem will first admit to needing help.  Those working with young people should know something about counselling, the limits of their own ability to deal with what may very well be a complex psychological problem and knowledge of the availability of the professional services to cater for such problems.</P>
    <P>Opportunities for voluntary service by young people was designated the fourth objective.  One of the most praiseworthy developments in youth work in recent years is the emphasis being placed on services freely given by young people to those in greater need than themselves.  Youth service now means service by young people as well as a service to young people. Young people have resources of energy and ingenuity that few adults can match and the opportunities for voluntary service by young people must be increased, so that the fabric of society may be enriched.</P>
    <P>The fifth objective, that of enabling young people to contribute to the development of the community, is important in view of the legacy of <Col N="914" /> human problems which technological advances have left in our modern society.  For many people the traditional rural or village community has been replaced by an anonymous urban society or an isolated low density rural environment.  The best antidote to the consequent problems and the best means of rebuilding community life is the development of voluntary organisations.  The energy and altruism of youth must be fully involved whether as individuals or through their own organisations and any youth policy must plan for this type of approach.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have made a study of the matter will realise that drawing up a youth policy is difficult and complex.  It is not sufficient or appropriate to think of youth in this context as an abstract grouping of young people without regard to their individual characteristics, emotions, interests and susceptibilities.  It is also necessary to have regard to the traditions, aims and activities of the various organisations to which they belong and to respect the views and outlook of the adults whose help and co-operation enables the organisations to be established and maintained.</P>
    <P>It is not, in my view, at all appropriate to think of the provision of services to young people in the context of State support within a framework of a rigid pattern of organisation.  I am somewhat appalled at the selective use of statistics sometimes used to support a particular point of view.  No regard is had to the different circumstances affecting young people at school, out of school, students in their early teens, students at a later stage in education or employment, young people engaged in drama groups, music societies, or a wide variety of courses, educational or artistic, young people devoting much of their time to sports, athletics, and so on.  For the purpose of presentation of a picture of the adequacy or inadequacy of facilities for the healthy use by young people of leisure time, we are implicitly invited to ignore all these activities and regard the general provision made as entirely inadequate, if these young <Col N="915" /> people may not also be induced to participate in other forms of particular activities which can be categorised, enumerated and labelled as falling within the particular type of youth activity.</P>
    <P>I consider that a suitable effective youth policy must make maximum provision for encouragement, for flexibility and self-development.  It should be characterised by a strong sense of self-initiative and independence. The emphasis should be on the opportunities made available for young people from which they should take the maximum advantage&mdash;libraries, museums, sports facilities, community activities&mdash;and that in making use of these opportunities, they should also contribute their part towards expanding and maintaining them.</P>
    <P>There will never in any country, as all experience shows, be financial resources available equal to or in excess of the demands being made upon them at any particular time.  The provision of additional funds for youth service is being expanded.  I readily admit that the demands for a wide variety of facilities are of an order that to some extent reflects an inadequacy of an appreciation of the value of much of the work that is being done in this area and of a failure to recognise the changing circumstances which create new needs which have to be met in a way which differs from what was our experience in the past.  I cannot help feeling, however, that some of the claims being made for financial and professional aid of one kind or another do not take adequate cognisance of the measure of our financial resources or that the examples which are quoted of expenditure of other countries do not show evidence that there is a sufficient understanding of the significance of the figures quoted or of the relative magnitude in the context of the population of the countries concerned.  In particular, they do not seem to have sufficient regard to the part which voluntary service plays in the provision of community activities of all kinds for both young and old.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> There is a very important role which the State can play in helping various organisations to co-operate in activities which are common to them all which, individually, they could not themselves undertake.  It is also true that the cost of various forms of capital equipment is very often beyond the resources of an individual organisation or group of organisations, without the help of some subsidy from the larger community.  I would wish to see voluntary organisations, with their voluntary workers, being helped to the maximum degree possible in this respect.  I would regard this as a priority leading only subsequently and on a graduated basis towards the employment of what are generally termed as &ldquo;professional&rdquo; workers.  I believe that voluntary workers giving of their time and services should be helped to secure a standard of support and equipment which a professional worker would demand as a fundamental requirement in the exercise of his profession.</P>
    <P>While I have spoken about general points, I now wish to turn to an explanation of the continuing work which is going on in the Department of Education in regard to youth policy in general.</P>
    <P>While the general principles which must form the basis of a future youth policy are being considered and evaluated in the continuing work and existing activities in various sectors I must emphasise that the activities have not been allowed to suffer from lack of attention or support.  The amount of money allocated to youth organisations has been increased dramatically since the present Government took office.  For example, in the current year a total of £156,150 has been allocated to voluntary youth organisations as against £57,050 in 1972-73.  This marks an increase of 174 per cent.  In addition the allocation to Macra na Tuaithe in the current year amounts to £62,200 as against £19,000 in 1972-73.  This is an increase of 230 per cent.</P>
    <P>The allocation to Comhairle le Leas Óige through the Dublin Vocational Education Committee has also advanced considerably but even more significantly, in the case of Comhairle <Col N="917" /> le Leas Óige, steps have been taken to regularise the position of the seven youth workers employed by An Chomhairle. These workers who were originally employed on a temporary basis have now been offered permanent pensionable posts in the services of the Dublin Vocational Education Committee. Conditions of service for these workers are being drawn up at the moment.  Deputy Wyse, when quoting from a Youth Council document, was using a document which may be a little out of date in the light of these facts.</P>
    <P>Other significant steps forward have been taken in the current year.  For example, a fund of £16,000 has been established for assisting regional youth councils on a nationwide basis.  This is a completely new departure that was decided on with a view to cultivating the programmes of regional councils pending the implementation of a comprehensive national policy.</P>
    <P>In addition a special project scheme has been set up which will assist two organisations to develop centres in County Westmeath and County Kerry which will among other things provide educational holiday courses in a rural setting for children from deprived urban areas.  As well as assisting these centres, the Cork Youth Project has also benefited under the scheme.</P>
    <P>My Department have also sanctioned grants to the Cork Youth Council and the Limerick Diocesan Youth Council towards the employment of youth workers.  The appointment of adult education organisers has been sanctioned in other areas, notably in Counties Meath and Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>Another new departure has been the allocation of a grant of £5,000 to an organisation, Contact, which assists young displaced persons in the Dublin area.  This fills, to some extent, a gap left by the Comhairle workers in the central Dublin city area.  An interdepartmental committee has been nominated to examine the work of this organisation with a view to seeing how its counselling services can be best extended to other areas.</P>
    <P>An important element of the grants scheme has been aimed at developing the educational content of the various <Col N="918" /> programmes of the organisations.</P>
    <P>A fund of £2,000 has been set aside to assist the training programme of uniformed organisations and in the case of the Catholic Youth Council provision has been made for an educational programmer.  The grant to uniformed organisations special training scheme represents a speedy response by the Parliamentary Secretary to NYC's submission.  Provisions in the allocations for voluntary service have also been increased significantly from £2,850 in 1972-73 to £6,600 in the current year.  This represents an increase of 131 per cent.</P>
    <P>In parallel on the international front, links have been strengthened with the French Government under the Franco-Irish Cultural Agreement and rapid developments in exchange schemes for youth and sport are taking place. Approaches are also being made to Germany and the United Kingdom with the same object in mind.  I would like to pay tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary whose personal involvement in the area of the Franco-Irish Cultural Agreement is well known.  I think it can be said with justification that Deputy Bruton is the first Parliamentary Secretary to give youth work the prominence which it deserves and that he is prepared to talk frankly to youth organisations about their problems rather than avoid complex issues through the use of platitudes and evasions.  He has invited specific recommendations and has informed representatives of the National Youth Council that he would be glad to have a submission from them on any matters which are the cause of particular concern to them.</P>
    <P>On the point made by the Deputy and by others that progress is being held up because of a lack of policy, I think people who so contend should be asked to identify the precise proposals that are being held up.  They should be asked to state how much these will cost and why the youth organisations cannot themselves cater for them from the greatly increased resources I have just mentioned.  The Parliamentary Secretary has told the National Youth Council that he would be glad to have submissions on these <Col N="919" /> precise proposals which they allege they are worried about.  So, those who complain that lack of policy leaves organisations with a lack of &ldquo;overall guidance&rdquo; should remember that it is a matter for the youth organisations themselves to evolve their own policy. That is what voluntary organisations are for.  Our policy will be concerned with the framework for Government support and will not lay down policies for individual organisations.</P>
    <P>I would submit the following as basic principles which could be annunciated:</P>
    <P>(1)  to support and never supplant voluntary initiatives and organisations;</P>
    <P>(2)  to develop the training and skill of adult volunteer youth workers as the key people in youth work;</P>
    <P>(3)  to link youth work with adult education and sport so as to have an integrated approach to community development;</P>
    <P>(4)  to ensure that identifiable targets are set and to encourage the reallocation of resources from less to more successful initiatives;</P>
    <P>(5)  to involve youth organisations in a much more concrete, practical way in policy formulation at national and local level;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this is very important&mdash;</P>
    <P>(6)  not to tie up resources in permanent but potentially redundant expenditures for example, buildings, permanent full-time youth worker posts;</P>
    <P>(7)  to make maximum use of resources physical and personal which we already have by encouraging the innovative use thereof.</P>
    <P>For those who allege that the Department of Education, the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary promised a youth policy at any particular time I would like to say that a youth policy was not promised by a particular time. It was undertaken by the Department of Education themselves and was not hived off to some commission or other which could be used as blametaker. This might have been what was done <Col N="920" /> by other groups; we have not attempted to do this.</P>
    <P>In a short space of some two years we have done a massive amount of work towards the production of a comprehensive policy and in the past 2½ years we have not heard one constructive policy idea put forward by the Opposition to help us.</P>
    <P>All these measures show that the Department have not stood still while policy is being finalised but there has been a notable advance and a firm and positive direction in the last two years.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to express my personal appreciation of the services rendered by the Advisory Panel on Youth in the formulation of proposals for a youth policy and also to the National Youth Council, the Catholic Youth Council and Macra na Tuaithe who have always been readily available for consultation with problems encountered during the study which has been carried out.</P>
    <P>I must also express my admiration for the work being done by the scout and girl guide organisations for young people at a very formative stage in their lives.  There are many other groups also to whom I should wish to make specific reference but I include them in my thanks to the National Youth Council to which they are affiliated.</P>
    <P>When this policy, on which so much work has been done is produced, it will be a monument to the interest of the Parliamentary Secretary in youth affairs and will guide the destiny of youth policy in this country for the remainder of this century.  I would like to commend him in the House for the work he has done under my direction.</P>

      <P>The unknown soldier, because by that time Deputy Bruton will be unknown, being a man who did not produce anything.  Our reason for putting down this motion is that we are frustrated by the two years' delay in introducing a comprehensive youth policy.  I have listened to Deputy Bruton at Question Time here, and I was under the impression from the answers he gave that he had in mind giving us the details of his youth policy long before now.  From listening to the Minister here tonight I know they have no policy.  He mentioned people who were prone to using pious platitudes.  His own speech tonight was pickled with pious platitudes interspersed here and there with a list of hand-outs of money that he had given to any Tom, Dick or Harry during the last few years in an effort to bolster up inactivity with statistics, to prove that he has done something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a Parliamentary Secretary. I would like to know what he has produced during that time, what he has done to help youth.  We were promised a policy, but I have not seen any sign of that yet, and we are told here tonight that he is still soliciting submissions from people.  The gullible youth leaders I know and Deputy Wyse is acquainted with have waited for this policy.  They met Deputy Bruton and expected something, but up to now they have got nothing.  I would suggest to the Minister that maybe he is too chary, maybe he is acting in too responsible a fashion. Two years is a long time to wait.  The young people of today will not be young much longer.  The people who were 14 when the Coalition came into <Col N="922" /> office are now 16.  Unfortunately they will not have a vote before the Government have to ask them to pass judgment on their term of office at the next election, but they will have one shortly after that.</P>
    <P>When this Government took office the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party promised an entirely new policy to be implemented by the Government to solve the problems that affect all our people.  The youth are a very vital section of those people, and I am afraid we have not approached their problems with any sign of determination or any sign of a policy.  The Taoiseach, when he spoke on education before the last election, promised consultation with parents and school authorities, teachers and students, in an effort to improve the position.  I cannot see any evidence of that happening.  Young people of today who are, by their nature, cynical of the powers-that-be, have every reason to be more cynical still and more disbelieving when they consider the inactivity and the false promises and see the hopes they had dashed to the ground.  It could well be that a whole generation of youth will not have received any guidance or support from this government.</P>
    <P>Have the Government a policy?  As far as I can see their policy is to hand out so many thousands of pounds.  It is debatable whether the real value of that money is maintained, whether an increased allocation of 174 per cent from the time we left office is a real increase or not.  This is a piecemeal, haphazard way of working.  They should ask themselves what is their long-term view.  We had this advisory panel established&mdash;whether it was August, 1974 or 1973 I am not sure; August is usually the month when newspapers look for some crazy news. It is high time that the advisory panel's advice was taken and something was done.</P>
    <P>What have they in mind in regard to the personnel they will need to implement their youth policy?  By all means make use of the voluntary people, but I am convinced that trained personnel will be needed to deal with the structures set up.  A certain amount <Col N="923" /> of funding will be needed, and some buildings.  Although the Minister does not like to see his money going to waste on buildings, they are very essential.</P>
    <P>We in our party have a concern for young people.  We see them as zealous, unselfish and truthful.  I have experience of them as being anxious to get involved and help in the community.  We had a youth conference in our party which was a revelation for those who might not have fully appreciated how much young people would like to get involved.  It is our policy to allow this interest to blossom.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Government to establish very close liaison between Government Departments, and particularly the Department of Education, and all youth organisations.  We must gear our programme towards a continuing youth education policy and decide on the type of structure that is best for that.  I would suggest a local structure, because the local people know the problem, and possibly a regional structure and then a national structure.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows the needs of any local community better than the people there themselves, and the vital person dealing with the youth is the youth leader.  The youth leader needs training and financial help.  Up to now youth leaders have not been trained. They have just evolved because they were interested.  They had the dedication; they had some little expertise they were willing to impart, people who were very unselfish and devoted a considerable amount of their time and talent to youth.  Some people may say they did not do everything we would wish but, no matter what the results were, at least they tried to do something concrete.  We can see something for their efforts, but they have got very little help.  At local level some people who had a particular expertise, for example as physical education instructors&mdash;and that is understandable in a military community such as we live in in Kildare&mdash; have produced young gymnasts of a very high calibre who have gone <Col N="924" /> abroad and represented our country very creditably.  Much more will have to be done.  Young people are anxious to help but they need guidance and it is the duty of everybody to show them there is an alternative to the public-house or the lounge bar or the blaring music of a dimly-lit disco.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke in fine words about recreation and how it should be used, and he expressed many pious platitudes.  I should like to think that something at a national level will be done as was initiated by Macra na Feirme who were established in my area 20 years ago.  Since that time they have revolutionised the farming community.  At the beginning they were set up with the intention of bringing people together but they branched out into educational matters. I have long association with them.  I remember the competitions, the question times, the winter farm schools and the trips abroad.  That type of activity in rural areas has done wonders.  Representatives of the farming community who were loath to stand up and express their views some years ago are now well able to speak and have become leaders of their communities and in many cases national leaders.</P>
    <P>The real danger in lack of a youth policy lies not so much in rural areas but in urban complexes.  With the present atmosphere, they could be the seedbeds of trouble for future generations. It is unbelievable that the Government would do nothing in this field for another year.  The Minister seemed to decry the need to spend money on buildings.</P>
    <P>In my parish, where we have a closely-knit community, there was need for a hall.  We provided a hall in a backward area and in the past couple of years we have gathered £13,000 to build a new centre which would cater for the needs of the area.  We had hoped the Government would continue the amenity grant scheme this year but the Minister for Local Government decided against it.  To prove that we are not as unconscious of the needs of the public as the Minister for Local Government, we discussed this matter at yesterday's meeting of Kildare <Col N="925" /> County Council and we hope to devise a scheme through which, when local people have shown they are <i>bona fide</i> attempting to raise money, when half the money is available the county council hope to provide the other half by way of interest-free loan.  If the Government had an interest in matters such as this they would set a headline by helping groups such as that.</P>
    <P>In many youth clubs in my county, and I presume this applies elsewhere, the main problem is that it is very difficult to get the different strata of society involved.  In many areas the well-off stay shy of youth clubs and their activities.  We have a system which is tied to various schools up to university level where gymnasia can be made available.  Comprehensive schools can help where all the children are under one roof in one campus.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Wyse, I deplore the fact that school leavers this year will find it hard to get jobs.  This was not so when Fianna Fáil were in office.  I suppose the Arabs will have to take the blame for this too.  The devil finds work for idle hands and we should be able to offer children an alternative to the thoughts of vandalism that will enter their heads.  We should try to counter the new cults that are prevalent particularly in urban areas.  I should like the Minister to point out the alternatives he and his Department have.</P>
    <P>I have a growing family and I am glad to see them involved in games and athletics.  I appreciate what the GAA and the soccer people have been doing for young people.  They provide games and opportunities for recreation and keep them out of harm's way.</P>
    <P>On the educational side, it is necessary that we follow up the early school leavers, those who leave at 16 years. Some of them go into dead-end jobs. Incentives should be provided for them to go back later and take up the books where they had left off.  A school has been sponsored by the Kildare County Vocational Education Committee with the co-operation of the Army authorities where people who could not continue after the national school are in a position to pursue intermediate and <Col N="926" /> leaving certificate courses.  They have been doing very well.</P>
    <P>In one of our new housing estates in Leixlip, although there has been a great demand for night classes, the demand seems to have come from the wrong people, usually people who could afford to pay for adult education if they wanted it.  The people who have the greatest need of adult education have not availed of this opportunity.</P>
    <P>Generally, what I am advocating is a national structure co-ordinating all the efforts of youth clubs rather than having sporadic efforts.  I suggest that we set up a training system for youth leaders.  In that way we would be doing something realistic.  I suggest that the Department change their minds about the availability of funds towards the making available of facilities and buildings.</P>
    <P>The Minister said one thing that I agree with.  He referred to the extension of career guidance outside schools &mdash;that we would have the highly qualified people who give advice in the schools to extend the service to those outside schools.  This would help such people to live fuller and more meaningful lives.  I hope the Department will co-operate in this.</P>
    <P>In my county I have seen hundreds of examples of community efforts.  I have in mind particularly the efforts that have been made in Kilcullen where, after the sudden death of one of our people in 1970, the Club 70 was formed.  That group have continued to progress and has led to marvellous community efforts such as the annual Community Capers.  They go to St. Vincents each year to regale the people there and to make life happier for them.  I should like to pay tribute to the people who are involved in the community games.  This has given a great impetus to athletics at local level and to a nation which has possibly gone very lazy, indeed, as far as athletics are concerned.  I see many people, both lay and religious, who have devoted much of their leisure time towards keeping clubs going and I feel that if those people were unfortunate enough to be in the Gallery here tonight, listening to the Minister, they <Col N="927" /> would not have gleaned one iota of hope from anything he said.  These people need help and guidance and, above all, I am confident that they need an overall plan, a target towards which they can work.  We have tabled this motion with a view to waking up the Government even at this eleventh hour and asking them to give these people and youth movements in general the chance they deserve.</P>

      <P>I am scratching them a little and it hurts.  They realise what a poor lot they are over there and when I say these things, they do <Col N="928" /> antagonise them a little.  We have a serious situation here in relation to discussing youth policy and its formation, in what way we are moving towards it and the whole matter of vandalism within our society and what is causing it.  These are the things we should be talking about and talking about in very serious vein.  As an urban Deputy, I am concerned with vandalism in our society.  What are the causes?  Have we examined them? The mere giving of money to youth groups is not sufficient.</P>
      <P>We have to examine the reasons for vandalism in our society.  Many of them stem from bad planning, bad housing, and education, particularly in the primary sector of which I spoke before. To dole out money is not facing our responsibility or the problem.  What we have to do is to examine the reasons and eliminate the causes.  If we can do something in this regard and if we can achieve something when this motion has finally been disposed of, I believe that the motion will have been worthwhile in the sense that we had an open discussion on it.</P>
      <P>To expect a plan or a youth policy overnight, I think would be blasé and, indeed, a type of thinking which would achieve nothing.  I think this because it is the first development, the first effort to come to grips with this problem. It does take time.  It is a very complex problem because we cannot isolate youth away from society.  We have to make it part of society and I would like to see the formation of youth within our community development.  We have quite a vast movement in this direction and I believe that if we can encompass youth policy and guidance within that framework, we shall be moving in the right direction.  As the Minister mentioned, there are many vacant buildings &mdash;I am speaking of schools&mdash;which could be used effectively at night&mdash; to develop the community and give it a more realistic approach.  I should like to see a greater emphasis on adult education so that people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If we can develop and concentrate on adult education, it will <Col N="929" /> reflect itself right back to the home because no matter what we say, the responsibility must devolve back upon the home.</P>
      <P>Family life is what will determine the kind of society we are to have. Adult education made available to those people who for one reason or another failed to take advantage of or did not get the opportunity in their youth to educate themselves would re-itself within the home and the family. In that way I believe we would have far less vandalism and a much better attitude towards society. We are not coming up with motions relating to our senior citizens, and what are we doing for them?  I do not believe that we should be just talking about youth on its own but about the community as such.</P>
      <P>I know that my local authority, the corporation, have set up a community and environment department in which there are community officers who work effectively in the field co-ordinating the activities of the various groups within given areas, bringing them together and building a stronger and more viable community.  I should also like to see this operating in the area of youth and that we would have youth officers and youth leaders within our local authority.  We could start with small numbers and add to them as required and they would go out and act as leaders in the community, as trainers, as people who guide the activities of the voluntary bodies.  The role of the voluntary bodies is paramount. We should help them and not erode their activities and work. These voluntary bodies have done a great amount of work.  I look forward to the introduction of an overall policy, not necessarily for youth but a community policy, that will bring a new attitude to our society.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Capital Gains Tax Bill, 1974: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 44 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out to <Col N="930" /> the Minister that the problem of inflation, as applied to capital gains tax, applies with particular relevance under this section.  This section provides that in the event of the consideration for the particular transaction being payable over a period the Revenue Commissioners may agree to the payment of the tax by instalments over a period not exceeding five years.  Before we adjourned the Minister was arguing that, in fact, if inflation were operating it would operate here to the benefit of the taxpayer. I suggest to the Minister that that is a mistake.  If we assume the transaction in question was for a consideration of £5,000, payable by instalments of £1,000 per annum over five years, and that the amount of tax involved was £1,000 which the Revenue Commissioners agreed to be paid at the rate of £200 per annum over five years it is true to say that the last payment of £200 would be paid in deflated currency.  To that extent the Minister is correct in saying that the taxpayer would benefit.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the gain is estimated at the beginning of the five year period and, having been assessed at the beginning of the transaction, is most likely to be received and on foot of the later instalments.  That would be paid in deflated currency and the deflation would be greater on the gain than on the tax because the gain is bigger.  Therefore, to say that the taxpayer is going to benefit on foot of inflation under this section is a mistake. Whatever argument the Minister may have advanced against providing for inflation generally in respect of capital gains tax in this section, where clearly it is contemplated that the consideration and possibly the tax would be payable over a period by instalments, there is every case for providing in these specific instances for inflation. Why does the Minister think there should not be provision for inflation in cases of this kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When a person agrees to accept payment of a price by instalment the probability is that in agreeing to the price being paid by instalment a higher price is demanded because there <Col N="931" /> is the element of postponement of receipt. Clearly, if one could expect to receive cash in the hand one might accept a lower price than if one is asked to accept payment over a period of up to five years as the section visualises.  Any reasonable business person would adjust the price if the period of payment is longer, even if interest is not charged on any outstanding balance.  That is the reason why the section is drawn in the way it is.</P>
      <P>If we were to allow adjustments to be made because in five years' time the consideration would in real terms be of lesser value than in 1975 we would have to ensure that when the price was struck in 1975 there was no element of compensation in the price for depreciation in the value of currency.  In one way it is unfortunate that we are dealing with these matters when we have such a high rate of inflation.  It is running at a rate now which is unacceptable in the long term and which will not continue at its present rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The factors which are accentuated by present circumstances will not exist in five years' time.  One can reasonably assume that looking at the pattern of world behaviour at present. I am mentioning that as an aside and it does not affect the fundamental argument I mentioned earlier, that a price when paid by instalments over a long period will, undoubtedly, be adjusted to compensate for delay in receipt of portion of the consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to widen the scope of this debate unduly but I cannot let pass what the Minister said in regard to inflation.  It is at an unacceptably high level not only in the long term but in the short term and to indicate that we may expect it will reduce because inflation in a number of economies around the world is reducing is something that cannot be accepted in the context of the argument being made.  Nothing that has happened here indicates any likelihood of a reduction in inflation. Our inflation is running many times the rate of inflation in a number of other countries in Western Europe and in America.  It is not reducing here.  It is increasing.  Any discussion we have on this Bill must take account of this fact.  We cannot close our eyes to it and hope it will go away.  The indications at the moment are that far from going away it will get worse in the short term.  The longer term depends on quite a number of factors, possibly one being what Government are in power.  However, leaving that aside, the fact is we are dealing with a situation of acute inflation. If the Minister says this section is drafted with the possibility that people striking bargains for payment of a consideration over five years will allow for inflation, that seems to me to be assuming a great deal.  It is assuming much more than the Minister is prepared to concede in regard to the Bill generally.  To be logical about it, he would have to say the section would be applied as it is drafted where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied the consideration agreed on takes account of inflation.  Where it does not take such account, he would have to say that he would build into the section a provision to allow for inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section we are dealing specifically with cases where the consideration is payable by instalments over a period and where the tax may be payable <Col N="933" /> by instalments over a period. Clearly it is a situation envisaged in which inflation is a relevant factor.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that it is assumed in all cases of that kind that account will be taken of the likely effect of inflation.  Even if there were provision for payment of interest on the outstanding instalments, that does not necessarily take account of inflation except to a limited extent. At the moment people say that borrowing money and agreeing to pay interest, even where the rate of interest may be variable, do not take account of the current rate of inflation; otherwise the current interest rate would need to be at least 25 per cent, and possibly higher.</P>
    <P>We may take it that the great bulk of cases dealt with under this section will not take account of inflation to anything like the extent at which it is running at the moment.  If the happy day arrives when inflation ceases to be a problem a suitable provision in the section would adjust in line with that situation, and if there were no inflation there would be no need for adjustment.  As long as there is inflation, and in particular as long as we have inflation at the rate we are experiencing at the moment, it is not good enough to stick our heads in the sand like the ostrich and pretend it is not there, or pretend it will not affect the kind of cases specifically envisaged under this section.  The Minister is morally obliged to provide, in cases where inflation is not taken account of, that there should be a suitable adjustment in the tax.</P>
    <P>That need not necessarily work to the detriment of the Revenue but it means taking a logical position on which one can stand.  I do not think the position set out in section 44 is one that can be defended, either from the point of view of the Revenue or the taxpayer.  It is ignoring the realities of the situation and, while it may make matters more simple from the point of view of administration and of drafting, those are not good enough reasons.  There is a strong and specific case for providing for inflation in this section where we are dealing with <Col N="934" /> consideration being paid by instalments over a period and tax being paid by instalments over a period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite certain that nobody but an idiot would accept the same price for an asset if payment were postponed over five years as he would accept if he got the total sum immediately.  Even if inflation did not exist, a person would require compensation for the loss of the use of the money over five years and the capital price would, accordingly, be adjusted. That is the reality of the business world and it is the attitude anyone would have when disposing of an asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the reality in some cases but not in all cases.  I am putting it to the Minister that, even where provision is so made by payment of interest, the rate of interest being charged goes nowhere near the rate of inflation.  In that case is there not a definite loss to the taxpayer arising directly out of inflation? Why is the Minister not prepared to make provision to cover that situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure anyone engaged in such a transaction would get professional advice and be advised on what factors should be taken into account.  People who own assets are people of the world and they are able to assess these matters for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that, if what he is saying were true and if people were to <Col N="935" /> follow this out logically, nobody would invest in most of the things available for investment today?  Banks would charge a rate of interest much in excess of what they are charging. The reality is that interest rates and returns on investments at the moment are not keeping pace with inflation. In the kind of transaction envisaged here, even where provision is made to take account of the fact that money is being paid over a period, it is extremely unlikely that account will be taken of inflation as it is running at the moment.  Does the Minister not agree that is a fact?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>All that is needed is to add an additional subsection which would adjust the tax payable in line with the changes in the cost-of-living index.  The Minister need not tell me that that is not a precise measure of inflation.  I know it is not, but it is one anybody will settle for, as the Minister knows, and I rather suspect the Minister's problem is that he knows provision should be made for inflation, above all for inflation, but he does not want to admit the possibility of adjusting for inflation or he may find himself in difficulty in general in this and other Bills before the House.</P>

      <P>It is not at all unusual or infrequent.  I have come across several cases of it recently because people have not got the cash to put down and payment has to be spread over a period.  It is not at all unusual or infrequent and it may well give rise to the serious problems to which Deputy Colley has referred.  In practice, it will give rise to these.  I should like to know whether on acceptance of payment of this tax by instalments the Revenue Commissioners propose to charge the going penal rate of interest of 18 per cent on the instalments outstanding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must pursue this a little further.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say these cases will be rare.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, they will not be all that rare.  If they are sufficiently important to require special treatment and a special section why is it not possible to provide in that section for the reality of the situation that we know is all around us, the reality that we know will apply to these transactions?  What is the major problem from the point of view of the Minister in providing an additional subsection which will adjust the actual tax in line with inflation according to the period involved in the particular transaction?  That does not have to be specified in detail in the subsection. &ldquo;In any case other than that in which the Revenue Commissioners establish that provision has already been made for inflation&rdquo;&mdash;I do not see where provision has already been made for discounting the money or for interest on the outstanding instalments because, as I tried to point out to the Minister, even where that happens that is not adjusting for inflation.  I do not understand why the Minister cannot agree in this case specifically where we are talking about payment by instalments. Why can he not provide a simple additional <Col N="937" /> subsection which will adjust the tax in line with inflation?  The Minister has not attempted to answer the case for this.  As I said, difficulties of administration and convenience of drafting are not a good enough reason.  There is possibly an important principle involved here and the Minister has not given any convincing reason why provision should not be made for inflation in these particular cases.  I think we are entitled not only to press him to do this but also to press him to give us good reasons why it should not be done.  I demonstrated reasonably clearly that, even in cases where some provision is made to take account of the fact that instalments are being paid rather than a lump sum, adequate provision for inflation is not being made.  It is important in principle that adequate provision for inflation be made and I want to press the Minister now to give us a good reason why adequate provision for inflation should not be made or, alternatively, to make provision in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Very significant.  That is the very point I am making.  It is a fact, and the Minister has admitted it, that adequate provision is not made for inflation where interest rates are being charged at anything like the going rate.  If there is any provision taking account of the fact that the money is not being paid in a lump sum the most likely thing to expect is that interest will be charged on the outstanding instalments and that is most likely to be the going rate of interest.  The Minister has admitted&mdash; he certainly cannot deny&mdash;that interest in or about the going rate is very far from taking account of inflation and, that being so, the Minister has not answered the case I have made.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's justification&mdash;there may be one though I am not aware of it&mdash; for saying that, even if there is that gap between the interest rate and inflation, we should not provide for it. That is what he is saying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be overlooking the fact that the State will be receiving this tax in a deflated currency.  One of the fallacies with which one has to contend is that inflation is due entirely to the conduct of the Government.  Apparently the suggestion now is that everybody is to be insured against inflation except the community who pay.  The Exchequer belongs to the community and the community are apparently to make up the loss.  This is getting into an economic and philosophical argument not directly related to the realities of the situation, which is that people voluntarily enter into a sale, make their own calculations as to what they want for what they are disposing of, or what they are prepared to pay for what they want to acquire and, if they are not receiving their consideration or the consideration is not passing instantly, adjustments are made to take account of postponement and those adjustments involve a calculation of the price of money, which is related to what is occurring today and, clairvoyantly, to what may happen over the next five years and it is also related to anticipated inflation.  A multitude of <Col N="939" /> different factors have to be taken into account and it would not be possible to produce any workable section in a Capital Gains Tax Bill to take account of this multitude of considerations in order to ensure perfect equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to follow the Minister's hare on the economic front, tempting though it is, but I do want to talk about this section as it will apply.  I want to put it to the Minister now that, when he says I was suggesting the Exchequer should suffer and not the taxpayer, he missed the point of something I said earlier.  He may recall that I said making this provision for inflation need not be to the detriment of the Exchquer. In my view if one is to make provision for inflation in regard to the tax the taxpayer will pay it should operate both ways.  The adjustment for inflation should be made in the amount of the gain and the adjustment for inflation should be made in the amount of the tax the taxpayer will pay so that the Revenue Commissioners will not lose out as a result. Of course, as I pointed out to the Minister, it is a question of 100 per cent versus 26 per cent and it is too facile to suggest that these cancel out. Mathematically, of course, they do not.  As the section is drafted it will certainly operate to the detriment of the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I suggest that an adjustment should be made for inflation, both in relation to the gain on which the tax is assessed and where instalments are paid over a period to the Revenue Commissioners. This is the right approach and takes account of the reality around us.  It is not pretending that inflation does not exist or if it does will not affect the people operating under section 44.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know it will affect them and we know that the section as drafted will affect them very seriously.  I want to know what objection the Minister has in principle to adjusting for inflation, both in favour of the taxpayer and in <Col N="940" /> favour of the Revenue Commissioners? Is that not a much fairer way to approach it then what is involved in the section which pretends inflation does not exist?  The Minister surely must accept that that kind of adjustment on both sides is fair and equitable.  If it is why should we not do it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that mean if a customer gets money through a bank and is only charged 11 per cent that he must pay the bank something over the interest for inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about customers in banks.  It is precisely because a customer does not have to pay 25 per cent, 32 per cent or 36 per cent, which was the annual rate of inflation on the basis of the last quarter, in interest that I am arguing that in a case, where somebody does a deal which involves the payment of instalments over five years and provides interest on the outstanding instalments, he will not get away with providing for interest at 36 per cent or 25 per cent on the outstanding instalment.  The most he will get away with is something close to the banks going rate.  That is precisely why I am making this case, that the kind of situation which arises will not take account of inflation.  The Minister said it would and I say it will not. Therefore, there should be an adjustment both from the point of view of the gain, so that you can allow for inflation in that, and from the point of view of instalments of tax being paid to the Revenue Commissioners, so that they will not lose out as a result of inflation.  Is that not a reasonable approach?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 40, subsection (1), line 39, to delete &ldquo;the following subsections&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;this section&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment represents a change of <Col N="943" /> wording only and does not affect the meaning of the provision.  As Deputies will see, we are simply deleting the words &ldquo;the following subsections&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;this section&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, it is merely tidying up the section.  It could be correct to say that it does not change the meaning.  On the other hand, it could change the meaning, as I am sure the Minister will accept, because &ldquo;the following subsections&rdquo; refer only to the subsections other than (1), whereas the amendment includes subsection (1).  But, if the Minister says it does not make any practical difference, I am quite happy to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a few questions about the application of this section.  The section commences by saying: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of this Act . . . &rdquo;&mdash;that is, without prejudice to generality&mdash;</P>
      <P>. . . any transaction which under the following subsections is to be treated as a disposal . . .</P>
      <P>Then, in subsection (2) (a) it says:</P>
      <P>If a person having control of a company exercises his control so that value passes out of shares in the company . . .</P>
      <P>The section commences by saying: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of this Act&rdquo; and then proceeds, in effect, to limit it to a controlled company.  Am I correct in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I take it that the saver of the generality of the Act is in respect of the rest but does not import those generalities into the section.  If one goes back to the definition subsections, one finds a company defined as any body corporate, but a controlled company has the meaning <Col N="944" /> assigned to it in section 35, subsection (4) and control&mdash;here is the point to which I want to draw attention&mdash;in relation to a company shall be construed accordingly.  Subsection 2 (a) of section 45 provides:</P>
      <P>If a person having control of a company exercises his control . . .</P>
      <P>Again, there is reference to control and there is a further reference to connected persons which is defined also in an earlier section.  Control is defined in section 35, subsection 4.  A controlled company is one in which the number of persons holding shares is not more than 50, has not issued any of its shares as a result of a public invitation to subscribe for shares and which is under the control of not more than five persons.  That is subsection (4) of section 35 which I have more or less paraphrased.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that section 45 is restricted virtually to private companies. I forget what we said on the debate on section 35 but would the Minister agree with me that controlled companies virtually are private companies? Is that not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, this section applies only to private companies. Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Generally, yes&rdquo;.  This is the point I want to get clear.  I want to know whether it applies generally or to private companies only.  Subsection (1) of the section says:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of this Act as to the transactions which are disposals of assets, any transaction which under the following subsections is to be treated as a disposal of an asset shall be so treated . . . </P>
      <P>Then the subsection continues to deal with that.  I should like the Minister to say that this section is restricted to the companies defined in subsection (4) of section 35 or to state otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, as the Deputy will appreciate, the section <Col N="945" /> covers more than private companies. Subsection (3) deals with leases.  There are three situations with which this section is concerned.  The first is with the exercise of a power of control by a person in control of a company so that rights are transferred from shares owned by him, or a person connected with him, into other shares.  The second situation is where the lessee of property, who has been the owner of the property, makes an arrangement by which there is an adjustment in the terms of the lease in favour of the lessor and the adjustment, in such a case, would be treated as a disposal of an asset by the lessee.  Apparently this section deals with the situation where a person entitled to enforce a right over an asset extinguishes or abrogates that right.  That also would be regarded as disposing of that right which he would be abrogating or extinguishing.</P>
      <P>The section deals, I said, generally with private companies.  At present I cannot contemplate a case where it could possibly apply to a public company. I would not presume to say that it could exclude a company that might be said to be a public company but such a company, of its nature, would not normally be a company which would be a controlled company because the control, in essence, is, in fact, a private control and that is what leads to its being described as a private company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would agree that subsections (1) and (2) are concerned particularly with private companies?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the companies defined in subsections (2) and (4) of section 35?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to subsection (4) of section 45, I would assume that the normal sort of situation to which it would apply&mdash;where a right of residence of support which was registered on lands was given up <Col N="946" /> or where an inhibition which was registered on a folio in the form of the exclusive right to a room in a house, for example, was given up by the person entitled to that right&mdash; would be regarded as a disposal for the purposes of capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>These are all the sort of small, everyday things that people generally in the country do not think this Bill affects at all.  In every section that one goes through in this Bill one finds things of that type that quite unexpectedly seem to be subject to capital gains tax.  For example, I doubt if there is a farmer in this country who realises that the rights of residence and support which he reserved at the time he made his land over to his son would be subject to capital gains tax if he were to give up those rights, as is done frequently for the purposes of a pension or something else.  How they are valued is often very hard to establish.  I suppose a right or support could be valued. An annuity can be valued.  A right of residence is difficult to value but the most difficult of all to value would be the exclusive right to the use of a room.  How that could ever be valued I do not know or whether the Revenue Commissioners have any method in mind for assessing the capital value of such restrictions or rights being given up.  Invariably these rights will be given up without any consideration. The question of who is going to pay the duty and tax and how they are going to pay it may give rise to some difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subparagraph (2) appears to apply to privately controlled companies and envisages the situation where a company's profits were often a great deal larger than the profits actually distributed in dividends.  Shares and other rights in the company were given in lieu of the distribution of these profits as dividends.  Subsection (2), as drafted, may well cover several situations which are, in effect, a form of distribution of profits.  If so, they would be subject to income tax. because the Income Tax Acts are so amended to cover that situation where profit is capitalised and given out in shares or in some other way rather <Col N="947" /> than in dividends.  If we have a situation as envisaged in subsection (2) &mdash;that retained profits are being distributed in some form&mdash;this is to be regarded as a disposal for the purposes of the capital gains tax.  It is also liable to income tax.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister not consider inserting in that subsection an additional paragraph to the effect that if any such activity, as is envisaged in subsection (2) (a) takes place, the subject would be liable to income taxation and will not also be liable to capital gains taxation, or, if it is subject to capital gains taxation, it will not also be liable to income taxation? The two, of course, are mutually exclusive, even though in an earlier section the Minister tried to draw them together as being basically the same.  They are not.  Capital gains tax can only apply where income taxation does not apply.  The possibility of that happening under subsection (2) (a) should be allowed for and provision should be made accordingly at the end of that subsection.</P>

      <P>If a plot of land is subject to the right of occupation by another or to an easement or to a right-of-way which another person might have over it, its market value is reduced.  If that right of occupation, easement or right-of-way is abolished or waived by another, then the value of the property increases. Accordingly, one must look at the consequences of the gain which the abolition of a specific right exercised by another may have on the property owned by another.  That is what subsection (4) does, having regard to <Col N="948" /> exemption of the first £500 in any year in the Bill generally.  The subsection will not cause hardship or the difficulties illustrated here.</P>
      <P>Under subparagraph (2) (a), if a person has a right of control over a company by virtue of certain shares and decides to transfer it to other shares, again there is a disposal of a right and a conferring of a right on another person or entity.  This is clearly a disposal.  It might be said that it is not necessary to spell out the situation in the Bill.  We would find it very hard to argue that these are not disposals or abandonments of rights by one and an acquisition of rights by another and, therefore, an occasion for calculating again.</P>

      <P>Is &ldquo;owner&rdquo; defined? The words &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; and &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; are very well-known legal technical terms but what does &ldquo;owner&rdquo; mean in this context?

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very novel definition.  I do not wish to be facetious but on the Minister's definition a foreman would be the owner or a person working under him.  What is the meaning of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;?  The Minister says it means superior interest, but is that enough?  Supposing you had a case involving the holder in fee, a lessor and a sub-lessor.  The sub-lessor and his sub-lessee are lessees within the meaning of this section.  So is the superior interest a lessor or a lessee.  I suggest that there is a certain looseness. What happens if actually you have a sub-lease and if after a transaction which results in an owner of any description becoming the lessee and there is adjustment of rights or liabilities under the lease&mdash;I cannot think up a suitable example&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Owner&rdquo; requires no definition in this statute as it is so generally understood.  &ldquo;Land&rdquo; is defined in section 2 as any interest in land and that would cover the tripartite arrangements Deputy de Valera has mentioned.  The ownership relates to any interest in land and &ldquo;lease&rdquo; is also defined in section 2.  I am satisfied it is capable of only one interpretation, and if the lessor and lessee are clearly understood so, too, is an owner of an interest in land.</P>

      <P>In the list Deputy de Valera gave he stuck to &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; and &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; after fee simple.  It might give rise to a great deal of confusion and doubt.  The fee simple owner could turn out to be the fee farm grantor and the fee farm grantee under him could be a lessor to a lessee who in turn is a sub-lessor to a lessee who is a sub-lessee perhaps to a monthly tenant or something of that kind.  All those interests seem to be covered by the definition of &ldquo;lease&rdquo; in section 2, but that does not leave <Col N="951" /> us any wiser as to who the owner is for the purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The owner of any interest&rdquo;, and if that interest is affected in any way by a transaction, then there is a disposal.  You might have a situation as described by Deputy O'Malley: you could have A, B, C, D and E who would have superior interests to F and G.  If the interests of the superiors are not affected by what happens between F and G, then there is no disposal affecting the superior parties.  However, some interesting points have been raised which we will examine between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a connection of the transaction with the adjustment. After the situations which we have described, the question is whether it is consequent or subsequent.  I think I know what the Minister means: he wants to see that where a lessor's interest has been acquired there is adjustment of rights and liabilities under the lease, but I am at a loss to know why the Minister in this section confines himself to leases, as Deputy O'Malley has said.  Admittedly, you could have a fee simple but what about certain types of mortgages and other encumbrances?  Why is it specifically leasehold interests the Minister has in mind here?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 41, subsection (4), line 37, before &ldquo;legatee&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;personal representative or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment to make clear that the subsection applies not only to a debt acquired from the original creditor or the legatee of the creditor but also a debt acquired from the personal representative of the creditor.  The provision is an extension of section 33, which deals with persons who are connected with one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The section seems to provide that the satisfaction of a debt held by a person other than the original creditor will be treated as a disposal by the creditor giving rise either to a charge as a gain or a loss. I assume that refers to a situation in which the original creditor sold the debt or the right to the debt and presumably <Col N="953" /> for less than its face or nominal value and may have incurred either a gain or a loss by virtue of collecting more than he paid for it or less than he paid for it, as the case may be.  Would the Minister confirm if that is so, because I want to get the principle on which the section relies clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then on the amendment, the section provides, as Deputy O'Malley anticipated, that an original creditor cannot make a chargeable gain or an allowable loss on the disposal of a debt.  I think it therefore must follow that only debts which have been purchased from the original creditor or a personal representative or legatee are to be treated as chargeable assets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it provides that a debt will not be on a chargeable asset in the hands of an original creditor, his personal representative or legatee, but take the ordinary case of money being lent by a creditor, a banker or a private individual where he succeeds in recovering only part of that debt.  Is it allowable for a capital loss in that situation, or does the fact that it is not a chargeable asset rule out the question of gains or losses on it, and, if so, does it not appear somewhat unfair that if a creditor is making gains on some debts and losses on others, he cannot set off his losses on his lending against the gains he may be making elsewhere in the course of his business?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that in that type of situation, so far as the capital side of it is concerned, the creditor could never make a gain unless he purchased someone else's debt, but he does stand to make a loss?  I am not talking about people whose trade or business it is to lend money because, as the Minister said, they are covered by income tax, and that is all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of a trader, not a banker, just an ordinary retail trader&mdash;for example, an auctioneer, publican or someone like that&mdash;who may occasionally lend money to people, to customers of his. If he suffers a capital loss there, does it not seem unfair not to allow him that?  He cannot be allowed it for income tax purposes, because it is not part of his business to lend money, but he could lose several hundreds of pounds.  That is bad enough, but assume that on some other transaction which he had in that year&mdash;for example, the sale of shares&mdash;he made a capital gain, is it not unfair not to allow him to set off his capital loss on the debt he had created, bearing in mind that he can never make a capital gain anyway?  The best he can do is to get the money paid back to him with interest if he is charging interest on it.  Therefore from the capital point of view he cannot get more than he lent but he can easily get less than he lent.  In these circumstances, by not providing that such debts be chargeable as an asset in the hands of the original credit, is this not somewhat unfair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is, and I do not think it would be appropriate that the Revenue Commissioners should have to make good any faults in the judgment of people who lend money to others.  If a loan <Col N="955" /> is made in the ordinary course of trade, that falls to be dealt with, as I have said, under the Income Tax Acts, but if people make private loans and do not enjoy the pleasure of having a refund, I think it would be unreasonable to expect that the Exchequer should allow such losses to be set off against gains which might be made on other transactions.  I do not have to point out that if such were to be allowed it would become a not inconvenient and not very complicated avenue of avoidance to people who would generate losses for setting off against gains.</P>

      <P>It says here:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;security&rdquo; includes any loan stock or similar security . . . but excluding securities specified in Schedule 4.</P>
      <P>While the Minister is trying to collect his thoughts&mdash;they take a great deal of collection on a matter like this&mdash;I should like to make a general comment on the section.  In the explanatory memorandum we have what appears to be a lucid paragraph in less than seven lines which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 46 provides that a debt is not a chargeable asset in the hands of the original creditor, his personal representatives or his legatee.  This exclusion will not apply to holdings of loan stock as, for example, in a company.  The satisfaction of a debt held by a person other than the original creditor will be treated as a disposal by the <Col N="956" /> creditor giving rise either to a chargeable gain or an allowable loss.</P>
    <P>That seems to be plainly stated and I think any of us would understand it. I am back to the point about giving the Revenue Commissioners discretion to implement that intention but in order to make that into law we have a section of 46 lines&mdash;as against the seven lines I mentioned&mdash;of singular complexity which have to refer to two paragraphs in the Schedule which in turn has to refer to another Schedule.</P>
    <P>The question has now arisen as to what &ldquo;security&rdquo; means because the proviso to paragraph 1 of section 46 says:</P>
    <P>Provided that this subsection shall not apply in the case of the debt on a security as defined in paragraph 3 of Schedule 2.</P>
    <P>Note the wording.  Hopefully, one turns to paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 for a definition but I do not get a definition. I get an inclusion; what I read is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;security&rdquo; includes any loan stock or similar security whether of any government or of any public or local authority or of any company and whether secured or unsecured but excluding securities specified in Schedule 4.</P>
    <P>That is merely an inclusion clause, not a definition.  Turning to Schedule 4 I get a long list of Government securities.</P>

      <P>I agree, but my point is that the whole thing is so tied together.  If anybody ever troubles to read the concatenation I have read out he will see the difficulty.  Deputy O'Malley asked does security include a debenture?  Does it include a land bond?  What does it include?  I think the section is an unnecessarily prolix and complicated effort to do what the Minister intends to do.  I cannot understand the necessity for all its provisions. When you come to subsection (2) you find:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of the said paragraph 3 and of paragraph 4 of Schedule 2 (company amalgamations), and subject to the foregoing subsection, the satisfaction of a debt or part of it (including a debt on a security as defined in the said paragraph 3) shall be treated as a disposal of the debt or of that part by the creditor made at the time when the debt or that part is satisfied.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy will support my assertion, which is a basic principle of law, that the taxpayer is entitled to know what the law is.  Even though it may be difficult to interpret and may require the assistance of lawyers and accountants; when it is in statutory form, it is precise.  If one were to adopt the <Col N="958" /> Deputy's recommendations that these matters be left to the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners taxpayers would be imperilled; they would be uncertain; they would not know the law until the discretion was exercised. They are entitled to know the law and use whatever ingenuity they can muster or purchase in order to find ways of interpreting the law.  I can give the House plenty of law to add to their store of knowledge.  I will leave it to the Deputies to decide whether or not it makes them any the wiser.  The definition includes loan stock, the holdings of which are transferable by purchase and sale.</P>
      <P>There is a case of Cleveleys Investment Trust Limited and Falkirk and Company Ltd.  This was an arrangement between Cleveleys Investment Trust Limited and the Falkirk Company Ltd. for a loan from Cleveleys to Falkirk, whereby on a capital reconstruction of the latter Cleveleys would get an allotment of 51 per cent of the share capital of Falkirk.  Falkirk went into liquidation and the loan was written off, and the court decided that the arrangement gave rise to what it called a bundle of rights or a composite series of rights conferring on Cleveleys incorporeal property and that it was not possible to segregate the loan element from the other element.  In such circumstances, section 46 would not apply and Cleveleys would be allowed a loss under section 12, subsection (3), incurred on the occasion of the entire loss, dissipation or extinction of an asset.</P>

In the case in question there was an <i>obiter dictum</i> that the debt on a security means a debt which is evidenced in a document as a security. It was also said that there was no similarity between the letter of acceptance or the bill of exchange in the case and loan stock or an unsecured debenture.  A debt on a security does not include secured debts such as the debt secured by a charge on freehold property or the guarantee of a third party or a bill of sale over chattels.</P>

      <P>I am trying to get away from the complexities of this and trying to get the principle involved. Subsection (1) provides that where a person incurs a debt to another, no chargeable gain shall accrue to the creditor or his personal representative on a disposal of the debt.  That is the principle laid down in subsection (1) and, as we said earlier, this section can only deal with debts arising other than in the course of trade in lending.  Having laid down that principle, the proviso goes on to say that that principle, which is the basis for the whole section, will not apply in the case of a debt on a security which has all these complexities we have been talking about.  I am still trying to understand why this distinction is being made.  The general principle is laid down in subsection (1)&mdash;where a person incurs a debt to another, no chargeable gain shall accrue to the creditor or his personal representative on the disposal of the debt&mdash;and then we say that if the debt is on a security, a chargeable gain can arise on the disposal of it.  I am sure there is a good reason for this but what I am trying to find out is what is the reason that one distinguishes between these two.</P>

      <P>That is one case, but the Minister will agree that the proviso is much wider than loan stock.  It is &ldquo;any debt on a security&rdquo;. Agreed, the Minister indicated that there are decided cases which seem to exclude from the meaning of &ldquo;debt on a security&rdquo; some fairly surprising things, such as freehold property which is subject to a charge to secure a debt; but leaving aside those rather peculiar cases, nevertheless &ldquo;a debt on a security&rdquo; is clearly much wider than loan stock, which is the example the Minister has given us.  It seems to be a general principle that where the debt is on a security, you exclude it, as though any debt on a security is something in which somebody would invest for the purpose of making a gain.  I am trying to get the principle rather than the detail of it. Am I representing it correctly?</P>

      <P>This is developing into a game of cowboys and Indians between the revenue collecting authority of the State on the one hand and the courts on the other.  It seems that all that is needed is somebody to be the victim in distress to start the war.  To approach this Bill on the basis of the Revenue Commissioners <i>versus</i> the law is wrong.  Ultimately <Col N="962" /> what is going to happen with our Constitution is that the courts will win this war in a simple way and cause great difficulty.  It will not be the fault of the Revenue Commissioners.  We will deal with that again on the Wealth Tax Bill.  Then we will be thanking God for the Constitution. I am objecting to the assumption that the Revenue Commissioners are going to have their eye wiped and cannot protect themselves.  I agree with the assumption that many efforts will be made to wipe their eyes but I do not accept the assumption that their eyes will be wiped.  We are only making it more difficult for them by getting a complex about evasion at this stage. This section, taken in conjunction with the explanatory memorandum makes one point.  The second point is: from the point of view of certainty of the taxpayer the Minister referred to and from the point of view of simplicity, is this provision necessary?</P>

      <P>For a person to sell a business cum overdraft or cum the bank account, as a person might in certain circumstances, is not the normal practice among sole traders, although it might happen if there was a company involved.  A debt situation described by the Deputy is a cash transaction and therefore is outside the ambit of this Bill.  Secondly, if it involves anything it is a case of one person trusting another too much and having to end up giving an involuntary gift to another.  Thirdly, it strikes me that the most fundamental and important consideration is the 100 per cent loss of the money advanced and not, although it may be very sore to consider it, the addition of 26 per cent that might be involved if it were regarded as a wasting of the assets for some reason or another.  The situation described by the Deputy would not fall for calculation at all under the capital gains administration.</P>

Those cheques bounced because they were forged and in his income tax return that year the trader showed a loss of £7,000.  The Revenue Commissioners included that amount as a profit and billed the trader accordingly.  It was not a trading loss. They assessed him on the £7,000 he cashed for a friend of his.

I could understand it if there was a lot of money lost or if it cost the State a lot, but the State does not gain a penny out of this. The State would lose money in legal costs and everything else.  I would be willing to bet that most decrees obtained by the State would be a net loss of revenue to the State when costs are taken into consideration.  The Minister should not state that this is to safeguard the revenue of the State because the amount of money involved is small in proportion to the revenues collected. Can we not, in the interests of simplicity and of the Revenue itself, particularly those administering it, take the chance?  What does it matter if an individual case goes against the Revenue Commissioners?  There is no loss of face involved, it is simply a case where the courts decide something. We are getting into a state of mind with regard to the Bill that I can only describe as the cowboy-and-Indian mentality.</P>

Subsection (1) lays down the principle of the section, namely, that where a debt is incurred in the normal way no chargeable gain and, therefore, no allowable loss arises when the creditor disposes of the debt.  That is a fairly simple, straightforward proposition, but then there is the proviso that it will not apply where the debt is on a security.  I asked the Minister to explain the difference in approach in the two cases and he referred to loan stock. That is a clear example and I agree it should be treated differently.  Can the Minister explain why other debts on a security are treated differently?  What is the principle involved?</P>

      <P>At last I think I have some idea of the purpose of this section.  Apparently it is an anti-avoidance measure but, as Deputy de Valera stated earlier, it is stated much more clearly in the explanatory memorandum. The explanatory memorandum states that a debt is not a chargeable asset in the hands of the original creditor, his personal representatives or his legatee.  It states that this exclusion will not apply to holdings of loan stock as, for example, in a company.  The satisfaction of a debt held by a person other than the original creditor will be treated as a disposal by the creditor, giving rise either to a chargeable gain or an allowable loss.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum puts it like that but I do not think it is stated in this way in the section.  If it were expressed in those terms it would be far easier to deal with it.  If what is said in the explanatory memorandum were carried through, would the section not provide that the original holder of a debt, whether secured or unsecured, would be in one position but the purchaser of a debt, whether secured or unsecured, would be in another position?  Would that not meet the major problem of avoidance which the Minister has in mind?  I am coming back to the question of the difference in principle between the debt that is secured and the one that is not secured.  Is the Minister not concerned with whether the original creditor disposed of the debt and, therefore, where there was the situation where two people were juggling around with debts when it suited them in order to set them off against gains?  If we confine one situation to the original creditor and deal with someone who purchases or obtains that debt from the original creditor, is that not the crucial point with which the Minister is concerned, rather than whether the debt is secured or unsecured?</P>

      <P>I do not think the principle involved is clear.  Apart from all the drafting points it is difficult to deal with this section unless the principle is clear.  According to the explanatory memorandum, the principle involved is whether we deal with the original creditor or someone who gets the debt from the original creditor.  I can see clearly that if a person is dealing with someone who has acquired the debt from the original creditor it is wide open to abuse.  The Minister obviously has to be very careful in dealing with that kind of case; but, in the case of the original creditor, what difference does it make whether it is secured or unsecured?</P>

      <P>I am in a little difficulty in that I think we have gone as far as we can go at the moment in getting at the principle of this and I am not going to press the Minister any further on it now.  I will not press the Minister any further on it now. On the assumption that we have some idea of what the principle behind it is could he explain subsection (3) and, if possible, give an example of what is involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) provides that when a debt is satisfied by the acquisition of property by a creditor the property will not be deemed to have been disposed of by the debtor or acquired by the creditor for an amount greater than its market value at the time of the acquisition in satisfaction of the debt, that is even if the debt is greater than the market value of the security.  Where an original creditor acquires property in satisfaction of the debt and later disposes of it making a chargeable gain the amount of the chargeable gain is not to be greater than the gain which would have resulted if the base cost of his acquisition were the amount of the debt and not the market value of the property.  This adjustment ensures that the original creditor will not be treated as making a chargeable gain on the debt itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example is usually the best help. A owes £10,000 to a company.  The company accepts freehold property having a market value of £9,000 in satisfaction of the debt of £10,000. A is treated as disposing of the property for £9,000 and his chargeable <Col N="972" /> gain is calculated on that figure.  The company's acquisition price is £9,000. If the company sells the property and makes a loss there is an allowable loss, but if the company sells for more than £9,000 the gain will be calculated not by reference to the £9,000 but by reference to the original debt of £10,000.  It is thus allowed to recoup itself, without a capital gains tax charge, on as much as possible of the bad debt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair enough principle and is a relieving subsection. Could the Minister do the same in relation to subsection (5)?  If he has an example with regard to subsection (6), with which he has already dealt, it would help to clarify the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (6) speaks for itself.  I have not got an example. Subsection (5) extends the exemption in subsection (1) and the loss provision in subsection (4) to cover the remainder man.  Where the original creditor is a trustee and the debt is settled properly, a disposal by the remainder man or his representatives on becoming absolutely entitled as against the trustee to the debt, on its ceasing to be settled property, will, therefore, not be liable to charge nor can it give rise to a loss.  I am afraid I have not an illustration available but the principle is the same as in the previous subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section gives a number of detailed rules for the treatment of options and option payments, whether options to buy or sell, and whether exercised or not, including double options.  An option is to be treated as a separate chargeable asset in the hands of the grantor but not in the hands of the person to whom it is granted.</P>
      <P>On the abandonment of an option by any form of non-exercise, the grantor is not put to any expense and the consideration he has received is a gain.  With two exceptions, the abandonment of an option cannot give rise to an allowable loss by the grantee.  The exceptions are an option to subscribe for shares in a company and an option to acquire assets exercisable by a person intending to use the assets, if acquired, in his trade. The abandonment of an option in these two cases will give the grantee the right to claim an allowable loss equal to the amount of his allowable expenditure on the option.</P>
      <P>Where an option is exercised, the option and its exercise merge in a single transaction.  If it is an option binding the grantor to sell, the option consideration is treated as part of the sale consideration in the hands of the grantor and for the grantee the cost of the option is treated as part of the cost of the acquisition of the assets sold.  Also, if the option binds the grantor to buy, the grantor deducts the option consideration from the cost of acquisition while the grantee may deduct the cost of the option as an incidental cost of the disposal to the grantor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a double option where the grantor is bound to sell and the grantee to buy the option consideration is to be divided equally and the rules in the section are to <Col N="974" /> apply as if there were two separate options.</P>
    <P>I think I should explain the subsections because it is difficult to grasp them without getting the full explanation. Subsection (1) provides that the grant of an option is the disposal of an asset even where the grantor does not own the asset but he binds himself to sell or, because the option is abandoned, he never has occasion to own. Similarly, where he binds himself to buy, the granting of such an option is a disposal of an asset even though he never acquires the asset because the option is abandoned.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) deals with the case where the grantor of an option meets his obligation under the option.  The sale or purchase, as the case may be, is treated as one transaction with the option itself and the option consideration is added to the main consideration in computing a gain or a loss on the sale, or, if it is a purchase, deducted from the cost of acquisition.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that the exercise or abandonment of an option is not the disposal of an asset by the person entitled to exercise it.  There will not, therefore, be an allowable loss on an abandonment by him.  If the option is exercised it is to be treated as a single transaction with the acquisition or sale of the asset so that where the grantor is bound to sell, the option consideration is added to the grantee's cost of acquiring the asset and where the grantor binds himself to buy, the option consideration is treated as an incidental cost of sale to the grantee.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) treats certain options as wasting assets the life of which ends when the right to exercise the option ends or when the option becomes valueless.  This treatment applies where the option binding the grantor to buy or sell shares or securities quoted on a recognised stock exchange is disposed of by way of transfer as distinct to being surrendered or allowed to lapse.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides special treatment in two cases of options, namely, options to subscribe for shares in a company or to acquire assets for use <Col N="975" /> in a trade.  The abandonment of these types of options are to be treated as a disposal giving rise to a chargeable gain or allowable loss.  If an option to subscribe shares is disposed of or abandoned, there will be no restriction of expenditure under the rules relating to wasting assets, if the option is quoted on a stock exchange at the time when it is disposed of, and dealt with on the stock exchange in the same manner as shares.  If an option of this kind is quoted and dealt in within three months of a reorganisation, reduction, conversion or amalgamation falling under paragraphs 2, 3, 4 or 5 of Schedule 2 the option is treated in exactly the same way as the shares which could be acquired by the exercise of the option.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) treats options relating to shares or securities as constituting a single global asset, that is, a holding, and coming within the rule in paragraph 13 of Schedule 1 in relation to disposals of some of the options.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) provides that a double option&mdash;binding the grantor both to buy and sell&mdash;is to be treated as two options and half the consideration is attributed to each.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) states that the provisions described in relation to options extend to an option binding the grantor to give a lease or to enter any other transaction which is not a sale as such.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) applies the same treatment to forfeited deposits or other transactions which are abandoned as is applied to options.</P>

      <P>This section, in contradistinction to the previous one, has at least some logic to it.  One can gather the intention from the form of the section.  It is an interesting mathematical point that it takes seven times as many lines to express what the Minister wants to do as compared to what is in the explanatory memorandum. There are 12 lines in the explanatory memorandum and something like 85 lines in the section.  However, that coincidence is neither here nor there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> This section is necessary.  It deals with a type of transaction which could be used for tax evasion and it deals with a well-known commercial type of transaction which would result in capital gains.  In contrast with the previous section this section is an intelligible piece of legislation.  Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) deals with the case of a chancer who sells St. Stephen's Green and cons somebody into paying something for it.  I suppose it is fair enough to get after him for revenue purposes but it seems to me to be conniving at a fraud.  In other words, it is the grant of an option in a case where the grantor binds himself to sell an asset which he does not own and, because the option is abandoned, he never had occasion to own it.  The possibilities under that are limitless.  I understand the Minister's point that this is a compulsion of drafting.  At least it is clear.</P>

      <P>Without mentioning names I can think of some famous cases in history where, apart from the Attorney General and the civil authorities being interested in apprehending a particular type of activist, the Revenue Commissioners would have a big interest also.  It would raise the very interesting question as to when the Revenue Commissioners become receivers of profits on improperly gained goods.  It is an interesting possibility&mdash;the profits of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of the section is necessary and, from the legal point of view, it is perfectly proper.  I just mention the absurdities it can lead to, or are they absurdities?  It is necessary to dissect the type of option that may be dealt with for the simple reason that dealing in options is a pretty widespread method of dealing with capital and capital transactions.  I do not think anyone can object in this case to the Minister having special regard to it.  Even I who have advocated simplicity and a little trustfulness on our part in legislation would agree that this is a necessary section.  There are 85 lines in it and nine subsections and, like all sections of this nature, <Col N="977" /> only time will tell where the loophole is or where a nexus can be made between something in this section and something somewhere else in this Bill, or some other Act, to find consequences which are not foreseen and which would not be considered desirable by us.</P>

      <P>I am always somewhat afraid that with a phrase like that &ldquo;Without prejudice to the provisions of another section&rdquo; one could get into unnecessary difficulty.  If the section were to say simply &ldquo;The grant of an option, including so and so and so and so is a disposal&rdquo;, would the Minister have some difficulty with section 8?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I refer the Minister now to subsection (4) under which the disposal by way of transfer of an option binding the grantor to sell or buy shares or quoted securities is regarded as the disposal of a wasting asset and the life of the option is regarded as ending on the date on which the option is exercisable.  Therefore, on the disposal of such an option its cost is written down over its life.  This can result in a higher gain being charged to tax than was actually realised by a person who purchases it and subsequently sells it.  On the face of it, there does not seem to be any equitable reason why an option should be regarded as depreciating over its lifetime like other consumable assets. I wonder what is the thinking behind that provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be reflected in the example I give: A pays £1,200 for an option to purchase stocks and shares at a price of £100 a share.  The option runs out after six months and the market price at different dates is as follows.  The month before the option is exercised, £95; on the date of the option, £100 a share; the following month it would be £105 a share; the third month £107 a share; the fourth month £103 a share; the fifth month back down to £100 and at the sixth month, during which he can still exercise the option, down to £90 a share.  At the fifth month the option has no value; he can buy at the price of £100 on the market if there is a downward trend.  Therefore at that stage the option can be written off.  If we did not have the rule he could sell the option at the fifth month for a nominal consideration and claim a loss of £200, consideration being nil, less an expenditure of £1,200 reduced to five-sixths.  That will not affect <Col N="979" /> genuine business transactions, such as options to subscribe for shares or for the purchase of business assets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the rule in the subsection were not there, at the fifth month, I think the Minister said the option was valueless; therefore, it would be sold at nil or, as the Minister said, for a nominal sum.  Without the rule being there, is the Minister saying that the person concerned would claim a loss of £1,200 but, with the rule, he can claim a loss of five-sixths only?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not this whole question of the five-sixths arise because the Minister is treating the option as a wasting asset and, therefore, the question of the gain or loss is calculated in relation to the length of time involved?  Am I correct in that?  Whereas if it were not treated as a wasting asset but were treated as any other kind of asset, there would <Col N="980" /> not be a question of calculating the length of time involved; it would be merely the amount of gain or loss.</P>

      <P>This is the point I was trying to make.  Would the Minister accept that the application of the rule in subsection (4) can result in a person who buys an option and then sells it being taxed on a gain greater than he actually realised, given that the gain on which he is to be charged is calculated in the artificial way set out in the subsection?  If the Minister accepts that this situation can arise, the subsection ought to contain a proviso limiting the amount of the chargeable gain to the gain actually realised.  I am sure that would not present any problem in relation to what the Minister is trying to prevent, that is, people creating artificial losses.</P>
