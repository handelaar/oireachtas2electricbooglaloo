    <Title>Agricultural Workers (Holidays) (Amendment) Bill, 1975: Second Stage and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to bring the statutory holiday entitlement of agricultural workers back into line with that of workers in other categories of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Holidays for agricultural and non-agricultural workers are governed by separate legislation.  For agricultural workers we have the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Acts, 1950 to 1969 and for non-agricultural workers the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973. Prior to the passing of the latter Act both categories of worker had the same holiday entitlement of two weeks leave and six public holidays each year.  Under that Act, which <Col N="1266" /> came into effect on 1st April, 1974, the annual leave for non-agricultural workers was increased to three working weeks and, by regulations made by the Minister for Labour under the Act, they are now entitled also to an additional public holiday with pay on 1st January.  The present Bill is primarily designed to extend corresponding improved holiday provisions to agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>The Bill accordingly provides in section 1 for increasing the annual leave of agricultural workers to the equivalent of three working weeks where the worker is continuously employed during the year and proportionately less where he has been employed for 11 or fewer months.  The section also provides for the grant of annual leave in specified unbroken periods depending on the actual entitlement of the individual worker in any particular year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, this is the second time we have had to complain about the fact that no script has been issued by a Minister on the Second Reading of a Bill.  It happened already with the Minister for Defence. I wonder if the Minister has a script for circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies.  This means that where a worker has been employed for eight months or more, his holidays must include an unbroken period of two working weeks.  If he has been employed for less than eight but more than four months his holidays must include an unbroken period of one working week and, if employed for less than four but more than two months, his holidays must be allowed on consecutive working days.  The provision requiring the grant of holidays in specified unbroken periods already applies under the existing Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Act, but is being modified to take account of the increase in the annual leave entitlement to three working weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the inclusion of 1st January each year as a public holiday for which agricultural workers will now be entitled to pay, thus bringing <Col N="1267" /> them again into line with non-agricultural workers.  The section also empowers the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to make regulations appointing a day to be an additional public holiday for the purposes of the Bill.  This provision would confer on the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries powers in relation to agricultural workers similar to those already conferred by law on the Minister for Labour in regard to non-agricultural workers and avoids the necessity of having a special amending Act with provisions such as are contained in section 2 for any new public holidays in the future.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the House that this Bill be read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of our spokesman for Agriculture, who unfortunately was delayed getting to the House this morning, I want to say that we welcome this Bill for many reasons.  It is always good to see legislation coming before the House which can be welcomed by the Opposition Party and it is a very pleasant way in which to start the day's business.</P>
      <P>Everybody will be delighted to see agricultural workers beginning to get their fair due.  They are fully entitled to their annual leave, just as are their colleagues in industry or in any other walk of life.  For too long agricultural workers were the poor relations.  While we welcome this legislation which will guarantee them three weeks' holidays per year and public holidays such as 1st January, it is fair to say there will be problems for the small farmers.  They will have extreme difficulty in providing three weeks' holidays with pay for their workers, if they are lucky enough to have people working for them.  However, I hope this will not prevent agricultural workers from obtaining their just entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt many thousands of small farmers will look at this Bill with a certain scepticism, considering the depressed state of agriculture at the moment.  Many of the transitional or development farmers will not be able to take a two-week or a three-week <Col N="1268" /> holiday for themselves; because of the nature of their business and the size of operations they are required to be on the job full time.  However, it is only right that those who are lucky enough to farm in the better-off areas and who can afford to give three weeks' holidays to their employees should do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I am glad the Minister brought it before the House and, so far as we are concerned, we will give it a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Collins I do not welcome this Bill and I shall explain my reasons to the Minister and the Deputy.  I suggest that when the Minister has heard my reasons he may not wish to put all Stages through the House today. There are no agricultural workers in my constituency but I am sure most agricultural workers will be perturbed about what is in this Bill.  With respect to the Minister and the civil servants who drafted it, it is loaded with discrimination against agricultural workers.  As a backbencher on the Government side, I am appalled that the Government are introducing such discriminatory legislation.  In a two-page Bill, it discriminates on two or three fronts against agricultural workers in terms of their relationship with other industrial workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An adult non-agricultural worker who works at least 1,400 hours per year&mdash;120 hours per month&mdash;is entitled to annual leave but, according to this Bill, an agricultural worker who works the same, or a greater number of hours, is not qualified for paid annual leave for the appropriate period if he is absent due to illness or injury or if he is absent for four days in a period of one month.  For example, if an agricultural worker is sick for four days in a month and if he returns to work and works 150, 160 or 180 hours, because he was absent for four days he does not qualify for annual leave. If an industrial worker is ill or is absent from work through no fault of his own but if he does 120 hours in the month, automatically he qualifies for annual leave.  There is a built-in discrimination in this Bill and provision <Col N="1269" /> should be made to ensure that it is removed forthwith.</P>
    <P>A non-agricultural worker is enentitled to paid leave for public holidays if he works 120 hours per month, or 110 hours if he is less than 18 years, in the immediate five weeks prior to the holiday but the agricultural worker must work 125 hours in order to qualify.  Why is there discrimination between one group of workers and another?  I would urge the Minister to remove that anomaly.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 14,000 permanent and 9,000 temporary agricultural workers.  We cannot have a situation where a Bill like this, with at least two areas of discrimination, is passed by this House.  As the Minister knows, the meat processing plants have made a fortune in the past 12 months on the intervention scheme.</P>
    <P>I know of nobody in this country who cannot afford to pay any agricultural worker that little difference which would mean the removal of discrimination between the industrial worker and the agricultural worker.  If the agricultural worker is absent for four days in a month, even if he has worked 150 or 160 hours, he is disqualified under annual leave provisions.  The ordinary factory worker may be out for ten days in a month but if he comes back and works 120 hours during that month he qualifies.  There is discriminanation there.  There is also discrimination in relation to public holidays.  It takes 125 hours for the agricultural worker to qualify and only 120 for the non-agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>As a trade union official I represented agricultural workers.  I know of no provision in the 1950 Act, in the 1961 Act, or in the 1969 Act which makes it obligatory for a farmer to keep a record of the number of hours worked by an employee.  My understanding is that if a farmer keeps a record and if he is subsequently prosecuted he must produce it.  How will this Bill be enforced?  If the farmer does not keep a record of the number of hours worked by an employee and if he goes to court he cannot produce a record.</P>
    <P>As far as I know in this Bill and in other legislation there is no provision <Col N="1270" /> for the payment of cessor pay to the next-of-kin when an agricultural worker dies.  I do not often speak harshly of public servants but I often wonder what goes on in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in relation to industrial legislation to meet the needs of agricultural workers.  Since 1969 I have been trying in this House to get the Agricultural Wages Board abolished.  I suppose it would be improper to take the name of the Ceann Comhairle in vain but he has an honourable record in that regard too.  The late Seán Dunne berated this House for years in an effort to get the Agricultural Wages Board abolished.  We are on the verge of it but we are not sure whether the verge is next year or this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle carried the cudgels for agricultural workers when it was neither popular nor profitable.  There is no provision in this legislation to enable the State to comply with international regulations or indeed with EEC instruments.  There is one for Deputy Gibbons down in Carlow.  He can tell all those large, wealthy farmers he knocks around with that it is time they observed EEC regulations in relation to the agricultural worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a good many things they would want to observe.  They would want to observe how they are getting on under the Labour Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that in this legislation there is no provision for observation of EEC instruments and international obligations. There is no provision for the payment of cessor pay to the next-of-kin.  That should be there.  Every other worker in the country has that.  It is some years since I was in the trade union movement on a full time basis so here <Col N="1271" /> I am working on memory but I am not sure there is any provision in the 1950 Act, in the 1961 Act or in the 1969 Act which would enable a trade union to take proceedings for the recovery of cessor pay.  One can hardly expect the unfortunate widow of an agricultural worker to go chasing after a large farmer who has left her high and dry with perhaps £40 or £50 due to her.  Who will chase the farmer for the money?  In other legislation there is a provision under which action can be taken.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is enacted as it is proposed the present anomaly affecting the pay of agricultural workers in respect of public holidays will remain. I regret that I did not have an opportunity of talking to the Minister about the Bill before standing up to speak. The representations I have received in regard to the Bill have come rather late because, as he knows, we only decided this morning to take the Bill.  I find it difficult to understand why the Minister should amend the 1950 and the 1969 Acts when parity in holidays could have been achieved by repealing the 1950 Act, the 1961 Act and the 1969 Act. This would be far better.  Section 2 (1) (6) of the Holiday Act, 1973 could also be repealed.  This is the provision which excludes agricultural workers.  By repealing that section parity could be achieved between agricultural and industrial workers.  If this Bill is enacted as it is proposed farm workers' holidays will then be covered by no less than four separate and complicated Acts when the 1973 Act could cover the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My regard for the Minister is in no way diminished by the fact that he has brought in this Bill.  I still regard him as the finest Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries this country has ever had, and that includes those of his own party who held the office in the past.  I have no doubt that from his wide experience at EEC level in the past 12 months he will see the merit of the case I have made.  I have no doubt that Deputy Collins will also put down appropriate amendments for Committee Stage.  That would be his <Col N="1272" /> privilege.  Unfortunately, I am precluded from doing so on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to a healthy debate on the Bill.  I would suggest to the Minister that the Bill should be amended along the lines I have suggested because in 1975 in the Republic of Ireland, professing to be a Republic, professing to end the discrimination between Irish people north and south, within the north and within the south, we should not discriminate between about 14,000 permanent full-time agricultural workers and another 8,000 to 9,000 temporary agricultural workers and the workers in other sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that it should be withdrawn? Consultation did not take place.  The Deputy was not consulted about the Bill.  Neither were the Deputies on this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1273" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that there had been agreement more or less to give all Stages of this Bill to-day. I am somewhat surprised at Deputy Desmond's approach to the Bill although it is understandable in some respects.  We all understood that this Government were an open Government, that everything they did was discussed at their own party meetings and at Government meetings. It would appear from what Deputy Desmond has said here this morning that he certainly, as one Deputy on the Government side and an important Deputy at that, being Assistant Whip to the Government, has not been consulted.  One wonders how far his opposition to this Bill will go.  Will it go as far as voting against the Bill or putting down amendments?</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Collins, who led for this side, I should like to welcome the Bill.  In my constituency there are still quite a large number of agricultural workers but the number is decreasing as the years go by and farm workers are a very scarce commodity indeed in many counties.  For many years agricultural workers were regarded as the Cinderella section of the nation.  It was not the fault of the farmers who employed them but they were treated in a very poor way.  For many years they had no holidays at all.  Then legislation was introduced which gave them one week's holidays.  That was amended later to provide for two weeks' holidays. This Bill proposes to give them a minimum of three weeks' holidays. That is a very welcome addition to the concessions which the agricultural workers deserve and which are due to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this provision is bound to create problems for the agricultural community.  There would appear to be a mistaken idea on the part of Deputies like the last speaker that in the eastern section of the country, in counties like Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Kildare, there is a very large number of wealthy farmers for whom this measure will create no problems.  The opposite is true as far as that part of the country is concerned and what is true of the <Col N="1274" /> south-east would be equally true of the rest of the country.  The farming community are not in a very good position.  The provision of these extra holidays will create problems for them although I am sure the vast majority of farmers will welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the situation which Deputy Barry Desmond has put forward as the desirable situation, namely, that farmers would be in a position to treat their employees on the same basis as applies to industrial and other workers.  I sincerely hope that it will not be very long before the stage is reached when farmers will be in a position to pay their employees properly and to give them the conditions of service, the holidays and time off and so on, that other workers enjoy.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the farmers are not in that position at the moment.  They have come through a most difficult period.  I think that 1974, despite what Deputy Desmond said about what happened in the processing factories, was a very bad year for agriculture. I do hope that we will reach the stage when farmers will be in a position not only to give their employees the pay and holidays and other concessions that they deserve but to employ additional agricultural labourers, that the State will be able to reverse what is happening at the moment where the number of agricultural workers is decreasing rapidly.</P>
    <P>As I said, I welcome the measure on the grounds I have put forward and we have agreed to give it a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House and congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on introducing the Bill.  At present it is not possible to put agricultural workers on a par with industrial workers.  Any effort on the part of the Minister to bring them on a par with industrial and other workers should have the full support of the House. Therefore I fully support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is part of an effort by the Minister to encourage farm workers to stay on the land.  The work that they <Col N="1275" /> do is absolutely essential, productive and profitable.  The Bill in increasing holidays for agricultural workers by one week is certainly an incentive to workers to remain on the land, but more is needed to stem the flow from the land.  For example, extra holidays would be one way of encouraging workers to remain in agriculture. Similarly, we must provide sufficient incentives to encourage farmers to continue to employ farm workers.  In reply to a question in this House on February 19th last, the Taoiseach said that at 1st June, 1973 the total number employed permanently in agriculture was 21,000 while the number of temporary employees was 14,300.  The Taoiseach went on to state that the corresponding figures at 1st June, 1974 were estimated at 19,800 and 14,100, respectively.  These figures showed a considerable drop in the number of both permanent and temporary employees. We know that this trend is a world-wide one but that should not stop us from doing everything in our power to maintain farm employment. During the past 20 or 30 years the numbers of people employed in agriculture have been decreasing all the time.  I should think that there are about 10,000 fewer workers employed in agriculture now than there were 20 years ago.  In bringing this Bill before the House the Minister is going some little way to redress the situation but more is needed.</P>
    <P>Schemes will have to be devised to help farmers retain their employees because it is not possible to find employment for all of them in industry. Our aim should be to keep them on the land.  If farmers cannot afford to employ workers, we should provide some incentives for them to do so. Perhaps the Department, in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare, could devise some sort of farmers' remuneration scheme whereby financial assistance would be given to farmers to help them pay their workers.  I doubt if such a scheme would contravene any EEC regulation but something of this nature is absolutely essential.  It would be a good deal better to maintain a worker in employment than to <Col N="1276" /> have him draw the dole.  It should not be very difficult to devise a scheme of direct subvention to farmers for this purpose.  Neither should its administration prove too difficult because the subvention could be paid to farmers, say, every three months.  I am sure that Deputy Gibbons would agree with me on this.  So far as I am aware many Deputies on this side of the House would be anxious also that a scheme of this nature would be introduced.  It would be an incentive both to farmers and to their workers.</P>
    <P>Very often farmers experience great difficulty in finding people who are prepared to work for them.  In the reply given by the Taoiseach here and to which I have referred already we were told that at the date in question there were only 500 people in permanent employment in agriculture in Offaly and that there were 500 also engaged on a temporary basis. These figures are very low for such a large farming county.  The figures for Laois were 700 and 500 respectively.</P>
    <P>Regarding the £17 rates abatement in respect of agricultural employees, it is the belief of the IFA that this figure should be increased.  In my opinion it should be increased dramatically.  I understand that one of the reasons for its introduction was to help farmers pay for social welfare contributions.  If the abatement were such that it would cover the cost of the stamp, it would be a worthwhile incentive both to farmers and to workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but he seems to be ranging very wide of this Bill.  This is a very limited Bill dealing specifically with holidays for agricultural workers.  I have given the Deputy some latitude but he must not range very much wider than the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to proceed so far.  This Bill provides an incentive to farm workers to remain in agricultural employment.  I thought that anything which would be a similar attraction or incentive would be relevant.  I bow to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> Agriculture is a specialised industry and should be treated as such.  At present agricultural workers are working a 50-hour week.  I recommend to the Minister that we should endeavour to provide specialised courses and specialised training for farm workers.  Many of our farm workers have not got the expertise to deal with farming machinery.  They have not got the expertise to deal with dairy husbandry, beef husbandry and pigs.  The specialised courses I have in mind would be run under the auspices of the county committees of agriculture.  At various times some of our county committees of agriculture have endeavoured to provide such intensive courses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy again, but what he is embarking upon now would be more appropriate to the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  This is a very limited Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely essential that agricultural employees should have three weeks' holidays in the year.  Farmers also need holidays. If a farmer takes his holidays in the middle of September or October when combine harvesters are in use, or if he is ill, the farm worker must be able to handle these machines.  A combine harvester costs in the region of £16,000 and, if a worker has not sufficient training to use it properly, it can be damaged and can be out of action for a whole season.  Specialised training courses are essential.  They would be of great benefit.  If a farm worker has expertise he will take a pride in his work and this will also be an incentive to him to remain on the land.</P>
      <P>I am pleased with this Bill.  It is a welcome step forward.  Any measure which provides an incentive to our farm workers to remain on the land is welcome.  The work of agricultural workers is absolutely essential.  We are facing the busiest period of the year for farmers and any incentive or any scheme which can be devised to maintain them in their employment is welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I need hardly say that we all accept the sentiments expressed by Deputy Enright.  As <Col N="1278" /> Deputy Browne said some time ago, we were prepared to give the Minister all Stages of the Bill today.  I was highly surprised to get the impression from Deputy Desmond, speaking on behalf of the agricultural workers of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, I suppose, that he has a great many criticisms of the Bill.  I am of the opinion that since that is so, and recalling the record of the Government parties on votes in the past&mdash;like the Taoiseach's vote on the contraception Bill last year&mdash;it may well be that Deputy Desmond would wish to vote against this Bill or put down amendments to it.  For that reason, when the Second Reading debate has concluded, it might be wise to afford the Government parties an opportunity either to oppose the Bill totally, or to put down amendments to it since they appear to be rather unhappy with it.</P>
      <P>We have no opposition to anything which will make the lot of the farm workers more attractive than it is.  It is interesting to listen to speakers from the Government side of the House.  Deputy Enright spoke with obvious and very clear sincerity, and a great deal of insight into the general situation.  If he does not mind my saying so, he spoke as an outsider as, indeed, the other contributors from the Government side spoke, including the Minister himself.  The Government parties have the tremendous disability in dealing with agricultural matters that within their ranks they do not number anybody directly concerned with agriculture.  They have to rely on outside sources for their information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Enright must be very well informed.  He was speaking, and we are all speaking, of a vanishing race. I can claim at least 40 years' recollection of intimate acquaintance with the people we are talking about now.  I can recall clearly the pre-war years when farm workers made up a considerable part of the population.  I have seen with great regret&mdash;regret which is being converted rapidly into alarm&mdash;the decimation of the people of rural Ireland, both farmers and workers, the exodus of about 100,000 people from agriculture since 1961.  I <Col N="1279" /> speak from memory but I think those figures would be accurate enough.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright was a little altruistic when he hoped that the implementation of the provisions of this Bill would serve to arrest this haemorrhage which is now becoming very dangerous for the future of Ireland. In this case I am not assigning blame to the Government parties only.  For decades we have all been remiss about this.  The question we must now face is whether we can tolerate this exodus any longer.  I would ask the Minister and the House why it was not possible to improve the position of farm workers and farmers in a year when wages and salaries went up by about 30 per cent and in some cases a great deal more.</P>
    <P>For instance, the Taoiseach last year got an increase in salary of £2,500 per annum but in the same year our farmers on average, according to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, suffered a reduction in income of about 30 per cent.  Rural Deputies know that farmers involved in livestock production suffered a reduction in income of more than 30 per cent.  In many cases the producers of young livestock last year had no income whatever.  In fact, they sustained very grave losses.</P>
    <P>It is idle to pretend that a Bill of this kind can arrest the haemorrhage that could well be fatal for rural Ireland and Irish agriculture.  We are at the point when the capacity to extract maximum production from our land will be impaired if any more people leave farming.  That goes for farm workers and farmers.  The Minister should give us the benefit of his thoughts on the varying of Directive 159.  It is time for us to examine that same directive and its companion, Directive 160, to see whether they ought not to be radically redesigned in order to ensure that they do not hasten the exodus of farm workers and farmers from the land as I suspect they will.  The insistence on a figure of about £2,000 a year income per labour unit as the target to attain the development farmer status must have a serious bearing for every farm worker.  It is like <Col N="1280" /> the sword of Damocles over his neck. It may be that a farmer employing his sons on the farm will have to dispense with the service of his workers because if he does not he will not be able to show an income of £2,000 per labour unit.</P>
    <P>There is a close correlation between the situation of the farm workers and the implementation of Directive 159. In the light of the review of the Common Agricultural Policy being undertaken these directives are wrong and do not suit our farming community. We cannot accept a directive from Brussels, or anywhere else, that will consign by far the greater number of our farmers to an inferior status, that would appear to hope that in the end they will disappear altogether from farming.  I suspect that the motivation behind those directives is aimed at what used be called the Mansholt thesis of the development of semiindustrial farming.</P>
    <P>This must be resisted by us with every resource at our command because the people we are fighting for are our own.  We cannot tolerate this under any circumstances.  I am talking about the continued survival of the people of rural Ireland and it is intimately bound up with the necessity for a radical reform of the directives I referred to.  If we do not do this, we will have the greatest exodus ever seen from farming.  Speaking about the Gael after the Famine John Mitchell said they would be as scarce as Red Indians on the shores of Manhattan.  We must make a radical decision about this; are we going to tolerate it or not?  My Party will resist these directives for all we are worth.  I appeal to the Government to resist them but I want them to have the necessary resolve to do so.  I want the Government to recognise the dangers there are in these directives in the manner of their present application.  If they were applied with reason and humanity, they would do well enough but that is not happening and that is my worry.</P>
    <P>The basis of Commission thinking is the notional idea called the modern farm.  That expression has all kinds of dangerous connotations which can be interpreted in other ways but it <Col N="1281" /> seems to mean the highly developed, high acreage, immensely economically efficient farm and that is not the type of farm we have yet.  It may be that we do not want that kind of farm.  We want efficiency and modernity but we should get it into our heads that the institution we wish to preserve most of all is the family farm and as many of them as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but it is more important to think about this than to talk about an extra week for the workers.  The latter is important but the workers will not be there unless we give them the conditions. While this Bill gives relief and provides for more attractive conditions for farm workers, it will not solve the problem or prevent the exodus.  Before it is too late we must see that farm incomes are underpinned with the proper implementation of the common agricultural policy.  This is not happening.  At present we are in the shadow of the suspension of intervention in beef.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in his enormously arduous task in Brussels while at the same time he has an obligation to run his Department here.  I suspect that the governmental organisation in dealing with the burdens a Minister must carry are imperfect but that is not my affair at present.  I urge the Minister to bear in mind that unless farm incomes are properly and securely underpinned and unless we take radical measures to ensure that the exodus of people from rural Ireland is stopped we will have no problem in another decade about holidays for farm workers when one considers the marital status and the high average age of our farm holders.  We had better look to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise as a matter of duty to make the few points I have to make.  Since the formation of the Agricultural Wages Board, and for many years before <Col N="1282" /> that, our agricultural workers were treated as second-class citizens.  I do not think there is any doubt in anyone's mind about that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it is an improvement in conditions but I do not think it goes far enough.  I believe we should have the same legislation where holidays are concerned be the workers agricultural workers or any other kind of workers.  I do not see any good reason why agricultural workers could not be placed on a par with industrial workers.  Where legislation provides that workers can qualify for public holidays or other kinds of holidays by working fewer hours as compared with some other category of worker those workers are still being classified as second-class citizens.</P>
      <P>Agricultural workers are doing skilled work.  I speak in particular about my own area which is a predominantly tillage area.  The agricultural worker in that area has to be skilled in many trades.  For one thing, he has to be a mechanic.  As I said, this Bill will improve the position and the status of the agricultural worker. The Agricultural Wages Board did a good job in bringing people out of slavery and giving them some kind of basic rights but it is no longer compatible with the kind of society in which we live today.</P>
      <P>The Minister got certain concessions for the agricultural community in Brussels.  He got the green £ and various other things.  These concessions, while good for the farmers, are very little use to the ordinary agricultural worker.  All he got was an increase in the price of his milk, his butter, his bread and other commodities. He buys in the same shop as the industrial worker and he must pay the same price.  He has to pay a great deal more for his butter and for his bottle of milk because of certain benefits sought and granted for the agricultural community, the community of which he is a member.  The Agricultural Wages Board should be abolished and agricultural workers should take their place under the Department of Labour like all other workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The agricultural worker is fast disappearing from the agricultural sector of our economy.  I want now to take issue with Deputy Gibbons&mdash;I am sorry he is not still here&mdash;for firing an oblique shot at this side of the House.  He insinuated that we would only be theoretical in our approach to the problems of agriculture and the agricultural worker.  A great many people on this side of the House have for generations employed agricultural workers and they and I are personally aware of the situation of the agricultural worker and how it has evolved over the years.</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to give the same rights to holidays to agricultural workers as are enjoyed by industrial workers.  The Bill makes a careful distinction between a full-time agricultural worker and a part-time agricultural worker.  I want to emphasise that because a great many farmers might be concerned about the number of holidays they would have to allow a part-time agricultural worker.  Deputy Enright quoted figures and they are very interesting in that they seem to show that, if one divides the agricultural employment sector into fifths, one finds three-fifths are permanent and full-time and about two-fifths are part-time. These are rough approximations. In a period of one year there has been a great decrease in full-time agricultural worker employment as distinct from part-time agricultural worker employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that this Bill will be a great deal more relevant to east coast areas than it will be to western counties.  Deputy Enright pointed out that in Offaly there are only 1,000 registered agricultural workers.  That would bear out my view that the Bill is really relevant to areas like Wexford, Wicklow, Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Kildare, Cork, Meath and possibly Louth.  Outside of these areas there is probably a very small agricultural worker population. All the Bill is doing is rationalising the situation and giving certain rights to agricultural workers.  I have referred to the fact that some farmers may be concerned about the extra week's holiday being given to agricultural <Col N="1284" /> workers.  They might feel this would disorganise their general working year.  I see no grounds for that fear.  I am quite sure the Minister, with his knowledge and the background of the Department, will ensure that does not occur.  I heard that criticism when this Bill was mooted.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not an incentive to an agricultural labourer to stay in employment. He is just getting his fair rights in comparision with industrial workers.  I can foresee in the near future further rationalisation occurring in relation to the labour market because many agricultural workers do some part-time industrial work as well.  I refer particularly to people working during the beet campaign or those doing part-time work in factories.  I believe we are moving towards a situation in which a joint board will have to deal with the rationalisation of the terms of employment of all grades of workers in all sectors of the economy.  I believe there is some thinking in that line in official circles.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies strayed away from the actual terms of this Bill.  The number of people employed on the land depends on the number of employers who are available to take them.  Many people who up to this were classed as agricultural workers are now employees of contractors.  While the figures might show a decrease in the number of people employed in agricultural work, those people have moved into another category but they are still working in agriculture.  They may be working as employees of land drainage contractors or as tillage or harvesting employees of contractors in local areas.  This has been recognised by the Minister for Finance in his taxation allowances to farmers.</P>
    <P>I know there has been a serious decrease in the number of agricultural workers so that we could reach a stage where we would not have a sufficient number.  I imagine farmers have a way of dealing with this matter.  I hope that by using modern systems of agriculture it does not mean that farms have to be of a large size throughout the country.  I believe this is occuring slowly in marginal areas <Col N="1285" /> but I certainly would not like to see large ranch farms set up in the country with a low element of employment.</P>
    <P>Many people who work as agricultural workers are members of families so it may not be the full picture when one says that the working agricultural population has dropped.  All those matters should be taken into consideration when people are talking about the number of people working on the land.  I welcome this Bill although I know some people may have to make some adjustments. I believe it is not beyond the ingenuity of farmers to provide the extra week's holidays for agricultural workers.  It is only fair those people should get the same holidays as people working in other employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on the 24th April on this Estimate I referred to what I regard as complete failure on the part of the Government to promote the tourist industry and to make a success of it.  I also referred to the failure of the Government to handle situations within the ESB and CIE.</P>
      <P>What has transpired recently in both State-sponsored companies bears out the correctness of what I said.  I stated on that day that the ESB were cutting back on major schemes, that they had adopted a go-slow attitude in relation to their planned rural development scheme.  Obviously the ESB are laying off men slowly but surely.  I suggested that the Government should subsidise the ESB and that they should make arrangements for the ESB to carry out those major schemes and their programmes, as planned.  Now is the time to plan for provision of power if this country is to expand industrially in the future, which I believe it will.  If things improve again and industrialists come to this country, certainly it will be a big set-back to them to find that the infrastructure, such as the provision of electricity, does not exist in sufficient quantity.</P>
      <P>I believe that the recent increases announced by the ESB in its charges will have a crippling effect on the economy.  Certainly, they will have a crippling effect on the ordinary man who finds it difficult to pay his ESB bills.  I meet people daily experiencing difficulty in meeting their ESB bills.  I had occasion recently to refer a number of such cases to the superintendent assistance officer and to the home assistance officer to ascertain whether or not their bills could be paid by way of assistance through the county council in order that their electricity supply would not be cut off.  These further increases announced certainly mean that there will be a category of persons who cannot possibly afford to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must examine also the effect of <Col N="1287" /> these increases on industry.  We know industry is going through a very trying time at present.  The increased ESB charges certainly will affect many industries and probably to an extent that some just hanging on at present will be forced to close down, with resultant further unemployment.  I believe that one of the primary reasons for these outlandish increases in charges which the ESB found necessary to impose is the failure of the Government to check inflation, now running at approximately 30 per cent per annum. With regard to electricity supply, the Government should endeavour to arrange that such large capital contributions would not be required from persons in rural areas, particularly from persons building homes.  I know of many cases where such capital contribution required by the ESB for the supply of electricity to persons building their homes amounts to the total of the combined State and local authority grants.</P>
    <P>It is my firm belief also that one of the primary reasons CIE have found it necessary to increase their charges&mdash;as announced recently&mdash;is the failure of the Government to check inflation, their failure to deal with any crisis that develops.  Up to recently it was evident that more and more people were using CIE as a means of transport for pleasure and business purposes.  Probably the tremendous increase in the price of petrol, as a result of Government taxation, had something to do with this.  But the colossal increase announced recently by CIE in respect of transport will mean that fewer people will travel with them which, in turn, will involve a reduction in revenue to CIE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We must examine the position so far as CIE are concerned and ask ourselves if this is a social service.  Is it to be operated as a social service?  I believe it is.  That being said, it is the duty of the Government to subsidise the company <Col N="1288" /> if it cannot carry on without increasing fares to such an extent that it will discourage people from using CIE as a mode of transport and involve more losses for the company.</P>
      <P>Before concluding, I must refer again to the complete failure of the Government to promote tourism here.  I believe very little effort is being made to promote the tourist market in Western Europe and Britain.  I believe there is a substantial market to be tapped in Western Europe and in Britain and that Bord Fáilte would be well advised to move their forces from Japan and Australia and concentrate on that market.  It will be years before we see thousands of tourists coming here from Japan and Australia.  I would strongly urge the Minister for Transport and Power and the Government to drop section 10 of the Wealth Tax Bill so far as hotels are concerned because we know that hoteliers are going through a very difficult period.  Many of them are on the verge of bankruptcy already.  Should the Government proceed with the Wealth Tax Bill and implement section 10, as published, it will mean the end for many a hotel here.  It is evident that hotels are doing badly when we see that Ostlanna Iompair Éireann, a group of hotels backed by the State, have shown considerable losses in recent years.  How, then, can we expect the family-run hotel or the chain of small hotels throughout the country to operate at a profit while the Government intend bringing in a measure to further tax hoteliers&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the principal reasons for the failure of the tourist industry here is the rising cost of living.  I have no doubt but that we have priced ourselves out of the tourist market.  The failure of the Government to check inflation has interfered substantially not alone with the tourist industry but has been the cause also of the substantial increases announced recently in ESB charges and CIE fares.  The Government, failing miserably to check inflation <Col N="1289" /> have contributed to the extent of approximately 90 per cent to the failure of the tourist industry and to the substantial increases in electricity charges and CIE fares.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Transport and Power encompass a large number of semi-State bodies.  This is about the only opportunity we get to speak about these bodies.  We should set up within this House at an early date a series of committees to look into the activities of the semi-State bodies.  It is high time the semi-State bodies were accountable to this House to a far greater extent than they are at present.  CIE have been granted a subsidy of £17 million but we cannot ask questions about them in this House.  The whole operation is wrong. The taxpayers foot the bill and they elect us to look after their interests. If we have not the opportunity to ask relevant questions it is time we put into operation the select committee system.  I would ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that this is done.  It would help his Department also.</P>
      <P>In addition to the subsidy given to CIE, their fares have increased considerably and one wonders where it will stop.  We must examine the whole transport system and ask if we are getting value for money.  The Minister should carry out an investigation into the cost of running CIE.  We know costs have escalated but the question is whether they have escalated to such a degree.  I do not know the answer and it is up to the Minister to find out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said before that CIE should operate a proper transportation system in Dublin because the present system is chaotic.  We have been getting various road reports every year but no action has been taken.  CIE have responsibility for transporting people and they have an obligation to come up with the answers.  It is no use saying there are too many cars on the roads.  CIE must operate a system that will transport people quickly and economically from one point to another.  I have advocated that, where possible, our cities should be <Col N="1290" /> pedestrianised but this is impossible with the present transport system.  It does not justify requesting motorists to park outside the central city area and to use buses.  The transport system is not properly geared to cope with this and we have no proper plan but in Nottingham, for instance, it operates efficiently.  Some business people are concerned that it might kill the life of city but the contrary has been proved.  There is evidence that where people can come in and move freely around a city there is a greater degree of commerce.</P>
    <P>CIE should re-examine their role. Otherwise people will tend to use cars to a greater degree and this is not in the best interests of anyone.  Every morning cars come into the city with only one person in them and this is a complete waste of transport and petrol. However, the car owner has no option. There has been considerable development in Dublin in the Clondalkin, Blanchardstown, Ballyfermot and Dundrum areas but the only contribution to transport in those areas was the closing down of the Harcourt Street railway line.  I said before it was a scandal and I shall continue to say it until some action is taken.  The line was vandalised so that it might not be used again but it is never too late to change.  We are paying £17 million to CIE; we want action and I would ask the Minister to ensure that CIE take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>They could well look at the system used on the Continent for the transportation of merchandise.  Are they satisfied there is not a place for them in that undertaking?  What disturbs me about many semi-State bodies is that they do not think they have an obligation to make money.  They think they have discharged their duties if they are just operating but they have an obligation to make a profit, to plough it back into their organisation and to create a better service.  They should constantly examine how they might widen the scope of their activities to ensure they are giving the best service possible. Some people are advocating a municipal transport system in Dublin.  That would take a large area from CIE and <Col N="1291" /> I do not think it would work.  CIE have the organisation to run a transport system but it is up to them to consider how they might play a more effective role so that the taxpayers get the best value for the vast sums going into that organisation.</P>
    <P>In the recent past we have been made aware of the enormous cost of fuel.  As a nation we are very vulnerable&mdash;perhaps the most vulnerable in Europe&mdash;and it is vital that we use every ton of oil to the best advantage. We have heard a lot about district heating.  While we had cheap fuel we did not feel it incumbent to exercise our minds on this.  We have a lazy attitude towards innovation.  I do not think we can drag our feet in this area any longer because people want a higher standard of living and they can only have this if we give them the opportunity.  Central heating is no longer a luxury.  Heating in all forms is a necessity.  It was a tragedy that we had to revert to coal fires in many new housing estates because of the high cost of the type of central heating we had introduced in them.  No matter what the advertisement may say about the coal fire it is both expensive and highly inefficient and it is a major pollutant factor in our cities.  Seventy-five per cent of the heat of a coal fire goes up the chimney and coal today is very expensive.</P>
    <P>The <i>Financial Times</i> published an article on district heating in which it was said that if the Government were willing to take seriously the fact that the era of cheap energy is at an end district heating is one area where they should encourage a lot more study and ultimately action.  It said that to date government activity appears to have been largely confined to lower speed limits, higher prices and their campaign to get consumers to save energy with little attempt to get to grips with the real problem.  It said that district heating supplies heat and hot water to a large number of premises or an entire town from one central heat source, that it is something which can, in the right conditions, offer a real saving and that it is something that has been relatively <Col N="1292" /> ignored.  We must admit that up to now we were not terribly concerned because central heating was not all that expensive.</P>
    <P>People still want central heating and rightly so.  There is in the ESB a vast generating area and this generating area can, if the right type of boiler is installed, give something of the order of a 90 per cent efficiency as against about 45 per cent at the moment.  An ideal start on a small scale could be made in the Ringsend area where a large number of houses are being built.  Beside that there are generating stations which have vast quantities of water and which can install the type of boiler that is necessary to heat those houses at a relatively low cost.  Here there is a vast new area of energy conservation.  I know the ESB have done a study of this and that there are pros and cons but from the social and economic point of view I think the pros far outweigh the cons.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make an indepth study of all the factors involved in district heating.  It is not a new concept.  It operates in most of the continental countries and in countries that are not as much affected by the high cost of oil imports as we are.  We have an obligation to look at this. Initially it would cost quite an amount of money but if it were properly planned I believe the international banks would be forthcoming with money at a reasonably low interest rate.  It would cut down on the expense of separate heating units which, to some extent, pollute the atmosphere.  The cost of running a central heating point would be negligible even where there was not a generating station.  There could be one vast boiler, possibly filling the dual role in a town of supplying electricity and heat.  People are being asked to switch off lights and turn off taps and this is effective to a certain degree but people forget after a while. We must find a positive way of conserving energy.  This is the way we can do it positively.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister in his reply making constructive suggestions in regard to energy conservation, what <Col N="1293" /> can happen, what he would intend to do and what machinery he would propose to set in motion to examine this matter.  The matter must be examined. People will continue to want a better way of life and central heating will be one aspect of this.  We cannot afford the very high cost of central heating.  If we discover vast quantities of gas and oil off our coast we will still have the obligation to conserve these fuels.  We have an obligation to future generations. The resources should not be dissipated. It is important to make the best use of any resources that we find by way of iron ore, oil or gas.  In that way we will be carrying out our responsibility to posterity.  When one has regard to our national debt one wonders what we are doing about future generations.</P>

      <P>Borrow now and pay later&mdash;this is the system.  We should have a very strong sense of responsibility in regard to the use of natural resources.  Up to a couple of years ago we were casually drifting into the throw-away society, where one buys and keeps for a year and then throws the article in the bin.  This generated a feeling of irresponsibility.  If the oil crisis did nothing else, it made us face the reality that we are not our own masters all the time, that there are people and forces which we do not control and it made us reassess our situation.</P>
      <P>A district heating association has been set up.  There are many people concerned.  I know personally a Mr. Byrne who is in the Electricity Supply Board, who gives a considerable amount of time to this matter.  Great credit is due to people like him who work so assiduously in the national interest.  It is heartening that there are so many people outside who are concerned with the national interest.  This is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of heating which would affect the Deputy now sitting on the other side of the House. When he hears what I have to say he may possibly agree with me.  There is a whole new industry that could be set up.  The high cost of fuel has <Col N="1294" /> driven the glasshouse industry into difficulties.  There have been questions raised in the House about the cost of oil and requests have been made for grants and subsidies.  The ESB are putting in an additional generating set in the Lanesboro' area in the next few years.  If they put in the right type of set there is a potential for a large glasshouse industry in the Lanesboro' area.  I do not think the Deputy would see anything wrong in that.  The cost of heating a glasshouse would be one-third the present cost.  This would have the effect of bringing a new industry into an area.  Obviously there would be the initial cost of erecting the glasshouses but the development would be ongoing.</P>
    <P>An industry does not remain static; it either expands or declines. This matter should be examined seriously.  An Foras Talúntais have examined the matter.  I would ask the Minister to follow it up so that this type of industry can be developed.  It would be part of the agricultural scene, which is important and it would be of great benefit to the economy.  We all talk about inflation but we have to get down to the job of tackling it and controlling it where possible.  One way of doing this would be this type of horticultural development.</P>
    <P>I have referred to Lanesboro' but there are other areas where there are generating stations and where land would be available for the establishment of a glasshouse industry.  A substantial volume of horticultural produce is imported.  This could be reversed and we could increase our exports.</P>
    <P>I realise that this matter may be one for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries but as the Electricity Supply Board would be involved I would ask the Minister to check the possibility of having my suggestion implemented.  What I have said may not be gospel but, there is a lot of truth in it and I am asking the Minister to investigate it.  It is something new but something that we should be looking into.  It is imperative that there be new thinking and new methods in all of this development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> The ESB have provided a very good service to this nation since their establishment.  Industries have not been prevented from coming here because of any lack of electricity supply. All aspects of energy development have been considered and developed in so far as possible.  Our rivers have been harnessed to the greatest extent possible and we have gone so far as to recycle power.  This has happened in the Glendalough area where by a process of pumping up water in the off-peak period into a vast reservoir 700 feet up the power can be released at peak periods.  This is good planning.  Last year there was much talk of the development of a nuclear station but there is rethinking in this respect now that there are gas and oil finds off our coasts.  However, we must keep all our options open.  I do not know enough about nuclear energy to be able to say whether we should develop in this direction but, at least, we must endeavour to have diversification of sources of supply. In the event of trouble in the countries from which we get our oil supply we could be in a very vulnerable position by not having any other energy source.  Because we are an emerging industrial nation it is of the utmost importance that we have a constant and a reasonably cheap energy supply.  I understand that the development of a nuclear station involves a period of about ten years.  Therefore, if we are to develop in this direction we must think well ahead.  Because of the possible hazards involved in nuclear development much thought must be given to any such project and we must ensure that in deciding whether to have a nuclear station, our prime concern must be for what is in the best interest of our nation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the domestic scene, we must endeavour to eliminate any duplication there might be.  Very often we see one company vying with another to attract customers, while, basically, the same kind of fuel is being used.  Duplication in this area is a luxury we cannot afford.  That is why we should use only the source of <Col N="1296" /> energy that is the best in so far as our economy is concerned.</P>
    <P>Down through the years the gas company have served their consumers very well.  That is why I was surprised to read that the Opposition spokesman concerned objected to a subvention of £1 million being made to the company to help them in a difficult time.  Because of inflation and of the increasing cost of fuel, the company experienced financial difficulties but because they were not a semi-State concern they could not request moneys by way of estimate here.  However, the Government decided to help them by way of subvention.  Perhaps the Opposition were playing politics in their objecting to that subvention but the people of Dublin would not thank them for that type of attitude because many people rely on the gas company for their domestic energy needs.</P>
    <P>I would not agree with ploughing money into companies that were not viable but the gas company have managed to be viable down through the years and only ran into difficulties because of circumstances that were outside their control.</P>
    <P>While people may prefer to have a choice in regard to the energy they use for cooking and heating there may come a time when we must rationalise in regard to, for instance, the various bottle gas companies.  In other words, we may have to tell consumers that they can have any colour so long as it is black.  At any rate, the aim must be for the domestic consumer to use only that fuel which is of the least cost to the nation.</P>
    <P>I do not live in the tourist belt but tourism is a very important aspect of our economy because it brings in quite a large volume of money to offset our imports.  This invisible export, as it is called, has always been a valuable source of income and has a direct effect on our balance of payments.  Deputy O'Leary said we were pricing ourselves out of the market.  If he went to England or to any other country, he would find that our hotel prices are still reasonable.  They are more than competitive particularly with the continent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> We seem to be concentrating on markets from which we are getting slightly diminishing returns.  Our Presidency of the EEC for the first six months of this year has gained tremendous prestige for us.  The President and our Ministers have enhanced our reputation. Are Bord Fáilte cashing in on this?  Are they doing a follow-up job? This is the type of publicity you could not buy.  The European papers gave a great Press and great coverage on our organisation and ability to run this conference.  With the right type of follow-up, this should ensure that we will get an even greater share of this market.  By and large, Europe is bulging at the seams.  It is over populated.  When you travel in Europe you see the roads and beaches, and so on.  The rivers are polluted. Here we have relatively good roads to drive on and very good hotels.  Possibly we have the best food in the world at a reasonable price.  We have sea and river fishing.  We have a relaxed atmosphere which people from the Continent would like.  To me this is a tremendous tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>We hear about the sun in Spain but all you get there is a burned back if you lie out in the sun long enough.  By and large, the food is bad and you get a pain in your tummy if you eat the wrong kind.  People who live in highly developed countries and who are under pressure would like the atmosphere here.  Are Bord Fáilte doing enough in this area?  I do not know.  Admittedly, the figures are going up and up.  In that type of business I do not think they can go down, so I am not marking them up too highly for that.  We should have a greater influx of this type of tourist, particularly now that we are a member of the EEC, now that we are &ldquo;one of them&rdquo; as it were.</P>
    <P>Rather than going to Australia looking for tourists money should be spent in the European market.  If we do a good marketing job there, we will attract them.  We have our problems. So far as Europeans are concerned the Northern situation affects the whole country and this inhibits people from coming here.  That makes the job harder but with good salesmanship, good market research and good advertising, <Col N="1298" /> plus the fact that we have the Presidency until the end of June, we should be able to attract more tourists to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Apart from the actual revenue, this will make us more European.  We will get to know the European people better and they will get to know us. This will break down any barriers or suspicions that may exist.  Up to recently, many people thought Ireland was part of England, just a small island off the coast of England.  I was always upset when I heard that said.  That barrier is down.  The market is there and why not explore it.  We have a problem in the British market since the bombs went off.  There is a certain degree of prejudice but we must work to get that market.  Markets are now hard won everywhere.  You only get out of a business what you put into it.</P>
    <P>We have the obligation of ensuring that our hotels are of a high standard. I would be very strict with hotels which provide a bad service.  I would have a list and, if a hotel did not come up to scratch, I would remove it from the list.  I know hotels are graded but I often wonder if the grading is strict enough.</P>
    <P>Farmhouse holidays appeal to people from the Continent.  They are big income earners.  It is a boon to people in the country that they can operate this business.  Farmhouse holidays are very professional.  I have taken a number of these holidays and I could not speak highly enough of the way they are organised and the service and civility provided.  This is the type of thing which will bring tourists to Ireland.  I am happy that the farmhouse holidays provide a good service and that people are well treated.  By and large, all our hotels provide the same service.  I believe we have the gift of being able to communicate and to treat people with respect and sincerity and a reasonable degree of charm.  It is amazing how these attributes can help the tourist trade.  I am not critical of Bord Fáilte.  I am merely asking are they doing enough in the European market.  I do not know.  I suspect they are not.</P>

That report states that the immediate effects on the money supply and bank liquidity of financing Government expenditure in part <Col N="1300" /> through the Central Bank are much the same as when recourse was had to external borrowing.  The report states that the bank is, therefore, prepared to help in financing the Exchequer borrowing requirement on the basis of substantial adherence to the budgetary disposition and in the context of the objectives of monetary policy set out in the statement on Monetary Policy, 1975, reproduced in the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of various Government statements to the effect that improved marketing conditions are likely to occur, he considers it essential that the rate of investment in industry should be accelerated so that this country will be in a position to take full advantage of improved marketing conditions when they do occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>The fiscal reliefs and Government expenditure provided for in the recent budgets were designed to induce industrial investment to the maximum despite the current economic difficulties. As evidence of this concern and priority, the provision for the industrial Development Authority for 1975 is £42,500,000 which is 50 per cent greater than that for the previous year.  The 1975 provision for capital expenditure by the Industrial Credit Company is £24 million compared with £4.6 million in 1972-73, and £16.2 million in 1973-74.  The liquidity problem has been eased by the recent fiscal and monetary measures including increasing the rate of initial allowance for capital expenditure incurred on industrial buildings between 15th January, 1975, and 31st March, 1977, from 20 per cent to 50 per cent and the rate of annual allowances for industrial buildings from 2 per cent to 4 per cent.  Company tax relief costing £12 million a year has also been given this year to assist companies engaged in manufacturing, construction or farming or in the sale of productive plant, machinery or materials to those sectors.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy there is a limit to Government action in attempting to induce investment.  In the final analysis the decision to invest lies at the individual or company level.</P>

The Department of Education advised the commissioners on 6th November, 1970, that a new national school should be provided on the eastern side of Killarney town. The site offered at Ballycasheen was inspected by the commissioners and in March, 1971, the Department were informed that that site was suitable. That was 1970 and 1971.  The commissioners did not receive any further communication regarding the school until October, 1974.  That is when the delay occurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>A special survey team set up to carry out an appraisal of the landing facilities required to meet the needs of the fishing industry on the Cork coast recommended in 1972 that an extension of the pier to make it accessible at all stages of tide would <Col N="1310" /> be useful mainly from the point of view of communications.  That has nothing at all to do with fisheries.  It has not been possible to prepare an engineering report and estimate of costs on the survey team's recommendation because of our large workload and a shortage of staff.  It was hoped to have the report prepared by one of the resident technical staff engaged on the Castletownbere harbour development project but a further depletion of staff there last year and pressure for the completion of necessary works at Castletownbere fisheries centre, including Dinish Island, prevented this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain it to the Deputy.  The improvements recommended for Kilcummin Pier by the County Mayo Harbour Survey team were the extension of the slip, improvement of the boatyard and provision of a bigger winch, all estimated, in July, 1972, to cost £11,000.  Following local consultations the commissioners were asked by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to examine revised requirements and, in May, 1974, the commissioners submitted two alternative proposals to the Department.  The first proposal, estimated to cost £11,500, provided for replacement of the outer half of the existing strong-wall by a similar wall in concrete, aligned in a south-easterly direction, and the installation of a two-ton winch.  The second proposal, estimated to cost £40,000, provided for demolition of the outer half of the existing strong-wall, incorporation of the remainder in a new pier, 12 feet wide with a six foot wide strong-wall, and the installation of a one-ton hand-operated crane.  In July, 1974, the Department requested an estimate of cost of amending the first of the schemes mentioned, by enlargement of the outer end of the strong-wall to provide a small landing platform on which a crane would be erected.  Due to heavy commitments of the marine engineering staff, particularly on projects in the Galway-Mayo area, the commissioners have been unable to submit their report to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  However, every effort will be made to furnish the required report and estimate to that Department within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>An improvement scheme in the fishery interests has been carried out to the existing pier at Killala by the Commissioners of Public works on behalf of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The pier is adequate for this purchase but, due to site conditions and the development of land and sea traffic, additional piling and dredging are considered necessary.</P>

In fact, the Parliamentary Secretary has not carried out the intentions of the previous Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, that pier should never have been sited in that spot because it is in miles and miles of mud.  If the former Administration were correct, the location of that pier should have been on the edge of the deep water half a mile further out on Inch Island. This has gone on now for five years. The very first week I was in office I received a call from the Killala Development Committee.  I met them on the pier and, to a layman's eye, it appeared that the pier would topple over but for the fact that we are now going to pile-drive from the mainland out to the portion that might fall in. I feel sure it will be done this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have received no proposal under the Coast Protection Act, 1963 concerning coastal erosion threatening the village of Inver.  Under the Act it would be a matter for Donegal County Council to investigate and consider such a proposal in the first instance.  The commissioners have, however, received a proposal from Donegal County Council for coast protection works affecting an area at Kilmacreddan a few miles west of Inver village.  Because of more urgent commitments, in County Donegal and elsewhere, I cannot say when this proposal will be reached.</P>

      <P>The deputation consisted of members of Bundoran Urban Council and Donegal County Council.

The other case was not mentioned except in passing.

      <P>Two archaeologists are attached to the Archaeological Survey Office at present located at Robinstown, Mullingar, while work on field monuments in Westmeath and the adjacent counties is in progress. A third archaeologist operating from Dublin is employed on an inventory of architectural monuments.  The recent appointment of a senior archaeologist as director of the Archaeological Survey Office brings the professional archaeological staff to four.  He has not yet taken up duty as director as he is finishing some work on which he was engaged.  An architectural assistant is normally employed on the work of the survey.  This post is now vacant.  A small number of workmen are employed each summer in connection with field work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 14th January, 1975, the Forest and Wildlife Service of the Department of Lands at the request of the Commissioners of Public Works have carried out a survey of the trees in the Phoenix Park.  The report on the survey is being considered by the Commissioners with a view to the preparation of a long term replanting programme.  As yet, however, no definite plans for replanting have been formulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a rather complex situation.  The information the Deputy is getting is taken from the Bolton Street Architectural Students' Report and they claimed that 60 per cent of the trees in the park were beyond maturity and would die within 30 to 40 years.  The Commissioners of Public Works did not consider this report authoritative enough to warrant immediate action and they sought the advice of the Forest and Wildlife Service of the Department of Lands.  Officers of that Department carried out a general survey of the trees in the park and their report is at present under consideration by the Commissioners so the Commissioners cannot work until they have studied this report.  The general conclusion reached by those officers was that while the state of the trees does not give rise to thoughts of impending disaster, the time is opportune for planning a comprehensive replanning and maintenance programme. It is the intention of the Commissioners to appoint in the very near future an arboricultural officer <Col N="1323" /> who will be responsible, under the guidance of the Commissioners' landscape architect and under the general direction of the park superintendent, for the implementation of the tree planting programme.  The post will be advertised in the press shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes back further than that.  In 1969 the County Meath Committee of Agriculture sold a site to the Commissioners of Public Works for the erection of Government offices in Navan.  They sold a further site to the Office of Public Works in 1973 as an extension to that site.  A prefabricated office to accommodate Department of Agriculture and Fisheries staff engaged on the brucellosis eradication scheme was erected on the site as a matter of urgency.  It is proposed to build permanent Government offices on the site and planning for this is in progress. In the meantime, it is necessary to erect a fence between the County Committee of Agriculture property and the Government-owned site, to provide a temporary entrance, to light the avenue from the entrance to the office, to provide a sign and <Col N="1327" /> to tidy up the site generally.

I refer to a question of mine relating to broadcasting into the Six Counties which has been ruled out of order because of legislation which is now before the Seanad but which may not be before this <Col N="1329" /> House for months.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, yesterday I submitted a Private Notice Question which you ruled out of order on the grounds that it did not satisfy the requirements of Standing Orders in relation to the matter being of public and urgent importance.  You accepted that the matter&mdash;I refer to the remarks made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs during an RTE interview on Sunday last&mdash;was of public importance but I would argue that this matter was also urgent in that there was need for an immediate assurance to the minority population in the North that the policy of the Government, not withstanding the remarks of the Minister, was being pursued, that is, the policy of power-sharing.</P>
      <P>I disagreed with your ruling but in the light of the Taoiseach's promised statement on the matter I did not pursue it further.  Yesterday our party decided to put forward a Special Notice Question in the name of our spokesman on Transport and Power, Deputy Barrett, regarding the imminent 33? per cent increase in CIE fares.  Again, the question was ruled out of order.  Apparently this was done on the same grounds as applied in the other case&mdash;that it did not comply with the requirement of Standing Orders that the matter be urgent and of public importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can you justify that ruling?  The matter concerned is very important and it would be my intention to pursue <Col N="1330" /> it if I do not receive a satisfactory explanation as to why it was ruled out of order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for private notice treatment of a question of the type referred to, the question must relate to some sudden development which could not be dealt with effectively by a question on ordinary notice.  My information is that Deputy Barrett could have raised this matter by putting down an ordinary question.  The increases in fares referred to were announced on Thursday last so that the Deputy would have had ample time to table a question in the ordinary way for this week.  Consequently, the question does not qualify for private notice treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That explanation does not stand up to examination in the light of the facts.  First, the announcement was not made on Thursday last.  It was made by way of the publication of the report of the Prices Advisory Commission on which there was a stop order for Friday, May 2. Deputy Barrett could not have had official notice of that increase, although there was newspaper speculation in the days previous, until the publication was released.  He got that on Friday but in the ordinary course of events he would have been on his way home then.  If, even then he had submitted a question it would not have been in time for the ordinary Order of Business until later this week. In the light of the procedure of the House there was no likelihood whatever that a question submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whose first question on today's Order is No. 159 and whose last question is No. 179, would have been taken this week.  That question would have been likely to have been No. 180 on the Order Paper.  I submit that there was no doubt about the public importance of the matter concerned.  The increases were due to have come into operation on Monday last but by reason either of some dilatory action on the part of the Government or because of some inability on the part of CIE to implement the increases, they have been <Col N="1331" /> postponed until Monday next.  Regardless of that there can be no doubt about the urgency and public importance of the matter which involves a huge increase in transport fares which will affect almost everybody in the country.  Therefore, I suggest that the matter should have been allowed by way of Special Notice Question today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>By 1978 we may be getting 12 per cent of our needs for energy consumption by way of natural gas coming in from Kinsale Head.  I wonder are we making the best use of natural gas in Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta <Col N="1335" /> and the ESB?  We have a few years to go before we will actually have the gas and we might now be in a position to actively encourage industry into areas where our natural gas would be of greater value.  Any energy we have must be used wisely and fully.  If it were possible to use it as a town gas, would that be more efficient than having to build a particular type of generator?  We must ask ourselves these questions.  We are completely dependent on fuel and this might be an opportunity to attract the type of industry which could use natural gas and also have a reasonably high employment content.</P>
      <P>The same could be said for oil. The statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last week was very informative and will ensure that we get the best value for the people.  The Minister for Transport and Power will also ensure that we have the necessary ability to take in oil and refine it and maximise its effects on the economy.  These assets will be of tremendous benefit to our people in the years ahead.  No doubt they will increase the standard of living of our people and ensure that our economic dependence on imported energy and fuel will be minimised. To do that we must have a very effective programme.  We must be quite clear in our minds as to what we will do with these assets. I do not think we can select two or three industries out of a hat and decide to use the oil or gas in those industries.  Our use of the natural gas must be planned.  In this regard we can learn from countries who discovered natural gas in the last few years.  We all realise that initially errors can be made in the use of natural gas and it is up to the Government to ensure that we do not fall into the pitfalls those countries did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of setting up a harbour board in Bantry.  That is a very scenic area but the last government made a complete boob by allowing oil tankers to discharge their cargo there without any controls.  The Minister should <Col N="1336" /> rectify the recklessness of the former government in this regard.  It is in the interest of us all that we minimise pollution, but we do not have very strict penalties to combat that. The multi-national companies can promise a lot but they do not have any obligation to anybody or to any place.  They are using our country for their own convenience and at ridiculous terms.  It is highly desirable that we have a harbour authority in Bantry.</P>
    <P>We all have a stake in our tourist industry and it is ridiculous that industries can be established without control over them.  In a lot of cases industries spoil our countryside.  What one could describe as &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; industries should be sited in special areas and other industries kept under strict control.  We should control the Gulf Oil Company by setting up a harbour authority in Bantry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my contribution I will deal with the areas of this Department that affect rural Ireland.  Since this Estimate was introduced CIE have imposed a major increase in fares and freight charges. I believe the increase is of the order of 33? per cent.  This will mean a heavy strain on many industries. Those factories depending on CIE to convey their goods will be adversely affected.  It was wrong to impose such increases at a time when many companies are finding it hard to keep going.  Many companies are finding it difficult to borrow money and those who are successful must pay a high price for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two weeks ago I submitted a question concerning the conditions of vehicles used by CIE but it was ruled out of order on the basis that CIE, being a semi-State body, was outside the control of the Minister.  I was informed that the condition of the vehicles was the responsibility of the board.  We will have to change the system in regard to semi-State bodies. They will have to come under the scrutiny of a Select Committee of this House.  I am not casting any reflection on CIE or any of the other semi-State bodies, but when additional <Col N="1337" /> capital is needed the Minister responsible must introduce a Supplementary Estimate in this House to obtain it.  Apparently, we are in order in providing money but we are not entitled to question how this money is spent.  In my area recently a bus broke down with the result that school children were unable to get to school. Some of the CIE vehicles on our roads are not roadworthy.  In many cases they have bad lights, bad tyres and broken reflectors.  How can we prosecute other individuals who drive defective vehicles when we do not prosecute CIE for allowing vehicles that are not roadworthy to be driven on our roads?</P>
    <P>It appears that CIE are running into more financial difficulty because the State subsidisation is heavier each year.  It is now running at £17 million and next year it will be in the region of £24 million.  How long will the State be able to subsidise CIE?  We will have to look at that aspect.  It may be said that CIE are giving good employment. They certainly are but at what price to the taxpayer?  Recently CIE changed the times at which trains leave the midlands in the morning for Dublin.  The Tullamore train left at 9.30 a.m. which was a very convenient time for workers and shoppers and anybody who wished to travel to Dublin.  Now there is a new arrangement and that train does not leave until some time after 11 a.m.  This is also happening in other parts of the country.  That is bad.  I brought this to the notice of the General Manager of CIE and he said it was under review.  CIE are not with it in regard to what is most suitable for the people.</P>
    <P>I was talking about the vast amount of money which we are pumping into CIE to keep it in operation&mdash;£17 million. Next year it will be £24 million and at the rate inflation is going I may be giving a very conservative estimate.  Can we continue doing it? Are we doing it as a social policy or as charity and can we continue doing it in that line?  Perhaps a select committee of this House could go into the working of every section of CIE and see where economies or a tightening <Col N="1338" /> up could be effected.  Admittedly there are some bus routes in rural Ireland that are not paying at all.  We must be fair and say that.  Some of them, as far as I know, for the most part of the week just carry the morning and evening papers, with perhaps a couple of passengers.  That situation could not pay.</P>
    <P>Finally I would hope the Government would bring in legislation which would enable semi-State bodies to be controlled by the Oireachtas, because all of us find it impossible to ask a question here about a semi-State body. If we do get a question in we are told it is the function of the board concerned.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn to the ESB.  I am very much alarmed at some of the charges that are being levied on young men who are building houses in rural Ireland and also in towns where there are groups of houses going up.  I had a few cases recently where the ESB quoted a charge of £900.  I had another case where £750 was quoted.  I asked the ESB if they would accept it in instalments and they said that if they did accept it in instalments they would not make the connection until the final payment was made.  I have now warned my constituents that if they are building a house, as well as making sure to obtain planning permission in full from the local authority, they should check out with the ESB what the charge is to be.</P>
    <P>When a house-builder gets a letter to say the ESB charge will be £900 it comes as a shock.  He sometimes does not expect that there will be any charge.  He then goes to his public representative to see whether anything can be done but there is simply nothing he can do.  A subsidy should be given to help such people, especially in rural areas.  If that trend continues and charges of that nature are imposed on I can see rural Ireland collapsing. After building a house and buying a site the ESB charge makes the cost enormous.  In the last day or two we have heard that the ESB are increasing their charges by almost 20 per cent.  They are doing this because there is a dropping off in the demand with factories on two and three day <Col N="1339" /> weeks and others closing.  The demand has gone down considerably.  We talk about saving energy and the ESB saving energy.  There are advertisements on television but all I see in the advertisements is the burning of the pound note.</P>
    <P>The ESB say now that in view of the fact that there is a falling off in demand they will have no revenue to expand and I have no doubt that they have no revenue.  With the drop in consumption they will find themselves in difficulty.  With an increase of almost 20 per cent on householders, factory managers, company owners, what will this do?  It will raise costs considerably.  From an exporter's point of view it will make costs almost prohibitive.  We all know the difficulties the textile and shoe industries are having at the moment.  With this increase in electricity charges they are going to be in a very serious situation. Most companies are in serious difficulty today.  Even the best of them want to borrow on any market in any country or anywhere they can get it. They are not asking what the interest rates are any more.  If they can get it they will talk about the interest afterwards. With all the charges and costs that are put on them the next thing one sees is the receiver in.</P>
    <P>I had the sorrowful experience the other day of seeing a receiver brought in in my own county to close down a firm which was employing almost 200 men.  This comes from inflation which is running wild.  Every day there is an increase in the price of some commodity. I do not know what the people think of these increases in prices.  I do not know how the house wife can bear these costs.</P>
    <P>In regard to Bord na Móna, I recently asked a question about the third development programmes.  The Minister has stated that there will be many more bogs developed.  How does he propose to do it in view of the fact that in an answer to a Dáil question he stated that Bord na Móna were at their limit in regard to borrowing and the managing director of Bord na Móna stated in <i>The Irish Times</i> that they were finding it impossible to borrow <Col N="1340" /> on any market now.  When I questioned the Minister on it he was unable to tell me when he would bring in legislation to raise the limit in regard to Bord na Móna borrowing. For us in the midlands that is a very serious situation.  Bord na Móna is the main employer in the midlands.  In fact it is the largest employer in the country.  We in the midlands are depending on Bord na Móna.  The cost of oil has increased enormously and turf briquettes is the cheapest fuel one can buy now.  How can Bord na Móna develop when they have no money, and no promise of any money and the Government are unable to state when they will give them any money?  If they are not able to increase the borrowing powers of the board, would the Minister, in his reply, state if he will arrange with the Government that they would provide them with the capital to finance this third programme? If not, a serious situation will arise because Bord na Móna is also linked with the ESB in regard to fuel supplies.  Between them they have been giving very good employment in the midlands.  The position looks bleak now in view of the fact that the Minister was not able to state when this legislation would be brought in.</P>
    <P>If suitable legislation was brought in by the Minister in regard to Bord na Móna, we would give it a speedy passage through this House.  I do not know what the delay is because it would involve only an amendment to increase the borrowing.  Why can he not do that?  Is the simple answer &ldquo;I have no money; I have bled everyone I can and the Government have bled everyone they can and there is no more bleeding to be done.&rdquo;?  That might be the answer.</P>
    <P>In conclusion on that point, I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would convey my remarks to the Minister in regard to Bord na Móna; in regard to the financial position they now find themselves in and if he would ensure that development will not be held up.  I was alarmed when I saw the statement of the managing director of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The increased charges imposed by the ESB and CIE will also have an <Col N="1341" /> adverse effect on agriculture.  It will increase their costs further.  Agriculture is very much dependent on electricity, especially for milking machines, cooling plants and other essential equipment.  When there is an increase in any of these items the supplier thinks he has nothing to do but pass it on to the person who is buying.  Under the Prices Commission one has to apply and give all the details and sometimes they are one month or two months wondering and thinking over it to see when is the best time, from the point of view of public reaction, to issue it.  Motor manufacturers need not give any notice at all before increasing prices. Petrol and oil companies need give only one week's notice and, with a stroke of the pen, can increase the prices again.  That is their position. They make a very handsome profit as well, as they did in the past and got away with it.</P>

      <P>The Britain Company is another day's work.  The question of energy arises.  In regard to the companies Deputy Collins is referring to, they are finding themselves in a very serious position which is brought about by the Government that failed utterly to control inflation. Even the Central Bank have admitted that the Government have driven inflation wild.</P>
      <P>Regarding tourism, not all hotels are doing their share to encourage tourists to return.  Sometimes the service is not as good as it should be while the charges are too high.  A person who stays at such a hotel would get a bad impression and would not either return himself or encourage anyone else to come here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received a number of complaints from foreigners here saying that they have been in hotels where they were charged at rates that were different from those charged to other people.  We cannot deny that it is <Col N="1342" /> going on.  Hoteliers who do that will catch people once but they will not catch them again.  Some of them have been complaining about business being bad, but a lot of the blame must rest with themselves.</P>
    <P>The only semi-State industry that one can say for certain is viable is Bord na Móna.  They have been making a profit all along.  That is why I should hate anything to happen that would jeopardise their progress.  I compliment the directors, the staff and the workers who have given such loyal service to Bord na Móna down through the years.</P>
    <P>There is an option open to Bord na Mona if the Government do not provide them with the money, that is, to increase the prices of turf and briquettes. The present price is £7 per ton.  That is dear enough but if it is to be increased further, it might be a question of robbing Peter to pay Paul because there would then be a fall in the demand for the products.  There is some talk of the turf being increased from £7 to £9 a ton in order to allow the company to continue in operation, to pay salaries and start this expansion programme.  I warn them that if they impose this increase, there will be a falling-off in demand.</P>
    <P>In regard to all of these semi-State bodies, a number of them being under the control of the Minister for Transport and Power, the time has now come when we in this House should have some say in their running and in the functions they carry out, To-day there is a tendency to think that when the State is providing money there is no problem.  There are many other concerns, some of them very big, that cannot turn to anybody for help.  If they fail to make their business pay, they will find themselves in serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>The time has come when we must look at the position very carefully to see how long the taxpayer can continue pumping very substantial subsidies to the semi-State bodies, some of which seem to be coming back to the Exchequer looking for bigger amounts all the time.  So a section of the community that is highly taxed at the moment will be more highly taxed <Col N="1343" /> from now on to keep all these concerns in operation.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves if we are keeping something going from a social point of view.  I am very alarmed at the amount of subsidies we are making available to the semi-State bodies.  Many of the railways in other countries and even a large portion of bus transport have been taken over by private concerns, and from the information I have they have made these pay very well.  I know that if we were to do this it would create a great upheaval and perhaps would not be workable.  However, a certain tightening up and looking into the day by day workings of these companies is necessary in order to see where savings can be made.</P>
    <P>Householders, business people, workers, and everybody else will now be taxed to the hilt.  I notice that these statements are always made at the weekends and not here on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays.  These ESB charges are a cruel blow to the housewife and the workers.  There is no doubt that this will bring about further redundancies because costs will go skyhigh again.  When costs go up what is sold from the factory floor must also go up.  Inflation is now running wild and my information is that there are more price increases in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>As I said before, we will be priced out of every market if this continues. It may be said that this is not relevant to the Estimate but it is very relevant in the light of these increases.  The Government have taken no action to curb this inflation. They will let it go higher and higher and then we will see factory after factory close.  I regret to have to say that this country is heading for a most difficult period from an industrial point of view.  I cannot see a number of companies surviving because expenditure and overheads will put them out of business.  The trade union movement has been abandoned and sections of it are dictating the terms.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House&mdash; although we would very much like to <Col N="1344" /> see it&mdash;cannot see the wage agreement which was worked out, implemented and agreed on by unions and employers. I fear the worst.  I fear that with these increases in ESB and CIE charges the workers will say: &ldquo;Right, if you charge us more for power and fares we will look for money whether a company can pay it or not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are heading for a chaotic situation from an industrial point of view. Most of the concerns in this country were built up by Fianna Fáil over the years, were doing very well and had expanded.  We always made sure that capital was freely available.  Everything is now being allowed to run riot and the housewife will be serving bread with no butter on it very soon if she is not doing so already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate before the House covers a wide range of activities.  We are glad to have an opportunity of discussing this Estimate. I cannot share the pessimism expressed by Deputy Connolly.  Indeed, I wonder if he was in order in discussing the whole wide-ranging economic scene.  Nevertheless he has done so.</P>
      <P>We are indeed in a period of inflation. It is world wide.  It is affecting not only us but practically every western European democracy and America.  I do not know when we will turn the corner.  According to the experts it will be towards the end of this year.  We would welcome an up-turn in employment and a down-turn in the rate of inflation.  It would have been wrong if we had panicked in 1973-74 when the oil crisis broke and inflation began to take off.  We would have been wrong to follow a policy of financial restraint because there is no doubt that such a policy would have led rapidly to a severe crisis in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Government can only ensure that the agencies of the State are available to those who want them. People in receipt of social welfare benefits have done very well under our Government, and rightly so.  We have adequate incentives for industry to be established and to expand.  How far can we control inflation is a question <Col N="1345" /> which is baffling many Governments. Perhaps we are in an unprecedented era.  Certainly what is now required is a very cool approach to the matter.</P>
    <P>The question of subsidising firms rather than allowing a direct price increase deserves to be discussed and there should be a far wider public discussion on it.  The question, for instance, of subsidising essentials such as bread and milk is always present and needs to be discussed.  Apparently under the terms of the EEC regulations direct subsidies are not welcome. We may have to revise our attitude to this.  We should try everything, however novel, to ensure that the consumer price index is held down as much as possible.  Deputy Connolly's pessimism is one I do not share.</P>
    <P>I should like to discuss the position in our society of Córas Iompair Éireann, a company which is giving cause for concern.  That company's report for 1973-74 shows a deficit of £11.66 million, more than £3 million higher than the previous year.  That figure was superseded in the last year. The subvention for this year is in excess of £17 million and I wonder, from a taxpayer's point of view, if this can continue.  We should have a hard look at the role which Córas Iompair Éireann should play in our society.</P>
    <P>We should compare the use to which the Government could put £17 million.  If it was spent on road improvements it would be advantageous. This massive support for CIE may not, in the long term, be the best use to which we can put our funds.  We should look at the various sections of CIE, for example, the Dublin city bus service, to see if it could be hived off to the private sector.  A useful exercise could be undertaken in relation to this.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the subsidy is the rail transport system which has a deficit of £9.6 million in 1973-74.  I agree it is important that we should have an alternative system of travelling by road and that we should have a good quality rail service for passengers and a specialised freight service.  We should have an adequate <Col N="1346" /> and good rail service connecting the main centres of population.  This could be done more economically than at present.</P>
    <P>The road passenger service in 1973-74 was profitable, and there is a sound future for that service.  Would it be possible to hive-off the provincial bus service also to the private sector? That service is making a profit and, perhaps, this is the best time to make the change.</P>
    <P>The road freight service should also be examined.  That service showed a surplus in 1972-73 and a slight deficit in 1973-74.  It is in direct competition with the private sector and has a function in the specialised fields where they can link up with CIE rail and container services.  Is there a long term need for CIE to have this road freight service on a wide scale?  A public debate is needed on the future of CIE and the part that company plays in our society.  There will always be a problem in relation to change, but I feel we can get over this problem in relation to manpower.  If parts of CIE were hived-off into the private sector, redundancies would not occur. In fact the efficiency of the private sector would ensure the continued employment of those at present involved.</P>
    <P>Part of the deficit of CIE is undoubtedly part of the social services provided by the Government.  When dealing with the accounts of CIE, this should be segregated and made a separate and distinct item.  It should be financed out of the Vote of the Department of Social Welfare.  The cost of the school bus service should be part of the Education Estimate and have a direct link with the moneys involved there.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects affecting the national situation which I should like to comment on.  The energy crisis hit us very harshly and the suggested increase in ESB charges of 18 per cent will create more problems. It appears the consumption of electricity will remain static over the next few years and I gather this is Government policy.  In that context and in view of the consultant's report on the manpower within the ESB, <Col N="1347" /> where it was stated the organisation could be run with a 15 to 20 per cent reduction in staff, the board should ensure that it is not over-staffed even in the long term.  They should take every measure they can in the national interest to contain price increases.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, the international air companies, are in trouble because of inflation and the energy crisis and this is likely to continue. I agree with the policy being pursued by Aer Lingus and hope that they can come through the present crisis.  I travel quite a lot between here and Europe, being a Member of the Council of Europe, and I can never understand why the tax free facilities at London Airport cannot be used by passengers travelling between Ireland and England.  As we have entered Europe, I think the facilities in relation to the purchase of tax free products in England should be available to Irish emigrants returning home in the same way as at any other European airport.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised of the public accountability of semi-State bodies.  We have three of them here, CIE, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.  I agree the scrutiny of their accounts should be more open to Members of the Oireachtas, and to the Public Accounts Committee in particular. That committee should have the right to call employees of the company before them with a view to explaining the activities of the company quite openly to Members of this House.</P>
    <P>There are a number of local problems affecting my constituency to which I should like to refer.  The Waterford Harbour Commissioners of which I am a member obviously are deeply involved and interested in the development of the harbour.  We had recently a move by a company to establish an industry at Cheekpoint which has given cause for concern to the general manager and the board of the Waterford Harbour Commissioners. The positioning of the factory at Cheekpoint is giving rise to concern because it is very near the Cheekpoint harbour and there is a <Col N="1348" /> danger that if an industry is established there the depth of the water will be reduced and will damage the entry and exit to the harbour.</P>
    <P>The general manager of the harbour board has made the position quite clear, as have the board.  We are most anxious to have the company concerned establish an industry on the estuary and we will facilitate them in every way possible, but I feel that the harbour board were right.  They had a responsibility to explain the position which, unfortunately, has been mis-interpreted in the area.  However, I am glad to say there will be a meeting between the harbour board and the company with a view to resolving the problem.</P>
    <P>Waterford harbour is an ideal location for the establishment of an oil servicing industry in view of the gas and oil finds off the south coast.  With these finds we are entering a new era of development of Irish Industry and the Irish economy in general.  I trust that the committee which have been set up between the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Transport and Power, an Foras Forbartha and the IDA will examine the Waterford coastline and the Waterford estuary and will be satisfied we are ideally placed for the location of such an industry.  Again, I would insist that any oil or gas finds off the cost of Waterford be piped to the land in Waterford and that whatever refinery and processing industries are necessary be established there.  This will ensure the maximum employment content which can be got from the finds.</P>
    <P>I am in complete agreement with the policy which the Government have announced in relation to the oil finds and I feel that their approach has been welcomed by people who are involved in the various industries searching for oil and gas.  This kind of government policy will continue to attract people who are interested in these fields.</P>
    <P>In relation to Waterford harbour, it is important to ensure that there will continue to be satisfactory livestock export facilities at the port.  It was always a great port for the export of livestock, bloodstock and sheep and it is important that we should have such <Col N="1349" /> a facility.  Even though the era of scheduled livestock services is gone, it is incumbent upon the Government and, indeed, upon the harbour board to ensure that that facility will always be there to take advantage of any market that may come.</P>
    <P>We had an unfortunate tragedy in Waterford when a trawler went aground with the loss of the life of the captain from Passage East.  It has given rise to great concern about the marine radio station facilities at Dunmore East.  The present facilities are not adequate and the people who are involved in fishing and shipping in the area are not satisfied with the present radio links there.  I asked a Dáil question about this matter some time ago and I understood from the Minister he was satisfied the facilities were adequate.  However, I have advice from the people more directly involved in fishing and shipping in the area that there is an urgent need for an adequate marine radio station in Dunmore East and I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to Tramore Fáilte for the efforts they have put into developing our resorts under the aegis of the major resort improvement programme which the Government have undertaken.  Tramore has come on quite a lot since the programme was introduced and they have done excellent work down through the years.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about one aspect of their activities.  I refer to the practice of engaging in activities which are already being catered for by private operators in Tramore. While I appreciate that Bord Fáilte are trying to get the resort as a whole developed I think they have an obligation to local operators not to encroach on their activities if they are satisfying a demand.  Bord Fáilte should be careful not to step on their toes.  I am aware of one case where concern has been expressed.  A semi-State body, such as Bord Fáilte, has an obligation to ensure that the existing operators in a resort are not cut across.</P>
    <P>The question of the Waterford Gas Company is also of interest in view <Col N="1350" /> of the Minister's participation in the Dublin Gas Company, which is the parent company of the Waterford company.  It is important that the supply of town gas in major cities should be continued.  In view of the many problems thrown up by the energy crisis, steps should be taken to ensure that the Gas Company continues to exist until such time as the extent of gas finds is examined in a national perspective.  I would be grateful if the Minister would make some comment on Government policy in relation to the gas companies supplying gas to towns.  There are only a few major cities affected.  I should like to hear from the Minister that the Waterford Gas Company will continue as a viable concern.</P>
    <P>My final comment in regard to the Waterford area concerns the airfield which we do not have but which, as a major city, we should have.  I am not satisfied with the progress being made to date on the provision of an airfield near Waterford.  Because of the industrial development which has taken place in Waterford the Department should play a more active part in ensuring that an airfield is located there.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the people who give their services voluntarily to the national sea rescue service. I am only too well aware of the dangerous and hazardous work which these people do.  I should like to pay a public tribute to the work which has been done on a voluntary basis by the crew of the Dunmore East lifeboat. On many occasions they have gone out in dangerous weather and have been very brave in rescuing people in hazardous conditions.  A tribute to those men is well merited.  They are held in high esteem in Waterford.</P>
    <P>Another problem is oil pollution. The Government should ensure that the dangers of oil pollution are monitored continuously not only in Bantry but also around the coast so as to avoid effluent or oil being discharged from ships on or near our coasts.  I have often seen traces of pollution in Tramore.  It is a national problem which needs to be tackled more effectively than heretofore.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> The hijacking of ships and planes is another grave problem.  Not much progress has been made, even on an international basis.  Our approach to this problem should be set down quite clearly and unequivocally in relation to the punishment of hijackers.  The Department have a vital role to play in the context of the energy crisis and in the developing economy.  I wish the Minister well in his post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate has assumed great importance in recent years.  Heretofore, the Department of Transport and Power was not considered to be a very important one.  In recent years we have had much discussion on the question of energy and all that it entails.  Consequently, the Department of Transport and Power has become a very important one. This Department has under its aegis a number of semi-State bodies.  I understand there are 12 such bodies. Many of those bodies, as far as ordinary citizens are concerned, are not of great importance, but there are four or five which affect the lives of every citizen.</P>
      <P>One of those is CIE, which is concerned with road and rail transport. Another is the ESB, dealing with the generation and supply of electricity, Bord na Mona deals with peat production, and the fourth important body is Bord Fáilte.  The activities of each of those bodies affects the lives of every citizen in many ways.  We have heard much criticism of CIE. It was debated at length in this House when a Bill was introduced to provide support for the depleted funds of CIE which runs at a considerable loss each year.  The most alarming fact for the ordinary citizen is that CIE fares, both rail and passenger, have been increased substantially recently. Those increases will affect the livelihood of many of our citizens.  They will affect industrialists who are finding it very difficult to show any kind of profit; who are finding it very difficult to maintain employment in present circumstances.  Those increases will add a further cost to their already depleted funds.  It is to be regretted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> Like other Deputies, I should like to see a closer watch being kept on those State-sponsored bodies.  I see no reason why they should not be made to make some attempt to fill the gap that exists at present.  If those people were told they had no business coming back here, that the taxpayers were fed up giving them money and that it was up to them to try to make the service pay, would we have the huge deficit we have at present?  Semi-State bodies knew that if they were short of a few million pounds at the end of the financial year, all they had to do was to ask the responsible Minister to promote the necessary legislation and automatically they would get what they asked for.  This should not be so. If an industrialist's enterprise is not viable, then he just goes out of business.  That is too bad but I do not see why semi-State bodies should be allowed to ask for subsidies at the end of each financial year, as CIE and others have done.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a very important part of this Estimate.  It is the third largest industry in this country.  It is one that should be encouraged in every way by the Government.  Greater effort should be made by the Government to bring tourists to the country because of the amount of money that is distributed throughout the country by tourists.  Prices in recent years may have had a bad affect on our tourism. The prices of food, petrol and drink have rocketed.  These are essential items for tourists.  They have an impact on hotel prices also.  We are really pricing ourselves out of the market.  Tourists can find cheaper places to spend their holidays than Ireland.  This is an unfortunate situation because we have a beautiful country; we have fresh waters, fishing, all the amenities and it is too bad if we chase tourists away by allowing prices to rocket as they have done over the past few years. Greater effort should be put into encouraging tourists from England and Europe.</P>
    <P>This is the area from which we can attract people and every effort should be made by the Government to attract those people to our country because they are the people who spend money. <Col N="1353" /> There is little use in having a tourist promotion campaign in Australia or Japan because it would cost too much and for the number that we would get from there it would hardly be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see the farm guesthouse business encouraged. Greater subsidies should be given to the people engaged in this industry. Areas such as Salthill, for example, which has several amenities get quite a substantial amount of money from Bord Fáilte to extend hotels and for other amenities.  It is only fair that some of this money should be spent in rural areas, in small towns and villages in rural Ireland.  There is more money spent in one square mile around Salthill than there is in the whole of County Galway.  I see no reason why this should be so.  The money should be spread around.  The people in small rural areas are entitled to their share and the people who are engaged in the farm guesthouse business should be encouraged because it is something from which the small towns benefit.  I was delighted to see in the report presented by the Minister that there is an increase in the volume of home holidays.  This is something that should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into all the other State-sponsored bodies but there is one which I would like to mention, that is, Bord na Móna.  This is one that affects all of us.  Deputy Connolly mentioned the effects it has in midland counties.  We all know that ESB charges have been rocketing too. Electricity produced from milled peat is now the cheapest form of electricity apart from that produced by hydroelectric plants such as at Ardnacrusha. We can encourage Bord na Móna and the Government to make greater use of our bogs.</P>
    <P>The importance of this has been brought home to all of us in recent years as we have seen the terrible crisis that the oil situation created for our Government and for our people. For that reason it is important that our bogs should be developed to the full.  The bias towards oil which was so evident in the ESB has no longer a price consideration to recommend <Col N="1354" /> it.  The possibility of a cut-off of oil supplies in peace and the possibility of the oil being cut off entirely in time of war is very real.  It makes oil produced power a dicely business.  It is vital, in order to keep the country going, that all native resources be tapped to provide power.  It is only common prudence in the present situation that we prepare ourselves for an emergency as our predecessors did, and indeed as two of our former statesmen, Mr. Lemass and Mr. de Valera, did in the thirties.  The surest and most economical way to provide that power from native resources is to utilise the bogs.  We all realise that the bogs have, as yet, been undeveloped. For that reason, mainly, I welcome the Bord na Móna decision to develop bogs in the Ballyforan area, north of Ballinasloe, which is quite adjacent to the area I represent in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Ballyforan area is particularly suitable for development.  Not only is there a pool of some 25,000 acres of suitable bog in the immediate vicinity but there are also vast reserves of bog both to the north and west of Ballyforan, to the north especially in the area extending from Ballygar to Castlerea and from Westport to Glenamaddy, Moylough and Mountbellew. There are more than 50,000 acres of bog in this area.  Two of the bog areas are at Lerhan, Breevna and Meelidr and the other extending from Moylough through New Forest to Gortnadeeve have more than 10,000 acres each.  In the present circumstances and having regard to safeguarding our future supplies of electricity it is most desirable that we utilise these bogs.</P>
    <P>We can realise the employment content of a venture of that nature.  When the price was low there were economic reasons for ignoring the social advantages of using our own resources to produce electricity but with the present price of oil we need to take a much harder look at the consequences of spending our money in Arabia rather than in Galway.</P>
    <P>The Galway bog produces cheaper power than is produced by Trabian oil.  We have no guarantee that the <Col N="1355" /> supplies of foreign oil will continue to be available in a troubled world situation. We are faced with the situation when £1 spent on Arabic oil will buy less electricity than the £1 spent in Galway.  At the same time our balance of payments is growing gradually worse because of a world situation that has changed completely.  I see no point in waiting to see if the world situation will change back to what it was in 1972.  There is nothing to be gained by hoping that somehow Henry Kissinger will wave a magic wand and change all this and bring the prices back to what they were before 1972. Even if oil prices were to become cheaper there are good reasons, both economic and social, for making use of our own natural resources to produce the power we need.  It should not be necessary to spell out the advantages of using our own natural resources rather than imported ones.</P>
    <P>Some of our economists regard the economic thinking of Arthur Griffith and de Valera as outdated, but anybody who opens his ESB bill and reads the marked fuel variation charges will realise what inspired those two men in the past.  We live in a troubled world and we cannot afford the luxury of clinging to an out-dated power policy now that world circumstances have changed.</P>
    <P>There were economic arguments in favour of oil a few years ago.  But today there are social and economic arguments in favour of bogs.  The social advantages of bog development in Ballyforan, Glenamaddy and so on, and the comparatively small parts of Galway would be considerable.  The revival of Bord na Móna and ESB activities in those areas would affect not only the prosperity of the areas but would have a considerable effect on the morale of the people, many of whom live on small farms.  These people are worried about the future of the small farm in regard to development such as grants and so on.  The prospect of steady employment in these areas would revitalise the whole life of north-east Galway.  The eventual prospect of a pool of valuable cut-away bog of 75,000 acres in these areas alone <Col N="1356" /> would contribute to the future prospects of a countryside which has continually looked to the land for a means of livelihood.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have shown that cut-away bog can be valuable.  The experiments carried out by the Bord and by the Agricultural Institute suggest that the cut-away area will be at least comparable with good mineral soil.  The eventual prospect of an additional 75,000 acres to be added to the areas of farmland is a factor that needs to be taken into account in the long-term thinking of any Government. It is only natural that the ESB policy should be dominated by its main objective&mdash;the production of power.  But the Government must look beyond that immediate objective, to the eventual advantages of an extra 75,000 acres, in making the decision to develop.</P>
    <P>The bogs in this part of County Galway are similar in quality, quantity and potential to the other raised bogs that have been developed by Bord na Móna and used by the ESB for the production of electricity.  There have been surveys carried out in those areas as far back as 1809 and 1814.  The exact extent and the suitability of the bog in question must be well known. It is now time that it should be developed.</P>
    <P>We have seen a lot of economic upsets in the past 10 years.  We have no guarantee that these trends will not continue.  We have an excellent opportunity here of providing employment, of providing power by developing those bogs.</P>
    <P>Because of the social advantages of bog development in an area such as County Galway, a case can also be made for seeking money from abroad for such an undertaking.  One of the main objectives of the European Economic Community was to help those communities living along the perimeter of Europe.  This is a project which should be recommended to our people in Europe by the Government. They should seek money to develop those bogs.  It might be possible to get the World Bank to give a loan as I understand they have done at Turlough <Col N="1357" /> Hill in County Wicklow.  If this were done it would stint the tide of emigration, it would create employment and it would have a great effect on this part of the country which cannot hope to attract suitable industries, as has been done in other parts of the country such as the eastern part.  There is a very strong case to be made here for the development of these bogs.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will ensure that every effort is made to develop them.  In that respect they can play a very important role by ensuring that the access roads to many of those bogs are in order.  Many of them have not been developed.  Nobody seems to know whose responsibility those roads are.  The county council tell us they have not got the resources available and that, in any case, the bog roads are not their responsibility.</P>
    <P>This is one area where the Minister for Transport and Power, and perhaps the Minister for Local Government, and perhaps too the Minister for Industry and Commerce, could come together and pool their resources and ensure that an allocation of money is made each year for those roads and to ensure that our bogs, which have been left untapped for years, are developed. In recent years people have been inclined to go back to the bogs for their fuel because of the high prices obtaining in the oil fields.  This should be encouraged.  Unfortunately many of them cannot do so because of the bad state of the roads leading to them.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann favours the appointment of an ombudsman.&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy O'Brien.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I explained that, in my view, while the idea of having an ombudsman is a useful one here, the reasons which were decisive in the adoption of the <Col N="1358" /> idea elsewhere did not seem to me to exist here.  I said I did not think that there was any serious degree of maladministration here of the kind which produced demands for such an office in Britain.  I said that, even for the minute percentage of actual maladministration, it might nonetheless be well argued that we ought to have such an official as an ombudsman in order to give the public the assurance that this minute percentage of cases, small though it was, would not go unremedied.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the main burden of the case for the ombudsman must rest in a country like this on somewhat different grounds.  Moreover it seems to me, as I said in concluding yesterday, that the limitations placed on the Parliamentary Commissioner in the United Kingdom, namely, that he can act only if the inquiry is instituted by an M.P., and that local government and matters of total discretion are excluded from his view, would make him completely unsuitable for adoption here.  It is exactly in the field of matters which are discretionary and in local government matters that difficulties for the citizen can arise.  I do not mean difficulties resulting from maladministration but difficulties in the sense that the citizen finds himself up against a machine by which he is baffled and feels himself unequipped to attack or to challenge.</P>
      <P>I want to talk for a few minutes about another matter.  I hope I will not be accused by Deputies on any side of the House of trying to reform an entire system to which I myself am a relative newcomer, and of finding fault with a system which others have lived under quite happily, and prosperously, and usefully for many years before I was heard of.  I am not trying in any way to lecture people who have spent very useful public lives.  I should like to make a point of view heard which very seldom surfaces in this House, I suppose, because the people who are in this House find that it is difficult to utter this point of view without invalidating some of the planks on which their own political existence is built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main large scale problem which <Col N="1359" /> the Irish people and their politicians have to deal with in the area which Deputy O'Brien has so wisely and so admirably driven us into yesterday and today, is the problem of divorcing the dispensing of administrative favour from the achievement of political support.  Administrative decisions at absolutely all levels from the highest to the lowest, from the awarding of a contract for the building of a £5 million underpass, or bridge, or tunnel, down to the simplest and humblest appointment in some kind of a local setting or the simplest and humblest according of a medical card, ought to be made on entirely objective criteria.  While there is no point in my denying that all sides in this House have been excercising their governmental powers when they were in office in a way which conflicted with these criteria and while there is no point in my denying that patronage has existed here since the State was founded, someone must say here sooner or later unambiguously that essentially it is wrong and that ideally we ought to be without it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take a high and mighty attitude towards this.  I must confess that I have become a great deal less high and mighty about it since I was elected to the other House six years ago and since I have seen at close quarters exactly how the political world works and, in particular, what the people expect of the political world.  I do not want to be high and mighty on this theme.  I do not feel that way about it any longer. One ought not to lose touch with and sight of the ideals with which one started out.  It is important to say, and keep on saying, and keep as an ideal in front of one, even if it is only an ideal of perfection such as a human being never can attain, that anything like patronage is wrong.</P>
    <P>It may be that the expectations which the people have of us&mdash;and we are responsible to them and we have to reflect their points of view and their wishes in a large degree&mdash;force us, whichever side is in question, to ride along with this system up to a point.  It may be that there are strong <Col N="1360" /> human reasons for going along with it, and that these human reasons would outweigh, and would outweigh even in the sight of the most just and the best man who ever lived, the ideal textbook reasons against patronage.</P>
    <P>I do not underestimate these reasons at all.  For example, very shortly after we took office I began to notice through the volume of post on my table that a very large number of people who support my party and the Labour Party were anxious&mdash;I will not call it for promotion I do not mean promotion in the sense of stepping up one rung of the ladder in a particular setting&mdash;for some kind of appointment or dispensation of which their known political affiliations had in the 16 previous years deprived them.  I hope gentlemen on the far side of the House will not think I am being contentious about this.  I do not mean to be.  I am trying to state it as fairly as I can and no doubt they will interrupt me if I go beyond the bounds of fairness.</P>
    <P>I noticed in these representations, which I passed on to the people concerned&mdash;some of which were successful and some of which were not&mdash;that the people who were making these representations were not so much concerned with getting jobs; they were not so much concerned with putting money in their pockets; they were not so much concerned even with having status; what they were concerned with was something more humble and more radical than that.  They wanted recognition.</P>
    <P>They wanted recognition from their friends that their years&mdash;and at times it seemed they would be endless&mdash;of slaving thanklessly in a hostile political climate watching plums, favours, recognition of all kinds, going to their opponents, going to people with whom they did not politically agree and could not bring themselves politically to agree with, were now at an end.  They wanted reassurance that they would be seen to be at an end by the smile of Government favour, a Government favour which was at the disposal of the people whom they had helped into office, for what were undoubtedly at the time entirely unselfish and public-spirited reasons.  I <Col N="1361" /> could not bring myself to despise a man who feels that way.  I am certain that the Deputies opposite, if they were to remain in Opposition for 16 years as we did, would feel the same way about it when they got in. There are those who now work for them, and I recognise that there are members of the Fianna Fáil Party who do not mind doing this.  Although it is not a good moment to be a member of Fianna Fáil I hope no ruthless discrimination is being exercised against them.  I recognise and applaud people who feel that the interests of the Irish people are served by supporting a democratic Opposition, and they should not be discriminated against for doing so.  If they pass 16 years and find at the end of that period that their political affiliation has debarred them for membership of this board or that committee I could not blame them for expecting that when Deputies Dowling and Moore are over on this side of the House, they would bestow favour on them which we had not bestowed.</P>
    <P>That lengthy introduction to what I want to say is only meant to exonerate me from the charge of taking a high-line about this.  I do not take a high-line about it at all.  We are all one people and we are similar enough, particularly in the roots from which we sprang, and there is no sense in trying to hammer into our neighbour or a 100 of our neighbours a point of view which one may have learned only through the fortunate experience of never having had to go begging to anybody for anything.  I do not, accordingly mean these remarks in that way.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge on all sides of the House that patronage is wrong. There may be extenuating circumstances of the kind I have described, there may be all kinds of human circumstances which make the fault for the seeking or the exercising of patronage diminish to vanishing point but it remains wrong.  It would be a poor day if we found ourselves as a House constructing casuistic excuses for the continuance of a system which we know is wrong.</P>
    <P>There is a distinction between the <Col N="1362" /> Fine Gael and Labour Parties on the one hand and the purses of the people of Ireland on the other.  Three years ago there was a clear distinction, or so it seemed to me, between the private concerns of the Fianna Fáil Party and the purse of the people of Ireland.  It seemed to me then and it still seems to me that whatever benefits whether great or small or whatever work, jobs, favours or recognition of any kind dispensed in the name of the people of Ireland ought to be done on objective criteria irrespective of the political affiliation of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>When we were in Opposition I watched that principle being flagrantly ignored, although to a lesser extent I see it being ignored now, but to a much lesser extent for a reason I will explain later.</P>

      <P>The duty lies on us, particularly at a moment like this on Private Members' time when, perhaps, a flag of truce is flying over the trenches to some extent, when the motion is introduced by a Government Deputy to make these admissions and to pull ourselves together and to ask ourselves whether we might revise our whole view of the political and administrative world to accommodate them.  This brings me back to the subject of Deputy O'Brien's motion.  An ombudsman, or something like that, would be acceptable and valuable if he was intended as a weapon against the exercise of favour in any shape or form based on political or similar criteria.  There is no such thing as absolute justice in this world and anyone, even a man who sets out intending to exercise no favour or political patronage, may end up making a worse appointment than if he had exercised political patronage. That possibility is open.  There are strong reasons also, apart from politics, in the case of doubt of appointing the man one knows you can <Col N="1363" /> trust rather than the man one does not know.</P>
      <P>There may be a strong case for some office like this which would be enabled to nullify acts of an administrative kind from the highest to the lowest, if satisfied that these acts were discriminatory in the sense that they were inspired by political favour for one side or disfavour for the other. I use the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; in the broadest sense; I do not just mean the three parties here.  I mean &ldquo;political&rdquo; in the broadest sense or any kind of criteria even a non-political one which was not related or capable of being usefully related to the purpose of the benefit, job or contract in question.</P>
      <P>Earlier I said I believed there was less of this and I hope we will get less of it as time goes on.  A substantial step was made by the Prosecution of Offences Bill which has taken the dispensing of what is now roughly £250,000 per year out of political hands and into non-political hands. That money used to be dispensed by all sides on an almost entirely political basis.  That has now ended.  There are people who regret its passing. That has now ended in consequence of a political initiative for the promotion of which the Attorney General was responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In brute political terms the Coalition Government have struck out of their own hands a very powerful political weapon.  They have done that in the public interest.  The sum involved is not small and spread over a relatively small profession it can buy a great deal of support.  It can buy a great number of speeches during by-election time, Presidential election time or general election time.  It can buy a great number of subscriptions or many plates at dinners.  We have struck that weapon out of our own hands because we thought it was in the public interest to do so and because we thought the legal business ought to be discharged by the best people available whatever their political affiliation.  I am proud to be working for a Government that sponsored that and I hope it is only the beginning of a process which will lead <Col N="1364" /> in the end to the entire depoliticisation of the administrative process at all levels.  I would like to see it go a bit faster.  I began by saying that I recognise the human strength of the forces which make it go fairly slow.</P>
    <P>We often hear criticism of the judicial appointments.  In connection with those so far I have not felt the necessity to apologise for them because those appointed to judicial office in the last two years were men who, under the kind of system I would like to see, would have been appointed to judicial office long ago. In other words, we have a long backlog to catch up with and a small number of jobs becoming vacant.  I admit that excuse will not hold good forever and that the time will shortly come when we will expect to see judicial appointments made among people who have associations other than with the Coalition.  I certainly would not go looking for people with associations with Fianna Fáil because that would be going from the frying pan into the fire, but people with associations other than with the Coalition.  I know some very deserving people who have not yet been met with the office which their talents and their experience would deserve.  I think that excuse holds good but it will not hold good for ever.  I hope in the case of judicial appointments we will see this Government introduce the same kind of procedure as in dispensing £250,000 worth of legal work every year to members of the Bar.</P>
    <P>If an ombudsman was an individual officer or the apex of a system of advice bureaux, his main function would be to ensure that decisions were fair.  We would not wish to have the spectacle of people expecting to get favoured treatment from their side when in office and less favoured treatment when they were out of office.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of patronage there is a question somewhat lower down the scale which is also connected with the ombudsman.  A pyramid of advice bureaux, with the ombudsman the ultimate court of appeal, would be the ideal solution.  It is human weakness that leads a public representative into allowing people to <Col N="1365" /> imagine something they have got, to which they were entitled and which they would have got if the public representative concerned had never been born, was obtained as a result of that public representative's intervention.</P>
    <P>I have often been thanked by my constituents for something they have got and I try to say to them that they were entitled to it anyway but ingrained in them is the idea that they would not have got it but for the public representative's help.  However, I find myself slipping and am inclined to think that perhaps they would not have got it so fast but for my intervention and I suppose in time I will find myself taking the credit.  It is outrageous that an elected representative could think of taking credit for, say, getting somebody a house.  He does not use a penny of his own in getting that house apart from what he pays by way of rates and taxes, which does not differentiate him from the rest of his fellow-citizens. He has no right to pull the wool over people's eyes, or allow them to pull the wool over their own eyes which is really the point.</P>
    <P>I do not want to criticise public representatives for trying to stem the flow of thanks they receive&mdash;they would need to be superhuman to do that.  The fact that people are encouraged to believe that the dispensing of administrative favours is in some way linked with political affiliation and that the intervention of a political representative is necessary before they get what they are entitled to is an unfortunate development and one I would like to see abandoned. The office of ombudsman and a pyramid of advice bureaux of junior ombudsmen based locally would do a great deal of good.</P>
    <P>I hope what I have said this evening will not be taken as a high and mighty castigation of my colleagues.  Everything I said applies equally to myself and my own party.  In Private Members' time Deputies could throw away party affiliations and look at a problem like this in the large perspective and see if this important element of our political life could be changed for the better.  On both sides of the House <Col N="1366" /> we could come together in order to achieve that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House very long.  I support this motion.  It may not be necessary to have a full-time ombudsman; a part-time one might be sufficient.  There are occasions when constituents in all parts of the country are reluctant to approach their local elected representative and at such time they could have recourse to a man who was above politics, a man of the highest integrity and one respected in the community. There is a case for appointing such a man on an experimental basis.</P>
      <P>All parties who have succeeded in electing public representatives, whether at Dáil level or county council level, are very closely in touch with the people.  One has only to see the provincial papers and read where Deputies announce their intention to meet constituents at various times and places.  I am more concerned with people who are reluctant to go to public representatives and, in that context, I support the appointment of a part-time ombudsman on an experimental basis.</P>
      <P>The motion should embrace public institutions and it could be extended to private commercial institutions. Week after week the columns in evening newspapers are devoted to ventilating people's problems.  The newspapers are to be congratulated on this service because not alone do they seek solutions to the various problems presented to them but they also receive subscriptions for charitable institutions. In that context the activities of a part-time ombudsman would not alone help public institutions but would also help commercial concerns and the commercial life of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion, in the name of Deputy Fergus O'Brien, that Dáil Éireann favours the appointment of an ombudsman.  I believe this House can certainly recommend the appointment of an ombudsman.  People may get the impression that we are critical of our civil servants or present form of administration. I have not been very long in this House but in the time I <Col N="1367" /> have been here I have come to realise that we have one of the finest public services in the world.  In our civil servants we have officials who are honest, dedicated, hardworking and completely devoted to their duties.  I am sure in saying this I am voicing the opinion of everybody in this House.</P>
      <P>The appointment of an ombudsman is something that I believe is necessary in the public interest.  My reason for saying so is that there have been numbers of people over the years who have had genuine complaints.  They felt that some particular Department of State did not deal with their cases in a fair manner.  They felt that the Departments were wrong, they felt let down and they felt that they had been steamrolled by public bodies. They felt that they had not got the necessary finance, the necessary ability or the necessary energy to stand up and fight to have their complaints investigated.  We must ensure that no person has a grievance that has not been investigated.  We will have to have some method of investigating each and every complaint. This, I believe, should work through every channel in our public service. Many people have the idea that they have not been treated as fairly as they should have been.  In order to ensure that justice is not alone done but is seen to be done I believe this is the best course to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this House we have, in the system of Dáil Questions, one of the greatest safeguards of any democracy. Each and every Deputy has a right to table a question which will have to be answered by a particular Minister within three days.  This is a great privilege and a great safeguard for the democratic institutions.  Nevertheless, some people feel that the replies they receive to Parliamentary Questions are often brief.  A Deputy may not have sufficient information to question a Minister further in regard to the reply to a Parliamentary Question.  For this reason it may be said that the Parliamentary Question is not sufficient.  The matter can again be raised on the Adjournment if a Deputy is not satisfied with the reply <Col N="1368" /> he has received but, nevertheless, again the Deputy may not have sufficient information and may not have the facts that are on the Minister's file.  After the appointment of an ombudsman the ombudsman will have the right to call upon the Secretary or the Minister of a Department to produce the files so that he can study them.  As far as I am aware, an ombudsman can ask for the official dealing with the case and ask him to give information relating to a particular case.  I believe an ombudsman would be an addition to and would strengthen the rights Dáil Deputies have to seek information through Dáil Questions.  It would certainly be a help to Deputies and would strengthen the hand of Seán Citizen if his grievance could be investigated and looked into by somebody on his behalf.  He could then see the full facts as they appear from an administrative point of view.</P>
    <P>Another advantage in this, and we should not overlook this point, is that it would help to do away with the unfavourable coverage in the Press that some Departments get at present. There are times when a Government Department may not be able to have their points of view put across to the general public.  I believe that an ombudsman would, could and should be able, after a grievance has been reported to him to issue a statement or recommendation pointing out that the civil servants were acting within their authority and scope.  This would be of benefit to the civil servants in their jobs.  It would cut both ways and be of benefit to both sides.  The ombudsman, in this sphere, could strengthen the democratic institutions.  For this reason I believe the creation of this post would be well worth while.</P>
    <P>Most county councillors and urban councillors&mdash;I do not know about Dáil Deputies&mdash;give their time on a voluntary basis.  They do trojan work on behalf of their constituents.  Not half enough tribute is paid to people working at local level.  This House should pay tribute to them for the very fine work they carry out.  Their motives are of the highest possible character. Most of them are interested in seeing that the democratic system we cherish <Col N="1369" /> is upheld.  They help to ensure that the democratic system is working properly, but the same can be said of Deputies who work hard for their constituents.  However, in this particular sphere I think an ombudsman could help in reducing the work load of Dáil Deputies, county councillors and urban councillors.  It would give the Members of this House and the Members of the Seanad more time to read and study legislation going through the House.  This is necessary and would be good for our democratic system.  Those are my views on the appointment of an ombudsman.</P>
    <P>All Deputies could be described, in a limited way, as ombudsmen.  The system has worked quite successfully in the past but any system, whatever it is, can always be improved.  We have one of the finest democratic systems but that fact should not make us sit back and not progress.  We should endeavour to improve at all times.  The appointment of an ombudsman would help to improve the situation and be of benefit to every citizen. I commend the proposal and support it.</P>

      <P>The time for discussion is now very limited.  Deputy O'Brien believes that the appointment of an ombudsman would serve the people better.  He is one of the few people on the Government benches who believe this.  I am not convinced that it is necessary or unnecessary.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that it is not a good enough reason that we should have an ombudsman because they have one in Britain.  That would be one of the worst reasons.  I would have liked to have had more time to deal with the Parliamentary Secretary's dissertation on the distribution of legal largesse by the Fine Gael Party.  It may be a case of middle-class values, the fact that he boasts that the Government have not been discriminatory in regard to legal appointments.  This may not be relevant but I should like to reply to the Parliamentary Secretary very briefly and say that at least the Fianna Fáil Party appointed a Chief Justice who was diametrically opposed to them politically.  We set <Col N="1370" /> the headline there.  If the Government are following that headline I am glad to see it.  We tried to introduce fair play in this area.  That is all I will say on that as I have not much time left.</P>

      <P>The next motion on the Order Paper is in the name of Deputy Colley and is about the appointment of people in Aireacht which we hope will soon come before the Dáil and the suitability of people, that before they are appointed to any public office we should know of their suitability for these posts.  This is what worries me: if we appoint an ombudsman, by what standards do we appoint him?  What power will he be given?  In Britain, the office of ombudsman is so tied up with conventions and restrictions that the system does not really work.  Last night, Deputy O'Brien said that in Sweden 1,000 cases were dealt with in a year. This is not very many.  Is an ombudsman suitable for the Irish scene? Should we not examine our society first and then say that what we want, if anything, is a certain type of person who would serve the people better than they are being served at present but at the same time would not be a curb on elected representatives? Let us take the case that a person considers something to be unconstitutional. We have had many cases, including Trade Union Bills, and so on, which the President is empowered <Col N="1371" /> to refer to the Supreme Court.  Would this man have the power to refer the fluorine scheme, the contraceptive issue or even the Sunningdale challenge to the Supreme Court?  I do not know what power he will be given.  He will not be elected but appointed.  Therefore, he cannot take precedence over elected representatives. To give him such precedence would be to take from the people certain power.  We must render an account of our stewardship to the people.  Deputy Power asked who should vet the ombudsman.  The one great thing about democracy is that the public can vet our actions or inaction. This is a great safeguard.  I am worried as to the powers we should give an ombudsman.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the hoary old story about politicians encouraging people to believe that only through them can the people obtain their rights.  I do not believe that.  I have never met a Deputy who practised this.</P>

The State in its wisdom has created a system through the people whereby certain benefits <Col N="1372" /> are available to the people.  Life is becoming so complicated nowadays that people need someone to advise them.  An ombudsman would never have the close relationship with the people which an active Deputy has.  If he is an honest politician he will tell the people whether they are entitled to something or not, or else he will make inquiries.  If we did not perform this function democracy would have folded up long since.  It is to the credit of all parties that we do this work.</P>

      <P>We are sent here primarily as legislators.  We must not lose the common touch about which Kipling wrote.  One can know the anxieties of people when one meets them.  Even if there were 1,000 ombudsman you must have the elected representative, who will have what the people want embodied in legislation. The ombudsman would be limited in scope.  To have wise and good legislation it must come from the people, but through active representatives.  We all know from history that before education became so widespread and when there was a very degree of illiteracy, there would be one man sitting in the market square who could write letters.  He was probably the forerunner of the modern ombudsman.  People might be so well informed that they would know their rights, their privileges and their responsibilities so that there would be no need for them to come near an ombudsman or even a public representative.  We may try to reach a Utopian situation but we may not make much progress.  Members of the British Parliament boast about how easy it is for their constituents to see them, but here constituents can see their representatives almost at any time they wish.  We should not follow the example of other countries.  An ombudsman may be very suitable to British or Swedish society but may not <Col N="1373" /> be suitable here.  Surely it is in the sphere of industrial relations that we need the super ombudsman, that in the Department of Labour we have rights officers who, when called upon by the trade unions or employers, will investigate any one case.  Therefore, the Department of Labour might well, in the new legislation that is promised, examine the setting up of this industrial ombudsman, not just rights officers who are civil servants, who are competent and who do a tremendous amount of good in trying to solve some of the knotty problems of industrial relations.  I do not think we need an ombudsman to deal with ordinary situations but I would agree with Deputy O'Brien to the extent that we need a figure who would give us more hope for the avoidance of industrial strife, that we would have a person who would ensure that no worker or employer would have to suffer any unjustice because there was no one he could go to to have a case investigated.  One may ask why, since the Labour Court is in existence, he cannot go there.  Thank heavens most people do but we have disastrous strikes, nevertheless.  Therefore, the appointment of an ombudsman would not be the complete answer to what Deputy O'Brien is after though I agree with him that it might help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House much longer.  I shall not oppose the motion but I do not consider it to be the answer to the problem.  The Government should not give much time to the consideration of this matter.  It was incorporated in their policy for the last election and I suspect what they will do with this one now is to try and keep face with the public on this aspect.  I would suggest to the Minister who is present, the Minister for Finance and the Public Service, that he would direct his whole efforts into having this industrial relations ombudsman or umpire because we know that a colleague of his may have a strike of civil servants on his hands very shortly.  It is ironical that it should be the Minister for Labour who is to be involved in the strike.  Here we are threatened with a strike of civil servants regarding an industrial matter <Col N="1374" /> but to whom could they appeal?  How will that strike be resolved?  If we had the ombudsman now they could have gone to him to seek help, saying that they believe the Minister for Labour to be wrong in recruiting outside labour.  In this way a strike might be averted.  But faced now with a strike, somebody will have to be put on a pedestal, somebody who will act as an industrial relations officer, to act as intermediary between the Minister and his civil servants.  Otherwise I see a chaotic state of affairs in the offing. Because of the eloquent plea made by Deputy O'Brien I will not oppose the motion but I do not believe it to be the answer to many of our ills.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Brien is to be congratulated on tabling this motion asking Dáil Éireann to reflect for a few hours upon this very important topic.  Deputy O'Brien recognises that administrative action in many cases matters a great deal more than private action and private decisions.  The State or public authority today can have an immense effect on the well being of individual citizens through systems of grants, pensions, benefits, some of them discretionary.  Others are people's entitlements under the law, but persons making decisions in relation to applications are humans and may themselves make human error in passing judgment.  Other areas where the State has an immense effect upon people's fortunes are areas of licensing, commissions, prohibitions and many other fields.  One Max W. Abrahamson, a constitutional lawyer of note in Dublin, some years ago said something which might appear to be harsh but which I am sure was not intended as such but was simply recognising man's propensity not always to be correct.  He said: &ldquo;It is generally if not universally admitted that politicians and officials are flesh and blood and we have enormous evidence from many fields that it follows from this alone that a proportion of their decisions will be unreasonable, negligent, biased and even dishonest&rdquo;.  If that judgment was one which was universally applicable, it would be both harsh and wrong.  But in so far as it identifies the possibility <Col N="1375" /> of error, there is a good case to be made for having an ombudsman.  I am long enough in this House not to hold any illusions about the effectiveness of the weapon of the parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied in my own experience, either as an Opposition critic or as a Government spokesman, that the rights of individuals can in all cases be sufficiently ventilated by means of a parliamentary question or that wrong done can in all cases be righted by that means.  You, Sir, like the rest of us are governed by the Standing Orders which permit only certain matters to be raised in the course of questions.  There are limits on matters which can be raised on the Adjournment.  In a forum of this nature where histrionics can sometimes take precedence over precision and incisive comment, there is a possibility that even the most well-intentioned Deputies and Ministers may not come to the kernel of the matter.  Many issues which an ombudsman could examine and ventilate in the quiet of his office can never be sufficiently processed through the means of the parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>While accepting the importance in our democratic system of maintaining the parliamentary question as the best means of keeping the Minister and his Department on their toes I am not satisfied that that is the best method for ventilating the grievance of an individual citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember some years ago being chastised because I raised by way of a parliamentary question the difficulty of a widow in a Dublin suburb whose window had been blown off the house because an employee of the local authority in question had negligently left the window ajar on a windy day.  Six months later when that good lady had obtained no redress whatever and still had a gaping hole in the wall, I asked the question here and I was chastised by some of our friends of the Fourth Estate for bringing this matter before Parliament.  That was a case where the parliamentary question worked to great advantage.  The window was <Col N="1376" /> installed in 24 hours.  So cases can arise where the parliamentary question is a useful weapon.  However where a person's intimate and confidential affairs are involved in an administrative decision it is not possible to ventilate such cases by way of a parliamentary question.  To some extent they can be dealt with by way of representations direct to a Minister or Departmental officials.  But there is a natural human tendency on the part of any public authority, its officials or political heads, to take up a defensive attitude when criticised and to justify a decision already taken when it is questioned.</P>
    <P>Other countries with an ombudsman or investigator of administrative affairs, have found that the vast majority of complaints were not well-founded. All countries with an ombudsman have found that cases have come to light through the system of having an ombudsman where wrong had been done and right was probably done because the system of ombudsman existed.</P>
    <P>Departments of State and public authorities are probably not the best judges of their own conduct.  It is probably a healthy thing to have their conduct looked at by some independent authority.  Life is becoming more complex.  Citizens, individually and collectively, are becoming more dependent on the State, not because the State as an entity has sought to get extra powers for itself, but because society has called on the community, through the State, to provide welfare services, health services, educational services; because society has obliged the State to protect the public good with rules for physical planning, because the community has conferred upon the public authority rights of compulsory purchase in the public interest. In the exercise of these duties and obligations the State must make judgments from time to time about the eligibility of people for certain benefits which are available.  It must also pass judgment on where the balance should be struck between the private interest and the common good.</P>
    <P>This is an area in which tremendous good can be done.  In most cases, <Col N="1377" /> decisions are taken which are for the benefit of the community.  If some decision is taken to confer benefit on the community, there are ways and means of ensuring that an individual is not harmed as a consequence.  Because of a multitude of decisions and the immense complexity of ways and means of conferring or withholding benefit, it is possible that human error will result in perfection not being achieved at all times.  It is clearly necessary to have some system which will reconcile the necessary exercise of governmental authority with the interests of the individual.</P>
    <P>Another area where the parliamentary question, and political representations by politicians to Minister and Departments, may not serve the best interests of the individual, is related to matters which are the responsibility of State-sponsored bodies.  Many Statutes of Oireachtas Éireann stop a Minister of State from interfering with the day-to-day workings of statutory bodies.  It is undesirable when public money is involved that such bodies should be entirely free from any scrutiny.  It is desirable that such organisations should also, if necessary, be subjected to the overall benign supervision which only an independent ombudsman system could provide.</P>
    <P>We do not require&mdash;and it would be contrary to the public interest&mdash;to have an elaborate system of administrative justice.  It would be undesirable that we should create a new empire, new institutions with a vast bureaucracy which would frustrate the efficient running of Government Departments, State agencies and local authorities.  That is undesirable and can be avoided.  We need a cheap, informal, expeditious way for people who feel aggrieved by some decisions to have their grievance examined by a person and an authority whose judgment would be respected as impartial. Being proud of the privilege of having been a public representative for 16 years, I can understand with sympathy the views expressed by Members of this House about the service they render to individuals, the services they render to the community <Col N="1378" /> in airing their grievances and in pressing them and having wrongs righted. That service will be required as much after we might institute the office of Ombudsman as it is required today. There are a number of countries&mdash; our nearest neighbour in particular&mdash; in which the system of administrative justice operates only when cases are brought to notice by Members of Parliament. That is a possibility which we should consider examining, but it might not be the most appropriate system to adopt here.  There may be people desirous of maintaining total confidence about their own affairs and not wishing to share their affairs or their grievance or their fears with public representatives.  They are entitled to have their confidence respected. It could be wrong to oblige them to seek the assistance of a politician in order to have their grievance aired.</P>
    <P>On all sides of the House we have Members who are only too happy to render service to members of the public irrespective of political loyalty, outlook or profession of the people who approach them.  In fact most Members of this House feel somewhat disgusted when persons approaching them believe that they have to profess political allegiance in order to get the service of the Member they approach.</P>
    <P>I recall on one occasion in Dublin Corporation receiving a letter in an envelope addressed to myself but the letter inside the envelope was addressed to a colleague of an opposite party.  That letter thanked him for using his good offices in making representations to obtain a house and pledged him, as in the past, undying political allegiance.  I had read the letter by mistake before I realised it was intended for somebody else so I duly conveyed the letter to the man in question.  He swopped a letter that he had received in identical terms which was intended for me.  It is a pity that kind of thing happens, but it is not unusual.  Other people have experienced it in various forms. It shows a weakness in the present system when people feel that rights are not available to them unless they <Col N="1379" /> go cap in hand to a political personality.</P>
    <P>If we want to elevate the standard of public life, if we want people to realise that their entitlements are there irrespective of political patronage then we need a system which will enable people to resort to an impartial authority in order to have their grievances examined.  The question arises as to what we can do.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Public Service, which is the youngest of our Departmental offspring, has been extremely busy in many areas involving the restructuring and modernisation of the whole public service, endeavouring to make it more efficient and keep down numbers without impairing the service.  The Department has also been engaged in activities which will help to give to public servants at all levels more satisfactory careers. But in spite of the tremendous workload which they have had, and it has been quite considerable, because apart from these areas they are also endeavouring to set up new institutions dealing with the separation of some Departments between policy making and administrative discharging functions, they have also done a considerable amount of work on the possibility of establishing a suitable system of administrative justice.  It will be recalled that this matter was referred to previously in the Review Body's Report on the Public Service.  It has also been studied by the Institute of Public Administration under the chairmanship of the then Chief Justice and now his Excellency, President Ó Dálaigh.  Quite an amount of work has already been done in this area.  In recent months my Department carried out an exhaustive examination of systems of administrative justice in a large number of countries.  All this information is now available to us.  But there are very few countries in which the whole administrative system is akin to ours. Several of them, like the French and other European systems, have written into their law for centuries past a special legal administrative system.</P>
    <P>The Scandinavian countries are also <Col N="1380" /> very familiar with the system of ombudsman.  There the operation of the public service is so open that any public file is open for inspection by any member of the public.  We very properly would not wish public files to be seen by people who had no right of access to them or no cause to have access to them except to satisfy their own curiosity or to probe into other people's affairs.  There is a need to have files in certain cases examined by independent persons.  The truth is that the workload on Ministers to-day, who are in theory responsible for the decisions of their public servants, is so great that even when a grievance is brought to notice by way of a parliamentary question or by a Deputy's letter the Minister seldom has sufficient time personally to devote to as thorough an examination of a complaint as the complaint may in many cases deserve.  All of this points to the great merit in the recommendation which Deputy O'Brien puts before us for consideration.</P>
    <P>What do we do about it?  The Government have given some thought to this matter and there are a number of possibilities.  We could produce our own legislation and seek the approval of the Dáil and Seanad Éireann for that, but it would be preferable to have an all-party committee of the Oireachtas, an informal committee which would work fairly quickly to consider all aspects of the matter including the issues that have been raised conscientiously by Deputies on either side of the House.</P>
    <P>A great deal has already been written on this matter.  We have the Report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group, the work of the Institute of Public Administration, an amount of documentation available from the Department of the Public Service and we have the free and frank comments of Members of this House and of our friends in the media.  If we had such a group from the Oireachtas we could discuss this matter impartially.  I would be surprised if at the end of those deliberations there would not be a broad concensus in favour of instituting some institution of administrative justice which would convince everybody <Col N="1381" /> that where the public service acts it will not only act fairly but it will appear to be acting fairly.  That is just as important because as convinced as I am, as we all are, that the public service invariably acts with complete integrity and invariably with immense efficiency, it is important that we convince everybody else of that.  A system of administrative justice, call it ombudsman or whatever, would ensure that the public would be equally convinced and that would be a very good thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the support given to this motion.  I realise that Members have different points of view, but, generally, it is accepted that some form of control or ombudsman is required. The Minister has in mind to set up an all-party committee and this is probably the fairer way rather than bringing in a Bill.  This does affect us all.  As public representatives we are affected one way or another.  It is important that one can judge from the machinery that exists within a State for checking administration, especially in dealings with individuals for their redress of grievances.  This will show how democratic a State is. People feel at a loss if there is not somewhere to go to redress a grievance they have.  An Administration not subject to scrutiny of its dealings with individuals is likely to become less effective and less sensitive to individuals.</P>
      <P>We all know about the frustrations of people.  We may ask a parliamentary question or write to the various Departments but that does not necessarily reveal the full story.  For one reason or another facts can be hidden, not necessarily for any ulterior motive but just because various Departments may, through error or in-difference, do this.  If we want people to have a sense of respect and trust in officialdom they must have redress to somebody who can have full access to all the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned that they can look after the affairs of their constituency through the normal <Col N="1382" /> channels but I do not think any Deputy, no matter how well-meaning, can really and truly say that he can do an effective job.  This is one of the reasons I moved this motion.  Deputy Moore said that it was part of the policy and that it was time we did something about it but that is not the reason.</P>
    <P>In my short time in public office I realised that there was a need for an ombudsman.  From time to time I came up against barriers and, because of lack of information, I felt at a loss. But if I could refer a case to an ombudsman I would be fully satisfied in my own mind that the case would be truly looked at and that this would satisfy my constituent, the person who was aggrieved.  This is important.  It is also important that, as distinct from England, the aggrieved party may go directly to the ombudsman. He may not want to go to a political man because he may feel that the political person in his area does not represent him and, therefore, it is very important that he has access to the ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore was not fully satisfied that there was such a need but I should like to quote him some figures that justify my belief that there is a need for such an office.  A survey conducted in Dublin was quoted in Basil Chubb's book <i>The Government and Politics of Ireland</i> and there is reference to the citizen's expectation of treatment by Government officials. In Dublin 35 per cent of the people felt that they were not going to get, and did not expect, equal treatment, while the comparable figure for the UK was 7 per cent and in the United States it was 9 per cent.  When these figures are compared there is certainly a great anomaly here.  Obviously for one reason or another, there is a deep-seated suspicion that people who have a grievance will not get fair treatment.  That does not necessarily mean they do not get fair treatment but if people feel they are not getting it they may be deterred from pursuing what they consider to be their rights. Another interesting figure is that in Dublin 17 per cent of the people expected to be ignored.  When we compare <Col N="1383" /> this figure with the UK which had 5 per cent and in the United States 6 per cent there is obviously a big public relations job to be done here.  The ombudsman could help in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crinion, in quoting my figure, mentioned that Sweden with a population of 7,000,000 and Denmark with 4,500,000 deal with approximately the same number of cases&mdash; 1,000 cases per year&mdash;and he said he dealt with that number in a few months.  I do not accept this because if it was the case our administration would break down.  These are day-to-day problems where people have to fill up forms, look for grants, apply for the children's allowance or seek a house but these are not complaints. These are jobs we do because over the years this custom has built up.  I do not think it is the job of an ombudsman to fill a form for family allowance.  Where there are genuine grievances they will have been pursued through public representatives before the ombudsman will be brought into play.  I have no doubt about this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crinion mentioned that 1,000 cases a year is nothing but I consider it is 1,000 too much.  Every grievance to the individual is a very serious one for that person and must be so treated.  I do not see the ombudsman impinging on the rights of the Deputy in any way.  The Deputy who does not keep in close contact with his constituents will pay the penalty and I think Members realise that.  It is important that Deputies always keep in touch because only by keeping in touch are they aware of the day-to-day problems and thus initiate legislation to solve them.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned about in moving this motion is that in regard to the grievances which arise, whether they are genuine or not, we cannot have full access to all the information. The files are not open to us.  But it is imperative that the ombudsman have access to them.  He will make a report both to the aggrieved party and to whichever Department, local authority or semi-State body with which the aggrieved party has a <Col N="1384" /> problem.  I believe the passage of this motion through the House will improve the standard of democracy within our State.  It will increase people's confidence in officials, giving them a greater awareness of and a greater trust and respect for them.  The figures I read out highlight the problem we must tackle in this respect.  There will always be a number of people who will distrust officials and who will be against the Establishment.  That is part of life.  But 35 per cent who do not expect equal treatment from officials is wrong.  We have to eradicate that and it can be done only by the appointment of an ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for supporting my motion.  I look forward to the all-party committee of this House to be set up by the Minister to examine the facts.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress on 29th January last the House was debating this amendment by Deputy Molloy on section 20.  Section 20 is necessary to take account of a High Court decision to the effect that an appeal, if posted within the appropriate period or even on the last day of that period, would be valid irrespective of when it was received.  The section is designed to clarify the position and remove difficulties which could arise by reason of that decision.  It is necessary obviously to have some definite time limit for the receipt of an appeal.  The section allows three extra days for the receipt of an appeal sent by post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this is a reasonable allowance to make.  I see no reason to allow <Col N="1385" /> a longer period.  If the periods for the receipt of appeals are to be further extended, the time set out in section 26 of the 1963 Act for the actual grant of permissions would probably also have to be extended.  Thus we would have a situation in which, to cater for an exceptional and, I would suggest, hypothetical type of case, the issue of actual permissions would have to be delayed in every case.  From everybody's point of view that would be undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might comment very briefly.  Deputy Molloy's amendment asks that the &ldquo;fifth day&rdquo; be substituted for the &ldquo;third day&rdquo;. There has been considerable discussion on this.  From the Minister's point of view it would not seem to make much difference to change from the third day to the fifth day.  The Minister has stated that the change has been made as a result of a High Court decision.  In making the change there is an admission of a principle that it is possible to have a certain number of days over and above the actual number of days laid down. Nobody would be any the worse off if the Minister were to extend the time limit from three days to five days.  On the other hand it would help considerably the type of citizen Deputy Molloy has in mind, those who live on islands where, on occasions, the post might be disrupted for some reason or another.  In relation to the Civil Service generally in most cases proof of posting is sufficient.  I recognise that it would not be possible to deal with cases of this sort in that way.  Deputy Molloy is not asking that it should be dealt with in this way.  He is simply asking for an extension of the time limit.  He has made a reasonable case.  The principle is admitted and we are disappointed the Minister will not meet us on this.  He did point out that a change might be necessary in the Principal Act.  If that is not positive, perhaps the Minister would meet us on it.</P>

      <P>I think this is a question of change for change's sake.  I do not know whether Deputy <Col N="1386" /> Faulkner heard what I said when I commenced this evening.  The High Court decision is to the effect that an appeal, if posted within the appropriate period, or even on the last day of that period, would be valid irrespective of when it is actually received. In view of that, what case is there for the amendment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Molloy was that it could happen on islands that it might, for one reason or another, take longer to reach the islands than three days. In those circumstances, it might take longer to leave the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I misunderstood what Deputy Faulkner was talking about. The real difficulty would occur with third party appeals.  The period allowed was 21 days so that if an appeal was made there was time to bring it to the notice of the planning authority before permission was issued.  Deputy Faulkner is aware of what I mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to allow three extra days&mdash;that is 24 in all&mdash;for third party appeals sent by post.  If five additional days were allowed&mdash;26 in all&mdash;it would be difficult, having regard to five-day weeks, holiday week-ends and so on to avoid cases where permissions issued are invalidated, unless we change that also.  What is being suggested is that, in the middle of this Bill&mdash;just because somebody thought of something at the last minute&mdash;a change should be made.  In fact we are improving the position.  I do not take Deputy Molloy's case at all because I do not see why <Col N="1387" /> the people on the islands should decide not to send an appeal until the time had almost elapsed.  I am sure they would react the same as everybody else; when they would get the decision they would send the appeal immediately.  We are granting them three extra days for that purpose. Deputy Molloy's amendment of adding a couple of days to that is simply for the purpose of making a change for change's sake.  I cannot see any case for it at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the court had not made its decision and if we were arguing for three days I suspect the Minister would even be against that.  The amendment is not put down for any frivolous reason, as the Minister seems to suggest.  This is the only opportunity we will have to amend the regulations governing the making of appeals.  The court decision was very valuable because a certain amount of hardship had been caused up to the time of the court decisions due to the Department not accepting appeals which had been made near the end of the statutory period.  There are quite a number of cases where this happened.  I do not think any of us want to see the legislation used in a penal way.  We would like to facilitate the public in making appeals and we would like to see the most reasonable provisions provided to enable them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the case for the five days is legitimate and the request is a valid one.  I mentioned the difficulty in remoter areas. I gave the example of the larger islands where there are large communities and a great deal of development going on requiring planning permission. I have found on a number of occasions that where legislation lays down a specific time limit within which appeals should be made this has operated to the detriment of individuals living on islands off our coast.  As a matter of principle, I am proposing that, where the opportunity presents itself, provision should be made to make such regulations less stringent and to facilitate the individual <Col N="1388" /> and the community rather than bureaucracy in these matters.</P>
    <P>This question of rigid time limits within which appeals should be made applies not just in planning matters. It applies throughout many of the activities of other Departments.  It just happens that on this occasion we have an opportunity in dealing with this section of making adequate provision in planning matters and I am suggesting that the five days would be going some way towards making the legislation more acceptable to people.  I should like to give an example, take the case of a person posting a letter on Saturday, the 1st day of the month, on Kilronan in the Aran Islands, an island with a very big population and a great deal of development going on.  The boat sails normally. except during July and August, on Saturday and Wednesday.  If the boat leaves Kilronan at five o'clock on Saturday afternoon to go back to Galway city and an appeal is posted at six o'clock at the post office in Kilronan it cannot be collected for delivery to the GPO in Galway until the following Wednesday, which would be the 6th of the month, As often happens, if gale force winds are forecast the boat does not sail.  The captain does not take any chances.  He is carrying passengers and a large quantity of goods.  The goods have to be unloaded into currachs for delivery to the small islands.  He does not sail if there is a possibility of bad weather. This happens regularly.  If the weather is bad, it is not usually a one-day gale; it usually lasts a few days before it blows itself out.  The possibility of the boat not arriving back at Kilronan to collect that letter until the following Saturday is a real one and then it is delayed until the 8th day of the month.  If the letters are delivered in Galway that night they will not arrive in Dublin until Monday and it will possibly be Tuesday before they arrive in the Department, which is the 11th day of the month.  The Minister is smiling.  Maybe the Minister does not care.</P>

The court decision making an appeal lodged on the final day of the period mentioned in the Act brings to light the fact that neither the month nor the 21st day makes any appeal that is posted on that day a legitimate appeal.  The Minister says it is legitimate only if it is delivered within three days.  All I am asking is that we insert &ldquo;only if it is delivered in five days&rdquo;. We would be prepared to accept an amendment along the Minister's own suggestions some minutes ago that the postmark on the letter of appeal be accepted as being a legitimate indication of the time in which the appeal was lodged.  If the Minister is prepared to make such an amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not.  I misunderstood what Deputy Faulkner was saying and I was wrong.  I was trying to point out the reason why the amendment had to be introduced because the postmark was effected beforehand.  It could be a month, not a week.</P>

      <P>I think it is very regrettable that the Minister is so un-bending in this matter.  It is not costing him anything other than to agree to a minor change which would have major consequences for certain individuals residing in certain areas.  I do not think it is in any way going to upset the administration of the <Col N="1390" /> Planning Act and the appeals system in the Department.  It will make no difference whatsoever.  I think the Minister is unfair in his reference to section 26 and the possibility, if this amendment were accepted, of the need to extend those time limits.  I cannot see how that arises at all.  On behalf of those persons, I am asking the Minister again if he will accept the amendment. It is clear and simple.  It is a minor concession being asked from him but one that will have important consequences for those placed in the situation where they are dependent on unreliable postal services, not in this instance directly the fault of the postal system but the fault of the weather conditions which obtain along the Atlantic coast quite regularly. There postal services are very erratic. I would not be making the case so strongly and so determinedly if I had not experience of people who had lost out because of the effect of the weather on the postal deliveries.  They have been denied things which, had they mainland postal facilities, they would have got.  Livelihoods were affected in the case.  A man lost a salmon drift net licence because of delay in delivery due to the non-sailing of the boat on a particular day.  We would be unreasonable if we were to ask for an unlimited length of time, or if we were to ask for the length of time the Minister spoke of a few minutes ago, a month or four weeks.  We have to have some limit, but I suggest that the Minister is far too narrow in this limit.  Five days would be more reasonable.  Along the west coast storms usually blow themselves out within three days so that would give two days for delivery of the letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the start that I would accept any reasonable amendment. I meant that.  This is not a reasonable amendment.  It is, in my opinion, something which was put in either for the purpose of attempting to change the Bill, for change's sake or of causing obstructions.  Even the cases Deputy Molloy quoted will not stand up to examination.  He spoke of the boat going on Saturday an hour before the letter is posted and the next one <Col N="1391" /> not until Wednesday.  Even if that is correct and even if five days were allowed, he was still late because they could not get it.  There was no way in which it could reach its destination if it were posted on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy then spoke about the storm being on for a week.  In effect what he is saying is, that there are certain areas in which there should not be a limit at all.  I do not know where he got the two days.  We decided to add on three days.  Deputy Molloy says, out of the sky, we will add on an extra two days.  Why two days?  Why should the people in the Aran Islands or anywhere else decide to wait until the last few days before they make their appeal?  Are they the type of people who put everything on the long finger? I do not think they are.  They are perhaps more anxious than anybody else to ensure that they are on time and therefore they would send in their appeals in good time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy said he had experience of this happening to people. Unless it happened before the High Court case it could not happen at all because until this Bill becomes law, that could not happen because the postmark is what operates.  We are hearing massive contradictions from Deputy Molloy about a simple matter.  The simple matter is, that we have a situation where a third-party is appealing&mdash; this is not somebody appealing for something he wants to do himself&mdash; against something which somebody else wants to do and trying to stop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy suggests that it is not enough to give these people the normal three weeks which they were getting plus three days, that they should, for some extraordinary reason, get two days as well.  This would mean changing other sections of the 1963 Act and of the Bill which is before the House. I am not prepared to do that.  It is ridiculous that we should have this type of situation.  If there was a good case being made for it, I would most certainly be prepared to have a look at it, but the more I hear of it the more I realise that there is no merit in the suggestion.  In fact, it would help those <Col N="1392" /> who for one reason or another might want to obstruct because it would give them an extra two days and prevent the confirmation of the planning decision.  If the planning decision was made it would completely upset the decision made if the appeal was sent in after the requisite number of days or alternatively we must change the 1963 Act and portion of this Bill.  In view of that there is no point at all in Deputy Molloy's argument.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that the Minister is not correct in alleging that my statement is contradictory. The example I gave the Minister did not state that the appeal was lodged on the last day.  In fact, the appeal could have been lodged on the 23rd day of the 30-day period and it would still have been late.  It would have been late by one day.  I should like the Minister to correct his statement of now, where he states that under section 20 we are dealing only with third-party appeals.  I am not of the opinion that that is so. The Minister is contradicting himself now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  In the case of a person appealing against a decision to himself he has the 30 days' period.  If he lodged the appeal on the 23rd day of that 30-day period and if the circumstances, as outlined by me were to happen as would be quite likely in certain locations along the west coast, his appeal would be late by one day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister was to be fair he must accept that if a person receives a decision from a planning authority which he does not agree with&mdash;usually it is a refusal&mdash;and he has to examine it and decide whether it is worth his while appealing it, he may have to consult some professional person as to the case he could make for an appeal which might succeed. These things do not happen overnight. For a period of three weeks to pass within which he would have his new plans prepared for appeal, his case presented, his arguments gathered and ready for presentation, putting down on paper and for posting, is not a long time.  It is unfair of the Minister to suggest that when a person receives a decision from a local authority that he does not agree with that he can then go and lodge an appeal the next day.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally the person would like to know if he has any chance of winning the appeal if he has a reasonable case.  In the case of an <Col N="1394" /> hotel the person would certainly consult again with his architect and engineers, discuss the decision, the reasons for refusal, see if there was any way they could be resolved or whether the professional advice was that the officials in the local authority had dealt rather harshly with him and that he might have a chance of succeeding on appeal.  Certainly, the preparation of such a case could be done in one day.  If the person is living on an island and must travel to the mainland to consult these professional people or if they must go out to the island, it will take some time.  To do all this in three weeks would mean a rapid preparation of an appeal case. The case is a legitimate one.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister repeat what the exact effect of the judgment in the court case was?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The court case judgment was that the date on the postmark applied.  This might be all right except that it has been known that letters have gone astray.  For one reason or another they arrived in the Custom House quite a lengthy time after the postmark was put on.  This caused a lot of upset, not least of which was the one which Deputy Molloy could create by what he is suggesting here when the third-party appeal is involved.  As Deputy Faulkner knows there is a notification given of the intention to grant permission. The number of days were fixed in order to make this possible within a certain period.  If what Deputy Molloy suggests was done it would mean that somebody could not alone get intention to grant permission but they could get a grant of permission and then find that an appeal had been sent in against the decision.  This would naturally cause a considerable amount of upset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to avoid this a date has been selected in a certain way and we went as far as we possibly could. There are not many third-party appeals coming in but in the other case there is more time given, and Deputy Molloy made a case against himself when he talked about the question of persons appealing themselves <Col N="1395" /> and said that although they had a longer period, he still felt they should get two days longer.  What is magical about those two extra days? I am not convinced that there is any merit at all in that.  We are doing it very fairly and we should let this section go without this amendment.</P>

Subsection (2) of the section as drafted would, however, have replaced the provision of the 1963 Act in relation to the time limits thereby leaving no time provision for appeals sent other than by post.  The new provision for appeals sent by post is additional to and not in substitution for the 1963 Act provision.  It is simply a drafting amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  If at any time while the provisions of this section are in operation normal postal deliveries have been disrupted for any reason the references in the foregoing subsections to the third day shall be construed as referring to such period of disruption.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 44 in my name relates to the same sort of situation as amendment No. 43 attempted to deal with, that is, the question of the time allowed for the arrival of notices of <Col N="1397" /> appeal.  Deputy Molloy was concerned with extending the time as a matter of general application from three days to five days.  My amendment is related to that but along somewhat different lines.  My amendment is concerned with the situation where there is a disruption of the normal postal services. I want to ensure that in a situation where the normal postal services are disrupted a citizen will not be put at a disadvantage in relation to a planning appeal because of that disruption.  This seems to me to be a fairly sensible suggestion.  A person may wish to appeal against a planning decision.  He carries out the provisions of the Act in so far as that appeal is concerned but the notification of his appeal is prevented from arriving because of a disruption of the postal services.  What I am suggesting is that if the normal postal deliveries are disrupted, instead of stipulating that the appeal must arrive within three days, the Act would provide that instead of the third day the relevant day would be the day on which the disruption ceases.  This is a reasonable precaution for us to write into the Bill and could in certain circumstances be of very considerable importance to individuals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the purpose of section 20 is to provide some certainty as to the latest date for acceptance of an appeal sent by post. This is necessary for a number of reasons.  For instance, to protect the board against litigation, to prevent a situation arising where, as I said earlier on Deputy Molloy's amendment, where commitments entered into on foot of what was believed to be a valid permission, are rendered abortive.  In other words, if the notification of permission had been sent out and subsequently there was an appeal, it could, as Deputy Haughey will readily agree, cause considerable trouble.  We are anxious not to hold up development and we must accept that a period of two months for the decision on a planning application and a further month before an issue of permission is a considerable delay. That is three months.  To suggest that <Col N="1398" /> it should be extended even further because of certain things happening to the postal service, for instance I do not think would be acceptable to the general public.  If the period for acceptance of an appeal is extended, one must also extend the period before the permission issues so this causes a longer delay and unless that is done there is a danger that the permission which has been issued <i>bona fide</i> can be cancelled out.  The purpose of the section is to remove doubts and not to have a position of uncertainty which would add to the delay of developers of the construction industry. They have been pressing about the fact that they consider that even the present system unduly delays them. Exceptional circumstances could be the cause of an even longer delay. The one thing which Deputy Haughey and Deputy Molloy have forgotten is that there are more ways of putting in an appeal than sending it by post.  An appeal by telegram would be acceptable.</P>

      <P>I am not.  I am dealing with a very important point. I am quite in earnest about this amendment.  I will put my case to the Minister and I will not waste a lot of time on it.  It is a valid case and if he does not accept it the legislation will be all that more ineffective.</P>
      <P>The Minister keeps talking about the time allowed for appeals.  On Deputy Molloy's motion I made the distinction that there is a statutory time allowed in which to enable the citizen to make up his mind.  It is either 21 days or 30 days.  That is if you like, the gestation period.  The citizen has that time to make up his mind.  We are not talking in Deputy Molloy's motion about extending the time for appeal. All we are talking about is the mechanics of making the appeal.  The Minister and the Statute grant a certain period and we are all accepting that.  We are saying that when that time has elapsed we are concerned about what happens then.  Deputy Molloy has put his case and the Minister refused to accept it.  I put this different sort of situation to the Minister and ask him to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the postal services are completely disrupted, is it fair that a citizen should be disadvantaged by that in respect of planning?  The Minister based his case on the instances where people are appealing against permissions which have been granted.  That is not fair of the Minister.  By far the greater number of appeals are made in situations where planning permission has been refused.  We are dealing with a situation where a citizen's application for planning permission has been turned down and he wants to appeal against that decision.  In all fairness, he should be granted every possible facility to make that justifiable appeal to the Minister or the board.  I am dealing with the situation where the time has elapsed in which he is allowed to consider the matter; he has come to a decision to make an appeal; he does everything that can be expected of him; he makes out his appeal and posts it and through the <Col N="1400" /> fault of the State because of a disruption of postal services, not the fault of the citizen, that appeal does not arrive within the three-day or the five-day period allowed for posting.  As the Bill is now framed, if there is such a disruption of the postal services and the appeal does not arrive, through no fault of the appellant, I am suggesting that the period should be extended from three days to whatever time the disruption lasts.  If he has done his duty, posted the appeal within the period allowed he should not be penalised because the State fails to provide an adequate postal service to enable that appeal to be delivered. That is a perfectly valid point and I suggest that the Minister should accept it.  If he does not accept it in the words I have put before him, perhaps he could devise better words himself. It is a very reasonable proposition. It is allied to Deputy Molloy's idea of extending the three days to five days but it deals with a different sort of situation.  With the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs we have at the moment anything can happen to our postal services at any moment.  I do not want to be tendentious in this regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He could be penalised.  The Minister must admit that through no fault of his own, a citizen who wishes to make an appeal to the Minister or to the board, does all that can be expected of him, his appeal does not arrive because of a postal strike, his appeal will go by the board as the Bill stands.  That is not fair.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the Minister for not agreeing to the <Col N="1401" /> amendment without delay.  Take a man who appeals against the decision of a local authority and does all that is required of him and posts the appeal and through no fault of his own there is a postal strike.  Why should he suffer?  I would be surprised at the Minister if he does not accept it without any debate.  This is the fairest amendment I have seen for a long time.  I would be surprised if the Minister contended that there would be justification for penalising him because of some disruption of the postal services.  I will be surprised if the Minister does not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that the Minister would even consider rejecting this very reasonable amendment.  It is not a contentious matter.  It is a simple constructive proposal by Deputy Haughey.  He has argued the case in a very reasonable manner.  The point made by Deputy Callanan is a very reasonable one.  I can appreciate the Minister's concern for the over-delay in appeals and the amount of time an appeal takes&mdash;two months for a decision and a further month for the appeal.  He is afraid that this will extend it further by days and maybe weeks.  Any further delay involved in Deputy Haughey's amendment would be as a result of some disruption within the State service which is, in this case, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to accept, even at this late stage, this very reasonable amendment.  Deputy Haughey has suggested that if the Minister does not accept the exact wording he has proposed the Minister can rephrase it and bring it back and we will accept it.  The principle involved, of a man having decided to appeal, having posted the appeal within the regulation time, and then having found that through no fault of his own, but because of some disruption within the State services, to which he is paying when he purchases his stamp or his telegram, this is not delivered to the appropriate authorities. How can one penalise a man due to the failure of some State service? If the Minister does not accept the <Col N="1402" /> wording, that is fair enough, I can appreciate he may not agree with the exact wording.  His parliamentary draftsmen might say that the wording is not the way they would like it, that it might be too loose or too tight.  But I would ask him to accept the principle involved&mdash;that a citizen should not be penalised because of a failure of a State agency to provide the service for which they are appointed and set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. I assumed that the Minister would have had no hesitation in accepting this amendment.  The Minister mentioned that part of the reasons why the section is as stated was to endeavour to remove uncertainty.  I would take that point.  But there is something which overrides this objective and that is the right of the individual. In these circumstances, as outlined by Deputy Haughey, we could be taking away the right of the individual to make an appeal. Because, if postal services are disrupted and an appeal does not reach the Department, a right is taken from the citizen.  On that basis I would suggest that the Minister reconsider the proposal put forward.  It is useful to try to remove uncertainty from the Bill where possible but nevertheless in circumstances where the rights of the individual are being infringed on, the Minister should reconsider the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of reasonable comments made but also some which were a little off the mark.  Deputy Haughey's reference to a gestation period is entirely wrong. It is nothing of the sort.  People are notified of the decision of a local authority.  Then they get either 24 days, if they are those who are objecting, or a month and three days if they are the people who make the application. It is not a gestation period. They get that period to send in an appeal if they require to do so.  It does not take very long for the people I meet to decide whether they should send in an appeal.  If they intend sending in an appeal they, as Deputy Molloy suggested, seek expert advice as to how they should frame their <Col N="1403" /> appeal and it can be sent in within a reasonable time.  But it is wrong to suggest that in any circumstances there should be an open-ended period.</P>

Already I have got at least three different versions of what people think is a disruption of normal services, none of which would be covered by Deputy Haughey's amendment.  Therefore, I suggest that we are being asked to do something which would leave the Bill wide open.  Deputy Faulkner made a reasonable comment but he over-looked one point.  The 1963 Act, which we are now amending, contains, though not as specific, the same intention as is in this, and there was just as much danger of a postal strike or of various types of disruption then as there is now.  We have 12 years' experience of that Act.</P>

Deputy Haughey says he will accept the wording if we will put in wording.  If there is a disruption of postal services does that disruption give those people, who want to put in an appeal, an extra day or an extra week, or an extra month or does it give them the whole year.

      <P>My amendment is specific.  It says that the three days will be extended to cover the period of disruption.  When disruption ends that is the last day.  The 1963 Act was framed very carefully by first-class officials, parliamentary draftsmen and so on, but nevertheless it did result in a High Court action.  So we are not dealing with trivialities here, we are dealing with very important issues which could end up in the High Court. Cannot you see that if you leave the section the way you have drafted it now you could have another High Court case over exactly this very point?  Is it not as well to put it down in writing now?  I do not wish to take up too much time on the amendment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this House is to discuss matters such as this.  What is now in this Bill ties up the loose ends which were left out in the 1963 Act which resulted in a High Court case.  I think Deputy Haughey will not deny that that is so. Deputy Haughey's amendment reads: &ldquo;If at any time while the provisions of this section are in operation normal postal deliveries have been disrupted for any reason the references to the foregoing subsections to the third day shall be construed as referring to such period of disruption.&rdquo; Supposing the strike which Deputy Callanan refers to takes place at different periods.  It is on in Dublin for a week and then it spreads down the country.  This would not be specific enough to cover that.  If there was a <Col N="1406" /> storm or a snow drift such as we have had before and the roads were disrupted and the lines were down and there was no postal delivery, is that the type of disruption which Deputy Haughey has in mind?</P>

      <P>There may be parts of the country where there will not be snow drifts.  There may be parts of the country in which people do not send in their appeal but would try to take advantage of something like this for the purpose of qualifying them as an after-thought.  We are trying to get a workable Bill through this House.  I would suggest that what Deputy Haughey is suggesting is not workable. If I thought it was I would accept it, as I did accept a number of previous amendments.</P>

There is other important business to do in connection with this Bill and we will not spend all night on this point.

This is the type of state we want to maintain and not to have legislation tied-up so that a citizen cannot take a High Court action.  I am proud that <Col N="1407" /> any John Citizen is able to defeat the State.  The Minister said that if there was disruption in one place the person could go and post it at another.

      <P>Where the train services or the postal services are disrupted, in the case of a refusal, the time of receipt of the appeal would be when normal services would be resumed. We do not have to go back too far.  If I posted a letter last Saturday night in Ballina containing an appeal against a decision either refusing <Col N="1408" /> me or my client planning permission and if the train strike had gone on two or three days instead of one day, my appeal would not have been delivered. What my client and I would have to have done would be either of two things: let the business drop or else put in a new application, putting a lot of extra expense on both the county council and on the client.  I can see the Minister's concern that there would be duplication.  In the case of an appeal, would he not consider, as a compromise, extending the date if there is disruption of the normal services?</P>

      <P>It is better to have some time element in this because if we do not put this in for one reason or another it may hold up appeals.  I understand that there must be special circumstances.  We may have appeals which would affect public concerns such as oil refineries or smelters where further technical knowledge might be required before a decision could be made, and this may not be available in this country and we may have to go outside it.  The day-to-day appeals which normally are not very technical would be dealt with within the four months.  Earlier when we were talking about vexatious appeals one thing which was highlighted was that they should not be held up.  Where appeals are held up people can be at a great loss in regard to money and development. It does not necessarily mean that we have to wait four months to get an appeal out but where there is a backlog and they might be slow to take on additional staff this will urge them to do so because they will have to have the appeal out within a time limit.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>In dealing with the Bill it is important to remember that we are setting up an appeals board and the experience of this House and of the public of the appeal system to date is one where the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary decides the appeal.  My amendment is put in as a safeguard to ensure that when this semi-autonomous body&mdash;the planning appeals board&mdash;is established they will not because of tardiness on their part hold up development.  It has been mentioned before that the Minister, being a political figure is subject to political pressures and he can be questioned about appeals.  There will be no such facility available when the planning board is established.  It is <Col N="1410" /> important that we have some lever over this board to ensure that they perform their duties expeditiously.  I suggest that having had the appeal for a period of two months, and not having decided it, any party to the appeal shall be entitled to demand that the board show cause why the appeal should not be heard.  The public would then have some right to demand an explanation from the board as to why a particular case had not been decided.  My amendment states that:</P>
      <P>...Should the cause shown be trivial or otherwise deemed by the High Court, on application, to be insufficient, the High Court shall have power to direct the Board to determine such appeal forthwith.</P>
      <P>A safeguard would exist that appeals would not be held up for trivial reasons by the board.  This safeguard is necessary and the wording is specific. I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy O'Brien says.  I think a date should be put on it to ensure that an appeal is not lying in the Minister's office for more than four months.  I have found that an architect when he submits an appeal would not follow up with the information required although he may have said he did.  In such cases the architect is holding up the appeal and not the Minister.  What date would apply&mdash;the date the appeal is lodged or the date the last information goes into the Minister?  I agree with Deputy O'Brien that it is necessary to have a date specified.  I smile when I see an ex-Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government looking for a period of four months.

      <P>The principle involved in both the amendments is basically the same.  Deputy Molloy has tightened the proposal to suggest a two-month period and brings into account the legal process which is the protection of the High Court.  The appellant can bring his case before the High Court.  The irrelevant argument of Deputy Belton is not worthy of comment.</P>

      <P>What happened to Deputy Belton is the very point we are trying to sort out here.  His comment should have been referred to supporting the amendment proposed by Deputy Molloy.  The necessity for some time limit on appeals is vital even when the appeal is before the Minister.  It is more vital when the appeal is before a board such as we are setting up.  At present we have democratic control under the Minister, he being the politically appointed person.  Now we are handing over a certain amount of this democratic control to a board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are familiar with semi-State bodies and their activities.  While they are in name democratically controlled by this House, in practice they are outside our control.  I can see the same thing happening to this board.  We should have built into this Bill some restriction on this board.  After receiving the appeal, the board should make the decision.  If they do not make a decision, it is up to them, in the High Court, to show cause.  Deputy Belton's point about the architect not submitting the details of the appeal is a problem between the appellant and his architect.  It has nothing to do with the board or the Minister.  If authority is to be handed over to a board, I am afraid we shall reach a situation as has occurred in semi-State bodies that the Oireachtas shall not have control.  We should have the necessary protection as is suggested in the amendment. The Minister, who has tremendous respect for the democratic process and for democratic control, and as a Minister of a Government who are suggesting the setting up of select <Col N="1412" /> committees of the Oireachtas to control the existing activities of semi-State bodies, will accept that we should not under any new legislation be setting up boards under the supposed control of the Oireachtas but which in practice will be completely independent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments submitted by Deputies O'Brien and Molloy are alike.  I think they do what the Minister was anxious about in other amendments, that is that they introduce something specific and take away uncertainty in relation to the time allowed to the board to make decisions. The only problem I would see in Deputy O'Brien's amendment is that the maximum time of four months might become the minimum time and would frustrate the purpose he has in mind. For that reason I would be inclined to be more favourable towards the amendment put down by Deputy Molloy.  It is vitally important that decisions should be made as quickly as possible.  The Minister is aware that in these times of very rapid inflation and escalating costs, it is essential that decisions be made as quickly as possible. Otherwise it can involve the appellant in very considerable expense.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in a reply to me yesterday, pointed out that in relation to certain types of houses the average cost had increased by 37 per cent since May, 1973.  If my reckoning is correct that would mean that the percentage increase since 1st January this year would be approximately 6 per cent.  It is quite obvious that any kind of lengthy delay in decisions by the board could result in very serious financial problems and, for that reason, the Minister should accept one of these amendments, preferably Deputy Molloy's.  If he thinks he can put forward a more suitable amendment himself which would combine the ideas involved in both these amendments, he would be doing a worthwhile day's work.  The problem I see in Deputy O'Brien's amendment is simply that the maximum time could become the minimum. Nevertheless, the original idea is roughly the same in both amendments and I commend them to the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not too bad.  If a person comes to a public representative and tells him he sent an appeal to the board on a certain date and asks the public representative to inquire about it, where does he go?  The minimum may become the maximum or <i>vice versa</i> if we agree to four months and that is what I am afraid of.  If a person who has an ordinary appeal about the site of a house makes an appeal to the Minister a Deputy can go to the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary and inquire about it.  He may be told it was not properly lodged and he can then go to that man and tell him he did not appeal in the proper way. Now it will go to the board.  How are we going to see the board?  Is the board compelled to write back immediately and tell this man his appeal is not in order?  This is what I am worried about.  We are moving away from democracy.  However, that is done now and it is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy's amendment making provision for two months, is agreeable to me.  I am not going back on what has happened in the past, I am discussing the Bill before us now because what happened in the past is not relevant.  We are discussing a new board, a board with which I did not agree.  The majority of this House agreed to it.  I bow to that decision but I claim that we should have some rights to guard the appellant against his appeal lying aside because it is not in order.  How is that man to find out it is not in order unless the board are compelled to write to him to tell him so?  I do not know how any public representative can inquire about such an appeal.  I should like to know about this because people ask their public representatives to make inquiries <Col N="1414" /> about many matters.  I do not know whether a public representative has any right to make inquiries from this board.  I support this amendment and I would ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to accept these amendments in principle.  We must remember that appeals are not made without good grounds.  It often happens that an appeal is lodged and the grounds for the appeal are not stated.  It may require two or three reminders on the part of the Minister or the Department to get the basis for the appeal from the appellant.  We also must bear in mind the fact that sometimes third party appeals can be lodged for a mischievous purpose, primarily for the purpose of holding up some development or a person may request an oral hearing of a planning appeal for the sole purpose of delaying a decision on the appeal or for holding up a certain development.</P>
      <P>If a time limit is imposed on the board for deciding these appeals a system must, naturally be devised whereby appeals will be decided within a stated time limit.  I know that the Minister and indeed any planning board will be in an invidious position in trying to decide an appeal when they cannot get information particularly of a technical and scientific nature.  If the board know they have a time limit within which to decide the appeal they will then set out ways and means of getting the necessary scientific and technical information within the required time limit.  As well as that, there will be finality in relation to an appeal.  At present neither an appellant nor an applicant for permission nor a third party can ever say when there will be finality reached in relation to their appeal.</P>
      <P>I am firmly convinced that there should be a time limit.  After all the planning authorities must by law decide a planning application within a time limit of two months.  They must get all the technical and expert information necessary to decide a planning application.  It is very desirable that there should be a time limit placed on the board for deciding planning appeals.</P>

      <P>How nice it would be to say we will put a time limit of two months on appeals and everybody will have his appeal decided within that time.  I forgive everybody in the House for making the argument except one person, Deputy Molloy, who knows quite well that what he is asking is impossible.  He knows well that when he was Minister for Local Government it was not a question of people worrying about waiting for two months; in fact, they had to wait two years and more.  This is the extraordinary situation we have in this House.  We talk about having a reasonable debate on a Bill which is supposed to amend the planning law.  Then we have something like this being brought in.  The amendments are absolutely unworkable.  The board are being set up as the authority to deal with appeals.  Of course, the board will realise that they will be judged by their performance.  They will be doing their best to get it done as quickly as possible.  Let us take the two countries, Britain and the Republic of Ireland.  In Britain, in appeals decided, in 1974, it took eight to nine months for cases decided by inspectors on written representations; 13 months for cases decided by inspectors after a hearing; 15 months for cases decided by the Secretary of State on written representations and 18 months for cases decided by the Secretary of State after a hearing. Our own figures compare very favourably&mdash;about six months for cases dealt with by written representation and about eight months for cases dealt with by oral hearings.</P>

      <P>What would be the average?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the average. There were some cases which took much longer.  There were some cases which could not possibly be dealt with in that period of time.  If it can be pointed out that there is at least one case in which over 12 letters have been written to the people making the <Col N="1416" /> appeal, asking them&mdash;as they are entitled to be asked&mdash;to make their case, and so far it has not been made. One local authority had eight letters written before they submitted the information for which they were asked.  It will be realised that what is requested here is absolutely out the window.  Of course, we would all love it if there could be a decision made in a short time.  I believe many people who applied for permission, on appeal&mdash;particularly those who, after a lot of trouble, get a site to build a house&mdash;would nearly prefer to be refused within a few months, if it were possible, than wait for six, seven or eight months and eventually perhaps get permission.  The plain facts are that we cannot do it; we cannot do it now.  It is unreal and unfair to suggest that it can be done by a board.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy suggests that there should be a High Court judge. &ldquo;Should the cause shown be trivial or otherwise deemed by the High Court on application, to be insufficient the High Court shall have power to direct the board to determine such appeal forthwith.&rdquo;  And the chairman of the board&mdash;about which the Deputy speaks&mdash;will be a High Court judge, or an ex-High Court judge.  Therefore, we will have one High Court judge directing another High Court judge to do something he considers should be done.  Apparently, the Deputies who have been making the case are not aware that, under present legislation, there is the right of an appellant to have an order of <i>mandamus</i> and it has been applied for.  Naturally, the people dealing with appeals will make sure to get them out before the order is made. But that right exists for anybody who wants to avail of it.  Therefore, to suggest that all we have to do is write it into the Bill that the decision shall be given within four months, or two months is ridiculous.  I am surprised it has been suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intake of appeals is about 4,000 per annum and we have got on top of them.  They were coming in faster than they were being dealt with, through nobody's fault but because it was physically impossible to deal with the volume of appeals.  When a <Col N="1417" /> case is trivial they are being dealt with fairly quickly, where there is not a very big issue at stake.</P>

      <P>Where there is a big industry involved and specialists required, we try to get it done quickly. I do not make any apology for saying that where there is a question of a lot of employment involved, we attempt to get as early a decision as possible. But with the best will in the world it has been found that cases like this take ten, 12 months.  Deputy O'Leary is quite correct when he says these things happen through no fault of ours.  It would be unfair if we decided that simply by appointing a board we could expect them to do something which we cannot do ourselves, no matter how we try.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I would ask the two Deputies concerned to withdraw their amendments because I think they realise that the suggestion they have made is just not workable.  The simplest way is that we must give the board an opportunity of dealing with these cases.  Naturally, they will not want to be sitting waiting around. I do not know how it will work; nobody here can say how it will work eventually.  We hope it will work fairly well but, to suggest that we should put a short time limit on it and then, automatically, give a decision in favour, if the case was not dealt with within the specified time is just not reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wanted to make and made in putting down the amendment is that there is a time limit placed on the planning authority at <Col N="1418" /> local level to which the Minister sees no objection and which he intends retaining under the existing legislation. The Minister is siding with the bureaucrats in refusing to put any time limit on the officials and himself, in the Department of Local Government, or on the planning board and their officials when they come into being.  It is a very valid point that there should have been a similar time restriction placed in the appeal process as there is on the local authority. The fine argument the Minister made, pleading the case for those in Local Government&mdash;that they could not possibly be expected to be able to decide planning appeals within a two-or four-month period&mdash;that often it would take them at least 12 months&mdash;while, at the same time, the Minister is satisfied, in view of our experience and everything else, to continue the two-month restriction on local authorities. There is an obvious anomaly there. We have made our case.  I have put my amendment.  We have heard the Minister's arguments.  He has indicated he is not prepared to see reason, so I withdraw my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would take up this point because the Minister has not accepted my amendment.  I believe it to be a reasonable one.  I realise there has been quite a back-log of work and as was said earlier this was because local authorities were refusing planning permissions for frivolous reasons.  The Minister indicated that he would have a look at this matter to ensure that there would be greater flexibility.  He has allowed flexibility in his period of office.  But more flexibility should be allowed.  If local authorities are diligent in their duty in not granting appeals where they should they should be so informed, and instructed as to what to do and how to do it.  I feel that would limit the number of appeals coming before the board.  In that way, the number would be reduced drastically and allow the board get down to work and operate within a period of time.  I feel that where there is a time limit it keeps people on their toes.  I realise the board may be taking over a back-log of work and that it would not be <Col N="1419" /> possible to bring this into operation at the beginning.  But after a period of time&mdash;if it is not written in initially &mdash;such an amendment should be inserted to insure that the board, for one reason or another, keep up-to-date and apace with the work.</P>
      <P>If the Minister does not accept this amendment now I would ask him to have a look at it at a future date because I still think it is necessary and I believe it has merit.  Indeed, I would not put it down if I thought it had not.  As Deputy Molloy pointed out, the local authority has a time limit and there is no reason why a board should not and I have in my amendment a proviso that this time limit could be extended for one reason or another and that would keep them on their toes.  I would ask the Minister, if he does not accept the amendment now, to look at it again to see if it would be desirable to put it in to ensure that this board will operate in an expeditious way.  In view of the fact that he is not accepting it now, I will withdraw it but I ask him to review the situation at an early date.</P>

      <P>I want to make a very brief contribution.  I appreciate the reasons why the proposers of both these amendments are withdrawing.  I think it is a reasonable approach on both our parts now that we have raised this principle.  For the Minister's consideration I want to make two very brief points.  First, I think in the complex of a new board, a board doing a job as distinct from a political Minister doing a job, a time limit is most desirable.  The situation is that, if you have a political head of a Department entrusted with the job of deciding these appeals, you have the whole democratic process mobilised to ensure that he does his job within some reasonable period of time.  First of all, as a political person himself he will be anxious to equip himself well and perform his duties with, if you like, political honour.  Secondly, he will have his own colleagues making sure, as far as they can, that there is no undue delay in any particular matter in which they or their constituents may be interested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Political opponents also.  Ministers in Government are subject to pressure and criticism in this House.  There is an inbuilt mechanism, where a political figure is concerned, in having matters reasonably quickly and expeditiously decided.  There have been some regrettable experiences in the past in this respect but these are unavoidable in any administrative machinery.  The Minister is now shedding this responsibility and handing it over to a board; there is, therefore, greater need for a time limit, because boards can become faceless bureaucracies.  There will not be the same political urgency where a board is concerned in getting on with the job.  We all know plenty of State boards and semi-State boards who can get into a nice easy-going way of doing things.  They do not have the political pressure of this House breathing down the backs of their necks.  I just make that point.  Whatever the need for a time limit where a political person is concerned, there seems to me to be a need for some time limit where a board is concerned or some machinery available to the individual citizen who cannot get at the political head and criticise him politically for not giving a decision. In the case of a board there should be some machinery available to the individual to make the board come to a decision.  I do not agree with putting too limited a time because that would involve, or perhaps precipitate, unfair decisions being taken.  If a board has an inadequate time limit, which confines them unduly, the simple thing for the board to do is just issue a refusal and let it go at that.  I do not think we want that.  We do not want to force a board into that position. There is a need in the case of a board, as distinct from a Minister, to have a time limit and I would certainly have that time limit adequate and flexible. I hope the Minister will be able to devise some such system.</P>

      <P>I would go further than Deputy Haughey.  I support the points made by the two proposers <Col N="1421" /> of the amendment, both Deputy Molloy and Deputy O'Brien. I know the Minister is familiar with these kinds of cases and I know he has sympathy with the applicants.  We all admit third party appeals can be mischievous.  A number of such appeals are unrelated to fact.  The Minister is familiar with these.  Surely in these days of rising costs, whether one accepts the rising costs are outside the control of the Government or within the control of the Government, it is still a fact that costs are going up and, if you have not got a limit on time, you will see a situation where, because of mischievous third-party appeals, an applicant who is entitled in law and everything else to proceed with a particular development may be held up unduly in that development. It might be an extension to a private house, and the next-door neighbour or a neighbour two or three doors away may lodge an appeal for some purely mischievous reason.  You could have somebody in Donegal appealing against some development in Cork under the present legislation.  Surely some time limit must be put on because otherwise you will have a situation, which I do not think anybody in this House wants to see, where costs will become prohibitive because of delays in planning appeals.  While the Minister has the control, as he has at the moment, it is possible to make representations.  One can put down a question or put some other political pressure on.  In the case of a board, as is suggested here, that control is gone as we have seen happen with the semi-State bodies.  I would like to see some limit, be it four months, five months or any number of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy wants to provide for bringing the board to the High Court and the Court saying: &ldquo;Give us fair reason why you have not given a decision.&rdquo;  The Minister has a reasonable approach to this particular problem.  I know that of my own personal knowledge of decisions he has made over the past two years. I know he is sympathetic.  I would ask the Minister to accept the principle of what is suggested and I would ask him to bring in his own amendment <Col N="1422" /> incorporating the ideas put forward by his colleague, Deputy O'Brien, and also Deputy Molloy.  I know from personal experience the Minister is acutely aware of the problem because he has spoken about it and said: &ldquo;For God's sake, do not be sending me appeals.  Make decisions in the local authorities.&rdquo;  I know he has been churning appeals out rapidly. We can talk to him but we cannot talk to a board.  That is why we want this amendment.</P>

      <P>The reason I believe why so many appeals are now coming before the Department of Local Government is because the time limit for the planning authorities at local level is too short.  This may seem a strange thing for a county councillor to say.  We are under pressure all the time to have planning applications dealt with.  If a short <Col N="1423" /> period was put on this board to deal with appeals, if the amendments were acceptable or if the Minister decided to lengthen that period to, say, six months or even a year, then we would put pressure on the board to make the decision.  As Deputy Haughey says, when they could not make up their minds they would refuse it.  I believe some local authorities are now doing this because of the two-month period which they have to decide on planning applications. The Minister should consider lengthening this period to local authorities to make it a three-month period.  He may then lighten the burden of this in-coming board.  Most local authorities and people who are used to making applications would welcome such a decision to lengthen the time for deciding such decisions at local level.  I would like to see the Minister put a limit on the decisions by the board.  If they cannot come to a decision within a period they should issue a very sound reason as to why they cannot make a decision.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that many applicants, particularly those making application for single houses or small developments&mdash;there have been many cases in the past where the person wishing to build a house has gone to the trouble and expense of securing a site and put a substantial deposit on a site&mdash;but by the time that the application is heard, is refused by the local authority, then judged on by the Department of Local Government, costs have gone up so much that many applicants cannot go ahead with their developments.  I know a person who has his house half built but has to sell the property because he is unable to meet the costs.  This application was first made over three years ago.  I appeal to the Minister to have another look at this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I might suggest my Parliamentary Secretary who deals with most of these problems.  If the Deputy considers a productivity bonus for him I am sure he would not object.  I was interested in Deputy Burke's comments about the frivolous appeals.  In this Bill I attempted to do something very definite with what I considered to be frivolous appeals. Deputies on the opposite benches were very noisy about the fact that I was trying to take away people's rights.  It was the pre-Faulkner period. Deputy Faulkner is not to blame for it but the Dáil Debate will show there was a lot about taking away the rights of the individual who wanted to make the appeal.  Some organisations outside this House joined in the noise and said that I was trying to do something which was undemocratic, as if I would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that I was not able to do what I would like to do.  Deputy Burke is right when he says that a lot of third party appeals which come before the Department of Local Government and the new board are sent in by people who simply do it to spite the neighbour.  There are a number of genuine appeals.  There have been cases of genuine appeals where people were imposed on by the neighbours attempting to build structures which should not have been <Col N="1425" /> allowed.  A number of appeals are sent in by people who have no connection with the area in which they live and one wonders what kind of mentality is behind the person who sets out an appeal and may ask for an oral hearing. There is on record a person who asked for four oral hearings over a couple of years and did not even have the courtesy to turn up and could not be refused the right to have an oral hearing.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke knows a lot about this particular one so I will not go any further.  The facts are that I would like to do something with the people who sent in frivolous appeals. The House would not allow me to do what I wanted to do with them so we will have to leave them to the mercy of the board.  I would like to see a quick decision given by the board.  I had a legal friend who was for a period a member of the House.  He is dead now.  Anytime he asked for something to be done and I asked: &ldquo;When do you want it done?&rdquo; his reply was always &ldquo;yesterday&rdquo;.  People putting in planning appeals always want the decision out before the appeal is in properly, and that is only natural.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the of them would prefer to get a quick reasonable decision.  Even though I have sympathy with those who feel that there should be some way of ensuring a decision is given fairly quickly I do not think it is possible to put a time limit on the new board.  It would be unfair to them.  The board will be a pretty high powered one. Very eminent people, I hope, will constitute the board.  I hope there will be an early decision obtained.  I believe we will get what we are looking for, and that is fairly quick decisions from them.  For that reason I could not accept the amendments.  I <Col N="1426" /> am glad that the Deputies have agreed to withdraw them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 46.</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Board shall have an absolute discretion to extend the time for making an appeal under this Act (other than an appeal to a court).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Some time ago we were discussing Deputy's Haughey's amendment No. 44.  He said that if there was disruption in the postal deliveries services an extension of the appeal time should be allowed.  The Minister argued against that on the ground that the amendment put down by Deputy Haughey was not specific.  I would suggest to the Minister that amendment No. 46 in my name is very specific.  It specifically gives discretion to the members of the board to decide to extend an appeal time.  I think the Minister will agree with me that a person making a third party appeal does not receive notification of the grant of decision.  It is only the applicant who is given that information.  There is the possibility that this information regarding the decision may not filter back to third party interests as quickly as it does to an applicant who receives a notification by post directly from the planning authority, and he, having only 21 days within which to make an appeal, quite a number of those days may have passed before he discovers that the decision had been made. Cases of hardship or cases of very great importance could arise where an appeal should have been allowed. I would have sufficient faith and trust in this board to allow them that much power and discretion, that where a case could be justified for an extension that they would have the right to grant that extension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is talking about and I am not quite sure he knows himself what he is talking about.  He started off originally by talking about extending the time for appeal and he talked about the islands.  Then he went in on Deputy Haughey's amendment with a different one.  Then he proceeded along to this one.  If I read this amendment correctly it is: The board shall have an absolute discretion to extend the time for making an appeal under this Act (other than an appeal to a court).&rdquo;  This would appear to me to be a suggestion that despite the fact that it was agreed to withdraw the other amendments and, therefore, the House have agreed that they should not be put in and I have agreed to have a look at a particular <Col N="1428" /> section which Deputy Haughey and other members mentioned.  What Deputy Molloy suggests now is that irrespective of that, for any reason at all the board can in spite of the fact that a grant of permission may have been given, at any time decide that they will hear an appeal, let it be a week after, a month after, any time. Somebody then who has got permission to build a house or to build a factory and has started to do the work and is in the process of doing it suddenly finds that the board has decided to grant an appeal against that after the grant of permission has been confirmed.  Deputy Molloy does not see one thing wrong with it.  I wonder does he know himself what exactly he is arguing about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the last person who should ask me whether I know what I am arguing about, because several times during the course of this debate the paucity of the Minister's knowledge of the Planning Act has been exposed here.  The Minister has just now made another statement which I contend is not accurate, that a third party interested in a decision of a local authority on a planning application is entitled, under the law, to notification of that decision at the same time as the applicant himself is notified under the law by the local authority.  The Minister knows that that is not so. When I asked him just now to state the law he changed his footing and said that it was the practice, and then the Minister went on to talk about other things which we were not dealing with and which he was not questioned on here.  If what I said originally is, in fact, not true, and if the Minister can quote the law which proves that what I say is wrong then I will withdraw the amendment straight away.  Although even excluding that particular example of a third party interest I think that the argument to grant the discretion to the board to extend the appeal time is meeting the type of argument which we have been making on previous amendments which the Minister has not accepted so far and where I with-drew it but expressing my disappointment <Col N="1429" /> that the Minister was not accepting it.  It was not withdrawn on the basis that the House did not agree, it was withdrawn on the basis that the Minister would not accept it. Let us not twist words&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The way to prove whether the House agrees or not is to call a vote.  Then we will see.  As far as I am concerned the Deputy with-drew his amendment because of the fact that he could not carry it in this House.  Those are the facts.  Therefore the House did not agree with the amendment.  Do not let us try to cod ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not children. We can all count.  We all know that when put to the pinch the Minister has more votes than we have.  If he had not he would not be where he is. So there is no point in arguing on that toss.  We, by the weight of our arguments and through the weight of common sense, are appealing here in debate for the Minister to see reason and to accept amendments that we have put forward.  In fairness, I would say the majority of the amendments that Deputy Haughey and myself have put down on this Bill have been accepted or we have been promised that they will be seriously reviewed by the Minister and that he will consider bringing forward similar type amendments on Report Stage. That is the position.  So the Minister has been agreeing with most of the arguments that we have been making, and if we get that type of assurance that he will consider it again before Report Stage we will not press it to a vote.  There is not much point in our pressing every amendment to a vote when we know that we are going to rattle out a majority for the Minister's side.  We are here to argue it and to deal with it in an adult fashion.  The Minister did not seem to be aware, until I brought it up, that third party interests are not notified under the law, and possibly if the Minister would agree to put in a section giving them the right to information at the same time as the applicant from a planning authority it might meet part of the argument <Col N="1430" /> that I am making.  I would ask the Minister to say whether I am right or wrong.  So far he has shown very little knowledge in his Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister agreed earlier on to think about the amendment that was put forward.  Admittedly he stated that this was not to suggest that he was going to accept it or that he was going to put forward anything to replace it.  Nevertheless, he did feel that the arguments put forward were of the calibre which would induce him to agree to reconsider the situation.</P>
      <P>The various amendments, the ones which were withdrawn and the one he has agreed to reconsider and this one, are basically to try to ensure that the rights of the citizens well be protected in relation to the planning laws.  I think the Minister will find himself in a bit of a quandary in relation to the case he made earlier when he said that the board might do certain things.  It might decide after a number of months to agree to an appeal and so on.  The Minister did say, and I would accept it, that it was hoped and intended that the board would be comprised of responsible people.  I would assume that a board of this kind would not agree to extend the time for appeals which were quite obviously vexatious.  In those circumstances, and taking it that the board would be a responsible board and would deal responsibly with the matters that came before it, surely we could accept that they would use the powers conferred on them by this particular subsection in a responsible way and that they would simply use this discretion when they felt that the rights of a citizen were not safeguarded, and that it would be only in these circumstances that they would take a decision under this amendment.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that perhaps in considering the amendment put down by Deputy Haughey he would consider this in conjunction with it.  Perhaps in relation to both he might come up with something which would cover the points made on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>On 7th April, 1971, a circular was sent to all the planning authorities and also to each city and county engineer.  It contained two paragraphs dealing with the question of notification.  The Minister at that time was Deputy Molloy.  The first one is that:</P>
      <P>The Minister considers it only equitable that objectors to applications before the planning authority should also be given the opportunity, if they so desire, of objecting to him if the decision of the planning authority is appealed to him.</P>
      <P>The last paragraph states:</P>
      <P>The Minister also requests any planning authority which does not at present do so to inform the objectors of the nature of the decision made by the planning authority at the time it is made and also to inform them of the statutory time limit for appeals.  This information should in accordance with the Commission regulations be included as a standard part of the notification of the decision of the planning authority.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Molloy will agree that that should have ensured that what he thinks should now be done is at present being done and has been done since 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that that circular is law, that it gives an absolute right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This circular was sent out under Deputy Molloy's instructions in April, 1971.  If I sent out an instruction to a city or county manager now I would expect it to be obeyed and if Deputy Molloy did not take steps to see that his circular was obeyed that was his hard luck.  Deputy Faulkner has been talking about the right of people to appeal and that having decided to consider Deputy Haughey's amendment, although I did not say I was going to bring one in, I was accepting that there was some merit in it.  In fact, this amendment, if accepted, throws the whole question of appeals right open.  What Deputy Molloy's amendment is trying <Col N="1432" /> to do is to give the board at any time the right to accept an appeal.  As I said before and as Deputy Faulkner says, the people on the planning board will be of the highest calibre but if we include a section like this in an Act of Parliament we are inviting them to do something which they are legally entitled to do.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that they should be legally entitled to accept an appeal after the statutory period with reservation on the particular item with which Deputy Haughey's amendment deals.  Apart from that, if we do this we are leaving the whole situation wide open.  I think that it would be desperately unfair to people who, having applied for planning permission, have been notified by the local authority that it is intended to give them that planning permission at the end of two months and at the end of a further month they are notified that planning permission has been given, that then at a later stage after they have involved themselves in a considerable amount of expense, somebody should appeal and for some reason or other it was decided that it was right that their appeal be accepted and they would have to go through the whole process.  I do not think it would be right and I am not prepared to accept it.</P>
      <P>There was a reference made by Deputy Haughey to the amount of time which should be given.  He suggested that local authorities should have a longer period than two months.  I do not think they should. In a case where a decision is being given, I do not think it is right that a local authority should wait until the last couple of days of the two months to write an innocuous letter to the applicant in order to extend the period, which they can do and which, unfortunately, some of them do.  I do not think there should be any extension on that.  I could not in conscience accept the amendment.  It would undo the whole point we are raising in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify one point.  The circular referred to by the Minister which was issued by me <Col N="1433" /> in 1971 established a practice that a person other than an applicant for planning permission would be given notification of the decision at the same time as the applicant.  It does not give such a person an entitlement in law to that notification.  If by some chance a local authority planning office does not notify a person other than an applicant of a decision to grant permission that is just that person's hard luck.  He cannot challenge in court the non-compliance with the law of the planning authority in that instance because the law does not require him to do it.  The Minister cannot cover that up.  It was an omission from the original Act which it was tried to amend through that circular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circular attempted to amend it by establishing a practice but not granting legal entitlement to such notification.  If the local authority is dilatory in complying with that request from the Minister&mdash;because that is all it is&mdash;the person other than the applicant can be deprived of his right to make an appeal because the 21-day period can elapse.  To give an example of the type of situation where my amendment might apply: where a local authority had not complied with the request in the circular from the Minister to notify a person of a decision, and if the three-weeks' period elapsed and the person became aware that development was beginning but that he was not notified and that a decision had been made, his right to appeal would be lost.  The fault would lie with the local authority because it was due to their omission in sending a notice.  That person has no entitlement in law to prosecute any person against the failure to comply with the law because it was not provided for.  In such a case, where due to a lapse on the part of the planning authority a person found himself in this position, I would suggest that the board should have the discretion to grant an extension to enable that person to lodge his appeal.  It is another form of granting an extension to the period of time for an appeal.  I ask the Minister to give an assurance that he would provide <Col N="1434" /> in an amendment on Report Stage which would give a legal entitlement to a person other than an applicant to information from a planning authority at the time a decision was issuing on an application.  Similar notification should be sent as is sent to the applicant himself.  If the Minister would give such an assurance it would meet the point I am arguing here but as he does not intend to accept this amendment, I withdraw it but would ask him to consider, rather than relying on this circular and this established practice, incorporating it into this Bill now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>The trouble with Deputy Molloy is as an old colleague of his said to me some time ago that he will never learn.  I quoted the circular which had issued under his direction. I shall now quote portion of the Act which might surprise him.  Section 25 (2) (f) of the 1963 Act states that the Minister shall by regulation provide for requiring planning authorities to furnish to the Minister and to any other specified person any specified information with respect to any application and the manner in which they have been dealt with.  It would be possible for the then Minister if he was as interested then as he is now to safeguard these persons' rights to have made a regulation which would require the planning authorities to supply the information.  He did not do so.  He now waxes eloquent at my failure to include in the new Bill something which is already contained in the parent Act and which will cover this.  When I am making regulations on this particular Bill I will ensure that there will be no slip up.</P>

      <P>I did not say that I did not agree with him.  An application for <i>mandamus</i> from an ordinary citizen who erects a garage or porch <Col N="1436" /> is very expensive.

      <P>If the Minister thinks that a time limit on the board, whatever length it might be, would be too restrictive, perhaps he would devise some procedure whereby a person who could not get a decision from the board, could do something reasonably inexpensive about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly there might be something in that.  But to impose a time limit of two or four months would be a cod.  If we grant eight months, ten months or 12 months, people would object to such a length of time.  We are caught between the two.  We are establishing a norm with the higher one rather than the lower one.  I agree that we should make every effort to ensure that there is no delay.  If the board are not doing their work they can be suspended.</P>

      <P>I will endeavour to ensure that the board will come to a decision as quickly as possible.  This has been the whole idea.  A method that was too simple might be worse than having no provision at all.  We are dealing with a very important board taking very important decisions. That is why I assume the right of <i>order mandamus</i> was included in the 1963 Act.  It was realised how important it was.  Deputy Haughey is correct in saying that this is an expensive procedure.  I will endeavour to ensure that there will be no undue delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 45 and 46, before section 21, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;21.&mdash;Where in connection with either the performance by the Minister of any of the functions assigned to him under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1974, or the performance by the Board of its functions an inspection is carried out or an oral hearing is conducted on behalf of the Minister or the Board, as the case may be, by a person appointed for the purpose by the Minister or the Board, the person so appointed shall make to the Minister or the Board, as may be appropriate, a report on the inspection or hearing, as the case <Col N="1438" /> may be, and shall include in his report a recommendation relating to the matter with which the inspection or hearing was concerned, and the Minister or the Board as may be appropriate, shall, before determining the matter in relation to which the inspection was carried out or the hearing was conducted, consider the report (including any recommendation contained therein).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment makes more specific provision for the matter which, under section 18 (1) (b) of the Bill, would have been dealt with by regulations. Section 18 (1) (b) has already been altered by amendment No. 38.  The purpose of the new section is to provide that, not only should reports on oral hearings be submitted to and considered by the board or the Minister as appropriate, but to make it clear that such reports may include a recommendation and that such recommendation may also be considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister is referred to in the new section because there may still be occasional oral hearings in connection with the closure of public rights of way and, when the building regulations come into operation, there may be appeals where a planning authority refuses to dispense with or relax requirements. That is section 33 (f) of the Bill.  It appears complicated but it is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment to amendment No. 47:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> To add to the proposed new section the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Such report and recommendation together with the transcript of evidence at any ordinary hearing, which may have been held, shall become as soon as may be a matter of public record at the headquarters of the Board.  Copies of same shall be available upon 14 days' written notice at a charge of 50p.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The intention behind that amendment is that the public and the appellant and any other interested party should have from this board a statement which would indicate the reasons why they arrived at a certain decision.  One part of my amendment suggests that this report, which is referred to and which is a necessary document before the board or the Minister can make a decision, is an absolutely essential requirement. Before the Minister at present&mdash;or the board in the future&mdash; can arrive at a decision on a planning appeal he must take into consideration the report of the inspector who attended the hearing, or who wrote the report, or who dealt with the application if it was not an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that when the board is established that report should be made available, and the recommendations contained in it should be made available, and also that the transcript of any evidence taken at an oral hearing should be made available.  This has been an area of great contention. There have been court cases querying the transcripts of evidence which the Minister has taken into consideration in arriving at appeal decisions.  The courts have directed, in certain cases, that the files in the planning section of the Department should be made available to those who brought the case before the court for their perusal so that they could satisfy themselves whether, in fact, the evidence given at the hearing was properly considered in the report put before the Minister and properly considered by him before arriving at a decision.</P>
    <P>This will be an autonomous board. <Col N="1440" /> It has been called a faceless persons board.  Anyway its accessibility to the public is nil.  I should like the Minister to let us know whether he would favour this board being obliged to make these reports and recommendations and the transcripts of evidence available.  If my amendment is going too far, if the Minister feels it is going too far and requiring too much, then I would put it to the Minister that the main point I am getting at is that we should have statements giving the reasons why the board arrived at certain decisions.  At present the Minister makes decisions and he gives reasons. They are short, concise and fairly traditional now.</P>
    <P>There is a set pattern of words used to meet groups of situations and they do not, in the main, relate to any specifics which were taken into consideration in the cases.  They do in some cases but, generally speaking, a kind of formula of words has now been latched on to which is not very meaningful to any person trying to find out the real thinking behind the decision to grant or to refuse.</P>
    <P>The court's decision which gives the public the right of access to these documents is establishing a new principle&mdash;possibly not a new principle as such, but it certainly is establishing a new precedent, in as much as this has only happened in recent years.  These documents are not generally available otherwise.  If the public are to obtain access to them, they must go to the expense of a court case and all that that involves.  Rather than placing that obligation on the community, and its expense, if these documents are available, I believe the public are entitled to them.  I do not see why they should be secret.</P>
    <P>I believe&mdash;I have not any great evidence of this; I have not any knowledge of it&mdash;that the planning appeals system in Britain gives much greater background information regarding the decision arrived at than is given here. I would be anxious to achieve something better than what we have put up with up to now.  We operated it.  The Minister is operating it.  I am suggesting that when this is handed over to a board we will be looking for reasons <Col N="1441" /> which will satisfy us to a much greater extent because of the facelessness of the board and the non-accessibility to them.  If the board are to gain acceptance, I think they should be obliged to report to the community on the decisions they are arriving at.</P>

      <P>Both amendments have been put before the House and I wish to speak on the Minister's amendment.  I shall be brief.  The Minister has assured me that this textural change will be made in the third line which will now read:</P>
      <P>Government Planning and Development Act, 1963 and 1975.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with that but the Minister's amendment must include the words &ldquo;in writing&rdquo; after &ldquo;a report&rdquo; where it occurs.  It would be ludicrous if the inspector, or whoever is involved, could satisfy the terms of this section by making a verbal report. Would the Minister accept that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is a slight complication and I think Deputy Haughey will be prepared to accept the explanation I shall give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been so much discussion, argument and litigation about the question of these reports, that it would be futile to have this section at all.  It is a very good section but the reports must be in writing.  It would be useless to insist on these inspectors making reports if they can be made verbally.  We all know what confusion and chaos can arise over verbal reports.</P>

I shall look at the matter <Col N="1443" /> and if I can I will put in what Deputy Haughey suggests for Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the people who are making the decision must give, in writing, their reason for making that decision and, therefore, if there is a report, even orally, they would have to refer to what the report was.</P>

      <P>That is a tangled argument.  We will not make a fuss <Col N="1444" /> about it but I think the Minister, on reflection, will agree that in this day and age, if he is going to compel inspectors to make a report to a board, he obviously has some very good reason for compelling that report to be made and is insisting that the board must consider that report before they come to the decision.  It is a very good point that is enshrined in the new section but it will not have any effect whatsoever unless the Minister insists that it be in writing.</P>

    <P>With regard to Deputy Molloy's amendment, I should like to point out that section 18 (1) as amended by amendment 38 enables regulations to be made providing for an oral hearing to be conducted by a person appointed for that purpose by the board.  The new <Col N="1445" /> section inserted by amendment No. 47 provides that the person so appointed shall make a report to the board.  That is what Deputy Haughey is talking about.  The Deputy wants this report and the transcript of evidence to be available publicly.  So far as the report is concerned, the fact is that if it were to be available publicly this would be bound to influence persons making such a report.  They would be looking over their shoulder when they were making it as to what they should put into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The fee paid to them covers only the presentation of a single copy to the Minister.  There are complications here.  The practice has been to refer a person who wished to have a copy of the transcript to the note-taker and suggest that he might make arrangements to get a copy at a fee to be arranged.  The Department have been prepared to make copies available at a suitable charge relating to the cost of producing the copies.  Some of the cases have had over 700 pages. Some of the public who talk so much about the fact that the transcript should be available do not seem to understand what is involved.</P>
      <P>I suggest there is no need for any change in the position about transcripts. The Deputy's proposal would create difficulty in engaging and in paying note takers and would mean that increased costs would fall on public funds.  A fee of 50p was suggested as the price that should be paid but this would not cover even the cost of the paper and I am sure Deputy Molloy is aware of that.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 48 in the name of the Minister has already been discussed but there is an amendment to the amendment by Deputy Molloy.  Perhaps the Minister would formally move amendment No. 48 and Deputy Molloy could move the amendment to deal with the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 45 and 46, before section 21, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;22.&mdash;(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Principal Act, a planning authority in considering,</P>
      <P> (a)  an application for a permission under section 26 or 27 of that Act,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> (b)  whether or not it is expedient to serve a notice under section 30, 31, 32, 33 or 35 of that Act.</P>
    <P>(c)  whether or not to serve a notice under section 36 or 37 of that Act. </P>
    <P>may, if they think fit, have regard to either or both of the following, namely,</P>
    <P> (i)  the probable effect which a particular decision by them on the matter would have on any place which is not within, or on any area which is outside, their area, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  any other consideration relating to development outside their area. </P>
    <P>(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Principal Act, the Board in considering an appeal brought under section 26, 27, 30, 33, 36 or 37 of that Act may, if it thinks fit, have regard to either or both of the following namely,</P>
    <P> (a)  the probable effect which a particular decision by it on the matter would have on any place which is not within, or on any area which is outside, the area of the relevant planning authority, and</P>
    <P>(b)  any other consideration relating to development outside the area of that authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment to amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), ninth line, to delete &ldquo;may, if they think fit&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's amendment is suggesting that the planning authority take into consideration factors which they deem are appropriate even though they may not be within that planning authority's area.  The words used are that they may do this if they think fit.  I think they should do it in all cases.  It may be just a play on words and may not be of very great significance but I put in this amendment to oblige planning authorities <Col N="1449" /> always to take into consideration relevant factors in an adjoining area. I think the obligation should always be on them to do so.  It is not very important and perhaps the Minister will see no difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have the effect of replacing a flexible enabling power by an inflexible mandatory provision applying in all cases.  Cases could arise where it would not be appropriate for a planning authority in considering an application to have regard to considerations relating to developments outside their own area.  Under the amendment there are thousands of cases where, even though a particular decision would have no effect on a place outside their area, the planning authority would have to go through the motions of considering this aspect.  Apart from this, the substitution of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in subsection (1)  would require consequential changes in other subsections.  Leaving that aside, what is intended is that they will do it if necessary and will have an enabling power if they think fit to allow them to do it.  It would be ridiculous to say that they must do it, which is what Deputy Molloy is suggesting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine they would but, just in case some local authority might say &ldquo;that is our responsibility and you do not have to take it into consideration&rdquo;&mdash;you wrote down that they should, if they consider it necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Minister brought forward this provision <Col N="1450" /> at all means that he does regard it as important, that a planning authority should have regard to areas outside their own and perhaps to environment considerations.  The mere fact that the Minister brought it forward at all indicates that he attributes significance and importance to it. Therefore, I think it should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's heart bleeds for me but I will sleep tonight all the same.  The position which is brought about by saying: &ldquo;If they think fit&rdquo; means that, when a local authority is making a decision, knowing that they should do this, if it affects them: &ldquo;if they think fit&rdquo; they can do it.  If it was not mentioned they could go on gaily.</P>
