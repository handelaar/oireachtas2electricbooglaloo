    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>

      <P>Before I reported progress a question was asked about silage pits and if they would be exempted and the answer was given, although Deputy Colley would not agree with it, that they would be if they were inside the acre.  The point I was making was that this is not possible because of pollution, that this type of silage pit had to be kept away from the main premises and would not be within the acre and that some of them are very costly.  Even a rather small one can cost up to £20,000.  What I wanted to know was were they excluded if they were outside the acre surrounding the house.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to explain that the Minister for Finance is engaged in the Seanad today and I am standing in for him.  I note the point raised by Deputy Callanan in respect of a silage pit and he inquires whether the <Col N="1826" /> silage pit would be exempt if it were situated on the acre of land which is being exempted.  With all due respect, this particular point might be more appropriately dealt with on the section because amendment 19 extends to farm machinery, moveable machinery, I take it, the benefit of the 50 per cent reduction.  Perhaps we could leave the discussion on the silage pit until we come to the section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19a:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 25, after subsection (1) (b) (iii) to add:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that, in this paragraph, references to an individual shall be deemed to include references to a trading company controlled by that individual in accordance with section 9 (2) (a) (i)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to extend the benefits of the section in relation to agricultural land and farm machinery, in relation to fishing boats and in relation to hotel premises as defined in the section&mdash;to extend that to a trading company controlled by an individual or his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section is drafted these benefits apply only to the kind of property I have mentioned being in the possession of an individual.  The effect of this amendment would be to extend the benefits to what are, in effect, family trading companies, in other words, companies where the individual <Col N="1827" /> in question or he and his family control the trading company.  I want to suggest to the Minister that it does not make a great deal of sense to limit the benefit of the deductions that are involved to those properties in the possession of individual owners.  Individual private ownership is, of course, common but as the Minister will be aware, most businesses today of any size are incorporated.  It seems to me that the section, unamended, is really trying to put the clock back.</P>
    <P>Failure to accept this amendment could very effectively exclude most of the agricultural and hotel property and some fishing boats which might otherwise benefit under the section. The amendment seeks to give the same benefits where the property is held by a trading company controlled by an individual and his family as those given in the case of property held by an individual.</P>
    <P>It is relevant in considering this amendment to note that subsection (3) of this section gives a 20 per cent reduction in market value and a deduction of 80 per cent of the debts even to discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies about which the Minister has been rather scathing in earlier parts of the debate. The Minister may say that he has an amendment coming up, No. 21, which eases the position here, but the fact is that it is extremely limited in so far as, first of all, it applies only for three years and, secondly, it applies only to hotels and, thirdly, while it provides for a reduction in the valuation of 30 per cent, it provides for a debt deduction of only 70 per cent as against 80 per cent in the section as drafted.</P>
    <P>The basic question that arises on this amendment is, why discriminate in cases of this kind against the property where it is intended to be relief because it is held by a company controlled by the individual and/or his family?  Is there any good reason for this kind of different treatment?  I am not aware of it and, if there is not any, I would hope that the Minister would <Col N="1828" /> accept the amendment and make the benefit that it is proposed to give worthwhile.  There can be little doubt, in a large number of farms, that the benefits proposed by the section simply will not be available unless an amendment on these lines is accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of Deputy Colley I would make the following point: in the case of hotels, for instance, certain individuals in the history of hotels and tourist development in this country have made very substantial contributions by virtue of the fact that their energy, their foresight, the confidence they personally command has enabled them to develop an industry.  There have been cases where people have made a particular success of, say, even one hotel. In those cases a circumstance that possibly the Minister is overlooking, and understandably so, is that for good commercial reasons a person in that capacity may wish to avail of the benefits of the Companies Acts and to have the benefits of incorporation, and that the method of operation may be through a trading company.  In fact, I could think of alternative methods too, and Deputy Colley in the amendment has merely referred to section 9 (2) (a) (1).  But section 9 (2) refers to persons corporate or otherwise.  The Minister should ask himself the question, what is the purpose of his provision here?  The purpose appears to me to be&mdash;if I am wrong the Minister will say so&mdash;to give a certain benefit under subsection (1) in certain cases, but the cases referred to in paragraph 3 all refer to an individual, which in the whole context of this legislation means an ordinary person who is unincorporated, that is, an individual human being in the simple sense of the term.  The point that I am asking the Minister to consider is that in the normal course of business, for good <i>bona fide</i> business reasons, not at all for tax evasion&mdash;though I would of course be willing to listen to the administrative difficulties that might arise from the point of view of tax evasion, this side of the House has always been willing to do so&mdash;such an individual on the question of limited liability alone <Col N="1829" /> might wish to avail of the benefits of the Companies Act through the formation of a private company whether trading or non-trading.  If that is so because of the earlier provisions in the Acts which are primarily designed to defeat the use of the private company as a device for avoiding and evading taxation that normal business procedure is not liable to the individual in such a case as we are considering now, with a consequent disincentive.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley has in his amendment referred to a trading company. I would like in going through the principle to say that any of the persons referred to in paragraph 9 (2) if <i>bona fide</i> applied might be considered in this connection.  The reason for extending to a discretionary trust is simply that there can be, as Deputy Colley says, a family element, and a desirable family element, in this. Deputy Fitzpatrick knows the circumstances of business in this town.  He could add to a list that I myself could supply of family businesses where, in effect, the father and, say, the sons have developed into partners running the business extremely efficiently, giving the area which they serve a first-class service and who are not only contributing to the economic life of the community but are a model of hard work and of responsible citizenship minding their own business literally and in the more general sense.  In such cases it is often desirable to resort to the Companies Acts.  For that reason, although Deputy Colley mentions trading company here, I might ask the Minister to consider even non-trading company.  I would further ask the Minister to consider the possibility that in such a circumstance the device of a discretionary trust might come in because in a case like that there can always be one person who may be an exception and requires the device of a genuine discretionary trust.</P>
      <P>Recently I noticed a case where there was an exclusion of an individual in a certain case simply because he was making his own way and it was not required that he should be within the terms of the trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all these reasons, which I hope are serious and substantial reasons, I <Col N="1830" /> would ask the Minister to consider in paragraph (b) in connection with Deputy Colley's amendment the possible substitution of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; having regard to the meaning of section 9 instead of the word &ldquo;individual&rdquo; right through and, while supporting the amendment in the form in which it is, an Opposition is always willing to accommodate if the Minister is willing to meet.  I would strongly urge this approach on the Minister.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, other than a fear that we are making an opening for tax avoidance or something of that nature, I would suggest that the Minister seriously consider this amendment and accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Colley, particularly in the matter of farms and hotels which are private family concerns.  The vast majority of the hotels in the west were built by individuals who had perhaps two or three sons and the hotels later became co-operatives with nobody but the family concerned.  I and other western Deputies have been approached on this matter.  Wealth tax does not, at the moment, affect many people in the west but this matter does.  Co-operative farming is being encouraged at present.  Two brothers may come together and decide to form a company and work in co-operation.  It is grossly unfair if this amendment is not accepted.  I would like to add my voice to that of Deputy Colley.  I have been approached on behalf of a number of reasonably sized hotels which are being run by families as co-operative companies.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment and I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to it as it affects co-operative farming and private co-operative hotels.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In order that we may deal with this amendment and that we do not stray too far away from it, it is necessary that we see exactly what is involved here.  It deals with agricultural property, fishing boats, hotels and nothing else.  They have been given special treatment in regard to valuation in this section by deducting 50 <Col N="1831" /> per cent or £100,000 from the market value and taking the remainder as the value of the property.  In regard to the first category, agricultural property, we have given a very generous allowance by way of exemption.  First of all, the dwelling house and contents and an acre of land is exempted. Secondly, all livestock is exempted. Thirdly, the machinery, as distinct from the property, is taken at 50 per cent of its value.  In regard to individuals, I can accurately say that there has been no demand, in representations we have got, for the extension of this treatment to farms owned by companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am saying that we have not been pushed to give this extension.  I stand over that.  The reason is that very few genuine farms are run by incorporated companies.  When we come to the very big farm that might be incorporated, a farm worth £500,000 or more, it is more beneficial for such a big farm to rely on its 20 per cent than it is on the 50 per cent or £100,000.  Deputy Callanan has raised the point of people coming together and doing co-operative farming.  I do not know to what extent that is practised. Of course, if three brothers, say, decided to farm co-operatively and form a partnership instead of a limited company each of them would have a threshold of £70,000 or £100,000, as the case might be.  Each of them would enjoy the exemptions conferred by this section.</P>
      <P>Fishing boats are given the same treatment as agricultural land in the section.  My information is that there is no real problem in so far as fishing boats are concerned because it is not the practice for owners to form companies to operate the boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do concede that hotels, quite <Col N="1832" /> frequently, are run by limited companies and are incorporated for the purpose of running the hotels.  However, I am advised that it would not be practicable to extend the relief sought to hotels because there would be wholesale evasion.  I would ask the House to note that in the section the relief which is mentioned, that is, the £100,000 or 50 per cent, extends only to bedroom accommodation in hotels.  It is a limited part of hotels anyway.  Bars or lounges, public rooms, dining rooms and so on do not enjoy the benefit of the 50 per cent or £100,000.</P>
    <P>In the amendment which has been mentioned by Deputy Colley and which I propose to move later on, I am giving special treatment to hotels by giving a discount, reducing the value of the shares by 30 per cent. This reduction will go right across the board and apply to the garage as well as the bedroom, it will apply to the public bar which may be used more as a public bar than a hotel bar.  It gives, as I say, that generous reduction of 30 per cent.  I respectfully say to the House that viewed in this light there is no real necessity for this amendment bearing in mind that it deals with the three types of property I have mentioned&mdash;agricultural land, fishing boats and hotels.  There is virtually no problem in regard to agricultural land.</P>
    <P>The special reliefs in subsection (1) of this section are reserved for agricultural property, fishing boats and hotel premises as defined which are owned by individuals.  The amendment proposes to extend this relief to such property when it is in the ownership of a private trading company within the meaning of section 9, which is controlled by a husband, his wife and children or any one of these persons.  It is difficult to see how this amendment could be operated in practice.  A private trading company is not a taxable entity.  Its shares are liable to tax in the hands of individual shareholders. The value for tax is the market value of the shares from which is deducted 20 per cent relief for productive assets.  In valuing shares underlying <Col N="1833" /> assets are but one of the many elements which are taken into account in addition to the company's past history and future prospects, dividend records, liquidity and so on.  To isolate the whole or part of the underlying assets of the company from all the other constituents which go to make up the value of the share and then to apply a relief to these assets and have it reflected in the value of the shares would be virtually impossible.  Even where it would be possible it would present enormous valuation problems for both the public and the private sectors.  The fact of the matter is that relief from tax can only be given for property which is itself liable to tax since a trading company is not as such liable to tax, it is not possible to give relief to the underlying assets.  The amendment is, therefore, unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if the House looks at the position of subsection 1 in a practical way it will be seen that there is no real necessity for the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The net question is should the relief which is proposed to be given in the case of individuals be extended to the case where the property is held by a family trading company?  The major reason the Minister gives for not granting that in the case of hotels, where he admits it is of importance, is that it would not be practicable, though, he said at one stage it would lead to evasion.</P>
      <P>This is a question which arose on another amendment last night as to how to give effect to this kind of reduction in valuing shares.  We are told that this is not possible.  How is it that the Minister proposes to do it in his own amendment, No. 21?  I do not understand the reasoning behind this.  Amendment No. 21 deals with a trading company as the present amendment does.  It proposes to give a reduction of 30 per cent in the valuation of property and presumably that will have to be reflected in the shares.</P>

      <P>I am still somewhat mystified.  If the Minister's problem is that under the amendment we are discussing it is possible that a good deal of the assets of the company consist of property other than a hotel or whatever is mentioned in this section and therefore it could not be distinguished&mdash;if that is what his problem is, that is easily overcome by providing where the assets consist wholly or mainly of property as described in the subsection.  There is <Col N="1835" /> no great problem there.  The real question is whether the Minister is willing to do this.  He has demonstrated himself in amendment No. 21 that it is possible to do this.  Is the will there on the part of the Minister to give the same concessions in the case of family trading companies owning hotels?  Will he give the same concessions to them as he has given to an individual who owns a hotel? If the will is there the method is there.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that to grant this would lead to &ldquo;wholesale evasion&rdquo;. That is not clear to me.  Perhaps he could explain this to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I would like to support this amendment.  In these three subsections which apply to agriculture, fishing boats and hotels, the word &ldquo;individual&rdquo; is employed.  We all know of cases where family hotels were extended and it was necessary for them to form companies because the family was growing up and they had to distribute part of the assets to sons and daughters within the company. I cannot see where there is difficulty in applying this concession if we take the private trading company. Where a private trading company is comprised entirely of members of a family, say three sons or three daughters, why can the Minister not grant this concession?  Why does he victimise them because they have formed a private trading company? The Minister has stated that it is only part of the hotel that will be exempt. I agree with him on that.  Bedrooms in the hotels are the only part that are exempt.  As far as I know, the kitchens of hotels carry a greater capital investment than other parts of a hotel.  Why that particular section of the business was not brought in I do not understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of fishing boats we know what a small fishing boat cost in the past but we can imagine what the capital investment will be in larger fishing boats, which are necessary if we are to compete against European fishing trawlers in the <Col N="1836" /> future.  That type of investment will undoubtedly be formed into a company. There will be huge capital investment in this, as much as any large hotel.  I would not be surprised if grants were given in the future and companies formed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably more aware of this than I am.  I would not be at all surprised if grants were given on these lines and these could very well be formed into companies' fishing boats.  Many fishing boats will fall into the hands of companies.  It will develop along that line.</P>
    <P>These are the points we must consider when we are legislating for the future.  We are not legislating for the past as to what the units will be.  We certainly must look to the future and see how these units are going to develop.  Private trading companies are being formed every day.  They are being formed for various reasons, especially within the family circle. When some members of the family are getting married, it is not possible to allocate a particular portion to each of them and a private trading company is formed where the profits can be allocated.  Surely in that type of situation where a family must form this type of a company they are entitled to this concession the same as an individual who is lucky enough to be able to keep it in his own right. We know the hotel business will involve an enormous amount of capital in the future.  It would be nothing unusual for two individuals&mdash;let it be farmers, or any other type of trader or professional man&mdash;to come together, as they have done in the past, and pool their assets, pool their wealth and go into the hotel business.  Surely on an occasion such as that they should be entitled to the same concessions. I cannot see why it presents an administrative difficulty and where there could be any evasion in the type of cases I have outlined.</P>
    <P>As I said on the Capital Gains Tax Bill and this Wealth Tax Bill, the Minister is visualising a way out for somebody who is devising a scheme to evade wealth tax.  You will always get a person like that and 1,000 years from now there will still be people <Col N="1837" /> who will be capable of doing that. We must make sure that we do not victimise the average genuine person who is interested in the particular type of industry and trade which the Minister has outlined in this subsection. We must ensure that this genuine person is not victimised because we are going after some smart alec who can employ professional people to get around this section.  I would prefer to let him off rather than to victimise decent people who are genuinely trying to carry on a business and trade well within the ambit of this subsection.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment will be coming up later.  It does not go far enough.  It is restricted to three years. I agree it is a small step in the right direction, but if Deputy Colley's amendment were accepted it would certainly restore confidence.  The Minister knows perfectly well that the major hotels, although within a family unit, are private trading companies. The Minister should look seriously at Deputy Colley's amendment because without it the section will inflict hardship within the family unit, although they are a trading company.  Those are the people I am concerned about in this section.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy de Valera put his finger on the matter when he asked a question in regard to entities which are taxable under the Bill.  I confirm that it is elementary in the Bill that only three entities are to be taxed, the individual, the discretionary trust, and the non-trading company.  That is why it is not possible to give exemption or to give special treatment to property in a trading company which is not a taxable entity.  I do not concede what Deputy Colley said in regard to amendment No. 21, which gives more general treatment to hotels.  I am not sorting out the property there.  What I am doing is giving more generous treatment to hotel shares.  I am not sorting out the property bit by bit and saying we will exempt this and we will not exempt that.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> For three years initially and, as the Deputy knows from his experience, these exemptions which are initially for three years have the happy knack of being extended.  The relief for agricultural land is intended solely for individual farmers domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State, and that object could be frustrated if the relief were extended to farmers in general.  I do not believe that would be the intention of Deputy Colley or the House.  The relief is also intended for genuine farmers and, apart from the fact that shareholders would not own the land, which of them could be regarded as genuine farmers?  If every shareholder in a farm or company were to be classed as a farmer the relief would be open to abuse.  Of course, consistent with the Land Acts if portions of the farm were held under different titles, under different folios, there would be nothing at all to prevent different companies being incorporated in respect of each folio and getting exemptions right across the board.  In that way the whole intention of the Act would be defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of farms are not incorporated.  Of the few that are, most would not qualify for the relief in subsection (1) anyway, either because they would not be genuine farmers, or because their agricultural property exceeds £500,000 in value. The 20 per cent relief against the value of the shares would be more beneficial to them.  Despite what Deputy Fitzpatrick says, the information available to me shows that the individual boat owners in the fishing industry whom this relief was intended <Col N="1839" /> to benefit do not incorporate their vessels.  That is factual.  That this is so is borne out by the fact that the matter has not been raised by the fishing industry.  That is the factual position at the moment.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> At the moment the question does not arise.  I have conceded that there remain the hotels.  I recognise that there is a different position there and for that reason, as I have said, I am dealing with it in amendment No. 21 which affords a more beneficial treatment to hotels than what is suggested here.  If the relief were extended to companies, the tax could be avoided. A farmer, for example, could set up more than one company to hold his land and get relief several times over.  As each company would be a separate legal entity complicated legislation would be required to make the companies aggregable.  Those are the simple facts.  I do not think there is any real complaint here.  We are dealing again with the three types of entities.  It is an exemption only extended to three types of property, and Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, although he knows that that is not so, overlooks it when he is making his argument.</P>

      <P>It is very interesting to hear the Minister making the case as to why this relief should be confined to the individual and the abuses which would creep in if it were allowed to be applied to a family trading company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall, I think it was last week, a discussion on a particular paragraph in a Schedule to the Capital Gains Tax Bill, where we sought to get relief in respect of interest payments for individuals and we were told from the <Col N="1840" /> other side of the House that it simply could not be done; it had to be confined to companies.  Everything was trotted out to show how it would be abused if it were not confined to companies. It could not be given to individuals. The Bill has passed both Houses of the Oireachtas with that provision in it.  Now we get the reverse situation.  I want to put it to the Minister this way. To make it as simple as possible let me take hotels alone, for which he admits there is a case.  If it were administratively possible, does the Minister see any reason, in principle, why the relief being given to individual hotel owners should not be extended to hotels which are in the ownership of family-controlled companies?</P>

If the position were that it could not be abused, could we get agreement from the Minister on the principle that it should be extended and that the same treatment should be given to the family owned hotel, owned through a family trading company, as is given to the individual?</P>

It is not necessary to do it in respect of boats.  It would not be practicable or possible to do it in respect of hotels for the reasons I have given, that you could have three companies operating the same hotel attempting to triplicate their reliefs and exemptions.

As an ordinary <Col N="1844" /> individual sitting here listening to the debate this strikes me very forcibly.  The Minister said this could not be given to hotels and that it was not feasible to give it to farms.  He said it would be discriminating against farmers by giving it to them on Deputy Colley's amendment.  Now if he gives a special rate and takes 30 per cent off the shares of hotels, is he not discriminating?  If he were to accept Deputy Colley's amendment on hotels the Minister says he would be discriminating against farms.  I agree with him.  There are very few farms involved.  What I am worried about is the tendency for smaller farms to do this type of thing.  There are numerous hotels involved.  Most of the hotels in the West of Ireland are family co-operative businesses.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (3), line 52, to delete &ldquo;stocks and&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;property consisting of stock or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is merely textual. Subsection (3) grants 20 per cent relief for productive assets.  The subsection opens by referring to property in the State which is used directly in the provision of employment in the State and stocks and shares.  Paragraph (a) then gives a deduction of 20 per cent from the market value of such properties. It is arguable that &ldquo;such property&rdquo; refers to property in the opening line and does not include stocks and shares.  Stocks and shares is a general term.  Where a single company is being referred to it is considered to be more correct to say &ldquo;stock or shares&rdquo; and the amendment, accordingly, also amends &ldquo;stocks&rdquo; to &ldquo;stock&rdquo;.  To remove any doubt &ldquo;property consisting of&rdquo; is being inserted before &ldquo;stock or shares&rdquo; so that such property in paragraph (a) refers both to property used in the provision of employment and property consisting of stock or shares of a trading company.  The reference in paragraph (b) to property will also refer to the two types of property.</P>

    <P>The question involved is, why not treat all productive assets equally? For example, why is a factory, which is giving employment, not as worthy of consideration as a farm, a hotel or a fishing boat?  Why should such a factory be saddled with heavier overheads?  That is the basic question that arises here.  The section purports to deal with productive assets but it deals in a different way with different kinds of productive assets.  As the Minister is well aware, our contention is that productive assets on which employment depends, on which growth depends, and on which we are all depending in order to get recovery in our economy, should not be subjected to wealth tax.</P>
    <P>Given that the Government have decided and voted to subject such productive assets to wealth tax, the question arises, why not treat them all the same way?  Why, in effect, say that such things as hotels, fishing boats, agricultural property and machinery should get greater relief than other productive assets such as factories, all of which are giving employment and all of which are important in the rehabilitation of our economy if we are to rehabilitate it?</P>

      <P>I want to speak in relation to one element under this section, namely, the farmer's part of it that gets the 50 per cent reduction in dealing with farm machinery and, basically, farm land.  I do not know whether it is generally known, but those who pretend to know something about agriculture, the investment in agriculture and, particularly, the return that comes from capital invested in agriculture, say&mdash;there is ample evidence to support this&mdash;that the return from capital invested in agriculture basically works out in the region of 2½ per cent to 3½ per cent. It is much lower than in any other type of business, when you take the capital and the return on the capital <Col N="1848" /> investment.  It would be arguing in reverse to adopt Deputy Colley's reasoning on this.  This is the thinking behind the special treatment given to farmers under this Bill.  There is another matter which should be borne in mind: that is, that basically speaking, in industry the turnover of one's working stock is far more rapid than it is in agriculture.  A man takes in livestock at the beginning of the year. He thinks for the whole year; in other words he does not turn over his stock so many times.  That underlines the fact that there is such a small percentage return from the total capital invested in agriculture.  That is the reason why the farmer objects to this treatment.  It is soundly based economics and very necessary having regard to the structure of Irish farming.</P>

      <P>I would like to disagree with Deputy Colley.  I speak for the hotels.  A survey was carried out for 1970 and 1971, which were reasonably good years for the hotel industry, by a firm of accountants in Dublin either for the Tourist Board or the Hotels Federation; I do not know which they did it for.  It showed that the average return on the capital invested was 1¼ per cent.  I feel that 30 per cent for three years is insufficient for the hotel industry. I am not speaking about hotels in the centre of the city.  I am speaking about hotels in general which bring in over £100 million a year.  If one were to take a public company, very often they pay out about 20 per cent of their profits and a certain amount of money is reserved for expansion, which is a good thing for employment. Shares in a public company get a 20 per cent knockdown.  Now a private trading company is going to get a 30 per cent knockdown.  We know what kind of a return people got from their investment in the CIE hotels which in 90 per cent of cases were built in seaside resorts or in a place like Killarney where there would be a seasonal trade.  There are none in the big city centres where there is a bigger profit and a better return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the farmer nor the hotelier, <Col N="1849" /> on average, is getting the same return as you would get in a factory.  Some factories do not make money, but generally people are not in the factory business unless they get a good return for their investment.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The amendment seeks to increase from 20 to 50 per cent the reduction in respect of property in the State which is used directly in the provision of employment in the State and of property consisting of stocks or shares of a trading company.  In order to assess the merits of the amendment we must bear in mind the type of tax we propose to impose, the thresholds which are available and the exemptions given.  Tax is being imposed at the rate of 1 per cent, but the effective rate on this type of assets of tax is always well below .80 per cent.  It is usually less than .70 per cent in respect of the type of assets that we are dealing with, productive assets on shares in trading companies.  The same applies with greater emphasis in regard to agricultural property where the effective tax is as low as .11 per cent, and hardly ever over .52 per cent, when account is taken of the exemptions and thresholds.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton raised specifically the question of hotels.  He appreciates that we have recognised the special position of hotels, the low return for money invested at the present.  We have dealt with them by giving a discount on shares of 30 per cent.  As the Bill stands, it is written into it for three years.  A case was made that the state of the hotel business due to a variety of reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I made the point yesterday that our approach to shares in trading companies is regarded by students in Great Britain and writers as an enlightened and a progressive move.  In the British proposals shares are valued at their full value.  There is no reduction given in respect of stocks and shares in trading companies.</P>
      <P>This is an innovation which equates stocks and shares in trading companies with the provision of employment. When we get a reaction like that from Britain where the tax is being considered and which is an industrial country, it is corroboration that what we have done is the right thing.  The amount of tax payable in relation to the value of the property is at a very low percentage.  It is 1 per cent written into the Bill but, as everybody knows, when you take into regard the exemptions, the thresholds and so on, the effective rate of tax is about a half of 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You hear appeals being made in regard to shareholders in companies and the case being made that the overheads of the company will be increased. That is the case made by Deputy Colley, but I do not accept that the overheads of trading companies are being increased by this Bill.  This Bill does not tax trading companies.  There can be no doubt about that.  I gave the example yesterday of a public company, Cement Roadstone, which is stated to have 11,300 shareholders.  Their concern with the amount of money they get in the form of dividends will not in any way affect the company.  Dividends of course are subject to income tax <Col N="1851" /> and always have been subject to income tax.  A case was never made that imposing income tax on shareholders in companies was in some way going to increase the overhead expenditure of the companies and prevent the investment of money into them.  Such a case has never been made.  It would not be realistic.  It would not stand up.  I put it to the House that you have the very same situation here. These shares will be valued.  The dividends from the shares are subject to income tax; the capital value of the shares will be subject to wealth tax, just as they were subject to death duties up to the present time.  The individuals we are talking about, the people who fall into the wealth tax category under existing law within the family, would have been subject to death duties at the rate of 41 per cent or more.  There is a threshold here of £100,000 in regard to wealth tax.  A person is not liable for wealth tax if he is married unless his taxable wealth exceeds £100,000.  He is then required to pay an annual amount which works out at about half of 1 per cent.  If that married man died last year and his property was passing to his widow, he would have to pay £41,000 or more.  That is the reality of the situation.  Nobody likes a new tax.  Nobody says &ldquo;well done&rdquo;&mdash; especially the people who pay it.  It is the business of the Opposition to point out to the general public that a new tax has been introduced.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Opposition not to misrepresent, not to create a false or misleading impression.  I believe that a fair study of the tax will prove that it is innocuous.  It is innocuous in the sense that it does not harm anybody.  It is part of a package&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;to relieve people from death duties.  The capital gains tax, the wealth tax and the capital acquisitions tax are all parts of a package to relieve people from death duties.  Until this package was brought in you had <Col N="1852" /> a situation where the pay-as-you-earn system of income tax was rigidly enforced, but capital gains could rocket and were completely exempt.  You had a savage imposition of death duties.  That is being improved.  You have a more equitable system of taxation overall.  To say that it is driving money and businesses out of the country is simply not correct.  I forgot to make the point yesterday when I was dealing with United States companies coming in here and when Deputy Colley and other Deputies said that this type of package we have introduced would chase them away, that a huge American company have announced the setting up of a factory in Mullingar in the last few days.  Presumably that company is well advised on taxation and has not been chased away.  I hope we will have more of these companies here because we want more of these companies.  We want more industry and employment here. I am convinced that the package, instead of being a hindrance, will be a help.  I pointed out&mdash;and I do not want to bore the House with it again &mdash;that in the Industrial Development Authority publication for circulation abroad one of the incentives they held out was that a system of capital taxation was being introduced but that death duties which ran to 55 per cent were being abolished.  I think that the exemption of 20 per cent right across the board on productive assets with a substantial recognition in the case of agricultural property and a big increase in respect of hotel company shares is adequate to meet the situation.</P>

      <P>The position is, as I see it now, that a public company can decide tomorrow to pay 5 per cent of its profits in dividends.  The person who is collecting the shares has a 20 per cent deduction in that 5 per cent of the profits and the rest stays with the company.  But a private trading company is not valued on its dividend at all; it is valued on the shares in the market; in other words, the profits, asset values and dividends do not come into it at all.  Nobody is interested too much in the dividends of a private trading company.  It is the profits and asset value we are <Col N="1854" /> working on.  In this position we have a public company treated preferentially because we are working on the dividend against working on profit and market value in a private trading company.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an appeal a little while ago from the Minister to the Opposition not to misrepresent the position, not to mislead the public and not to misrepresent the provisions of the Bill.  In the course of his remarks the Minister did all of those very things himself.  First of all, he talked about the effective rate of taxation under wealth tax.  I venture to suggest that the Minister did not take into account, and has consistently failed to take into account, the consequences in a private trading company of imposing the wealth tax, in particular in a private trading company where dividends and directors' fees have not been drawn for a number of years, as is not uncommon when the business is being built up.  The direct consequence of <Col N="1855" /> the imposition of wealth tax in such cases is that the cost of paying the wealth tax will have to come out of the company.  It is not just the rate of wealth tax, it is the income tax on it as well that comes out, and you get a rate which is well over twice the rate of wealth tax in such cases.  I venture to suggest that the Minister did not take that into account in arriving at what he says was the effective rate of tax.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Minister said that this was part of a package replacing death duties.  The fact of the matter is that the real replacement of death duties is capital acquisitions, inheritance tax and gift tax.  The amount of money that is estimated to be involved in the wealth tax is relatively small but the impact of it is quite large, and if the Minister wants to talk about death duties I suggest that he ought really to talk accurately about them.  He ought not to say that if a man died leaving property worth £100,000 passing to his widow the death duties payable would be £41,000.  That is not correct.</P>
      <P>The Minister made other statements in this regard which are, in my view, quite misleading as to the effect of this wealth tax.  The real question is that it is imposing a charge which has got to be paid by somebody.  It is quite useless for the Minister to talk about this in the case of trading companies not being imposed on the property but only on the shareholders, particularly in the case of private trading companies.  Where does the Minister think the money is going to come from?  How does he suggest that it is not going to add to the overheads of such companies?  It is quite illusory to suggest that this can come out of thin air or that it can come out of the pockets of the shareholders and not affect the operations of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that if the Minister wants to appeal to the Opposition not to misrepresent the position he might first attempt himself not to misrepresent the position and acknowledge that of course wealth tax is going to affect the businesses or the shareholders <Col N="1856" /> subjected to it.  The money has to come from somewhere.  It is going to impose higher overheads, and a very relevant question for the Minister to answer is why should one increase overheads of business at this time particularly.  The Minister talked about the fact that income tax is payable on dividends and so on.  Yes, it is, of course, and has been for many years because it is a form of income. If you tax income, if you tax inheritance and if you tax gifts, effectively you are then taxing all the methods by which a person can acquire money or property.  Wealth tax is a tax on too of that again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have said if you tax income, inheritance and gifts you are covering all the ways people can get property.  But the wealth tax is on top of that again, and I do not know if the Minister has yet recognised the significance of that fact.  To compare it with income tax on dividends suggests that he has not recognised the significance of what is involved in this wealth tax.  But I would again come back to what I proposed in this amendment, and that is that if you are going to give some productive assets relief to the extent of reducing the value of the assets by 50 per cent you should apply that to all productive assets.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Esmonde talk about it and confine his remarks to farms and say, correctly, that the return on investment in farming is very low.  Deputy Belton's contribution was largely on the basis, in so far as it related to the amendment, that the return on investment in hotels is very low, and at the end in passing he agreed with Deputy Esmonde that he thought the return in farming was low.  That was interesting, but it was particularly interesting to hear the Minister adopting this argument.  In other words the case being made for the special relief in the case of farming and hotels was that the return on investment is low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That special relief also applies to fishing boats.  Nobody said the return <Col N="1857" /> on fishing boat investment is low.  I cannot say at the moment whether it is high or low in relation to farming or hotels.  Let us assume even for the purpose of the argument that it is relatively low.  Has the Minister considered the implications of what he is saying, that is, that the impact of wealth tax should be related to the return, to the income?  This is totally inconsistent in a Bill which proposes to impose wealth tax where there is no return, where there is a loss, and which makes no provision for that. The only justification for that approach is that wealth tax is a tax on property, on assets without regard to the income from it.  Yet we hear the case being made by two Deputies and the Minister that the justification for special relief in these cases of farming, hotels, fishing boats, is a low return.  I wish the Government side would get their minds clear on what exactly they are trying to do in this wealth tax and what are the principles involved, if any, other than purely short-term political ones, designed to appeal to people who do not understand what is involved, people who are becoming fewer in number.</P>
    <P>If the Government benches believe in wealth tax in our circumstances in principle&mdash;personally I believe it is ridiculous&mdash;at least let them have some consistency in their approach.  To advance the argument that there is a low return on particular kinds of wealth as a reason for giving them special treatment is practical, but it is totally inconsistent with a Bill which proposes not to recognise a situation in which there is no return at all, but an actual loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I was telling the Minister.  The fact is that I am arguing that if there is any case for applying wealth tax to productive assets, and I do not think there is such a case, there is no case for applying in effect a lower rate of wealth tax to some productive assets than to others.  To do that you have to involve yourself in saying how productive they are.  If you are going to do that, then the approach in the section and in the amendments by the Minister does not do that either.  But, in fact, the basic principle in the Bill as shown by its various provisions is that it is a tax on assets and that it is not concerned with the return on investment, with the income of the owner of the assets.  Therefore, this whole approach that has been given from the other side has no relevance to what is done or what is required to be done here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come back to the simple proposition that is involved in this amendment, namely, if you must put wealth tax on productive assets and if you are going to give a 50 per cent relief in the case of some productive assets, why not give it to all productive assets on which jobs depend?  We can cloud the issue in all sorts of ways but that is what is in this amendment.  It simply <Col N="1859" /> says to delete 20 per cent and substitute 50 per cent.  That is what this amendment is seeking to do.  Unless the Minister is prepared to accept it, he is saying he is going to give 50 per cent relief to certain kinds of productive assets and 20 per cent to other kinds.  The basis at which he arrives at that conclusion has not been made at all clear, but in so far as there is any basis for it it is totally inconsistent with the other provisions of the Bill and with the alleged principles of wealth tax.  The Minister can have it one way or he can have it the other but he really cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not want it both ways.  What we propose doing, and what we are doing, is to give a relief of 20 per cent to all productive assets.  We recognise three special types of productive assets which are in a special category and which are well known and recognised as a high capital investment and low income return.  First is agricultural land and agricultural activity in general.  I am not going into that in detail because it is accepted that the net rate of return is very low there. The case was effectively made in regard to hotels falling into the same category at this time and we recognise that.  The third category are fishing boats which in addition to having low return, have also the hazards of the sea to contend with.  They are usually operated by owners, and they have the hazards of the sea to contend with and all the risks involved in fishing. Deputy Colley speaks of imposing a tax on a company that is not making money but is showing a loss.  If that is a trading company and if it is showing a genuine loss, the shares in that company will be valueless or very nearly valueless.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It will be taken into account and the <Col N="1860" /> losses will be taken into account.  If a privately-owned concern which is being run at a loss continues in this way the goodwill will disappear and the value of the shares will come down.  All those things are taken into account.  I want to repeat that the shares in a private trading company are liable to wealth tax only when the shareholder is in the wealth tax category.  That is the first point I want to make.  Even then, the wealth taxpayer has the thresholds and exemptions and reliefs and they will reduce the tax well below .80 per cent, as I have said.  The maximum effect of wealth tax on a private company arises when the company is owned exclusively by one person and he has no other property.  Take one such case where a person has shares in such a company valued for £500,000. He starts off by getting exemption of £100,000, reducing the net value for tax to £400,000.  Assuming he has other net personalty of £50,000, that leaves his total for tax at £450,000. He is asked to pay £3,500 on that.  His exempt property which would be reasonable, of £55,000, given his total wealth £605,000 and the percentage rate is .58 per cent.  I ask Deputy Colley is there any terror in that for anybody?</P>

      <P>Yes, it would.  I am talking of a private company now.  A £500,000 company is not a small company.  If that is liable to a tax of the order of £3,000, that is an outgoing from the person and having reference to sections 8 and 9 it would be a very fast acceleration towards liquidation.  That fact cannot be got away from.  It is a practical fact, not a legal one.  What the Minister is doing now is, in the case of any private trading company that gets into difficulties and is assessed to tax on its assets as it would be under sections 8 and 9, the imposition of tax regardless of the profit position on the assets would accelerate liquidation and would incidentally, if the company has any employment content at all, lead to unemployment.</P>

      <P>Does not the Minister understand that profitability is shown in the balance?  That applies to all companies.  It is pretty serious with some companies at the moment.  The assets situation is a situation which appears on the balance sheet irrespective of whether the company is floating, viable or not.  This is a question that came up last night, that the Minister for Finance should have regard to, that is, the present situation where there are a considerable number of companies whose profitability is in question perhaps for the next year or two years but whose assets as appearing in the balance sheet, their actual physical assets, including potential goodwill or leasehold values, can work out at a fairly substantial sum irrespective of whether that company is making a profit or not.  This can become quite serious in relation to the effect of wealth tax.</P>

All the other matters that have been raised have been largely obscuring what is involved in this amendment which is simply to give the same treatment to all productive assets.

The section proposes to give exemption of 20 per cent to all productive assets with 30 per cent for hotel companies but to recognise the special position of high capital low yielding businesses such as farms, hotels and boats.  What Deputy Colley wants us to do is not to give any preferential treatment to these special categories, to give special treatment right across the board, which I do not think would be fair.</P>

This amendment seeks to do away with the 80 per cent and to provide that all debts and encumbrances may be forgotten.  Why restrict the deduction of genuine debts at all?  It should be clearly remembered that we are dealing here with productive assets on which jobs and growth depend.  Just because in the case of these assets some concession, in this case, a 20 per cent reduction in valuation, is given in regard to the valuation of the assets is not, I would submit, any good reason for restricting the deduction of debts.  As I suggested in another context earlier, in effect this restriction on the deduction of debts is trying to take back with one hand what is being given with the other.  There should not be wealth tax on productive assets on which everybody's future depends. But, if we must have it let us at least give the most generous possible treatment to productive assets.  One way of assisting in giving generous <Col N="1868" /> treatment to productive assets, which are so important to all of us, is not to restrict the deduction of debts and encumbrances which may be made.  That is what this amendment seeks to do, to take away any restrictions and to allow all genuine debts and encumbrances to be deducted.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I understand that for all practical purposes this amendment was argued on the earlier amendments 18 (b) and 18 (c).  The effect of the amendment is to seek to allow 100 per cent debts against a property which is only valued at 80 per cent of its value for tax purposes.  The amendment is not acceptable and I regret that I must oppose it.  It is illogical, in the first instance, because we are only valuing the property concerned at 80 per cent of its value.  It would not be logical, therefore, to grant debts of 100 per cent as against that property.  If it were logical to do that it would be equally logical to allow debts in respect of property which was wholly exempt.  That has not been sought. We have provided in the Bill that where a person incurs an overdraft of £X,000 for the purpose of providing himself with a private residence that that overdraft will not be allowed as a debt, the logic behind that being that his private residence is not an asset for the purpose of the wealth tax and was not taxable.  We say that it would be therefore illogical to allow that debt to be taken into account against the rest of his wealth.  That, in another way, is what this amendment proposes to do.</P>
      <P>I can tell Deputy Colley that the attention of my advisers was drawn to this by outsiders, by people who are making representations in general. They pointed out that unless we dealt with this as we proposed to do we would be opening the way to avoidance.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I support Deputy Colley's amendment for one particular reason. The Minister has already stated that the property is valued at 80 per cent. A certain type of property, such as a hotel, may have considerable debts. <Col N="1869" /> The particular type of debts that I am talking about are not just sundry debts.  I am talking about builders' suppliers who give substantial credit to a hotelier to expand his business. This can be very expensive.  Surely this type of debt should be taken into consideration when we are discussing this section?  These are credits which may have been given over 12 months and be repayable over three or four years.  This is the type of credit one can get when one is operating on this scale.  Would the Minister not agree that in that type of situation a hotelier would be entitled to the 100 per cent claim on the debt?  There can also be debts for household supplies, timber or concrete or various other things. These should be allowed the 100 per cent.  The Minister is allowing only 80 per cent in that type of case.  Perhaps I am wrong on this; if so perhaps I can be put right.</P>

If there are no debts due and if there is the position that a man has sufficient wealth to build his hotel this will mitigate against the man who cannot afford to pay for the goods which I have in mind.  He is going to benefit as regards the valuation.  He will get a real reduction because he is only <Col N="1870" /> being valued at 80 per cent.  But the person who has to go into a builders' supplier and get 50 per cent of his materials and goods on credit, will carry these debts with him on valuation day.  The Minister is going to say to that man: &ldquo;Although I know you owe this money I am allowing you only 80 per cent of that debt.&rdquo;</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister can rest assured there are certain penalties imposed by suppliers for extensive credit.  The man in the situation visualised by me is being penalised for obtaining credit.  It is quite obvious that the man who has the funds at hand&mdash;these can be substantial; they are not trivial matters at all; they can run into £20,000 or £30,000, especially where a big hotel is being built.  It is unfair to penalise this particular person by not allowing him 100 per cent for this type of development.  At the same time, if the man has the money in capital, he is certainly benefiting by the Minister's section.  There is a lot of sense in Deputy Colley's amendment, and it should be looked at very closely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we have in the Minister's statement of his opposition to this amendment a typical bit of administrative thinking without adequate consideration of what the realities of the situation are likely to be, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said.  I say administrative thinking because it is the type of administrative logic that can lead to absurdity.  I will tell the <Col N="1871" /> Minister why I make a statement like that.  The statements I just made are not ones to be made unless there are good grounds for making them.  I hope there are good grounds for my making this one.</P>
      <P>First of all, let me take the Minister's false analogy with a residence. In the case of a residence, that is completely free of tax.  It is the same as the acquisition of any other asset.  Where an asset is being acquired with a benefit I quite agree with the Minister that to give an exemption of the debt acquired in purchasing would not be in the same category because what you are exempting is the asset once acquired, in the hands of the person, and if they were to acquire such an asset they can acquire it by purchase. I agree that it would be going too far to attempt to exempt the purchase price of that, although from another point of view the case could be made, but for the purpose of my argument I will admit the Minister's point there. That is a completely different matter. Here we have a case of a property the value of which is going to be adjusted by deduction of 20 per cent of the market value.  If it is a productive asset of a certain sort, which is used directly in the provision of employment, is the phrase used in the section, that by itself, if there was a simple asset that is giving employment and is used directly in the giving of employment, and the amendment stops there, that is a benefit.</P>
      <P>Now let us look at the practical case. In most cases there will be debts.  In very many cases if the value of the asset is reduced by 20 per cent and the value of the debts are reduced by 20 per cent at the same time you are robbing Peter to pay Paul, or you are taking away with your left hand what you are giving with your right hand.  To say the least, it is a notional administrative transaction in practical terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentially, in a case of debts and encumbrances outstanding at the valuation date, I can understand encumbrances, but where you have the property which is used directly in the provision of employment, the exact meaning of &ldquo;debts&rdquo; might lead us to some <Col N="1872" /> interesting points of distinction.  That is bad enough.  In other words, we have a section here which apparently confers a benefit but which in the most practical cases&mdash;and remember in most practical cases where employment is concerned there will be debts&mdash;we are very likely taking away with B what you give with A.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, the situation is worse than that.  This is a rather important consideration if the Minister's avowed purpose here is to provide employment.  Another administrative error is that nothing stands still or is cast in business.  You either go forward or backward, as a general rule.  There is no such thing as saying: &ldquo;I am nicely placed.  I have a static business and everything is happy.&rdquo;  That is an error that the staff mind, whether it is in an army, or in an administration, or in a big company, or anywhere else, can make.</P>
    <P>In the case of an enterprise coming within the terms of this subsection and providing employment, it is probable that the impetus of business will require continued investment to secure expansion, to safeguard employment, and to secure viability by development. I doubt if you would have any difficulty&mdash;I could give a large number of individual examples if I were asked&mdash; with businesses which have been faced more than once with the alternative of dying either quickly or slowly, or taking their courage in their hands and developing.  It is like an aeroplane taking off in difficulties.  To avoid a crash the pilot, instead of doing what the cautious motorist can do&mdash;pull up and go in to the kerb&mdash;has got to put on more power and put in everything he has got to get airborne and get into a safe area.  It is the same in business.  You must invest, you must develop.</P>
    <P>If you concede that practical consideration, which I submit to any businessman is a very real one, then you must concede that that development requires financing.  The conventional way of financing is borrowing in some form or another, and borrowing means debt.  It can frequently happen in the type of enterprise envisaged in this subsection that the actual initial <Col N="1873" /> assets, that is the property, involved and the net market value of the property which is used&mdash;I will not complicate it by expanding the argument to the stocks and shares&mdash;may be quite small in relation to the debt incurred. It would not be unusual for a business with, say, a property evaluated at £½ million to have a debt of the order of £¾ million.  The point is that the debts could be greater than the actual property.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, we come to the kernel of Deputy Fitzpatrick's argument, namely, that you give 20 per cent benefit on the lesser, and only allowing 80 per cent on the greater means that you have more debts unallowed for than you have value allowed for.  That is an important point in considering the particular enterprises here.  It is facing reality.  It is a totally different situation from the case where a person buys a residence. Appeals to formal logic, arithmetical or administrative logic, in this case is not the answer.  The amendment would correct this.</P>
    <P>In final answer to the Minister's point about administrative logic, if you want to help productive assets, if you want to make an exception and you are making an exception here&mdash;I am giving full credit to the Minister for his good intentions&mdash;why not give the 20 per cent?  It will be very easy to check on the debt.  There will be no evasion in the debt.  By giving the 20 per cent you are actually doing the reverse of what you are doing here. Instead of creating difficulty where there is expansion and development, you will encourage expansion and development. This is one of the things we have been urging from this side of the House.  I would very strongly ask the Minister to consider the amendment in that way.</P>

Then go on to the other approach where you have again a hotel valued at £100,000, you deduct your 20 per cent, and you get £80,000.  You go to the debts and you have still £20,000 worth of debts but you take 20 per cent of them and you get debts down to £16,000 and you deduct your £16,000 from your £80,000 and you again get £64,000.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Last night an example was given by <Col N="1882" /> the Minister for Finance.  We will say A owns land worth £100,000 and he has other assets of £80,000.  His total wealth is £180,000.  The value of the land for tax is £50,000 and the other assets are £80,000.  He has, therefore, a total of £130,000 and his wealth tax should come to £300.  Assume that he borrowed £100,000 to buy land worth £100,000, the lands and borrowings cancel each other out so that in equity he should still pay the same amount of tax as his net assets are unchanged at £180,000.  However, the position would be as follows if the full debt were allowed: the value of the land for tax, £100,000; other assets, £80,000, equals £180,000, less entire debt, £100,000; net value £80,000, no tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Because part of that is land and he is entitled to 50 per cent.  We dealt with that under another subsection.  It is the same principle.  There is 80 per cent here but it is only 50 per cent there.  We would only be allowing against land 50 per cent of the debt on the same principle as we are only allowing 80 per cent here.  Less 50 per cent of the debt, £50,000, total, £130,000, and the wealth tax is £300 which is correct.  If we were to do what Deputy Colley suggests the man who could afford to manipulate things so that he would borrow and have debts as against wealth tax on the relevant date would get off tax whereas the ordinary honest-to-God man who could not arrange things in that way would have to pay wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That gets back to the two fundamental points raised earlier.  Forget for the moment my <Col N="1883" /> error in regard to the calculation.  Not appreciating the fact that the 80 was equal to 100 minus 20 which is, fundamentally, the mistake that was made there.  Leaving that out the point still arises that in absolute terms 20 per cent relief on the property&mdash;if one does the calculation as it is done in the section&mdash;and 80 per cent relief on the debt, if the debts exceed the property or are very substantial then one has the consequence as I outlined earlier. Why not go the whole hog and give the benefit on the asset?  It would be the net asset.  One can work out the calculation for that.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about tax evasion. Surely that can be controlled as it is under the Income Tax Acts.  Tax evasion is no answer, and in a developing business the arguments made earlier are still valid.  If that is done there would be a great deal to be said for what the Minister is doing in this section and it would amount to a real relief.  If one takes in any proportion of the debt, no matter how big or how small, one is giving an incentive and reducing the net amount of the assets by 20 per cent.  The debt is subtracted <i>in toto</i> from the 80 per cent of the assets.  The 80 and the 20 depend essentially on the fact that 80 is equal to 100 minus 20.  In the case of making that 80 up to 100 and taking the actual legal application of the interpretation of the section, without going to any alternative methods of calculation, one would confer a great benefit on businesses which are developing and forced to develop and have an employment content.  That part of the argument stands as strong as ever, and the tax evasion has been answered in similar cases in the income tax code.</P>

      <P>I want to reinforce what Deputy de Valera has said.  As far as I can see the only argument the Minister has put forward against doing what is sought in this amendment is that it would lead to tax evasion.  If one takes the example he gave, the non-liability for tax in that example is a function of the level at which the threshold is fixed and the value of the properties that the Minister chose as an example. <Col N="1884" /> One would not, of course, get that kind of result if the value of the property were different or if the thresholds were different.  The mere fact that by choosing this particular combination of figures you get a result of the kind the Minister mentioned is no answer at all to saying that people engaged in business in so far as their productive assets are concerned should not be allowed to deduct the full amount of the debts simply because one is giving a concession in regard to the valuation by reducing it to 80 per cent.</P>
      <P>It has been demonstrated from this side of the House that this kind of concession could be very important and failure to give it effectively is taking, if not all back, very much back of what is given.  This question of evasion which is alleged to arise is just a function of the particular figures chosen and the level of the threshold. It would not be true to say that it would provide a coach and four for people to avoid liability for wealth tax. That would not be true at all.  Failure to accept the amendment will certainly lead to very minor relief in the case of productive assets coming under this subsection.</P>

I have shown that property valued at £100,000, with £20,000 worth of debts, ends up for tax purposes revalued at £64,000.  Deputy Colley says that if the thresholds were different the results from examples given by me would be different.

But if he is liable for wealth tax, the example and the result given by me can or will follow to a greater or a lesser <Col N="1885" /> degree, depending on the amount involved. The workings of this Bill will be monitored and will be kept under review and it may be necessary to change it from time to time.  In the income tax position we have the other monstrous situation which went on for years where a person could borrow £10,000 to buy a house, not necessarily for his own use, was allowed the full amount of interest, and if he was in a very high income tax bracket he would end up by paying practically nothing.  He could sell the house a few years later for £20,000 without paying one penny tax on the gain.  That has stopped, and rightly so, and the amount is limited. As the workings of this Bill go on, if it seems necessary to alter it in the reverse way I am sure it will be done.</P>

In my view, the Minister has an extra function, that is, to take into account the very real cases&mdash;and the Minister knows about them&mdash;where firms run into debt, much greater debts than their assets.

      <P>In page 14, subsection (3), after line 14, to insert the following proviso:</P>
      <P>Provided also that, in case of property consisting of stocks or shares in a trading company whose assets on the revelant valuation date consist wholly or mainly of premises registered in the register of hotels, kept by Bord Fáilte under section 24 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, and the assets of the business carried on therein, this subsection shall, in respect of the valuation date falling in the year 1975 and the two valuation dates next following that valuation date, have effect as if &ldquo;30 per cent&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;20 per cent&rdquo; in paragraph (a), and &ldquo;70 per cent&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;80 per cent&rdquo;, in paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House knows that hotel bedrooms were treated generously in regard to wealth tax by applying to them the same exemption as was given to fishing boats and agricultural land.  The House knows also that suggestions were made that this exemption and relief should also be extended to hotels owned by companies.  It was pointed out that that simply would not be workable, but in recognition of the amount of capital involved in hotels and the low rate of return, this particular amendment has been introduced to meet the situation. Subsection (3) as it stands gives a 20 per cent relief for properties consisting of stocks and shares of a trading company. The proviso in this amendment now makes this relief 30 per cent for such properties in trading companies whose assets consist wholly or mainly of premises registered in the register of hotels kept by Bord Fáilte.  The principle of wholly or mainly has already arisen in section 6 (3).  The hotels must be registered with Bord Fáilte under <Col N="1887" /> the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939.  The assets of the business carried on therein are taken into account in considering the extent of the hotels business <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other business, if any, carried on by the company.  Trading companies included in the definitions in the next subsection comprise companies registered in the State or with a register of members in the State.  The amendment is very much in relief of hotels owned by limited companies.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the force of the Minister's arguments on the last section and I again take the opportunity of apologising for remarks I made in regard to the mistake on the equivalence of the percentages. The same point arises in another way on this.  Again you have the gearing of this amendment, 30 to 70; 70 is 100 minus 30.  Deputy Esmonde is right when he says that if the debts exceed the value of the assets, then there is nothing payable.  It becomes a minus quantity.  There is an area, I think, where the deletion of the figure &ldquo;80&rdquo; which we discussed before and, in this amendment, the deletion of &ldquo;70&rdquo;, would make a substantial difference in favour of the hotel in this case.  I would urge, even though the Minister has rejected this principle on the last amendment, that this is an administrative <Col N="1888" /> approach to this, a kind of administrative logic.  Whatever the merits of the previous amendment, here the Minister might consider either deleting the 70 per cent or leaving the 80 per cent stand.  If he deleted the 70 per cent, he would leave it at 80 per cent.  It therefore is 100 minus 30, which is 70 per cent of the assets less 80 per cent of the debts, would be involved in this case.  Notwithstanding debate on the last amendment, and freely admitting that the Minister made a strong case for himself on the last amendment in the particular case of hotels here, and since this is a proviso and an addition, the Minister would greatly improve his amendment and improve the section if he deleted 70 per cent and let the 80 per cent rule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a short Bill whose main purpose is to increase the borrowing powers of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. The corporation was one of the first State-sponsored bodies established in this country, dating from 1927. In the meantime it has become closely identified with agricultural progress here, it has expanded dramatically in <Col N="1889" /> the past ten years and is now investing £55 to £60 million a year in Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The corporation are a registered company with £10 million share capital. The issued share capital of £6.75 million is held by the Minister for Finance who appoints the Board of Directors. The corporation also hold £16 million in Exchequer loans.  In recent years their lending was financed mainly from deposits, repayments on existing loans and borrowing abroad including the World Bank and European Investment Bank.  To take 1975 as an example the corporation expect to lend £55 million which will be financed by means of £25 million deposits, £21 million repayments on existing loans and £9 million foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>In passing I should say that the deposits scheme introduced by the corporation in 1965 and guaranteed by the Minister for Finance has been highly successful.  They now hold £75 million in deposits and pay an interest rate of 10 per cent.  I can readily recommend the scheme to the public who can get a very good return on their investment while at the same time contributing to the development of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The corporation give credit for a variety of purposes but loans for livestock, land purchase and improvement, buildings and equipment are the more popular.  In the year to April, 1975, such loans amounted to £25 million or 45 per cent of total advances.  They also give loans for the purchase of seeds and fertilisers, repayment of debt and family settlements and capital for the purchase of grain at harvest time.  They finance hire purchase, mostly farm machinery, their total hire purchase transactions in 1974-75 amounting to £5 million.</P>
    <P>Farmers are the principal borrowers but a considerable amount of credit goes to merchants and co-operative societies, mainly processing firms such as creameries and meat factories.  In 1974-75 the corporation advanced £40 million to farmers and £16 million to others.</P>
    <P>Repayment periods vary.  Loans to grain millers for the purchase of grain <Col N="1890" /> may be repaid within six months. Other short-term loans such as budgeted loans for seasonal farm operations are repayable within 12 to 15 months.  Then there are medium and long-term loans.  Loans for livestock run for five years, land drainage for 15 years, land purchase and buildings for 20 years and dwelling houses for 25 years.</P>
    <P>Interest rates charged by the corporation are based on the current cost of borrowing.  With the high cost of funds in the money market in recent years the margin available to ACC to cover administrative expenses is minimal.  Samples of current lending rates are 12 per cent for budgeted loans, 13¾ per cent for a repayment period of one to five years, 15 per cent for periods of ten years and over.</P>
    <P>From time to time the corporation operate schemes to meet special needs.  For example, they had a loan scheme for breeding stock from June, 1972, to December, 1973, to help farmers to increase their livestock numbers. The State paid an interest subsidy of 4 per cent on such loans.</P>
    <P>A similar scheme of loans at low interest rates operated last winter to help small farmers buy feedingstuffs. The State paid an interest subsidy of 8 per cent enabling the farmers to borrow at 5 per cent.  The Associated Banks took part in these schemes on similar terms.</P>
    <P>Turning to the future it seems likely that a high demand for agricultural credit will continue.  Farm prices are recovering after the temporary set-back in 1974 and, with the growing confidence in the future of their business, farmers will no doubt increase their investment in land improvement, livestock, farm buildings, equipment and other facilities.  The farm modernisation scheme will give added impetus to such investment with its emphasis on farm planning, efficiency and profits.</P>
    <P>The corporation are most anxious to contribute to farming progress, and with this in mind I am providing for a big expansion in their borrowing limits.  They regularly review their schemes and credit terms to take <Col N="1891" /> account of farming requirements. They are also reviewing their administrative system and expanding their regional organisation in order to be in close touch with the needs of individual farmers and speed up the issue of loans.  They will soon have offices at 24 centres throughout the country. I should like to congratulate the corporation on their performance and to wish them well in their plans to provide a first-class service to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I will now summarise the main provisions in the Bill.  Section 1 contains the usual definitions.  Section 2 increases the maximum amount which may be borrowed by the corporation. The ceiling of £120 million set in the 1973 Act is increased to £220 million. It is expected that the revised limit will meet their requirements for the next two-and-a-half years.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with ministerial guarantees.  The Minister for Finance may guarantee the repayment of ACC borrowings.  In keeping with the new ceiling on borrowings, section 3 increases the maximum amount of such borrowing which may be guaranteed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 4 gives the Minister for the Public Service authority to regulate the pay of the corporation's chief executive.  It provides that the remuneration and allowances payable to this officer shall be subject to ministerial consent.</P>
    <P>Section 5 corrects an omission in the Act of 1972 which, in dealing with foreign borrowing, empowered the Minister for Finance to indemnify the corporation against losses or to receive any benefits arising from changes in exchange rates.  Section 5 formalises the accounting provisions for such losses or gains.</P>
    <P>This Bill will enable the corporation to cope with their expanding business and to help the progress of Irish agriculture.  I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his little homily about the benefits of farm credit.  May I remark on the smug and self-satisfied atmosphere in which <Col N="1892" /> it must have been written and the almost total ignorance of the agricultural situation revealed in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech?  This is not to say that we in Fianna Fáil do not recognise the pressing need for a satisfactory credit system and, while we have some suggestions for the improvement of the Bill that will be before the House in due course, in general we accept the necessity for it. I mentioned the extraordinary ignorance and the detached attitude that is displayed by the Parliamentary Secretary in his speech.  It states:</P>
      <P>Farm prices are recovering after the temporary set-back in 1974 and, with the growing confidence in the future of their business, farmers will no doubt increase their investment in land improvement, livestock...</P>
      <P>If that is not a cavalier way of dismissing the major agricultural tragedy that hit the country with the arrival of the National Coalition Government, and in which the agricultural industry is still in the throes, I would like to see a better way.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other aspects that were mentioned in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech that must have caused some concern to farmers who wish to borrow.  There are the very substantial amounts of money that are made available from the Agricultural Credit Corporation to people outside farming, especially people who have consistently during the years made very large profits from farming, with the assistance of the credit mechanisms that are available for farmers and that many farmers feel should be available only to them. It is true also that farmer co-oper-atives and meat factories borrow very heavily from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  This is a different category of borrower and, while their borrowing has diminished the available amount of money left for borrowing by farmers, it is readily recognisable at the same time that without this investment the massive development of the dairying and the meat processing industry that took place under the Fianna Fáil Government could not have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1893" /> It is worth noting that this expansion and development, which was very very rapid indeed, especially in the case of meat processing and the concentration on dairy product manufacture, has diminished very considerably since the advent of the Coalition Government. In the context of European prices and price structures and the collapse of the cattle trade that was contrived by our own Government here it is likely it will lead to a situation where the dairy factories especially will be getting into increasing difficulties.  The profitability of the dairy industry has been very seriously damaged, principally by the disastrous drop in the price of calves in dairy farms.</P>
    <P>Three years ago it was quite common to see calves being bought by the suckler herd owners in the country for £70 each.  In the last couple of months it is just as common for similar calves to be bought or sold for 70p.  One does not have to be a great mathematician to figure that in an intensively run dairy farm which sells off its calves, which might be carrying a cow to the acre, the profit per acre will fall by the price of calf per acre.  This is the case in many intensive dairy farms at the present time now.  They are being transformed from a profitable situation where they were going ahead, expanding rapidly and investing heavily in their own land and increasing the production from their land, to a situation now where many of them now are suffering a loss.  They will be feeling the effect of the new price structure for milk that seems to have been accepted without any great demur by the Government.  It is the introduction of the European Commission idea that is delicately called &ldquo;financial coresponsibility&rdquo;. What financial coresponsibility means in European terms is that if there appears to be an oversupply of any particular product the farmer's price is reduced.  I hope that before this present milk season comes to an end that there will not be a downward adjustment of milk prices, apart from the built-in downward trend of milk prices that is with us all the time because of the constant erosion of prices due to inflation.</P>
    <P>It is well on an occasion such as the <Col N="1894" /> Second Stage of this Bill to consider the motivation behind farmers who would seek to borrow money.  When it became apparent that this country was entering the European Community there existed already a very satisfactory rise in the size of the cattle herd, the sheep flock and the pig herd in this country.  All of these flocks and herds were increasing in numbers. Farmers were borrowing very heavily to expand their production in all of these areas and we had established in this country a very large beef herd of suckling cows.  It was to those herds that the calves from the dairy herds were moving and making such satisfactory prices during the Fianna Fáil regime.</P>
    <P>With the advent of the National Coalition Government, and the most incredible mismanagement of the farming sector by that Government, we now have a situation where the beef suckler herd has been almost totally eliminated and with it the market for calves and dairy herds and, of course, the profitability of farming enterprise at the present time.  Even on the Department of Agriculture's own admission, farm profits fell about 30 per cent last year. If we are to take the findings of the Agricultural Institute, which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries vehemently denies, the average farmer's income last year was £1,500.  In the teeth of raging inflation there has been a disastrous drop in the incomes of farmers.  The Government, with that marvellous sensitivity of theirs, contemplating the destruction they had wrought in the farming sector, in examining their lawyers' hearts and their university dons' hearts to see what they might best do to assist this situation, introduced several new forms of taxation. They introduced income tax for farmers along with the rating of their land.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government I never denied that it was my opinion that farmers should pay the same kind of taxation at the same rate as any other person in the country.  This is perfectly logical and sensible.  What the National Coalition did was to introduce this system in a very lefthanded and peculiar way.  The type of <Col N="1895" /> taxation introduced by them and called income tax is called income tax inaccurately because in many cases this taxation will be determined not by the size of farmers' incomes but by their rateable valuation under the Griffith valuation which was done in the middle of the last century.  It is a very serious taxation, running handin-hand with the very serious rates on agricultural land which the Irish Farmers' Association, members of this party, and other people who understand agriculture, who have contacts with agriculture or are involved in agriculture, have been advocating. Nobody but a fool would advocate that there should be some particular class of people that would be exempt from taxation that applies to everyone else in the State.  That is nonsense. We do not advocate that.  What we do advocate and seek is taxation on the same basis as other people for the farmers of the country.  We have not got it.</P>
    <P>The Government, in their extraordinary insensitivity to the peculiarities of the farming community, of a nation of farmers such as a great many of us still are, stuck their awkward thumbs in the whole business of farm succession.  I am afraid that while their legislation, part of which is before the House at the present time, is the law of this land, that the timehonoured concepts of farm succession from father to son will be no longer possible and that Ireland's race of hard-working, industrious farmers will be taxed out of existence.  It will no longer pay the sons of farmers to become their fathers' successors as farmers because their backs will be broken by succession tax and capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>With all these other blessings the Coalition conferred upon us they have also&mdash;I would think in total ignorance rather than in malice, with an ignorance that is very difficult to understand or believe&mdash;destroyed the whole system of farming.  It is clear that they do not know how this works. The provisions of the income taxing of farmers will effectively mean that many second sons, enterprising men <Col N="1896" /> living on farms of £50 valuation and over, will not only have the profits that they made from doing occasional hire work for their neighbours taxed but whatever little profits they might make on their own farms will be taxed as well.  Their identity will be found because the people for whom they work, in making their income tax returns, must give the names and addresses of the contractors who carried out those works for them.  In other words, the old system of neighbourly co-operation has been turned into a system of neighbours spying on one another.  This has not been eliminated at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These are a few of the things the Coalition Government have been doing for the farming community.  In the incredibily short period of two-and-a-half years they have produced chaos in the industry.  Week by week the Department issue a Press release giving the reference prices for cattle throughout the European Community. Week by week the price of cattle in the Irish Republic is far lower than in any other country in the Community including Great Britain.  In more recent times a mechanism has <Col N="1897" /> been introduced by the British Government for the provision of what is in effect, a guarantee price for cattle, by the use of a variable premium.  This variable premium has been varied in so far as it affects Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The upshot of it is that cattle prices in all of Ireland, north or south, would be about £1 a hundredweight less than in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I have not heard any protest from the Department or the Minister about this.  The effect it has on the farmers in the Republic is that the relationship between their prices and cattle prices in the UK will be changed to the detriment of our farmers.</P>
    <P>Because of the depredations of the National Coalition Government, because of the utter havoc they have wrought in the farming scene in the last two-and-a-half years, it will be necessary to have very wide credit facilities available for survival.  A farmer may be obliged to take the same spendthrift's course the Government have taken by borrowing for ordinary day-to-day purposes in order to stay alive.  Farmers may, like them, be forced into a policy of borrowing further to get a little bit further along the road and the devil take the hindmost whenever the crunch comes, as it must inevitably come.</P>
    <P>I have tabled questions to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and to the Taoiseach, which should be received in the next week or two, seeking to establish the movements in cattle numbers, sheep numbers and pig numbers that have occurred since the advent of the National Coalition.  We know that the sheep flock since 1973 has diminished by 20 per cent.  We are not able to supply our markets for pigmeat.  This is not to be wondered at since the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries as late as last May 12 months advised the pig breeders to get out of business.  He told them there was no future in pigs.  Now we cannot get bacon to meet our orders in Britain. At the same time Polish and Swedish bacon gets very heavy EEC export refunds in the British market.  Similarly <Col N="1898" /> cattle numbers must have diminished rapidly since the total failure of the Irish Government to make any impression on the business of selling cattle in Europe.</P>
    <P>We urged the Ministers for Finance, Agriculture and Fisheries and the Government generally to give us a realistic devaluation of the agricultural £.  When it was far too late in the day, when all the producers of small cattle, especially in the west of Ireland, had been wiped out and had sold their cattle, the Government on 7th October, 1974 gave a devaluation which was of little or no value.  There was a slight difference between it and the British devaluation.  There was a slight export refund on Irish cattle going to Britain which will presently be working the other way because the British Government who were more attentive and more alert, are going to do a further devaluation of the agricultural £.  In due course when a great deal of harm has been done the Coalition may get around to facing this question again.  It may be that they will have to seek the permission of Her Brittanic Majesty's Government before they do anything.  If we are to go on their performance and their record we can depend on them to do the wrong thing.</P>
    <P>We are talking about an Agricultural Credit Bill for an industry in which herds and flocks have been seriously diminished by the direct inactivities of the present Government. The principal factor in their wretched performance was the total ignorance of what goes on six miles away from where Nelson's Pillar used to be. There are areas where the Government's performance is excellent.  In recent times their stage manager has been transferred to another job.  He will become the people's commissar of Radio na Gaeltachta and also assistant to the official propaganda organ of Radio Telefís Éireann.  He is being replaced in this area, this George Orwellian area, of black is white, and war is peace.</P>
    <P>We have been persuaded that although we make no profits everything <Col N="1899" /> is all right.  When the Minister goes to Brussels he brings back a bonanza.  It is impossible to sell calves; it is impossible to sell lambs. That is a well-known fact but it seems no member of the Government knows.  They are not concerned about these things.  God knows, as far as the poor Deputies who sit behind the Minister are concerned, I do not know whether they are consulted or asked.  I do know they will dutifully troop in behind the rest of the National Coalition on all occasions except the aberration when the Taoiseach takes the wrong turning at the top of the stairs.  It is worth mentioning also that in this context of diminishing herds, increasing poverty, crashing prices and the imposition of several new tax loads on farmers, we discovered recently through the medium of Parliamentary Questions that the cost of fertilisers since the advent of the National Coalition has gone up by about two-and-a-half to three times, whether they are nitrogenous manures, phosphate manures, potash or indeed lime.  I gather that the sales of fertilisers in this season are down by about 40 per cent.  This is not to be wondered at because when farmers' profits are down by an admitted 30 per cent in many cases&mdash; it would be double that in others&mdash;it is unreasonable to expect that these farmers would be in a position to buy fertilisers.</P>
    <P>The effects of their incapacity to buy fertilisers are going to be felt in the quantity of material that they have to sell.  Fertiliser has no value at all only the capacity that it gives farmers to produce and sell more goods, whether the goods be milk or milk products, meat or meat products or cereals, sugar beet or whatever.  It is necessary to tell the Government, because they are not aware of these things, that if fertilisers are not used production will fall.  The quality of the cattle, sheep and pig produced will fall also and, needless to say, the quality of breeding has been seriously disrupted by the crashing of prices, by the unprofitability of proper cattle breeding.  This is a serious area.  In a <Col N="1900" /> properly run agriculture no sensible man would use a scrub bull but it might be said in the present context that no sensible man would bother using anything else for the reason that three years ago, when Fianna Fáil were in office, the price of calves, if anything, was too high&mdash;in the region of £60, £70 and they often made more.  Now the price, after two-and-a-half years of Coalition activity, is 60p, 70p.</P>

      <P>We are subject to the heckling of the Heydrich of the Fine Gael Party, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  In the consideration of any Bill dealing with agriculture and credit, one must examine the purposes for which this credit will be used.  I have been attempting to survey the scene that confronts us and it is frightening.  It is necessary to consider all these things.  Great use was made of credit during the Fianna Fáil regime but for the purposes of expansion, for building, for increasing herd sizes, for buying better breeding stock.  This does not pay any more.  This is why we must advert to it here in this debate.</P>
      <P>The Chair will know very well, because of her undoubted connection with the farming scene, that the use of proper breeding stock is no longer profitable and that the type of stock being bred very widely at present will, in due course, have to be eliminated by a Fianna Fáil Government.  It is induced by the idiot policies that have been pursued in agriculture.  I can describe them in no other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to a very serious question that will concern people who may well have recourse to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The elimination of brucellosis was not proceeding quickly enough when Fianna <Col N="1901" /> Fáil left office but it was proceeding at a fairly businesslike rate.  It is also fair to say that the pattern of disease elimination and progress with the clearance areas was very similar to the pattern which was followed with the elimination of bovine tuberculosis, beginning in the north and centre of the country and moving down towards the heartland of animal disease in Munster and possibly my own county of Kilkenny as well.  I do not seek to ascribe unfairly any blame to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries for this situation.  It is true and must be admitted that the hard core area of brucellosis will be largely the Munster area and possibly Kilkenny and a bit of Wexford thrown in.  A new and urgent factor is that by 1978 it will not be possible to sell Irish cattle, either alive or dead, on the Continent unless they are attested from the point of view of tuberculosis and brucellosis.  That is a mere three years away.  Yet the surface has not been nibbled as regards brucellosis in the dairying areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to it.  As the scheme progresses, as reactors are taken out, and in many cases the number of reactors in herds will be very great&mdash;whole herds may well react.  In these cases the herd owner, if he wants to continue being a herd owner, will have to borrow money, presumably from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, to re-establish his herd.  In any event there is going to be an enormous wastage as the reactors are eliminated from the dairy herds.  As far as I know, and the Minister has given no indication that I am aware of, there is no sense of special urgency about the really radical and tough tackling of the elimination of brucellosis.  If there is not we are going to be in a very extraordinary position by 1978 because even now the United Kingdom cattle producers are expanding their production so rapidly and are being <Col N="1902" /> assisted so assiduously by the United Kingdom Government that the market for Irish stores in Britain will be diminished.</P>
      <P>The market for Irish chilled meat in Britain will be diminished.  We may well find ourselves by 1978 with a lot of cattle to sell and nowhere to go because we will not have attained attested status.  Therefore, it is of vital necessity that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries should produce a dynamic disease eradication programme and do it immediately.  Deputies will have noticed that, during the Minister's recent dispute with the veterinary profession, this party acted in a very responsible way.  We sympathised with the Minister's difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was attempting to say&mdash;I may have been obscure &mdash;was that the better the disease eradication scheme is, the greater will be the elimination of reactors from the herd, the more rapid will be the elimination of reactors from the herd.  In these circumstances, herd owners will have to replace the reactors as rapidly as possible. Most of them will have no way of doing this except by raising money from the ACC or some other lending agency.  The Acting Chairman may see my point now.  I beg pardon for being so obscure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were a member of the Government I would be possibly a university don, a solicitor, or a member of some of the more eloquent professions.  I ask the Chair to be tolerant with me. I am simply a farmer.  I hope my party <Col N="1903" /> will, for the foreseeable future, at any rate, maintain the link with the plain people of Ireland, of whom I am one. We may yet live to see the day when the regime of the RTE demi-gods will be broken and the plain people of Ireland will take charge of the Government. I am quite confident that they will.  Possibly that might be a little irrelevant and so I must not elaborate on it.</P>
    <P>There is another area of borrowing which would be of special concern to the Acting Chairman, to Deputy Callanan, and to other Deputies from the west of Ireland, because it is there the greatest proportion of small farms are.  I am not aware of the policy of the present Government with regard to the maintenance of the smaller farmers on the land, but I am very certain what our party's policy is. There is no doubt about it and I want to be perfectly clear on this.  It is Fianna Fáil policy to maintain the small farmers of Ireland on the land of Ireland and to make it profitable for them to be there, and to give them every assistance to be there.</P>
    <P>We must not be blamed if we have certain anxieties and suspicions about the Government.  We have seen how the farm modernisation scheme was allowed to proceed on its merry way, in spite of the fact that it is a scheme that is weighted very heavily against the smaller farmer rather than what is known in European terms as the concept of the modern farm.  Indeed, credit or no credit, with the Coalition in charge it will be very difficult, if it is possible at all, for the smaller farmers to survive.</P>
    <P>When we contemplate the inertia of the Government with regard to having modifications of the farm and modernisation scheme made in Brussels, we must be forgiven if we have feelings of anxiety with regard to their intentions for the smaller farmers, especially in the province of Connacht.  It is not a political secret that the majority of them very sensibly vote for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>These are farmers who have a particular interest in the EEC disadvantaged <Col N="1904" /> areas scheme.  As requested by the European Commission in, I think, last October or November, the Irish Government presented a map of the country and on this map were delineated the areas our Government felt were agriculturally disadvantaged.  A scheme was devised whereby, after great deliberations and cogitations, the contribution by the EEC would be 25 per cent of the disadvantaged areas scheme, but the remaining 75 per cent would fall to be paid by the national Government.  The Minister, even with the suppression of other schemes, had such a pathetically small sum at his disposal for the augmentation of the disadvantaged areas scheme that he had a brainwave.  He got out his map of the disadvantaged areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I refer to it again.  A totally unwarrantable assertion was made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He said:</P>
      <P>Farm prices are recovering after the temporary set-back in 1974 and, with a growing confidence in the future of their business, farmers will no doubt increase their investment in land improvement, in livestock, farm buildings, equipment and other facilities.</P>

There is nothing more relevant than the poverty that is being inflicted upon the agricultural industry by the Coalition Government. There is, therefore, the awful necessity to provide some kind of life-line for them.  I realise that access to credit for farmers must be provided even by the National Coalition but that is not really the cure for the agricultural situation. We will have to adopt more radical methods to put the country back in the condition it was in 1973 when we left office.  The restoration of our shattered herds and the rebuilding of the numbers that have been so shockingly depleted by the National Coalition will take quite a long time <Col N="1906" /> and a lot of effort and a lot of agricultural credit that may or may not be assisted by the terms of this Bill.

I understand that <Col N="1909" /> the Manpower Service of the Department of Labour has been in touch with the union and the people involved with the present firm, to which the question refers, to see how new employment can be provided and new training, if necessary, for the people involved.</P>

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that Cork city and its environment has a population of 150,000?  The Parliamentary Secretary is not dealing with a little town. He is talking about employment in various parts of Cork some 20 miles apart.  Some of the parts to which he refers are homogeneous and there is adequate unemployment in the areas to which he referred to absorb whatever employment he has referred to as being likely to be available.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that this kind of employment, to use the Minister for Industry and Commerce's own phrase, is an ongoing process; something that he could not have stopped anyway because the facilities were there already?  Some of the negotiations had already started before the Minister, or his Parliamentary Secretary, took office.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary further have regard to the fact that on the ratio of population, Cork to the rest of the country, there will be approximately 5,000 secondary school-leavers seeking employment in the Cork city and county this year?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary accept that the industries to which he has referred will not only fail to absorb the ordinary unemployment figures but will miserably fail to absorb those who have now been put out of employment?  What prospects are there for the 5,000 school-leavers who will be looking for employment in the autumn this year?  Is it not only poppycock for the Parliamentary Secretary to be talking in this fashion?</P>

      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has said.  The situation is that the present Government have provided substantially increased resources for the Industrial Development Authority to assist in new job creation.  In real terms, even taking account of inflation, in the present year there is a 40 per cent increase in the amount of <Col N="1910" /> money available to the IDA for capital expenditure.  That is a substantial commitment of money and it is money that counts by the Government in this field.  Of course, there are difficulties in the textile industry and the Deputy and the House are aware of them.  This is an industry in the textile field and there are problems.  However, these problems are not confined to Ireland. In fact, the relative job loss&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Does he not realise that a leading firm in Kildare which kept workers in non-productive work for as long as there was a ray of hope of an improvement in the situation even in this year, have now decided that they must make workers redundant, and in this very month of July they have decided that there is no hope for the future?

There is the possibility of production platforms being produced in Cork and Mayo and, in view of the indication from the Minister that there is a strong probability of oil being found off our shore, could we not create jobs by placing an order with each of the companies concerned, thus giving hundreds of jobs in both areas?</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be under a misapprehension.  There is a difference between an oil rig and a platform.  An oil rig is a vessel used in exploration work for petroleum, and essentially it involves marine technology. The production platform, which is used in the actual extraction of the oil when it has been found, is a civil engineering job.  The companies to which the Deputy has referred are in the latter category and would not be set up to deal with a demand for oil rigs.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>A study of the economic potential of the north Clare phosphate deposits, initiated by me last year, is continuing. The object of the study is to establish whether the deposits represent a viable source of phosphate for fertiliser.  I am now considering an interim report which indicates that further drilling will be required to provide additional evidence as to the nature and extent of the deposits. Even if the expenditure involved is found to be justified it may be some time before this study can be completed.</P>

      <P>When the Minister was asked if the investigation would be carried out shortly he replied that the original examination was undertaken at a time when there were extraordinary rises in the price of North African phosphate.  He also said he had a figure of 1,500,000 million tons which he stated seemed rather small in relation to our requirements. I pointed out to the Minister that in the war years, with antiquated and limited equipment, it was discovered that between Kilfenora and Doolin and estimated 10 million tons were found as a result of ordinary borings.  With regard to the question of fertilisers, last January the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was asked about the production of fertilisers in this country to counteract the enormous amount of money spent on imports.  At that time I suggested an investigation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the increase in the price of rock phosphate from North Africa does make the production of phosphate here a more economic proposition, and that changed circumstance is being taken into account in the study to which I referred. Subsequent to the Deputy's last question on the matter the Minister set up a working group who met in June, July, September and December, 1974, and in March, 1975.  This <Col N="1923" /> working group have presented their report to the Minister and it covers such matters as the geology of the area, techniques of extraction and the economics of the project.  The report has indicated that further drilling would be required to establish the extent of the rock phosphate desposits there.  It would be necessary to have that information on the extent of the deposits before a decision could be made as to whether it is economic for NET or any other such body to initiate actual extraction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 21 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>As a result of this country's application to the EEC Commission, under article 135 of the Act of Accession, for temporary measures of protection for the footwear industry, the Commission have authorised Ireland to apply for the period until 31st December, 1975 a rate of duty of 10 per cent to imports of United Kingdom footwear with uppers of leather. An order to this effect has been made by the Government and came into force on 12th July, 1975.</P>
      <P>This tariff adjustment means the restoration of the import duty that applied immediately before 1st July, 1975 to UK footwear with uppers of leather.  Otherwise, the new rates of duty that were introduced for UK footwear as from 1st July, 1975 will continue to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While any increase in duty will be of benefit to the industry I am disappointed, as I have already indicated, at the limited nature of the protective measures authorised by the Commission. I appreciate the problems for the Community in granting this exceptional concession for Ireland at a time when other member States of the Community <Col N="1926" /> are faced with similar difficulties but I had thought, nevertheless, that the compelling case made to the EEC Commission would have justified the authorisation of stronger measures of protection.  I note that the decision is to be subject to review in a few months' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in the 12 months ended June, 1975 the footwear industry went through a most disastrous period in the course of which numerous firms closed down, that at that time they had the benefit of this very small duty on British imports and that that was of no value whatever to the industry? In those circumstances does he consider that the reimposition of that very small duty will now be of any benefit to the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be of some benefit.  Approximately 80 per cent of Irish produced footwear comes into the category which is covered by the concession but quite clearly these problems existed even while such duties were previously in existence.  It is for that reason that I have, on behalf of the Minister, expressed disappointment that the Community were not able to agree to some more substantial measures to protect the Irish footwear industry.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that we on this side of the House on many occasions urged the Minister to take measures under Article 135 of the Treaty of Accession and that the Minister did not move when he should have done so?  Even as late as about a month ago, he pointed out, as did the Parliamentary Secretary, that it was not desirable to make any move under Article 135 and is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the EEC is quite obviously well aware of the fact that the Minister is not a bit anxious to get any worth-while result from this Article and that that is part of the reason why they have done nothing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister and myself said in debates in the House was that it was not desirable that the problems of particular industries such as footwear and textiles which are general to the whole Community should be solved by the erection of tariff barriers within the Community, and it happens that the bulk of the imports of footwear to this country are coming from other Community countries.  If there was to be any general move to introduce tariffs between member States in respect of industries which are in trouble in all member States it would lead to the breakdown of the Common Market. Quite clearly the Minister was prepared to use Article 135 and achieve <Col N="1928" /> success in relation to this matter but not, as I said in the original reply, an adequate success from the point of view of the shoe industry.</P>

      <P>With regard to the coastal regions of County Kerry I have been informed by the Industrial Development Authority that they have approved a new project for Valentia Island which has a potential employment for 45 persons, mostly men, and is expected to start up in August.  In Cahirciveen, two new industries which started up last year have an employment potential for approximately 40 new workers.  A new industry which started in Tralee in March this year has an employment potential of a further 70 jobs by 1978 and the Industrial Development Authority are negotiating with a promoter in connection with the location of a new project in Tralee which would provide a substantial number of male jobs.  There is also the prospect of expansion by another industry in the town.  The authority have industrial sites available <Col N="1932" /> at Kenmare and Ballylongford and they are actively promoting these with a view to the establishment of suitable projects in these areas.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rest of the county the Industrial Development Authority have informed me of the following developments regarding employment prospects in manufacturing industry:</P>
      <P>At Castleisland, factory construction is under way for two projects which between them have an employment potential of nearly 100 jobs; one of these projects is expected to start production shortly and the other during next year.  At Killorglin, an existing industry has an employment potential of 30 additional jobs.  At Killarney, a new firm which commenced production last year is expected to build up employment by a further 50 workers over the next 18 months.  At Listowel, the IDA have an advance factory available and are promoting it for the attraction of a suitable industry.  The Deputy may take it that the Industrial Development Authority will continue to promote County Kerry vigorously as a location for industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> Before we adjourned we were dealing with amendment No. 21 to section 10.  I had explained that the purpose of the amendment was to increase from 20 to 30 per cent the deduction allowed in respect of shares in companies, the principal asset in which is a hotel.  The amendment is in ease of the taxpayer and it was accepted by the House.  Before we adjourned Deputy de Valera was suggesting that I should insert 50 per cent instead of 30 per cent or alternatively I should insert 80 per cent instead of 70 per cent.  The effect of what Deputy de Valera was saying would be to breach the principle I argued on the previous amendment on the basis that only the same proportion of debts should be allowed as the value placed on the property.  In other words, if only 80 per cent of property was taken for wealth tax purposes then only 80 per cent of the debts claimed should be allowed.</P>
      <P>We argued that fully on the previous amendment.  I established that the principle was a sound one. Although Deputy Colley did not agree with that I do not see any point in having the same argument all over again especially as we are operating within a time limit.  I, therefore, recommend this amendment to the House as being in ease of hotels operated by a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this amendment is in ease of hotels operated by a company it is welcome. However, in my view it is far too limited.  It does not attempt to provide a comparable relief in the case of family owned hotels operated through a company as is provided in the case of individually owned hotels. The limitations are clear.  It applies only for three years, and I do not think it is a sufficient answer to that for the Minister to say, &ldquo;well these things have a habit of being extended.&rdquo; If the Minister wants to argue that it is only needed for three years and that, hopefully, the downturn in tourism will then be out of the way, that is a tenable argument. But that is not the indication he gave when Deputy Belton queried this.  On <Col N="1942" /> the contrary, his answer was that these things have a habit of being extended. If the thinking is that it should be a permanent feature then it should appear in that way in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I object to the alleged principle the Minister is talking about which is to reduce the deductions for debts as he reduces the valuation of the assets.  It is not clear to me as to which kind of hotel is getting the bigger relief now. On the one hand there is the individually owned hotel with the provisions of subsection (1) which are limited to such portion of the hotel as consists of bedrooms and, on the other hand, as provided in this amendment, company owned hotels where the relief proposed applies across the board to all the assets of the hotel, indeed all the assets of the company which are wholly or mainly an hotel.  I do not know if the Minister can throw any light on it as to which is going to get the greater relief now, but it seems to be possible that the greater relief is now going to be given to a company owned hotel whether it is a family or publicly owned company.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the Deputy knows the 50 per cent reduction is given in respect of bedrooms where the hotel is owned by an individual.  In this case where the hotel is owned by a company relief is not given in respect of bedrooms as is given in the case of the individual but the 20 per cent productive asset allowance is increased to 30 per cent. It is difficult to be precise or to say which is more beneficial, but by and large it is probably six of one and half a dozen of another.  It is difficult to be precise.</P>

      <P>as an item exempt from wealth tax.  It is possible that my amendment may not be necessary in view of that.  Logic would seem to require that the Minister ought to include &ldquo;growing timber&rdquo; in line 28, on page 14, with &ldquo;livestock and bloodstock&rdquo;. If livestock and bloodstock are to be taken into account for the purposes of this section because they are exempt it would seem that growing timber should also be taken in.  I am not urging this.  There are so many illogicalities in the Bill perhaps the Minister might deal with this also.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (4), lines 22 and 23, to delete &ldquo;is engaged in farming on a full-time basis and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment concerns the definition of genuine farmer.  In the Bill as drafted two main tests were adopted for determining how such a person could be identified.  The first that he should be engaged in farming on a full-time basis and the second that at least 75 per cent of his property should consist of agricultural property.  With a view to meeting representation, including representations from the IFA to the effect that the first test was too restrictive and might exclude individuals who would legitimately be regarded as farmers, I proposed in the original amendment, No. 22 to substitute for &ldquo;in farming on a full-time basis&rdquo; the words &ldquo;wholly or mainly in farming in the State&rdquo;.  In the meantime further detailed consideration of this amendment has resulted in the conclusion that use of the words &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; will give rise to enormous practical difficulties of definition and that it would be wiser to drop completely these words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the reasons leading to this conclusion are as follows: While the second test of property ownership, 75 per cent agricultural property, is a <Col N="1945" /> question of fact and readily ascertainable and susceptible of proof.  A test based on time and involvement will present enormous difficulties for the private and public sector.  In the final analysis the first test, viz.  a time basis, boils down to a question of the time spent on running a farm.  For example, it could often be logically argued that persons such as Dáil Deputies, Ministers, teachers, local government officials, full-time officers of organisations and so on could not be &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; engaged in farming.  On the other hand the opposite argument could sometimes be used with effect.</P>
    <P>Others, however, such as professional men or women would probably have less difficulty in coming within the definition.  Straight away an element of unfairness as between taxpayers arises which is compounded in that it could be argued that the less time one spends on a profession for which one is paid the greater are one's chances of being treated as a farmer with the attendant benefits.  The test assumes, not necessarily correctly, that the best yardstick of judging any activity is the time spent on it.  In the marginal cases, those where the problem may be of major significance, the question would be difficult to prove or disprove and, accordingly, all the more contentious.</P>
    <P>To arrive at the facts necessary for a decision would require searching inquiries and corroboration both of which would most likely lead to resentment on the part of the taxpayer. In all the circumstances it seems clear that the test necessarily based on time spent on running a farm is far from ideal.  So long as 75 per cent property test is retained the elimination of the time test altogether should not give rise to too much abuse.  In the context of the relatively low return which is claimed for farming not less than 75 per cent is a high proportion of one's wealth to retain or invest in lands.  It is a proportion sufficiently high to ensure that a hobby farmer would hardly hold it unless he intended to, and did, in fact, take an active part in farming.</P>
    <P>In relation to 5th April last no question of abuse can arise.  As for future years the matter can be kept <Col N="1946" /> reviewed so that the benefits accruing to the ownership of property by persons who were engaged in farming are not acquired by persons for whom these benefits are not intended. Accordingly, I propose this amendment which has the effect of deleting from the definition of farmer the requirement that the individual be engaged in farming on a full-time basis.</P>
    <P>There of course, remains the condition that 75 per cent of the wealth of the individual should consist of agricultural property.  In this context agricultural property refers only to land in the State and the stock, machinery, effects and so on thereon. As I have indicated, the position will be kept in view and if any tightening up is required this will receive attention.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22a:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (4), to delete lines 34 to 36 inclusive and to substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;hotel premises&rsquo; means premises registered in the register of hotels kept by Bord Fáilte under section 24 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to provide that in the case of the benefits given under subsection (1), so far as it relates to hotel premises, it will relate to all of the hotel premises and not merely to the bedroom portion as provided in the section.  There are a number of reasons why this should have been done.  In the main the definition in the section is such as to exclude virtually all facilities attached to a normal hotel without which they would not be registered with Bord Fáilte, although registration is part of the condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The division of the assets as between the hotel bedrooms and the rest of the hotel is going to present very considerable difficulty to taxpayers and to their valuers, and of course to the Revenue Commissioners, in trying to ascertain the part of any hotel accommodation attributable to the bedroom accommodation. Any sub-division of the hotel <Col N="1947" /> will have to take account of the actual amount of the hotel premises attributable to the bar, lounge reception area, ballroom, restaurant, kitchen, toilets and corridors.</P>
    <P>I have touched earlier on another very difficult problem that seems to me to be arising, that is, the distribution of the debts as between the bedrooms part of the hotel and the rest of the hotel.  I do not see how that is going to be done; yet it will have to be done under the Bill as it stands, because there are different proportions of the debts allowable as a deduction depending on whether one is dealing with the bedroom part of the hotel or the rest of the hotel. This amendment seeks to abolish this division in the case of a hotel.  If, however, the Minister feels that it simply must be divided, it seems to me that it would be far more practical and workable if the arrangement were to be made that there would be an abatement on the residential portion of the hotel which would then include the essential portion of the hotel which is given over to the servicing of the residential accommodation.  I do not think there are any easy ways of doing this if one must avoid them.  It would be far better not to divide them, but if it must be done and I think it can be done in a better way than is done in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the House knows hotel premises in the ownership and in occupation of an individual, first of all, gets right across the board a 20 per cent productive asset relief.  Then in respect of the bedroom portion that 20 per cent is brought up to 50 per cent.  That is done on the basis that there is a distinction between the bedroom portion of the hotel, which might not be worked to capacity at all during the year, and the diningroom, bar and lounge portion of the hotel, which is worked to a much greater capacity than the bedroom portion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example the bedroom portion can be and is reliant to a very large extent on the state of the tourist industry <Col N="1948" /> and on strangers coming to the locality, whereas in modern living and in present conditions the diningroom and bar are very often worked to capacity all the year around, the bar catering for locals and people from an area that is served by the hotel, and the dining room and function rooms are used very considerably for functions.  That is the basis on which the difference has been made, the larger relief being given to the bedroom portion.  The amendment is concerned with the definition of hotel premises which, as it stands in the Bill, embraces only bedroom accommodation in such premises.  The result is that the relief in subsection (1) of section 10, the lesser of 50 per cent or £100,000 from the market value, is confined to bedroom accommodation. This relief recognises the seasonal nature of the hotel business which has the effect of giving a low return in capital representing bedroom accommodation.  The same is not true of the other activities associated with hotels, kitchen, bar business, dining room facilities.  The latter are in much the same position as other businesses, some of which have also seasonal features.  Accordingly hotel assets other than bedrooms qualify for the same relief as any other property which is in the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Take the case of a privately-owned hotel with a golf links and the golf links is really the basis of success for the hotel.

I would be interested to know what the basis of assessment or value of the golf links would be.  How do they reckon them on the assets and what kind of a relief is that likely to get them?

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few observations I want to make on the section.  First, it seems to me that if the section were really taking account of productive property, as it purports to do, in the side note, which is &ldquo;Net market value of productive property&rdquo;. I do not think that you would have subsection (2) (a) in the section at all.  You would have quite a different approach, one on the lines that we have suggested all along, where productive property would be exempted from wealth tax.  However, I am not going back over that ground again.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to a couple of points that arise. There is a special provision in regard to land which is near an urban area or within a mile of an urban area. Since this section is purporting to give certain reliefs in regard to property, presumably the criteria involved should be whether they are productive or not.  While agricultural land close to an urban area may have a greater value than land in what we call a rural area, it does not necessarily have any greater productive value.  There may be some slight exceptions in the case of market gardening in north County Dublin or something like that&mdash;I am not sure &mdash;but in general it is true to say that they have no more productive value when near an urban area than when far away from it.  The criteria which appear to be applied on the basis of this section do not apply here and should not be applied here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, in regard to the definition of &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; I want to urge again that the reliefs being given to the individual farmer should apply to the family company which is running, and there are such.  In fact there are quite a number where the assets consist&mdash;it is a family company as defined in the Bill&mdash;wholly or mainly of agricultural assets.  I know the Minister says this would be wide open to abuse but I want to suggest to him <Col N="1953" /> also that if he wanted to do this he would have no great difficulty in having methods devised which would prevent any avoidance or evasion that might be involved.</P>
    <P>There is also in the definition of &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; a requirement that not less than 75 per cent of the market value of the property comprised in the taxable wealth of a farmer at the valuation date should consist of agricultural property, farm machinery, livestock and bloodstock.  There is considerable difficulty involved in this provision.  I understand of course why he has to draw the line somewhere.  But nevertheless I think it would not be right to allow this to pass without drawing attention to the difficulties that can arise, because whether 75 per cent of the taxable wealth of a farmer on the valuation date, that is one particular day in the year, consisted of the kind of asset listed in the section or not could well depend on whether at that time the farmer had sold cattle or sold crops. If he had done so and had the cash, not having reinvested it in other agricultural purposes, he could find himself outside the 75 per cent limit. Similarly if he happened to have, in addition to his agricultural property some stocks and shares, fluctuations in the market value of those could alter his position.  I recognise the difficulty that is faced here in trying to define what is in effect a genuine farmer.  Nevertheless, these kinds of difficulties are going to arise.</P>
    <P>I also wonder whether it is necessary in regard to the definition of a farmer to confine the farmer who qualifies as an individual to one who is both domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State, and whether it would not be sufficient to confine it to one who is ordinarily resident in the State, ignoring the domicile.  In subsection (2), paragraphs (a) and (b) it says if &ldquo;it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners&rdquo;.  Who is going to show this to the satisfaction of the Commissioners?  Is it the Commissioners themselves, and, if so, would it not be more appropriate to provide something like &ldquo;if the Commissioners are satisfied that&rdquo; and so on?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1954" /> I also want to suggest to the Minister that the deduction provisions which arise here under both subsections (1) and (3) ought to include provisions for relief for death duties payable after 5th April, 1975, for prior deaths in respect of the sale of property specified in section 28 of the 1931 Finance Act.  I think that relates to heirlooms or things of that nature. Similarly there should be provision for relief in respect of estate duty payable after 5th April this year in respect of timber under section 9 of the Finance Act of 1912.  These are two cases in which liability for death duties can arise in the future.  If that is correct, I am suggesting that there should be provision for deduction in respect of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying while such land may be more valuable, it is not necessarily more productive and that this section is purporting to give reliefs in the case of productive assets.  There is, in effect, a higher value being put under this section on land which is not necessarily more productive, though it may be more valuable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This provision is very much in ease of the taxpayer.  Everybody knows that land situated adjacent to a town, even a small town, is in reality very much more valuable than agricultural land situated a distance from the town.  Deputy Colley makes the point that it need not necessarily be productive but the section as a whole visualises this relief being given to property which is going to become productive.  Five years has been mentioned in some place.  It could even be land that might be bought by a local authority for industrial or housing purposes or might be suitable for that.  That is the sort of property we have in mind.  It is very much in ease of the taxpayer.  Deputy Colley suggests that the reliefs and exemptions given to an individual should be <Col N="1955" /> extended to the family company which operates a farm.  My experience, which would not necessarily be very great because I did not practise in a part of the country where it would be likely to crop up, and my information are that the number of farms that are operated through or by companies is very limited indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes.  I am also satisfied that where a company was incorporated, even by a family, to run a farm, the principal object of that operation was the avoidance of death duties.  One does not like talking about experiences but in my fairly considerable experience I had only one instance of a farm that was incorporated into a company and in that case death duties avoidance was the object.  That will no longer be necessary in family circumstances now.  If people are going to be caught up in this wealth tax because the farm is being run by a company, it will be a comparatively simple and inexpensive operation to put it into liquidation.  It is a very rare occurrence to have a company formed for the purpose of running a family farm.  I said that it can be unscrambled by putting the company into liquidation.  If I were to accept Deputy Colley's suggestion and apply the exemptions and reliefs to a family company I am advised that by having different shareholders and directors in cases of big farms the device could be used to avoid wealth tax, just as it was used in previous times to avoid death duties.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley stated that he appreciates that there must be some test in regard to a genuine farmer but he thinks that the provision to qualify as a genuine farmer, that 75 per cent of the wealth on the appropriate day must be agricultural property, may lead to difficulties.  We think that it is the fairest test that we can provide, that if a man is so involved in agriculture that he has 75 per cent of his wealth in it, then he has a genuine interest in agriculture and he is genuinely involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1956" /> Deputy Colley mentioned the case of a person who, by the sale of stock, might change the balance and find that on the relevant day less than 75 per cent of his wealth would consist of agricultural property.  All I will say about that individual is that he would likely be a marginal case anyway and he would very likely have considerable other property such as stocks and shares.  It would probably be doubtful whether he was ever a genuine farmer if he could be so easily transferred from one category into another.  We have provided that to qualify the farmer should be domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State.  I do not want to go into this in too much detail but our object is to try to confine these concessions and reliefs to genuine Irish farmers.  I do not think too many people will object to the policy behind that so far as it can be operated.</P>
    <P>In regard to death duties which might be a liability at 5th April last in respect of a death which had occurred prior thereto, if such a claim for death duties exists, then it will be regarded as a debt due by the individual and can be claimed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23b:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1) (b), line 53 to add &ldquo;provided that this paragraph shall not apply to debts or incumbrances incurred in the acquisition of shares in private non-trading companies to which section 7 (1) (j) refers&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) (b) of this section is intended to prohibit the deduction of debts incurred in acquiring property, which property is exempt from wealth tax under section 7.  That is not an unreasonable proposition.  Where the debt was incurred in purchasing shares in a private non-trading company the assets are subject to wealth tax and without benefit of a threshold. I presume it was not intended that in such circumstances there would be no deduction allowed in respect of the cost of the acquisition <Col N="1958" /> of the shares.  This amendment is designed to cure this.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if I give an example of the kind of situation that can arise it might make it clearer.  Let us assume that a man borrows money to take up shares in a private investment company which, in turn, purchases a portfolio of investments.  The company will be taxed without threshold because it is a private non-trading company but the man who borrowed the money to buy his investment in the company will not be allowed to deduct the amount of the debt that he incurred.  It seems, on the face of it, that this is an oversight.  I cannot believe that it was intended to achieve this effect and that is why I put down this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The private non-trading company is a taxable entity under section 6.  The assets of the company are the taxable wealth of the company.  Shares in such a company are not taxable in the hands of an assessable person. This is done to avoid taxing both the assets of the company and the shares of the company.  The exemption of shares is provided for in section 7(1) (j).</P>
      <P>Section 11 states what debts may be deducted in arriving at the net market value of the taxable wealth of an assessable person.  It also specifies the debts that may not be deducted. Among those not deductible are those referred to at paragraph (b), namely, debts which are incurred in an acquisition of exempt property.  On general principle, and to preclude tax avoidance, allowance cannot be made for debts incurred in the acquisition of exempt property.  There is no bar to the acquisition of exempt property as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person wishes to expend all his assets in the acquisition of exempt property he is free to do so.  What is not allowed is the deduction of a debt incurred to acquire such property against other taxable wealth.  An example of avoidance that allowing such a debt would give rise to is as follows: A has assets worth £250,000, tax payable on £150,000.  He borrows £100,000 to purchase exempt property. <Col N="1959" /> His assets are now £250,000, £100,000 exempt property.  Under the section, as drafted, £100,000 debt is not deductible.  In effect it is set against the £100,000 exempt property. His taxable wealth remains at £150,000 and his tax bill remains unchanged.  This result reflects the true position.  If the debt were allowed against the £250,000 his assets would be £150,000 and tax would be payable on £50,000 only instead of £150,000.</P>
    <P>It will be argued that a debt incurred in the acquisition of shares in a private non-trading company is in a somewhat different category, in view of the fact that the assets of a company are liable to tax.  An example might clarify this point.  A has taxable assets of £500,000, tax payable on £400,000.  He borrows £200,000 to purchase all the shares in a private non-trading company.  The company being taxable as an entity, would pay tax on £200,000, assuming that to be the value of the assets.  In effect, since A owns the company, A would be paying tax.  Nevertheless his taxable wealth remains at £500,000 payable on £400,000 as no allowance is permissible for the debt of £200,000.  In the circumstances this is unfair since he has paid wealth tax on £600,000&mdash;£400,000 and £200,000. The amendment seeks to remedy this situation by providing that this £200,000 should be allowed as a debt. It should be remembered that we are dealing only with companies that are investment companies, which are private companies and which are under the control of not more than five persons.  The shareholders therefore will normally be relatives of each other.  The conditions are necessary such as to lend themselves to tax avoidance.  If the amendment were accepted debts incurred in the purchase of these shares would be allowable as debts against the taxable wealth of the individual and this would immediately lead to tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>Take for example A and B who hold 60 per cent and 40 per cent respectively of the shares in such a company <Col N="1960" /> and each has taxable wealth of £500,000 apart from the shares which are not taxable wealth in their hands. Shortly before the valuation date A contracts to sell two-thirds of his holding to B, and B contracts to sell his 40 per cent holding to A, the consideration for each transaction being £300,000.  As a result of these arrangements their respective shareholdings in the company remain unchanged but each has a debt of £300,000 which under the amendment could be deducted from the £500,000 taxable wealth, thus saving tax on this amount.  The contract of sale may or may not be rescinded by the parties subsequent to the valuation date.  This collusion avoidance is available to all shareholders in this type of company.  In view of the possibilities for tax avoidance which these companies generally present and the particular further scope which the amendment would offer, the amendment proposed is not acceptable.  That is highly technical but apparently that would be the result of the amendment being accepted.</P>

      <P>I follow reasonably well the case the Minister was making. He acknowledged that the situation which arises under the Bill as it stands is unfair.  In substance, what he is saying is that to remedy this unfairness in the way suggested in this amendment would provide a vehicle for tax avoidance.  Could I ask the Minister, if that is so, is there not any device open whereby the unfairness can be got rid of but the door would not be open to tax avoidance?</P>

      <P>I should like also to know what is the position under subsection (1) (b) in regard to a life assurance policy which was mortgaged as part of a house purchase transaction.

      <P>Also, in regard to subsection (1), paragraph (c), I think the Minister will agree that very often it could take a considerable time to demonstrate that reimbursement could not be obtained.

I think that is one case that would be covered anyway. <Col N="1962" /> The point I am making is that to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that one could not, in fact, obtain reimbursement, could take quite some time, in some cases a few years.  If that were to happen the question is, would the debt be allowed to be deducted in respect of previous years' assessments as well as the current year in which it was demonstrated it could not be recovered? Remembering that wealth tax is an annual tax, this problem could be of some importance.</P>

The answer is no.  He would not be entitled to it.  He would only be entitled to an allowance in respect of the one operation when he paid it. One could not keep a debt hanging over one's head indefinitely, year after year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I am suggesting is that, if there is a debt outstanding, as long as it is outstanding and unpaid it should be deductible, assuming it is a genuine debt.  If you want to measure his net wealth, as long as he owes money, you have to deduct this to measure it.  In the special case here, as I understand it, he may have the debt and he may pay it but he will not be allowed to deduct it if he has a right of reimbursement. Only if he can demonstrate to the Revenue Commissioners that he cannot get this reimbursement will he be allowed to deduct it.  That is again a reasonable proposition.  But the question I am posing is if he demonstrates that in fact he could not get reimbursement and the demonstration of that takes a few years, what he will be demonstrating is that, say, two years previously he had this debt and he was unable to get reimbursement. Should he not therefore be allowed that deduction?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to have some degree of certainty, in so <Col N="1967" /> far as it can be obtained, in values agreed between the Revenue Commissioners and the taxpayer.  Where an accountable person has furnished all the information necessary to enable the commissioners to ascertain the market value of any property, then it seems to me that that is sufficient to have it agreed between them.  The section in subsection (1) provides:</P>
    <P>where an accountable person has furnished all the information necessary to enable the commissioners to ascertain the market value of real property or of shares which are not dealt in on a stock exchange comprised in the taxable wealth of an assessable person on a valuation date,</P>
    <P>certain things shall happen.  The purpose of this amendment is to say that these things should happen in relation to any property where the taxpayer has, as the section says, furnished all the information necessary to enable the commissioners to ascertain the market value of any property, then I am suggesting the provisions of subsection (1) should arise.  I know that further on in the subsection there are references to the real property and the stocks and shares but I am suggesting that it should cover any property and that it is not really necessary to make this distinction at all.</P>

A person in that situation with a share that is publicly traded would be pinned to the higher value, because this subsection deals with the three years and it hopes to deal with real property, that means immovables, that is the definition under the definition section&mdash;it has not the legal connotation the Deputy or I might understand it to have&mdash;and it deals with shares in the private company.

      <P>The amendment is not acceptable. If the section were so enlarged in scope it would include quoted securities. There would be no point in doing this.  The value of securities which are quoted is readily available and nobody would enter into an agreement to last for three years which could be shown in the event to be unrealistic. Neither party could be expected to agree, for three years, to the value of a portfolio of securities as a whole either.  Apart from being sold and reinvested or spent there could be extraordinary fluctuations in the value of individual units in the portfolio over a period of three years. Once factors such as those must be taken into account for individual units there would be no advantage to either party to agree a portfolio as a whole over a period of three years. The chances of the agreement being entered into or remaining would be removed.  When account is taken of the exemptions for chattels, livestock, bloodstock, artistic objects, growing trees, there is very little personal property left to value, apart from securities, whether quoted or not. That is the thinking behind this.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to Deputy Esmonde to get the picture of what I was trying to achieve one has <Col N="1969" /> to look at the next amendment too.  I was trying to achieve a situation in which, on the one hand, you could have a degree of certainty, say for three years, if there were agreement between the Revenue Commissioners and the taxpayers.  If, on the other hand, either the Revenue Commissioners or the taxpayer felt that there was a change in the situation which would warrant going back on the agreement then they should each have the right to do so.  As the section stands the Revenue Commissioners have the right to do so but the taxpayer under subsection (1) would be bound for three years, no matter what material changes occurred.  I was trying to achieve, in the combination of the two, that if both parties agree and are satisfied then the agreement can operate for three years but if either party is dissatisfied that they have equal rights to revoke the agreement because of material changes coming about.  Perhaps it might be in order if I could move the next amendment at the same time.</P>

      <P>Very well.  There is one point I wish to make in regard to amendment No. 23d.  It could be argued that as the amendment is worded it would omit the situation arising in the event of fraud or non-disclosure of material facts.  If that is so, I would have no objection to its being included.  As the section stands it seems that it is pretty well loaded in favour of the Revenue Commissioners. For instance, subsection (1) (a) refers to and envisages an increase or decrease but paragraph (b) does not refer to or envisage an increase or a decrease in the value.  It says &ldquo;a material change&rdquo;, whereas (a) materially increases or decreases.</P>

The first paragraph refers to &ldquo;which would materially increase or decrease the market value&rdquo;. The second paragraph refers to &ldquo;a material change in the assets of the company or in their market value&rdquo;. There may be some significance in the different phrasing.  It seems to me that under the arrangement in the section the taxpayer can do nothing for three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have a rather extensive note here that might be helpful to Deputy Colley if I put it on the record.  I am not sure that I understand Deputy <Col N="1972" /> Colley's amendment.  However, to ensure that there is no misunderstanding in the proviso I propose to set out briefly what it seeks to do.  It provides that the agreed values are not binding if there is a failure to disclose material values in relation to any part of the taxable wealth of the assessable person.  The reason for this is obvious.  The necessity for the reference to any part of the taxable wealth may not be so obvious.  An example will explain&mdash;agreement could be reached very speedily on the value of property where the taxable thresholds are not reached.  The matter would be academic for both parties.  However, such agreement might not have been reached if the Revenue Commissioners had been aware of other property which brought the aggregated wealth above the threshold of liability.  The Commissioners must, therefore, have the right to reopen valuations in such circumstances.  This approach benefits the taxpayer and the Revenue in cases where there is no question of non-disclosure.  It makes for flexibility and ensures that time and energy are not wasted by either side when there is little or nothing at stake.  Most of us have had the experience of submitting a schedule of assets where there was a small estate and where there was obviously no liability for death duties.  There was no difficulty at all with the Revenue Commissioners if no liability was obvious.  It was different if there was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the proviso set out further circumstances in which agreed values may be reopened. Paragraph (a) relates to real estate and provides that where there is a change in the tenure under which the property is held or let the agreed value may be reopened.  This would apply for instance where new terms of a lease were negotiated within the three-year period or where a person with a leasehold interest acquired the fee simple.  Further if there is any change whatever whether affecting the real estate in question or any other property which would materially increase or decrease the market value of the property the value may be reopened.  Even though the reference here is to &ldquo;any change <Col N="1973" /> whatever&rdquo; the value of the property has to increase or decrease materially, so that a change which causes a slight change in value would not be sufficient to have the value reopened.  The increase or decrease must, however, be over and above any increase or decrease which might be normally expected apart from the change.  The increase or decrease which would normally be expected might be due to the rise or fall in market value due to the economic climate, so that an increase due to inflation or a decrease due to recession would not be a ground for reopening an agreed value.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the proviso applies to shares which are not quoted on the stock exchange.  If there is an alteration in the capital or ownership of the capital or the rights of the shareholders <i>inter se</i> an agreed value is no longer binding.  The capital of the company in this context is the share capital, so that if there is an alteration due to, say, the issue of further shares, the redemption of shares, the transfer of shares by one shareholder to another or the passing of a resolution which alters the rights attaching to the shares and, therefore, the rights of the shareholders <i>inter se</i> the agreed value is no longer binding.  Neither will an agreed value remain binding if there is a material change in the assets of the company or in the market value of the assets of the company over and above what might normally be expected.  Normal fluctuations or changes in assets or in their values are ignored, for example those brought about by favourable or unfavourable trading conditions.</P>
    <P>The subsection ends by stating that the market value may be ascertained again by the Revenue Commissioners for each of the relevant valuation dates.  This does not necessarily mean that the agreed value would be changed for any one or all three of the valuation dates.  It merely means that the values for each of the three dates might be reconsidered.  Changes which take place before the third valuation date only are taken into account.  Changes taking place after that date are ignored as far as the agreed valuation is concerned.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the agreement <Col N="1974" /> can be reopened by either side where these conditions arise.  I am not entirely clear what Deputy Colley intends in his amendment beyond that under his amendment the Commissioners could not reopen the agreed valuation even if there were failure to disclose material facts.  There is no time limit as to when the event must occur which materially increases or decreases the agreed value.  In the Bill it must occur within the three years. The Commissioners' powers to reopen are less wide in the Bill, certainly as regards non-quoted shares.  On the first ground the amendment is unacceptable.  Perhaps, however, in the light of all the factors the Deputy might consider withdrawing the amendment.  The section is fair and reasonable as between the Commissioners and the taxpayer and it is not, as Deputy Colley seems to suggest, weighted in favour of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>As I indicated earlier it might be said, as indeed the Minister said in reading from his brief, that this amendment did not take into account the non-disclosure of material facts.

It is not a matter, I must confess, in respect of which I am imbued with a crusading spirit. Therefore I have no objection to withdrawing the amendments as the Minister has suggested.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to procure for a husband and wife an equal threshold with two single people or a separated couple.  The section is worded as, indeed, are earlier sections in the Bill by reference to an individual whose wife is living with him.  I do not wish to go back over all the ground we went over before, but I do want to record again my view that the actual drafting of this Bill and provisions of it, as worked out, clearly reveal an intention to treat a married woman living with her husband as an appendage to the husband, and brought in because it is necessary to bring her in but for no other reason. The practical effect of this approach is to deprive her of a threshold which would be available either to a single <Col N="1976" /> person or to married couples who are separated.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve that kind of equality it would be necessary to accept this amendment and to provide that at least in the case of the husband and wife together the threshold would be £140,000 as double the amount of the £70,000 for the single person.  The £70,000 is not only the allowance for the single person.  It is also the allowance for each of the partners of a separated marriage, if I may put it that way.  I believe this should be done both from the point of view of equity and from the point of view of giving recognition to the role and status of a married woman who is living with her husband.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> When we discussed section 4 Deputy Colley argued quite strongly that there should be a separate threshold in respect of a husband and a wife and that threshold should be £70,000 in each case.  I pointed out then that the effect of that would be to reduce the married allowance or married threshold provided in the Bill.  Deputy Colley's argument then was that the husband and wife should each retain a single threshold of £70,000.  I pointed out that the effect of that would be a loss of threshold in many cases.  In most Irish situations one or other of the spouses has the wealth and the other may have little or none. It is usually the husband who has the wealth because he inherits the family farm or the family business.</P>
      <P>I also pointed out on that occasion&mdash; I will not go over all the ground again &mdash;that to do what Deputy Colley was suggesting then would bring economic pressure to bear on the husband to transfer a portion of his wealth to his wife, a portion of his farm, a portion of his business, in order to avail of the threshold, and that might lead to difficult situations and have consequences which were not thought of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The threshold provided for a married couple is £100,000.  Deputy Colley has drawn attention to the fact that, in the Bill in various places, we refer to the individual whose wife is living with him and he goes on to make the <Col N="1977" /> political point that, in some way or another, that is a reflection on the wife and regards her as an appendage of the husband.  There is no such reflection intended good, bad, or indifferent. The actual fact is that we have to have an accountable person and in a family situation where there is a man and a wife and minor children, the accountable person is the husband and reference, therefore, is made to the wife.</P>
    <P>In this amendment Deputy Colley, as he is perfectly entitled to do, makes a different case from that which he made on section 4 and says now that there should be two individual thresholds of £70,000 each but that there should be a joint threshold of £140,000. I cannot accept that because I do not think it is necessary.  What I am doing in the Bill is striking a happy medium between Deputy Colley's suggestion on section 4 of providing an effective threshold of £70,000 for the husband, unless he divested himself of some of his wealth in order to qualify for a double one, and the joint one here of a £140,000.  I am striking a happy medium and I am providing a married threshold of £100,000 which I think is reasonable.</P>
    <P>There are reasons why a double threshold is not necessary.  First of all, I repeat that two people living together &mdash;and I am not suggesting that they can live cheaper than one&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very oldfashioned idea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am not suggesting that they can live cheaper than one person, but I am suggesting that they can live cheaper than two people living separately, and distinct and apart.  There is also the exemption of the family home and its contents.  The provision of an exemption from wealth tax of the family home and its contents, in a wealth tax situation where you have comparatively wealthy people, much more than compensates for the £40,000 Deputy Colley seeks.  Deputy Colley is saying that a married couple should have twice the threshold of two single people.  I say that a married <Col N="1978" /> couple in every case will have a threshold of £100,000 and, in addition, the family home and its contents will be exempt.  That is a reasonable approach.</P>
      <P>I will concede that there is more force to the case Deputy Colley is making now for the £140,000 threshold than for the two separate thresholds of £70,000 for the husband and £70,000 for the wife which he made on section 4.  The more I thought of that argument the less merit I saw in it and the more pitfalls I saw in it.  In this situation, I do not think there is a necessity or justification for doubling. Deputy Colley now accepts the basis of a married threshold by suggesting it should be £140,000.  I agree with this principle but I do not agree that the married threshold should be double the single threshold for the reasons I have given.</P>
      <P>Other countries provide thresholds. Some of them give a greater threshold for a married couple than for a single person: others do not.  I will just put this on record.  This amendment seeks to increase the threshold of liability of a husband and wife from £100,000 to £140,000, double the threshold of £70,000 which is available for a single person.  The aggregation of the property of a husband and wife for the purpose of wealth tax seems to be the practice everywhere.  Various countries differ in treatment of the thresholds for married couples as against single persons.  The figures below set out the position in European countries.  It can be seen that in Sweden and Denmark there is no distinction. The threshold is the same for a married couple and a single person. In Norway and the Netherlands the threshold for married couples is about one-third greater.  In Finland it is one-fifth greater.  In the remainder, Germany and Luxembourg, the threshold is doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill, as drafted, the threshold is increased for married couples by about 43 per cent.  The comparison, however, does not end there.  The thresholds for married persons here is about three times greater than in the highest European threshold.  It is significant that, in the <Col N="1979" /> countries where the thresholds are doubled, Germany and Luxembourg, the thresholds for married persons are as low as £24,000 and £2,200 respectively.  In the light of these facts and additionally in the context of the other reliefs and exemptions in the Bill, there is no case for increasing the threshold to £140,000.  I must accordingly reject the amendment.</P>
    <P>However, if the Deputy insists that married persons should have a double threshold, I am quite prepared to consider that.  I would then have to reduce the individual threshold to £50,000 each.  If left to my own devices, I am against the individual threshold for the reasons stated.  I do not think it lends itself to the Irish situation.  I do not think it lends itself to the case where the husband usually owns the business, or the farm, and usually wishes to pass it on. The converse could be the case, too. I made the argument the last day in regard to where a man on an income married a lady who was a farmer with a business.  If we were to have the two thresholds she might be pressured economically to transfer her property, or a considerable proportion of it, to her husband in order to qualify for a threshold, and that might not have desirable results either.  What we have done here is the reasonable thing.  We have given a 43 per cent higher threshold for a married couple than for a single person and we have done what no other wealth tax country has done: we have given exemption for the residence and its contents.</P>

      <P>I do.  The reason I raise this here now is that the Minister seemed to concede in an earlier amendment that Deputy Colley's interpretation of an analogous phrase in that sense was right.  There is one practical aspect of the problem.  It would arise only where substantial property was involved.  The £40,000 difference Deputy Colley is talking about will not mean a lot of money to the Revenue here.  If it did, that would be an argument in its own right.  There is not a lot of money involved. There are other considerations involved such as the one I have raised just now.  What is the construction to be put on the phrase &ldquo;is living with him on that date&rdquo; in relation to either Deputy Colley's amendment or the section as it stands?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have overlooked the fact that it is defined.  A certain stage can be reached, and this is a social problem with married couples, at a certain stage of their lives, that if they have the wealth necessary to make them consider the threshold seriously, there is a positive <Col N="1981" /> inducement here to separation.  The Minister may shrug his shoulders at that but it is not unknown that this type of problem arises for other reasons with married people at a later stage in life.  The Minister might find more cases in which people opted for the single allowance and double residence than he might have allowed for.  Would that be a good social consequence?  All these things suggest that possibly it might be well to make the allowance double the single one.  If this is done, I fail to follow the necessity for arguing that we must halve the single one.</P>
      <P>I am back to the point of the difference of £40,000 in wealth.  If it is taxable it is not going to occur in a large number of cases as yet.  It is going to be a relatively insignificant sum for the Revenue.  On the other hand, I freely allow that as inflation is going these limits may be such that this will not be talked about as a wealth tax; it will be talked about as a poverty tax, if you know the distinction I am making.  At the moment it is property that is above certain thresholds and the Minister, and the Government, are selling it as a tax on wealthy people who can pay for the benefit of people who cannot pay, to achieve the equality of wealth, but if inflation continues at the present rate a situation can arise where, in the future, this will be found to be a more general property tax.  With a little forethought, therefore, I suggest that the Minister give consideration to Deputy Colley's figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to comparisons with other countries, my point is reinforced by the observation that the Minister will find, when he looks at thresholds fixed for other countries, that they were fixed before this rampant general inflation afflicted the Western economy.  Desperate efforts are being made to control that inflation.  Nevertheless, it is estimated that this year the order of the inflation will be about one-fifth, 20 per cent.  If this goes on it will not be long before these sums are of such proportions that they will be little better than the proportions in income tax allowances to the sums involved. <Col N="1982" /> These arguments are worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The inflation that is reflected on the face of the Book of Estimates is to a large degree housekeeping inflation. The cost of running the State. If that type of inflation continues it will not be long before a figure of £100,000 is equivalent to what £10,000 is today.  With these arguments there is merit, apart from anything else, in Deputy Colley's suggestion, and I do not think, even if the Minister takes the principle of separateness which he does not like, it follows that he must cut the single allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that there is a principle involved here. There is a principle of a different kind, a principle of equality.  Marriage, after all, is a partnership.  I would prefer to see a joint figure, transferable, rather than two separate ones.  That would be a much better arrangement.</P>
      <P>What is happening here is if two people marry, both of them, depending on their circumstances, are being deprived of the difference or half the difference, which Deputy Colley is talking about.  Where they separately qualify for a residence each they now qualify for one residence when they marry.  I am inclined to agree with the Minister in a sense, depending on the inflationary situation, in regard to thresholds and, particularly, in regard to the residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not quote European examples because they are not good arguments.  For example, in the case of Germany, income tax charges are allowable, so that the rate of 1 per cent can come down as low as 4 per cent against our 1 per cent.  That sort of argument does not carry a lot of weight.  Everybody is inclined to say that the wife, in effect, ceases to be a full person because when she gets married it is moved up.  I suppose it can cut the other way.  It could be the husband who is dropping the £40,000 in some circumstances and not the wife.  There is a principle of equality here.  It is a principle which has been spoken about a lot and is an idea <Col N="1983" /> adopted by the European Community. The Commissioners are in a better position to assess it than we on this side of the House but I do not think there could be an awful lot.  The Minister is introducing new legislation and most of the members of the European Community&mdash;four of them have a wealth tax and three or four have not&mdash;if they were introducing it today would be considering the principle of equality.  They would be considering allowing the two people about to be married to become the equal of two single people for tax purposes, using the overall sum of £140,000 Deputy Colley suggested beneficially within the marriage.</P>

      <P>I am not going back over the ground Deputy de Valera and Deputy Brugha covered because they put forward a number of points I would otherwise have made.  On the last occasion we discussed this the Minister put forward certain arguments in favour of a joint threshold and against separate thresholds for a husband and wife.  I do not agree with the argument he was putting forward but this amendment at least gave him the opportunity of accepting the <Col N="1985" /> principle.  When it came to the crunch he may have accepted the principle but not the practice and that is what counts.  The Minister found himself unable to agree that although single people and separated married people are entitled as individuals to a threshold of £70,000 plus residence, he could not agree to a threshold of £140,000, plus one residence for a married couple.  It is unfortunate he could not agree but hardly surprising in view of the line which he, and his colleagues, have taken in regard to this whole question of the role of women, and the role of married women in particular.  There is a good deal of propaganda but when it comes to the crunch, this is what we get.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23f:</P>
      <P>In page 16, after line 32 to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Each of the sums mentioned in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) and in the proviso to subparagraph (c) of subsection (1) shall be appropriately increased on the 5th day of April, 1976 and on every subsequent valuation date in accordance with the calculations of the Central Statistics Office relating to the reduction, if any, in the value of one Irish Pound, during the period of one year commencing on the next preceding valuation date and such increased sums, if any, shall be deemed to be inserted in place of the corresponding sums in subsection (1) on the appropriate valuation date.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to build in in the threshold set out in the section provision for adjustment in line with inflation.  I want to suggest that with inflation running as it is at the moment here at 25 per cent per annum it is simply sharp practice not to build into this section such a provision.  I know the members of the Government frequently made a point in regard to the wealth tax to the effect that it will affect a very small number of people. What they mean is a very small number of people will have to pay it. In fact, it is going to affect every single person in the country, but even in so far as one can say that a small number <Col N="1987" /> of people will be obliged to pay it, that certainly will not remain true for very long if inflation continues at anything like the rate it is going and if this amendment is not accepted or something very similar to it.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite clear that inflation, if it is to continue at anything like its present rate, will bring in many thousands of people to liability for wealth tax, people who think that it can never apply to them in the way of their having to pay it.  I indicated in connection with another matter on an earlier section&mdash;but it illustrates the kind of thing that is happening&mdash;that if we assume an average rate of inflation of 15 per cent over the next ten years, in ten years' time a particular grade of civil servant will have an annual salary of £44,500 per annum with no improvement whatever in his standard of living over today.  That gives a fair indication of what is going to happen with inflation running at this level.  By the way, as I say, I take an average of 15 per cent per annum as against a 25 per cent per annum at the moment.  I feel it is simply not good enough if the Minister is going to say to us, as the Minister for Finance did before, that the Government will review this from time to time.  Three-yearly intervals, I think, was mentioned by somebody as the interval for review. Maybe the Minister for Lands would say it would be at shorter intervals but it simply is not good enough with inflation running as it is not to build in provision for it.  The refusal of the Government to do it in this Bill and in the Capital Gains Tax Bill, I suggest, is very ominous.</P>
    <P>It is one thing if the Government were to argue that it was not necessary, but clearly they cannot argue that but to fob off the provision for inflation by saying, &ldquo;Well, we will do it in due course when it is necessary: we will review it from time to time&rdquo;, immediately raises the question, if the Government are prepared to do that, why not build it in now.</P>
    <P>One is also reminded of the fact that promises were given to review in the same way in the light of inflation income tax allowances, with the clear <Col N="1988" /> indication that they be adjusted at least in line with inflation where in fact that did happen.  The adjustment was considerably less than inflation. For all these reasons, it seems to me the Minister should accept this amendment or another version of it, if the Minister wishes&mdash;in fact, at this remove from the time I put down the amendment I could improve the wording of it myself.  It is not so much the wording of this amendment that I am concerned with as acceptance of the principle that we should build into this section automatic adjustment of the thresholds in line with inflation.  If the Government fail to do that, as I say, it is ominous when one combines it with the refusal to do it in regard to the capital gains tax, and I can only suggest that there is a clear intention on the part of the Government to bring more and more people into the wealth tax net as distinct from the impression which the Government are at present trying to give that the wealth tax will apply only to a few people who are very wealthy.  The test of the Government's intentions in this regard arises on this amendment and on the reaction of the Minister to this amendment, not in relation to the wording of it but in relation to the principle of it.  If the Minister is not terribly happy with the wording of this that does not put me off in any way.  But if the Minister were to say that he accepted the principle and would introduce his own amendment to effect it, then he would be establishing the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government in this regard.  But unless he is prepared to say that, it is reasonable, to say the least, to suspect that the intention of the Government is to bring in to the wealth tax net as many people as possible in the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The amendment proposes a statutory adjustment mechanism whereby the thresholds would on 5th April in the year 1976 and in each subsequent year be increased to take account of the estimated reduction in the value of the Irish £ in the year commencing on the next preceding valuation date, namely, that on 5th April, 1976, if the rate of inflation in the period 5th <Col N="1989" /> April, 1975, to 5th April, 1976, were 25 per cent the threshold for a married man would be increased from £100,000 to £125,000.</P>
      <P>That I accept the principle involved in Deputy Colley's amendment is an indisputable fact.  Since the White Paper was published the Minister for Finance has repeated in this House and elsewhere the Government's commitment to reviewing the thresholds for the new capital taxes to take account of inflation.  In so far as the wealth tax is concerned there is a firm commitment on the record of this House to review the thresholds in 1978.  The maintenance of the thresholds now proposed in the Bill for three years should be looked at in conjunction with the section 12 provision to accept values agreed in 1975 for the next two valuation dates also. There is therefore a frozen situation for a three-year period.</P>
      <P>Naturally when the thresholds come to be reviewed before the 1978 valuation date, the change in the value of money between now and then will be one of the factors to be taken into account in making adjustments. It should be remembered that the weight of the wealth tax can be varied by changing other elements of the tax, for example, the rates, exemptions, reliefs, and ceiling provisions, apart altogether from the thresholds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a new tax such as wealth tax it is acknowledged that in the first year extra work will arise for the taxpayer and his advisers and for Revenue in arriving at valuations and agreeing assessments.  Once having agreed this year's valuation and assessment in the light of the provisions of the Bill, I am sure that the work involved in compliance and administration in the immediately succeeding years will be that much lighter.  It was with a view to a further easing of the burden that the Bill provided, in section 12, for the freezing of valuations for the next two valuation dates.  Naturally if the valuation is frozen, except in the particular circumstances indicated in the section, it is logical that the thresholds should also be frozen for the same period.  This is why the Government's <Col N="1990" /> commitment to review the thresholds refers to a three-year period rather than to a one- or twoyear period.  The greater degree of certainty and the reduction in compliance costs which this three-yearly revision of valuations and thresholds will give to wealth tax payers will I am sure be generally welcomed by them.</P>
    <P>In short therefore I am at one with Deputy Colley in recognising the need for review of thresholds to take account of inflation.  I differ from him in so far as I do not accept as the sole indicator or criterion for such review the CPI index mentioned by him.</P>
    <P>Other factors and other indicators would be relevant.  I do not accept that the inclusion of a review provision in the Bill is any more guarantee of meeting his wishes in this regard than the firm Government commitment already given to such review.  I have provided in the Bill for a freezing of valuations once agreed for a three-year period, the commitment to review the thresholds also refers to a three-year period.  For those reasons I do not think the amendment is necessary and I do not propose to accept it.</P>

      <P>It would appear from what the Minister says that he accepts the principle advocated by Deputy Colley.  The only real point of disagreement between Deputy Colley and the Minister is the question of whether or not the consumer price index should be the criterion for the judgement for inflation in future.  To my mind that is a rather minor point. If the Minister feels that some other criteria are relevant to the judgment of inflation or purposes of this particular tax, he should say so.  We might be able to agree with whatever formula of additional criteria besides the CPI the Minister might wish to suggest.  I ask him, if he feels something further is necessary, to tell us what it is.  There is every possibility that we would agree to that.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister for Finance on a number of occasions has given a firm commitment to review the thresholds at the end of three years in the light of <Col N="1991" /> the working of the Bill and in the light of the change in money values and in the light of inflation.  This is an annual tax which will be taken as a criterion for the operation of other taxes.  It would not be possible to write an inflation clause into this measure without writing an inflation clause into the income tax code.  I think the Deputy will accept that.  It would not be understood. This is an annual tax; so is income tax.  If an inflationary clause was written into this an equal case could be made for writing it into the income tax code.  It is not written into the income tax code.  It never has been. Tax here is virtually frozen for three years.  Therefore there is no inflationary safety valve necessary for that period. The Minister for Finance has on several occasions committed himself to review the threshold and/or the rates of allowances, thresholds and so on, to have regard to the situation three years from now.  That is as good a guarantee as can be given.  It is not reasonable to ask for more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in what he has had to say secondly in relation to this amendment differs markedly from what he had to say firstly.  Firstly, when he read out the brief he was all sweet reasoning, telling us how right Deputy Colley was. He then came to the gist of his objections the second time.  I cannot accept that because there is not an inflationary clause in the Income Tax Act, therefore we cannot have it in this.  There is not such a clause in the Income Tax Acts, but it has been strongly advocated that there should be such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole question of inflation and taxation whether it is income or capital taxation has really only become important in the last two or twoand-a-half years.  Up to 1973 we never had inflation in the country at a figure in excess of 10 per cent per annum. We now have a figure of 25.2 per cent up to mid-May this year.  When inflation was in single figures it was not vitally important.  It affected a lot of people but only to the extent of a fraction of its present effect.  The fact <Col N="1992" /> that we have not yet had an inflationary clause written into the Income Tax Acts does not prevent us having one in a Finance Bill which will come up here within the next week or two. If the Government so choose, they have a perfect vehicle for it.  A section could be inserted in the Finance Bill without any great difficulty.</P>
    <P>I recall the Minister for Finance promising last year in general terms that the allowances in relation to income tax would rise in future at the same rate as inflation rose from year to year.  This year unfortunately the increase in allowances lagged far behind the rate of inflation over the past year.  There is no validity in the Minister's argument.  It is open to the Government to change the income tax law within the next week.  They will certainly get no opposition from this side of the House if they chose to put an anti-inflationary clause in the income tax code.  We feel that in justice it should be here and in the income tax code.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the fact that under section 12 valuations were frozen for the first three years.  It appears that this only applies to real property shares not dealt with in the stock exchange.  That is a very limited category of property.  Real property&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The obvious exception to this is quoted shares.  Most people of some wealth would have a great proportion of their wealth in quoted shares.  It makes no allowance for people who can acquire certain property during that period.  Presumably a 75 per cent valuation cannot apply to something that is acquired after valuation date in 1975.  Cash is an obvious example also, together with a whole series of other movable chattels and various other forms of <Col N="1993" /> property.  The Minister tells us that no problem will be caused to anyone because there is a firm commitment to review in three years' time.  It depends of course on what meaning you wish to put on words, but as I understood it there was a firm commitment on the part of the Government last year to review income tax allowances this year in the light of inflation and that they failed to do. They increased them somewhat but at a rate that was way below the rate of inflation.  Is the firm commitment that the Minister for Lands talks about now in relation to this the same sort of firm commitment?  Is it going to be honoured or not honoured in the same way as the firm commitment in relation to income tax was not honoured?</P>
      <P>The Minister speaks of a three-year period as if it were just a very short time, that inflation could not have any great effect in that period.  I would like to point out to the Minister that if inflation continues to run at the rates it ran last year and this year after a three-year period the nominal increase in the value of property would be something over 80 per cent. That is 25 per cent per annum for three years compounded.  It would be perhaps 81 or 82 per cent.  To say that that is not significant, as the Minister I think seeks to imply, is just ludicrous. It will mean that on paper any piece of property which is not a wasting asset will nominally be worth 81 or 82 per cent more in 1978 than it is in 1975. Everybody knows that that piece of property will not be worth any more in real terms, which are the only terms that matter.  To say, therefore, that there is a firm commitment to look into this thing again after three years is a joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If equities were to increase in value at the annual rate of inflation, which unhappily they do not do nowadays but in theory they should, nominally they would be worth 82 per cent more in 1978 than they are in 1975.  Nobody could suggest that they are worth any more in real terms because they are not, they will not be and they could not be.  The increase in real terms in that period, assuming the current rate of inflation, would only take place when the increase in their value over <Col N="1994" /> the three-year period exceeds 82 per cent.  Therefore, to have a situation in which a capital tax is charged on an annual basis without any reference to or allowance for inflation, at a time when inflation is running at more than one-quarter, is patently unfair.</P>
    <P>The fact that you are dealing at the moment with a small number of people who may not evince much sympathy from the great mass of the public does not get away from the fact that this is an inequitable proposition on the part of the Government. Equally, it does not get away from the fact, as Deputy Colley has pointed out clearly, that many thousands of people who today think that wealth tax has nothing to do with them in the sense that they are not now liable, and never will be liable in their opinion, will be liable by 1978. God only knows what the rate of tax will be at that stage.  It may not be the comparatively low rate which is in the Bill at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley has put across the need for this amendment very clearly and very cogently.  It is self-evident. The Minister seeks not to disagree with the principle but on spurious grounds he refuses to accept the amendment.  I do not think he can have it both ways.  If the amendment is right in principle as the Minister feels it is, then I think it should be accepted, and the fact that there is a constant valuation for some limited number of things for three years is not relevant.  The majority of assets are not subject to that constant valuation for three years and, as I pointed out to the Minister, if inflation continues at its present rate&mdash; and the indications are that it probably will&mdash;then even though someone's assets increase on paper by 82 per cent between now and 1978 they will be worth no more to him than they are today.  If the change as suggested in this amendment is not made there will be the situation that people will be paying far more than they could envisage and, equally importantly, thousands of people who are not now within the net and could not see themselves within the net will be in the net well before 1978.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has given rise to quite a deal of discussion by people outside the House. To allay the fears of the public the Minister has quite categorically given an undertaking to review the threshold and other elements that are involved in this wealth tax in three years' time.  I want to refer to the fact you are not just dealing with thresholds under this Bill.  You are dealing with the various items that go into the taxable entity and that includes matters like exemption and partial exemption and systems of valuation.  All of us have to admit that in the last five or ten years the world has really turned upside down in financial terms, not alone in inflation but in respect of the different values being put on different properties.  What I am getting at is that you can have different properties, some of which will appreciate in value and others which will not appreciate in value.  One cannot look at matters at this time and say what is the proper way to measure wealth or measure the threshold in three years' time.  It would be very dangerous for us to pin ourselves to any particular criteria on which a review should be based in three years' time.  I mention the fact of different properties and different exemptions.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has dealt at some length with the matter of inflation. You should bear in mind that when you are dealing with matters of inflation you might only be dealing with consumer goods which go to the consumer price index.  You may not necessarily have the necessary capital element to give a proper reflection in the consumer price index.  We should also bear in mind that the expected and accepted and demanded income from assets does not always go up or down with the value of the assets.  All one has to look at is the price of Government securities quoted on the stock exchange to see how the capital value of Government securities goes up and down like yo-yos because they are trying to adjust the income on those Government securities with the income that is obtained from other securities in a different section of the financial market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1996" /> One would be taking an unwarranted and a very ill-advised step to pin oneself to any particular basis on which the review should take place.  I think the Minister has made it quite clear in his undertaking to this House and to the country on behalf of the Government that a person who is exempted and has a certain threshold in relation to his property today will get the comparable threshold and exemptions in three years' time.  That is quite clear from the Minister's undertaking and that is the way it is interpreted by the public. Deputy O'Malley is a lawyer and I am a lawyer.  I have never seen any clause in any lease that provides for a review in the wording or on the basis as presented in this proposed amendment.</P>

If you pin yourself to something like this, I think the taxpayer could lose out badly on this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy conceded that this is a very difficult area to define.  The criteria of values may be completely different in 1978 and one may have to look at properties from a completely different angle.  I think that in all seriousness a taxpayer would be very ill-advised to have himself pinned down to something like this.  For instance, the cost of living might not go up 25 per cent but the value of land might go up 30 per cent per annum although it is exactly the same property.  If the taxpayer pins himself to the consumer price index he is a dead loser on that in 1978.  He would be pinning himself to something of this nature if in an Act he tries to legislate for 1978 when we do not know what the circumstances will be then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be the height of negligence to agree to a clause of this sort.  I am not criticising Deputy Colley personally on this.  I can see a frightful difficulty in trying to draft a clause that will be fair for the taxpayer.  I believe that Deputy Colley's intent is to assist the taxpayer in his situation, but I do no think he is doing that.  He might be putting a noose around the taxpayer's neck.  Once it is written into a statute it is going to be very hard to get it out, and that is why I disagree with this proposed amendment.  I appreciate the spirit and I go along with it.  We said that from this side of <Col N="1999" /> the House.  There is no doubt about that.  We are in common agreement on that, but the question is how to do it and I do not agree with this method.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have made some progress in regard to this matter when we now find that both the Minister and Deputy Esmonde agree in principle with us.  This first arose in connection with the capital gains tax and there was no agreement in principle from the other side.  We have made that much progress.</P>
      <P>I think it is important in the context of this proposal to build in a protection against inflation in relation to the thresholds and to bear in mind again that this Bill is taxing productive assets.  With regard to people in the distributive trade and their stock in trade, what will happen to the value of that stock and trade over a period of three years in money terms, with no real increase in stock, assuming inflation to continue at something like its present rate?  One can see immediately the enormous damage that can be inflicted unless something is done about it.</P>
      <P>I must give Deputy Esmonde credit for having put forward very well an ingenious argument as to why we should not do this, but he left out one vital element in the whole thing, that is, he presented the matter as though we had a choice between putting in an amendment of this kind or putting in a better provision that would reflect more accurately what precisely was going to happen or that would have that effect in due course. That is not the choice we are faced with.  The choice is either to leave the section with no provision whatever for adjusting for inflation, or to take this amendment which without hesitation I admit does not cover all situations. Deputy Esmonde thought that to accept this could put a noose around the neck of some taxpayers, say, somebody who had real property which might increase, say, by 30 per cent per annum if the inflation rate were only 25 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that Deputy Esmonde is omitting the very vital part of it, that this section contains no provision whatever for adjustment? Furthermore if a taxpayer were to find himself in the position envisaged by Deputy Esmonde he would not get an adjustment fully in line with the adjustment that had occurred in the value of his property, he would at least under this get such adjustment as related to the consumer price index.  If Deputy Esmonde were all that concerned about it, no doubt he would do his best to ensure that the Bill would be amended to cover the situation of this man who had a particular property adjusted at a different rate from that provided in this.  This would not be impossible, but the important thing is that we build in now a provision for adjustment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alternative we are offered is an assurance by the Minister on behalf of the Government that this review will take place in three years' time.  I do not wish to cast any undue aspersions on an undertaking from the Government but I do want to say that even if that means&mdash;it does not mean it but even if it were to mean it&mdash;that in three years' time these thresholds would be adjusted in line with inflation, in the meantime what is going to happen to people whose property is being affected in this way.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, the provision in the other earlier section does not cover quite a number of items which would be affected by wealth tax.  That is number one.  Number two, we had a similar <Col N="2001" /> amendment to this down to last year's Finance Bill and it was resisted with exactly the same argument and an assurance was given and an undertaking was given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is mistaken, but if he thinks there was no inflation in 1973&mdash;I know as compared with now it might seem so&mdash;in fact inflation was a problem in 1973.  An amendment of this kind was resisted by the Government and in substitution we were offered an undertaking to review the following year the income tax allowances.  They were reviewed.  What happened?  Inflation was 25 per cent and the adjustment was 15 per cent. None of the criteria that Deputy Esmonde was talking about came into this one.  This was a straightforward adjustment in line with inflation as measured by the consumer price index. That is what happened.</P>
      <P>In the light of that history does Deputy Esmonde seriously suggest that a taxpayer would choose this section as it stands and the undertaking that we heard as against an amendment inserted into the section on the lines we are discussing?  Nobody in his senses would make that choice.  Some adjustment, however imperfect, is better than none at all.  If we are going to talk about the method by which you are going to measure the different inflation that occurs in regard to different assets we could argue about this until the year 2000 and nothing will be done about it.  What is important is what is done now in this section today.  That is what is really important.  That is what people will use as the test to judge the Government's intentions in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the facts I have outlined and particularly what happened in relation to the similar amendment moved to the Finance Act and the manner in which that was resisted and the reasons given and what happened to that, there is no reason why anybody should accept <Col N="2002" /> with any degree of confidence that they can expect to get the same benefit from the undertaking given on behalf of the Government as they would get by the insertion of this amendment.</P>
    <P>For that reason I want to urge the Minister to demonstrate the Government's <i>bona fides</i> in this matter by accepting this or a similar amendment &mdash;if he wants to draft it and put it in at the Report Stage I will be very happy with that situation&mdash;by accepting the amendment rather than refusing it and asking us to rely on the kind of undertaking that was given in relation to the Finance Act with the result that flowed from that.  Failure to do this can only be interpreted in the way I indicated earlier as an unwillingness on the part of the Government to make the adjustments that are necessary.  If such an amendment were incorporated and if it were necessary subsequently to make other adjustments for the relief of the taxpayer on the lines outlined by Deputy Esmonde, there is nothing to prevent that being done.  What is important is what is done now.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This Government are pledged and committed to a fair system of taxation. That is the reason that we introduced the capital gains tax, to have some fair relationship between the PAYE system of income tax and complete freedom from tax on huge capital gains.  This Government are committed to a fair system of taxation.  That is why we abolished death duties.  In looking around for a tax to replace death duties one of the factors we decided upon was wealth tax.  We published a White Paper and before we introduced this Wealth Tax Bill we gave very detailed consideration to the proposals. The best assurance and the best guarantee that the taxpayers have in regard to this Government's future operations in regard to tax is their thinking on wealth tax as outlined in the Bill.  I put it without fear of contradiction, that in this Bill we have a reasonable wealth tax.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> A fair and a reasonable wealth tax. The more Deputy Colley argues about it and the more he keeps us in this House, the more clearly it is being brought home to the people that it is a fair system of wealth tax.  The <Col N="2004" /> longer Deputy Colley keeps us here and the more he talks the more he is convincing the people that it is fair and the less fear they have of it.  It is a fair system of taxation with, first of all, very high thresholds, by far the highest in Europe.  It is no answer to say that the European ones are of many years' standing.  Some of them have been reviewed as recently as this year.  The threshold is exceptionally high.  The personal allowances are very generous.  There are exemptions of the private residence and its contents, the generous treatment of agricultural land, livestock, machinery, the generous treatment in spite of what the Opposition say, of productive assets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are not prevented from reviewing it in 1976 or 1977.  That is the relevance of the arguments and the case that I am making.

      <P>Of course, Deputy Colley is quite right to avail of this matter to make his political arguments but he is talking about his threshold regulator, his cost of living regulator, his inflation regulator, as if that was a safety valve, as if it was a fire escape.  Everybody knows that an inflation regulator on its own is useless because a Government could write an inflation regulator into it and then tinker with the rates, then tinker with the exemptions and you are back to where you started from.  The inflation regulator on its own is simply no good.  It does not give the protection that the Opposition seek to convey to the people that it does give. Deputy Colley knows perfectly well that you cannot go regulating one thing piecemeal, that you cannot introduce a regulator into one tax without introducing it into another.  You cannot introduce a regulator into tax without also introducing it into items of income over which the Government have a say, like interest on Post Office deposits and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good Opposition amendment. It is an amendment that one would expect from any Opposition but it is not a realistic amendment. <Col N="2006" /> It is not an amendment that gives the security that it sets out to give and it is not an amendment that can be realistically accepted because, as I have said, you could not think of writing a regulator into your capital tax code without writing it into your income tax code.  That cannot be seriously said.</P>
    <P>The Government, as I said, are committed, through the Minister for Finance on numerous occasions, and I am now repeating that assurance, that the principle of Deputy Colley's amendment is accepted, that there is necessity for revision of thresholds to keep in line with changing values of money, and so on.  That will be done, and the best evidence of it is that we have already frozen values for three years.  I do not accept Deputy O'Malley's brushing aside of the freezing of valuations as being insignificant or as being of no help to the taxpayer because we have frozen real property and, as the House knows, real property, as defined in the Bill, covers all movable property; it covers leaseholds, it covers real property and chattels real.  We have also frozen, if the taxpayer wants to avail of it, shares in companies which are not quoted on the stock exchange.  As I said earlier, when you add to that the list of shares that are not quoted on the stock exchange it covers all the various shares in companies that the Opposition have been so concerned about throughout this Bill.  The private family company is also covered</P>
    <P>When you add to that list the very long list of complete exemptions such as the family residence, the contents, livestock, bloodstock and all the rest of them, there is very little left, unless the shares that are quoted on the stock exchange.  If they continue on their present trend, which I hope they will not, the taxpayer will have no worry in regard to them.  I repeat that this is a purely Opposition amendment, put down in the hope that the arguments put forward in its favour and the headlines which it may get, will be accepted without thought, without any analysis, by the people and that the Opposition will be regarded as good boys and the Government <Col N="2007" /> will be regarded as bad boys. But that is not the position.  I do not want to take up any more time beyond saying that I am convinced that every day that goes past people are becoming more aware of what is involved in this and the Opposition are simply wasting their time if they think that there is political mileage in it.  Whatever political mileage they got out of it in the very early stages of the discussions on it is long since gone.  The people know it and they want to get it out of here and get it on the Statute Book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his political advice and lecture and I do not wish to prolong the discussion on this, but I want to say two <Col N="2008" /> things: one, it is notable that in the somewhat lengthy and, without being too disparaging, I may say, somewhat blustering reply we have had from the Minister, never once did he comment on what is our real experience of an undertaking given by the Government in response to precisely the same kind of amendment on the Finance Act.  That speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>The other thing I want to mention is the fact that, whatever the reason, and the Minister has put many reasons on the record of this House, the Minister is refusing to build into this section a provision which would adjust thresholds in line with inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The amendment is concerned with <Col N="2012" /> extending paragraph (a) of section 14 (1).  This paragraph states that where an assessable person is an individual the individual or, if he is dead, his personal representative is primarily liable for the tax whether or not he is absolutely entitled to the property or is entitled merely to a limited life interest in the property. The reason for this is that the individual is the wealth taxpayer.  He is the focal point.  The position is obvious where he is the absolute owner. Where his interest is a limited interest, he is deemed by section 3 (3) to be beneficially entitled in possession to the underlying property.  Here he is again the focal point from which the following results follow.</P>
      <P>The underlying property gets the benefit of all the exemptions and reliefs which apply either to him or to the property itself.  His domicile and ordinary residence determine the extent of the claim for wealth tax on the trust funds, not the domicile of the trustees or the proper law of the settlement or any other chose-inaction. It follows logically from this that the individual should in all cases be primarily liable for tax.  However, as regards the limited interest, the distinction between primary and secondary interest will be much less important, if the next amendment, amendment No. 24, which I propose is adopted.</P>
      <P>Briefly, this will have the effect of enabling any accountable person who is liable for tax on a limited interest to recover the tax from the trust property.  The individual, notwithstanding that he is primarily liable for the tax on a limited interest will, therefore, be entitled to reimbursement from the trust funds.  This, in effect, means that the ultimate remainder man is footing the bill.  In the circumstances, therefore, Deputy Colley's amendment which seeks to limit the liability in respect of tax on a limited interest to the trustee or remainder man, as the case may be, is of little practical significance as far as the taxpayer is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is especially so since subsection (4) provides that tax shall be recoverable from any one or more of the <Col N="2013" /> persons accountable for the payment of the tax.  The Revenue Commissioners, therefore, have a choice of persons to whom they may apply for payment.  In practice their approach will depend on the facts of the case. For instance, if the trustees are here they would, in most cases, apply to the trustees first.  If the trustees were outside the jurisdiction, they might apply to the life tenant in the first instance.</P>
    <P>However, Deputy Colley's amendment is unacceptable for other reasons. There may be no trustees or they may be outside the jurisdiction.  The remainder man may be unknown, and besides the trust property is not vested in a remainderman.  A contingent remainderman may never become entitled to the trust property.  On the other hand, there must always be a person primarily accountable in the person of the tenant for life.  To accept Deputy Colley's amendment, which restricts the liability to tax of a limited interest to these persons, would prejudice the Revenue's ability to collect the tax, unless the life tenant were brought in again as an accountable person under another head.  Supposing I were to move my amendment, amendment No. 23h, and deal with it, would that be helpful?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> My amendment No. 23h proposes on page 17, subsection (3) (c), line 51, after &ldquo;discretionary trust&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a person who is, by virtue of subsection (2) or (3) of section 5 deemed to be beneficially entitled in possession to property&rdquo;.  Section 14 is the section which sets out the persons who are accountable for wealth tax.  In subsection (1) it indicates the persons who are primarily accountable for the payment of the tax.  Those who are secondarily accountable are set out in subsection (2).  Subsection (3) provides that the person secondarily accountable shall be entitled to reimbursement from the person primarily accountable and then goes on to state how the person primarily accountable shall also be <Col N="2014" /> entitled to be reimbursed.  This amendment is concerned with the latter subsection (3) which omitted to deal with the type of case dealt with in subsections (2) and (3) of section 5. This amendment remedies this defect. These subsections deal with special cases of discretionary trusts which where not treated as entities but where instead the property of the trust was ascribed to certain individuals, trusts solely for children of a marriage with or without parents and where a minor child is living&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This amendment is concerned with subsection (3) which omitted to deal with the type of case dealt with in subsection (2) and (3) of section 5.  This amendment remedies this defect.  These subsections dealt with special cases of discretionary trusts which were not treated as entitles but where instead the property of the trust was ascribed to certain individuals, trusts solely for children of a marriage with or without parents and where a minor child is living the property is deemed to be that of the husband, survivor of the parents, or of the minor children as the case may be, trusts for persons incapable of managing their own affairs, property deemed to be that of the individual concerned.  In all these cases there will be a person primarily accountable for the tax, a husband, a widow, an orphan child, or an adult child.  The tax will be on property which is deemed to be his but which is in the hands of a trustee.  The amendment provides that a person who is deemed to be in possession of such property shall be entitled to reimbursement from the trust property.  The whole purpose of these subsections of section 5 was to take these special types of trust out of a charge for tax which fell on discretionary trusts as entities. The intention was to ascribe the trust property to these persons who would not normally be liable to wealth tax. <Col N="2015" /> thus enabling them to get the benefit of the thresholds to which as individuals they would be entitled.  It is not expected that liability should arise in many cases.  However, there is always the possibility that a liability might arise.  For that reason, it is desirable that the person deemed to be entitled to the property should be entitled to reimbursement.  Amendment No. 24 is the amendment which does what Deputy Colley wanted to do.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes.  In page 17, after line 55, it is proposed to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>Any accountable person who is authorised or required to pay tax in respect of an interest which is a limited interest shall be entitled to reimbursement from the property in which the limited interest subsists or on which it is charged or secured or on which it is entitled to be so charged or secured and he shall, for the purpose of paying the tax, or raising the amount of the tax when already paid, have power, whether the property is or is not vested in him, to raise the amount of such tax, and any interest and expenses properly paid or incurred by him in respect thereof, by the sale or mortgage of or a terminable charge on that property or any part thereof, and any other accountable person who is entitled to reimbursement under subsection (3) shall have a similar power in relation to any property in respect of which he is authorised or required to pay tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to shift the liability for wealth tax in respect of a limited interest from the life tenant to the trust fund.  To appreciate the necessity for this, it is necessary to look briefly at the background which led to the life tenant being treated as the person liable for payment of the tax and not the fund. A limited interest is made liable to wealth tax in the same way as any <Col N="2016" /> other property in the ownership of an assessable person.  Section 3 (5) (b) states what a limited interest is. Broadly speaking it is an interest which is less than an absolute interest. It usually takes the form of a life interest or annuity.  Section 3 (3) shows how a limited interest is treated for the purposes of tax.  It makes the underlying property liable.</P>
    <P>To take the more common form first, a life interest, section 3 (3), treats a person who has a life interest in property as being entitled to the whole or the appropriate part of the property in which the interest subsists or on which it is charged or secured.  A person entitled to a life interest in a fund or in a farm is regarded as being entitled respectively to the fund or farm.  If a person is entitled to a life interest jointly with another he is regarded as being entitled to half the underlying property. It flows from this approach that all the incidents referable to that property follow.</P>
    <P>A person entitled to a life interest in, say, bloodstock, livestock or artistic objects will get the benefit of the appropriate exemptions.  If he is entitled for life to a farm, hotel or productive assets he gets the benefits of the appropriate deductions.  The Bill makes wealth tax payable by a life tenant the personal liability of the life tenant under section 14 (1) (a). There were several reasons for this approach, the prime being that the life tenant is in fact the person who is in the beneficial enjoyment of the property and the fact that in the vast majority of cases the life tenant should have no difficulty in paying the tax.</P>
    <P>The combination of thresholds, reliefs and the ceiling provisions should ensure that the tax is in almost all cases payable out of income.  There are no progressive rates of tax which might cause hardship.  The flat rate, which does not exceed 1 per cent, and will invariably be substantially lower, raises no problems of priority of various types of property <i>inter se</i> for the purpose of liability for tax. The British, in their Green Paper on wealth tax, approached the position <Col N="2017" /> differently.  Like us, and subsequent to our decision to do so, they proposed to make the underlying property liable to wealth tax.  However, they make the tax referable to the life interest a liability on the trust fund, not on a life tenant.  Their proposed rates of wealth tax which are progressive, rising from 2½ per cent to 5 per cent, would appear to have left them no choice.  In many cases resort would have to be had to capital to meet the tax, especially as it is proposed to apply the top rates with certain deductions to settled property. Making the fund liable to wealth tax in respect of limited interests means, in effect, making the ultimate remainderman liable for the tax.  Our view was that this would not be justified where the tax could in the vast majority of cases in fact be paid out of the income of the trust.  However, two points might be made.  Although very unlikely it is possible for a life tenant to be entitled for life to property which produces no income and, at the same time, own no property out of which the tax might be paid.</P>
    <P>In some other cases wealth tax might cause a substantial diminution of the income, if again he had no other property and the income of the trust fund was negligible in the context of its underlying value.  The fact that such situations can arise is itself a valid reason for ensuring that a life tenant be protected in all circumstances. This can only be done by making the fund liable.  This approach has the advantage that there will always of necessity be available property out of which the tax can be paid. Deputy Colley suggested on Second Stage that the tax payable by a life tenant should be paid out of the trust funds.  There have been other representations to the same effect. The suggestion presents no difficulties from the Revenue point of view.</P>

      <P>In amendment No. 23 (g) what I was trying to achieve was to cover the kind of case I referred to on the previous section where, say, a widow has an annuity or, indeed, a worker who worked all his life, say, on an estate, has an annuity in each case charged on the whole property <Col N="2018" /> which might be of high capital value. As the Bill stands he or she could be liable for the wealth tax on the whole property.  I was trying to achieve a situation in which this would not happen.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment No. 24 achieves what I was trying to do.  One problem arises in it.  My amendment would have ensured that the kind of person I am talking about or the life tenant would not be primarily liable. The Minister's amendment still leaves them primarily liable.  I appreciate the reasons the Minister has given. All of what I was trying to achieve could be achieved if the Minister could assure me that in cases of this kind the Revenue Commissioners would, in the first instance, go against the trustee or the remainderman if they were within the jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>In page 17, subsection (5), line 59, to delete &ldquo;and any other person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to this Bill being published an erroneous impression got abroad that under section 14 the Revenue Commissioners could demand information concerning a taxpayer from all sorts of people, including his neighbour and if the neighbour did not supply information which he might have purely as a neighbour he would be liable to substantial penalties, including a penalty of £1,000.  That was never the intention of the Government and was never the intention of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concede that the section, as drafted, left itself open to that argument or to that interpretation but that was never the intention of the Government or the Minister.  The object of <Col N="2020" /> this amendment is to put the position beyond doubt and to write into the Bill that no such demand can be made. If anybody was foolish enough to make such a demand it can be ignored without any liability to the Revenue or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 proposes in section 14, page 17, subsection (5) and line 59 to delete the words &ldquo;and any other person&rdquo;.  This subsection makes an accountable person and any other person in possession of information relevant to the taxable wealth of an assessable person liable to disclose such information to the Revenue Commissioners as he is required in writing by the Revenue Commissioners to do.</P>
    <P>There have been numerous representations that this is going too far, giving powers to the Revenue Commissioners that are too wide, and that it should be sufficient for them to look to accountable persons only for information. It was also represented that the inclusion of any other person would be detrimental to the business of banks and investment houses and would also affect the principal and client relationship for solicitors, accountants, and so on.  Many of the points raised could be rebutted and many of the fears are exaggerated. The matter is, however, controversial, and as it is thought that the collection and so on of the tax will not be adversely affected the offending words can be deleted.  That amendment was circulated by the Minister quite a while ago.  It never was the intention that the powers ascribed to the section should be invoked.  This amendment now puts the matter clearly beyond doubt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment of the Minister's is all right as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough.  I was intrigued to hear the Minister say that there was an erroneous impression abroad that this section provided that anybody, including a neighbour, could be obliged under pain of a penalty of £1,000 to give information to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to any other person's taxable wealth. There is nothing erroneous about this <Col N="2021" /> at all.  That is precisely what the section says.  It says an accountable person and any other person in possession of information relevant to the taxable wealth of an assessable person shall disclose to the Commissioners. There is nothing erroneous about it. In fact, it does not matter what kind of protests of innocence are made now, the fact is that that is exactly what was sought to be enacted in this Bill.</P>
      <P>In this case we are dealing with what could now be referred to as the infamous spy clause in this Bill which provoked so much protest, as the Minister has indicated.  It threatened the effectiveness of, amongst other things, the agricultural advisory service and a great many other things too, and seriously, because it could oblige anyone at all to give information about anyone else under pain for failure to do so of a penalty of £1,000, plus, possibly, £50 a day.  Somebody said that this was George Orwell's <i>1984,</i> nine years ahead of schedule, Recently, the Government saw to it that there was a special release to the news media to tell everybody that this open Government had graciously decided not to proceed with this spy clause as they had originally planned to do.  The truth of the matter is, if one looks at the Minister's amendment, that they have only half withdrawn.  That will appear clearly when my next amendment is discussed.  Apart from that the Government still plan even with this amendment to impose this spying under penalty obligations on a husband in respect of his wife, and on a wife in respect of her husband, but perhaps even worse, on minor children in respect of their parents.  As far as this side of the House is concerned this provision is objectionable, inquisitorial and, possibly, unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effort made in the Bill as drafted to produce this situation in which anybody would be obliged under pain of heavy penalty to give any information about anybody else was one that should never have appeared. The fact that the Minister now proposes to amend it, while welcome, does not absolve the Government from having tried to do it in the first place, nor does the position arising even with <Col N="2022" /> this amendment present itself as a satisfactory position at all.  It is one that is objectionable and one that we could not accept at all.  The penalty cannot be reduced as the Bill stands, no matter what the circumstances, because the Revenue Commissioners or the courts do not have power to reduce the penalty.  To impose that penalty on a husband if he fails to disclose the information sought in connection with his wife's wealth or assets, or on a wife in connection with her husband's assets, and, worst of all, on minor children in respect of their parents' assets is not acceptable.  I hope the Minister will agree that it is unacceptable, and will be prepared to do something about it as I proposed to do in regard to the earlier part of the objection in my amendment.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for me to amend the consequences which impose this obligation on the husband in respect of the wife and vice versa, and on the children in respect of their parents without a major change in the provisions of the Bill.  Therefore, the obligation to cure that defect rests on the Minister.  I do not know if the Minister is in any doubt as to why I say that this obligation arises, but if he is I will spell it out.  Otherwise I am assuming he is aware that this is what the section, even as proposed to be amended, is doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already entered in the lists in the Press in respect of this problem, namely as <Col N="2024" /> Deputy Colley says, the notorious spy clause because the words &ldquo;and any other person&rdquo; was included in subsection (5) of section 14.  It is a section that deals with the persons who are primarily accountable on the payment of tax.  I am just wondering how many people who raised their hands in horror at these words bothered to go back to the history of accountability in capital tax.  For those who did not bother to do so or who did not know how to do so, I would like to inform them that as far back as the Finance Act, 1894, under section 8, subsection (4), it is stated as follows:</P>
      <P>Where a property passes on the death of the deceased&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>some words were deleted by a subsequent Act</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;every person to whom any property so passes for any beneficial interest in possession and also to the extent of the property actually received or disposed of by him, every trustee, guardian, committee or other person in whom any interest in the property so passing or the management thereof is at any time vested...</P>
      <P>becomes responsible to deliver to the commissioners details of the estate. This section went further to say that if a person did not render the account there was a £100 fine or, alternatively, a fine equal to the amount of duty eligible in reference to the estate.  That is not the end of it.  We come to section 22 (4) of the Finance Act, 1965.  That section dealt with property that came within section 2 (2) of the Finance Act, 1894, which dealt with the charge for death duty.  Paragraph (1) of that subsection of the 1965 Act uses the following words:</P>
      <P>Where the deceased was competent to dispose of such property within the meaning of the Principal Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is, the 1894 Act, which gave rise to the charge for estate duty</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;his executor, or as defined... shall, in addition to any other person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>again the words &ldquo;other person&rdquo; were used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2025" />&mdash;be accountable for the duty and subsection (4) of section 8 of the principal Act shall have effect as if the words referring to the executor not being accountable were omitted.</P>
    <P>It even goes further than this in the 1971 Act in which, again, stiff penalties are brought in.  Section 42 of the Finance Act, 1971, says:</P>
    <P>A person who fails to comply with subsection (3), (4), (5) or (14) of section 8 of the Finance Act, 1894, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £500.</P>
    <P>Then it sets out the cases and says in subsection (2) (a):</P>
    <P>Where a person fraudulently or negligently, for the purposes of the enactments relating to estate duty, delivers, produces, furnishes, gives or sends to the Revenue Commissioners or otherwise makes use of any incorrect account, return, estimate, statement, information book, document, record or declaration, he shall be liable to a penalty of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a sum not exceeding £500 and,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the amount of, or in the case of fraud, double the amount of the additional duty payable if the said account, return, estimate, statement, information, book, document, record or declaration, had been correct.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (8), when a person failed to make the return he became liable for the duty as an extra penalty, in addition to the duty payable.  Under subsection (8) you get down to people in the capacity of guardian, committee or other person. Quite obviously the original purpose of the words was to try to get anybody who dealt with the property in trustee capacity or pseudo-trustee capacity.  It should be appreciated in this House&mdash;it is probably known to Deputy Colley and to anybody with any legal training&mdash;that you do not have to be described as a trustee to be a trustee.  You can, by your action, place yourself in a position of trustee and place yourself in the position of being an executor.  There is such a thing as an executor <i>de son</i><Col N="2026" /><i>tort</i> and if you do that you place yourself with all the liabilities and all the responsibilities of a trustee or an executor <i>de son tort</i>.  I imagine when this was originally drafted the purpose of &ldquo;other person&rdquo; was to cover these cases.  However, in view of the fuss that has taken place and the alarmist campaign that took place without having regard to the previous revenue history of dealing with accountable persons for taxation purposes, it was thought better to delete these words and then there could be no grounds for complaint. Deputy Colley is a very good advocate.  I concede that, but his ability as an advocate has been overstretched this evening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Certainly, in most of the legislation that has come through this House, be it social welfare or otherwise, no matter where the legislation came from, whether it came from Deputy Colley's side of the House or this side&mdash;the family unit has always been observed and I do not think it has ever been the intention of any party in this House to set up that sort of situation where a close relative like a parent, would spy on his or her children or children spy on a parent.

    <P>If I may just repeat myself and say that in regard to accountability in the past in the operation of estate duty, the accountability was far more severe than is provided for under this section and the penalties were far <Col N="2027" /> more severe.  A person might have to have a penalty of £100,000 estate duty.  There have been cases where there has been possibly £1 million eligible for estate duty.</P>
    <P>Something else we can bear in mind has just occurred to me because I had the situation of having to give an opinion under section 8 of the 1894 Act some years ago.  We are an island here and there are many estates here where the income goes into other hands.  Basically the tactic adopted by lawyers and accountants is that when they take money into their hands they always account for it to the Revenue Commissioners to keep on the right side of the law.  In handling another person's money, say, collecting rents for him or something like that, they have placed themselves in the position of trustees and they are actually managing and dealing with somebody else's property.  If that property is subject to a Revenue charge they rightly account themselves to the Revenue Commissioners for this property.  There is a principle of rectitude and correct conduct in all affairs, particularly in professional matters.  It is always adhered to certainly by the old and correct school of lawyers and accountants or estate agents.  There has been a great deal of smoke and wind blown across this section which is quite unjustified and, before the amendment came into print I wrote to the newspapers saying what the obvious intention of the section was and pointing out that there had been a past history in the matter of accountability that had been ignored by the flakmen who spoke in certain areas down the country to alarm the agricultural community.  They said everyone was going to be straining themselves to look over their sceachs at their boundaries to count the cattle on the farm next door.  That is the most ridiculous piece of propaganda that has ever been put forward, and I regret it seems to have emanated from some sort of professional source&mdash;I do not know from where&mdash;or else it was translated into language and given to the Press, but it did not make sense.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde has told us about smoke blown across this section.  There has been quite a cloud of smoke blown across it now by Deputy Esmonde himself.  He very carefully glossed over what this section is doing and when he had ransacked the precedents, the best he could come up with was a reference in the 1894 Act and another in the 1965 Act.  One was on penalties, which is irrelevant, except as a factual statement of what the penalty is for failure to comply under this Bill.  That is the only relevance of penalties.  The real issue is that the other Acts to which the Deputy referred specifically provide that they are making accountable people who either have the property vested in them or dealt with it in some way. Deputy Esmonde spoke at some length afterwards about the role of such people and quite rightly.  Everything he said was correct.  But what he did not say was that this section said a great deal more than accounting for property with which he had some dealings or which were vested in him.  It says an accountable person&mdash;and that is the kind of person who is talked about in the other Act&mdash;and then it goes on &ldquo;and any other person in possession of information&rdquo;, and it spells out that any other person in possession of information is obliged to give it in relation to anybody else.</P>
      <P>There is no Act of Parliament passed that I am aware of prior to 1922 and never in Dáil Eireann in which it was sought to do what was sought to be done in this section.  No amount of contrived pleading&mdash;to use Deputy Esmonde's phrase&mdash;or special pleading can get over that fact. Nobody ever attempted to do what was attempted in this section.  The smokescreen from Deputy Esmonde will not conceal the fact that it was never attempted by anybody before.</P>

      <P>Has the Deputy noticed &ldquo;be accountable&rdquo;?  It does not say &ldquo;be obliged&rdquo; or &ldquo;to furnish information to the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;. Clearly if you are making somebody accountable, you cannot make a neighbour accountable, but you can make a neighbour disclose information.  You cannot make a neighbour accountable if he has no interest in the property or has not dealt in it in any way.  Therefore, there is no precedent whatever, and the Deputy is making a valiant but unsuccessful attempt to cover up the fact that there is not in existence any precedent&mdash;and I doubt if any effort was even made to introduce one at any time in the past&mdash;for a provision which would make any person liable to disclose information to the Revenue Commissioners, any person who had nothing to do with the property. If the property was not vested in him, if he did not manage it, if he did not inter-meddle in any way, he could not be asked to do this.  That is the alleged precedent quoted by Deputy Esmonde, but there is no precedent in anything he says for providing, as this section does, that somebody in whom the property did not vest, who had no connection of any kind with the property, is obliged to furnish information to the Revenue Commissioners.  That is what this section sought to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view it is a disgraceful effort that it should have been tried on.  I suppose we can rejoice that something is being done now to step back from it, but as I pointed out, not enough is being done to step back from it. This arises on my next amendment and I presume I am not in order in <Col N="2030" /> discussing that, but I hope that I am in order in pointing out that even with the Minister's amendment, that even with my amendment inserted, the section would still read that an accountable person is obliged to furnish information in respect of the taxable wealth of an assessable person, not in respect of the person for whom they are accountable, but of any assessable person.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by the Minister to try to show that the second part of this subsection which says &ldquo;...and any such person shall at all reasonable times, make available for inspection books, accounts&rdquo; and so on, again that was a pretty valiant effort by the Minister, but it does not really stand up because, first of all, that phrase would cover a person who had such records and it would also cover a person who had not; furthermore, any such person must refer both to an accountable person and to any other person.  Clearly an accountable person would be the kind of person who would have documents and records, or might well have, which should be produced to the Revenue Commissioners. The reading of the section as it was produced and brought into this House is quite clear.  It sought to do something that was never done before, and to the best of my knowledge was never even sought to be done before, to make a person liable under pain of serious penalty to disclose any information he had about anyone else. That is what the section is doing.</P>
    <P>I am pointing out that even with the Minister's amendment it is still making an accountable person liable to furnish information in respect of any assessable person, not just the assessable person in respect of whom they are responsible.  An accountable person should be liable to give information only in relation to the taxable wealth, to use the phrase in my amendment &ldquo;in respect of whose tax he is an accountable person&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy were correct in that I think it would be quite clear on the face of the section that that was what was intended but it is by no means clear.  In fact, I would contend on the contrary that it does not say that, and when one has regard to the portion of the section which the Minister now proposes to delete and the implications of that, one can reasonably assume that what is sought to be achieved is to make an accountable person liable to furnish information under pain of penalty in respect of the taxable wealth of any assessable person.  Will the Minister say which assessable person would be involved in that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to read the interpretation of the section as it was drafted.  As it was drafted it is quite clear the reference was not to an assessable person, only in relation to this person.  It related to any assessable person.  The taking out of any other person does not alter that construction. Therefore, an accountable person is still being made liable to furnish information in respect of the taxable wealth of any assessable person. That is the only way one could have construed the section as unamended. The amendment does not alter that meaning in relation to the phrase &ldquo;an assessable person&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We get back to the position that the amendment which the Minister introduces restricts one aspect of the section but in my view it does not restrict it nearly enough.  It is vitally important, having regard to what was in this section, to spell out unambiguously just how far these powers are to be allowed to go.  I believe it is the duty of this House to spell out in <Col N="2032" /> that way what exactly is intended to be done.  I am making it clear in my amendment how far we are prepared to go.  If the Minister, Deputy Esmonde and their colleagues are prepared to go further they should be obliged to say so in this House and put it on the record.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is obvious that Deputy Colley is hard put to get an argument on which to base an attack on the wealth tax when he is prepared to spend so much time on this section with over 15 sections still to go.  It is obvious from this section as originally drafted that the intention was that it was only the assessable person or such other person who might be acting in one capacity or another for him and who might have books or records who was being called upon.  That is in the interpretation I put on it and it is the interpretation the Minister put on it from the very beginning.  Once the opposite allegation was made, the Minister said, to put it beyond doubt, he would introduce an amendment.  He drafted an amendment and it was circulated six weeks ago.</P>
      <P>I remember that in 1971 when the Finance Bill was going through it was obvious then that a serious obligation was being placed by the then Minister on a variety of people in respect of returns being made for death duties. I remember objecting to it at the time because it was then enacted that &ldquo;where a person fraudulently or negligently for the purpose of the enactment relating to estate duty, delivers, produces, furnishes, gives or sends to the Revenue Commissioners or otherwise makes use of any incorrect accounts, returns, estimates, statements, information, books, documents, records or declaration he shall be liable to penalties of £500&rdquo; and, as Deputy Esmonde says, to double the amount of the duty.  Let us take the case where Deputy Colley is acting for a client and some clerk in Deputy Colley's office incorrectly, but innocently, completes a schedule of assets that goes to the Revenue Commissioners. That clerk whom Deputy Colley entrusted with this becomes liable to a criminal offence.</P>

      <Col N="2038" /> There is great significance in the difference in drafting involved in subsection (5) of this section and subsection (2) of section 15 to which I have referred.  The amendment I am moving seeks to have this read &ldquo;an accountable person in possession of information relevant to the taxable wealth of an assessable person in respect of whose tax he is an accountable person.&rdquo;  In other words, to make it clear that we are dealing with somebody who is involved and that we are not leaving it at large.  I would hope, having listened to the Minister's protestations of innocence in regard to this section and this subsection, that he will not raise any difficulties about accepting this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I also propose to deal with the three amendments together, Nos. 25a, 26a and 26b.  First of all, the section, as amended, makes an accountable person in possession of information relevant to the taxable wealth of an assessable person liable to furnish such information.  As I understand the position, the purpose of the amendments is to ensure that an accountable person is liable to furnish information in respect only of the taxable wealth of an assessable person in respect of whose tax he is an accountable person.  That is what the Deputy wants to do.  That, in fact, is the aim of the section as drafted.  An accountable person, A, in possession of information relevant to the taxable wealth of B. is required to disclose such information as the Revenue Commissioners require for the ascertainment of liability to/or for the collection of wealth tax.  In the context of wealth tax the tax can be payable only by B. or his accountable persons.  It is difficult to visualise circumstances in which A. could be asked to furnish information in respect of that wealth in connection with the taxable wealth of say X, Y or Z because X, Y or Z would not own that property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxable wealth of an assessable person and information relevant to that wealth can be relevant only to <Col N="2039" /> the case of the assessable person who owns wealth and in whose hands it is liable.  Furthermore, information can be sought only for the purpose of ascertaining liability to or the collection of tax.  The question of liability to tax can arise only in connection with that assessable person. The Deputy will see therefore that our views on the scope of the section coincide and that there is no necessity for the amendments he has tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I do not see any such thing.  The question of liability to tax does not arise here. We are talking about seeking information and from whom it may be sought in relation to whom and what. In view of the fact that I drew the Minister's attention to the wording of subsection (2) of section 15, I am surprised that he did not refer to that or attempt to explain it.  Let me refer him to it again.  It is dealing with a very similar situation.  It is providing that</P>
      <P>a person who is accountable for the payment of tax by virtue of section 14 (2) shall, if he is required in writing by the Commissioners to do so, deliver to the Commissioners within such time not being less than 30 days as may be specified in the requirement on a form provided by them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>These are the crucial words</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;return of the property in respect of which he is accountable comprised in the taxable wealth of the assessable person concerned.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt as to what is intended in the wording there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that what he intends is what I seek in the amendment. If that is so, the Minister should have no difficulty and no hesitation in accepting an amendment which would make it clear beyond any shadow of doubt as to what is intended by this subsection.  The fact that section 15 (2) to which I referred goes out of its way to spell out this relationship makes all the more significant the omission of anything <Col N="2040" /> like that in this subsection and all the more important that it should be spelt out without any ambiguity whatever. Therefore, if the Minister says that his intention is to ensure that an accountable person will only be asked to furnish information in respect of the taxable wealth of somebody in respect of whose wealth he is an accountable person, there is no reason why the Minister should not agree to spell that out in the subsection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister then compare it with the wording in section 15 (2) and would he agree that when there is a difference in wording of that kind in very similar circumstances, the courts would interpret that difference as meaning there was a different intention?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As I say, I am satisfied that subsection (5) as drafted does exactly what the Deputy wants.  I do not want it to mean anything else.  I am satisfied that it does not, but I am prepared to have a look at it between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I accept that but I have to enter a reservation in this sense, that I will have to see what amendments the Minister puts in on Report Stage and have an opportunity then to put in my own.  In other words, if the Minister does not have an amendment in to cover this point I will want to cover it on Report Stage.  I will confess also that from our experience on the capital gains tax I am a little slow to leave the matter there because on that occasion when we were subject to a time limit we got very short shift from the Minister for Finance and, being Report Stage, we are limited, of course, by the fact that we can speak only once.  What is in my mind is that the Minister ought to spell out now and put it on the record. If he says that the intention of the section is to do what I am seeking to <Col N="2041" /> do in the amendment does he not think it insufficient to say that he is advised that that is the effect of it having regard to the wording of subsection (2) of section 15?  I know well the Minister takes clearly the point I have made about the contrast in the wording and the likely effect on an interpretation by the courts.  Because of that contrast I am certain that the Minister takes that point very clearly and, that being so, the Minister has to go a little further than say he will look at it between now and Report Stage.  The matter is too important.  If section 15 (2) were not there it might be reasonably plausible for the Minister to argue that what is in the section is only doing what is intended by me and, as he said, by him.  I would be inclined to argue that. But, in the light of the contents of section 15 (2) I do not think that argument is open to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave it to Deputy Colley to answer that point, but the wording in section 2 does limit.  With regard to section 5 what at first sight I do not understand is this: if the Minister is satisfied on the principle, what objection can he have to putting in &ldquo;in respect of whose tax he is an accountable person&rdquo; because that is the only addition there after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;?  You qualify &ldquo;person&rdquo; by adding &ldquo;in respect of whose tax he is an accountable person&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The next two amendments are consequential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the next two would be consequential.  We are agreed on the principle.  Supposing you leave it out, taking it purely on possibility of interpretation, I accept that that is the Minister's intention.  We are agreed on that.  &ldquo;An accountable person and any other person in possession of information relevant to <Col N="2042" /> taxable wealth of an assessable person shall&rdquo;, and so on.  That leaves it on the wording of that phrase, anybody who is an accountable person within the meaning of section 14 (1) and any other person in possession of relevant information as to the taxable wealth of an assessable person whether they are directly related to the accountable person or not.  It leaves it open.</P>
      <P>I am repeating an argument that was made generally earlier and I do not want to delay the House.  If you do not qualify the words &ldquo;assessable person&rdquo; then the assessable person may be assessable in regard to something totally different from what the accountable person is accountable for. That is on the reading of that subsection. If we are agreed on the principle, surely the safe thing and the unambiguous thing to do is to take Deputy Colley's amendment, that is, provided the agreement is there, which is obviously so.  The Minister has pooh-poohed the idea that there was ever any intention of, say, getting information from an accountable person who is accountable in respect of the assets of, say, B or any other person who has knowledge or information with regard to the assets of C, that these two could be used to give information, if they have it, about the assets of X.  The Minister pooh-poohed that interpretation from the intentional point of view.  But I do ask quite soberly, unless you put in that qualification, is not that a possible legal interpretation of the phrase as it stands, and if it is a possible legal interpretation, no matter how farfetched, why leave it to be an appeal to inference, why leave it to argument if you can copperfasten it by expressing the intention clearly and concisely by that qualifying phrase that is in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is quite obviously convinced but he is just being extra cautious here&mdash;I can understand the Minister's caution in not wanting to take an amendment straightaway, but can anybody in the House give a good reason now as to why the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in line 60, page 17, should not be qualified in that context by the words proposed in this amendment? <Col N="2043" /> If no good reason can be given, if the intention is agreed, the Minister should accept the amendment.  I would agree possibly to rewording for the Report Stage, but I think he should go further than just saying he will consider it for the Report Stage.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i>&ldquo;Accountable person&rdquo; is defined on page 1, section 1.  It means a person who is accountable for the payment of tax by virtue of section 14.  Under section 14 (1) a person is primarily liable and under 14 (2) other persons are also accountable.  There it seems to say &ldquo;the following person shall also be accountable for payment of any amount of tax for which the persons referred to in subsection (1) are made primarily liable and, if the assessable person is an individual, every person whose property is included with that of the individual under section 4 and every trustee except...&rdquo;<i>et cetera</i>.

      <P>There are a few points I want to raise.  The first is one I referred to in passing earlier on one of the amendments.  It is common case between us that an accountable person is obliged under subsection (5) to give information to the Revenue Commissioners when it is sought from him. But an accountable person, in accordance with section 14, can include a husband in respect of his wife's property and/or his minor children's property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the section but I am referring to this part of subsection (5).  It can also include in certain circumstances a wife and the minor children.  I am putting it to the Minister, therefore, that subsection (5) has the effect of imposing an obligation on a husband in respect of his wife's property, and on a wife in respect of her husband's property, and on minor children in respect of their parents' property, to disclose all information sought by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to that property and to be liable, if they fail to do so, to a penalty of £1,000, with possibly £50 a day, and with no powers as the Bill stands to the Revenue Commissioners or to the courts to mitigate that penalty.  Would the Minister accept that that is a correct interpretation of subsection (5)?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I assume that the Deputy accepts that the Bill provides for the aggregation of the wealth of the husband, the wife and the minor children, and that he accepts that the husband is the assessable person.  Bearing that in mind.  I do not think the interpretation which the Deputy has put on subsection (5), which is the correct interpretation, is unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are entitled to call on any one of the three people whose wealth is aggregated <Col N="2046" /> and who are treated as one for the purpose of tax to give the information required and there is no obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to sue for penalties, as the Deputy will be aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> To sue for penalties.  As the Deputy knows, the income tax code is riddled with powers to enforce penalties which are hardly ever invoked unless in very extreme cases.  Of course, the Revenue Commissioners have an overall power to mitigate and do mitigate penalties and compromise penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that on a later section, but at least on this occasion we are <i>ad idem</i> as to what is meant which is, I suppose, an advance.  The Minister thinks in the circumstances it is a reasonable provision. I think in the circumstances it is an unreasonable provision and I would think that, in some circumstances, it could be held to be unconstitutional in the sense that to impose an obligation of that kind on a wife in relation to her husband, or on children in relation to their parents, is something which would not, as the Minister knows, be tolerated for an instant if the assessable person were a criminal accused of a criminal offence. It just would not be tolerated for a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that it is going very far to impose this obligation on the wife, or husband, or children of an assessable person.  I realise the drafting difficulties involved in doing anything about this without going to the very root of the Bill.  Nevertheless I would suggest that, if one were to take the view of this provision that I take, which is that it is unreasonable and inquisitorial and possibly unconstitutional <Col N="2047" /> one could perhaps get around it by excepting the husband and wife and minor children from the provivions of this in so far as this subsection arises where they are accountable persons but not for any other section of the Bill.  One does not have to undermine the whole concept of the accountable person including the husband, wife and minor children, in order to deal with the problem.  However, the Minister says he does not agree that it is an unreasonable provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a different view. I would hope that between now and Report Stage the Minister would think again about it and the implications of this.  I am only speaking of subsection (5) in so far as it relates to the furnishing of information by husband, wife and minor children.</P>
      <P>There is another matter arising on this section which was drawn to my attention, and I want to put it to the Minister.  It relates to the operations of certain firms of accountants who, although they are an unlimited group, frequently work through an unlimited secretarial company as secretary of private non-trading companies and, in other cases, they perform the duties of secretary.</P>
      <P>In other words, they come within the terms of reference of the Bill. They suggest that it is both unfair and inequitable that the secretary of the company should be fixed as the person primarily accountable for the payment of the tax.  While admittedly an officer of the company is the secretary, the office of secretary is a subordinate one, and the secretary is at the bidding of the directors, and it would be quite unusual for the secretary to have power to dispose of the assets of the company or to operate a bank account on his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Does he act as secretary of the private non-trading company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If he acts as secretary or in the terms of the Bill if <Col N="2048" /> he performs the duties normally performed by a secretary.  The right to reimbursement from the assets which is provided is hardly sufficient to encourage a secretary in a private non-trading company to remain in office, particularly as the secretary appears to have unlimited liability as against the director who, under subsection (2) (c), has his liability limited to the market value of the property or the income, as the case may be, which is vested in, or collected, or received by him, or to which he is beneficially entitled in possession.  It appears that there is not such a limitation on the liability of the secretary.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it would seen, that the provisions of subsection (3) paragraph (d) would produce a real danger which could inhibit professional firms from carrying out duties as secretary or acting as secretary of these non-trading companies to which they normally provide this service.  Again, the situation is made worse because the professional firm itself is obliged to operate under unlimited liability.  In a particular case of which I am aware, the operation of this section as it stands is likely to close down a secretarial department which employs a number of people in an accountant's office.  I am not suggesting for a moment that that was intended.  I am just pointing out that it is a consequence which seems to be arising in this matter.</P>
      <P>I would point out also that in the case of many private non-trading companies that are unlimited the directors, therefore, have power to redeem the shares by transfer of the assets of the company <i>in specie</i> and possibly they could remove them even from the jurisdiction and leave the secretary holding the baby.  It is the dangers of these kinds of risks with unlimited liability which are leading to the dangers I have mentioned. There are other points I want to raise but perhaps the Minister might find it more convenient if I stop at that point as he might like to comment on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to make a general remark <Col N="2049" /> in reference to professional people in general who assume responsibility for the affairs of other people like solicitors and accountants.  I am sure that before a solicitor would undertake on behalf of a client an obligation which might involve him in a monetary liability he would make sure he knew his client, he knew who he was dealing with.  I think immediately of a solicitor who goes to an auction and buys a property in trust for an undisclosed client.  If my legal memory is correct, he makes himself thereby liable as principal, and if the client did not honour the transaction by putting him in funds to complete the purchase he would have no answer to an action for specific performance. Broadly speaking that is similar to the situation Deputy Colley speaks about here, where a professional firm of accountants offer their services to act as secretary of a non-trading company.  Deputy Colley wants to ensure that they are not primarily liable.  There is also a provision under some of the Income Tax Acts where companies whose registered place of business is outside the State have to give the name of a person within the State to accept notices and to serve documents on their behalf under the Companies Acts.  I am not in a position to say whether that makes the person liable for their tax but I know there is such a procedure.</P>

      <P>The Minister is touching on a very important point here. If there is nobody else within the jurisdiction the Revenue Commissioners can get at, I would make no case at all, but where there are other people who have a beneficial interest in the property in effect, I am suggesting that the secretary as such should not be liable.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The type of secretary the Deputy has in mind is somebody who takes on the job as a professional secretary, and really he is a member of a firm of accountants from what the Deputy has said.  Such a person is taking a calculated risk if he acts as secretary without satisfying himself that the private non-trading company is reliable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2050" /> I have a note here which might be helpful to the Deputy.  Every company is required by law to have a secretary.  Not alone is a secretary an officer of the company, he is an administrative officer.  <i>Prima facie,</i> therefore, he is the person to whom everyone, including the Revenue, should apply to discharge the obligations of the company.  It is not agreed that his office is a subordinate one. The courts do not appear to regard it as such.  The suggestion that the primary accountability should rest on the directors is not a realistic alternative. A director need not be a shareholder of a company.  While the secretary of a private non-trading company is the person primarily accountable for wealth tax under section 14 (1) (d), he is only one of several accountable parties under section 14(2) (c).</P>
    <P>Under section 14 (4) the Revenue Commissioners can apply to any accountable party to discharge the tax.  It is not necessary that they should apply to the person primarily accountable at that stage.  It is not agreed that it would be difficult for the secretary to obtain reimbursement. Most of the documents issued by the company are authenticated by him and his co-operation is essential for a company.  Besides, it is difficult to visualise a situation where a company secretary would not foresee the possibility of his being left holding the can.  All he has got to do is resign. This is, perhaps, more true of companies which act as secretaries.</P>
    <P>If in any year difficulties arise in the payment of wealth tax, the secretary, or the person who performs his duties, need never find himself in the same position again.  In all the circumstances, therefore, it is not considered that the liability of a company secretary, or the person who performs the duties of a secretary for the purposes of wealth tax, should be altered.</P>
    <P>The point one gets from that is that the Revenue need not necessarily follow the secretary who is primarily liable.  They can follow the directors or other people mentioned by the Deputy, if they are within the jurisdiction and are marks.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I would not say so.  I would say the contrary is the case.  If a reputable firm of accountants accept a contract to act as secretary for a non-trading company, they are giving status to that non-trading company.  The fact that a reputable firm of accountants whose word is acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners, act as secretary of a non-trading company, as I say, gives status and prestige to that company.  If they were not to accept the responsibility of secretary they might even be misleading the general public.  It is desirable, in the interests not alone of the Revenue Commissioners but of the general public, that a professional firm who act as secretaries would only act as secretaries of firms they could stand over.</P>

      <P>That statement seems to be somewhat ambiguous.  I should like to make a general comment on it.  We are further progressing to what I might call the mandarin stage.  We are going to proliferate as a result of this section, not only within the State service and the Revenue Department itself, more administration and more people employed in administrative work as against those in productive work. This will obviously be transmitted into the other side of the coin as well. Socially, a lot of this legislation has the undesirable consequence that there will be more and more bookwork, paper work, accounting, and so on, all at a money cost, and ultimately at the cost of people who are doing productive work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a comment about agents.  We are on the section. I have always been concerned about intrusions on the role of solicitors. <Col N="2052" /> Perhaps, as I am not a practising lawyer, I can make this point without any embarrassment to either side of the profession and make it as a layman with, on the other hand, some experience and practical information on the subject.  I have always thought, no matter who brought it in, that it has been a pernicious principle to hold solicitors, and the legal representatives of the individual in the State, accountable for the information reposed in them in trust.  If there is any justification within the meaning of our Constitution, within the meaning of our whole legal tradition, for the existence of the legal profession it should be sacrosanct.</P>

      <P>I have gone away from accountants; I am dealing with solicitor under the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo;.  In this Bill, and the income tax code, the person is suitably described by the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo;.  Incidentally, in counsel's opinion, it is the same word that is usually used in giving agent directions.  There is no doubt that agent includes solicitor.  This section goes further in what I have described objectively as a very pernicious intrusion on the constitutional safeguards that our legal system provides for the individual as against Big Brother, the State, in particular.  This is not new, and I am not talking about the Revenue Commissioners only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take criminal jurisdiction going back to Magna Carta, and enshrined in the Articles of our Constitution, Article 38.  On the criminal side, I do not think no matter what we passed in this House, we would be able to breach that.  If it was a criminal matter I would be willing to bet that our Supreme Court, on appeal, would maintain the rights of the individual, as it did in the case of Padraig Haughey reported in 1970, reports which may be in the news shortly, would hold that a solicitor <Col N="2053" /> was absolutely privileged, as also would be the barrister briefed by that solicitor on behalf of that client.</P>
    <P>We are now dealing with a code of law that is coming perilously near, in its provisions, criminal provisions. Points of constitutionality may well arise.</P>
    <P>Maybe enough rope is being given in this House to hang the whole lot on a constitutional point.  This section goes further than its predecessors. There is no use telling me that the Income Tax Acts did this.  The Income Tax Acts are as bad and there is provision in the Income Tax Act, 1967, section 176, which is equally objectionable, and my strictures apply to that also.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between section 176 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and this Bill.  Precedent here is admitted but this goes further than the precedent established because section 176 makes every person who in whatever capacity is in receipt of any money <i>et cetera</i> shall, whenever required to do so by notice, prepare and deliver within the period mentioned in such notice a list in the prescribed form, signed by him, containing the particulars as set out.  This captures solicitors, and that is what I am objecting to.  I strongly object to that on the grounds of the confidentiality that exists between solicitor and client and that the individual with the complexity of our present law is entitled to have free, confidential advice and to consult and be in a position to find out what the law is and what his rights are without embarrassment by Big Brother, the State, in whatever department it may be, the police in a police state or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Section 176 captures solicitors and that is objectionable, but it can be said for section 176&mdash;objectionable and indefensible as it is, and the beginning of the slippery slope&mdash;it specifies certain things.  This section captures solicitors as an accountable person in subsection (2) by the use of the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo;, and in subsection (5) states that any accountable person&mdash;that must be taken as meaning any solicitor in the context&mdash;in possession of information relevant to the taxable wealth of an assessable person shall disclose <Col N="2054" /> to the Commissioners, or such other officer as the Commissioners may appoint, such information within their possession or power as they may require in writing for the ascertainment of liability or collection of tax and shall make such disclosure within a time not less than 30 days.  The important thing is, &ldquo;such information within their possession or power as they may require in writing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 176 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, at least specifies what that information is.  The section states, &ldquo;any information&rdquo;, unqualified or general.</P>
    <P>If we pass this section in its present form, notwithstanding and not controverting the precedents that are there &mdash;I say the Minister has gone further than the precedents&mdash;then any solicitor will be required, if this Act stands up in the Supreme Court, to disclose all that transpires between a client who consults him on the matters raised in this Bill.  Is that a desirable situation? Does it not, in the first instance, mean that before one can consult a solicitor one has to consider what the risk is of talking to the solicitor at all?  Furthermore, it is of interest if there is a criminal matter.</P>
    <P>I am saying these things not in stricture of the Minister; it is a free expression of an opinion by a Member who seeks to have a point taken into account in our passing of this legislation. Nothing more.  It is not to be taken as a stricture on anybody.  The penalties are coming very near criminal liability.  Unexpected things can happen and we should not rely too much on the English decided cases.  The 1921 Tribunals Act and the 1970 Act are a good example as to what can happen when one has a written Constitution such as we have.</P>
    <P>It behoves us to ask, &ldquo;are we within the proper limits&rdquo;?  If there was anything savouring of criminality in this an embarrassing situation could arise for the Revenue Commissioners and cost to the State.  I have not said all that for the sake of launching a delayed tirade against the Income Tax Acts and the building up of all this information-seeking legislation much of which I concede is necessary.  Indeed, I have a great deal <Col N="2055" /> of sympathy with the problems of the Revenue Commissioners, and, perhaps I should say in all fairness, in the implementation of the legislation such as it is they have been entirely and eminently reasonable and understanding. That does not get away from my point; we are making law here.  That is why I emphasise that it is not to be taken as a stricture on anybody.</P>
    <P>The fact that it has been benignly and reasonably administered to date does not obviate the objection in principle and the dangers of running into a constitutional impasse here. The Minister, when he is considering the amendment on subsection (5), should take this point into account. If possible, he should limit the amount of information he is concerned with and take into account the possibility that a solicitor might be acting criminally on this.  I want to give this possible interpretation as a guise here; I do not think it would be upheld but it could be embarrassing if there was any attempt to rely on it and lead into trouble.</P>
    <P>If a solicitor were acting for two different interests, two different assessable persons, and in that sense accountable for both, and if in one case he was acting in a criminal capacity and the other had a relationship to it, then, as the wording of that section stands, it could be invoked to cross without Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>
    <P>It is an unlikely point to succeed but we have a Constitution.  The Supreme Court has been very strong on its right to decide judicial matters. It is, therefore, desirable that if the the Minister is looking at that subsection in regard to solicitors that some qualification should be put on the information required from a solicitor.  The Minister will understand that I am talking purely about the solicitor and client relationship.</P>
    <P>I greatly regret that this was breached in the Income Tax Acts.  I concede, firstly that, and, secondly, it can be pleaded that it has given no difficulty to date and the Revenue <Col N="2056" /> Commissioners have been more than reasonable in it.  That I also concede. Further it may be argued that a certain amount of benign co-operation has resulted in good relations to the benefit of the client, and I am certain in certain cases that would be so.  All these points I concede, but nevertheless there is the principle of the interference to that extent of the confidential solicitor-client relationship which is so important in the modern world against Big Brother, the State, in whatever form.  I am not applying that term to the Revenue Commissioners; I am applying it to the modern State as a whole.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider all that in relation to subsection (5) and the amendment he promised Deputy Colley he would consider.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> They are not acting as solicitors.  They are acting as estate agents or rent collectors.  The Act of 1894 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where property passes on the death of the deceased and his executor is not accountable for Estate duty in respect of such property, every person to whom any property so passes for any beneficial interest in possession, and also, to the extent of the property <Col N="2057" /> actually received or disposed of by him, every trustee, guardian, committee, or other person in whom any interest in the property so passing or the management thereof is at any time vested, and every person in whom the same is vested in possession by alienation or other derivative title shall be accountable for the Estate duty on the property, and shall, within the time required by this Act or such later time as the Commissioners allow, deliver to the Commissioners and verify an account, to the best of his knowledge and belief of the property: Provided that nothing in this section contained shall render a person accountable for duty who acts merely as an agent or bailiff for another person in the management of property.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) reads:</P>
    <P>Every person accountable for Estate duty and every person whom the Commissioners believe to have taken possession of or administered any part of the estate in respect of which duty is leviable on the death of the deceased, or of the income of any part of such estate, shall, to the best of his knowledge and belief, if required by the Commissioners, deliver to them and verify a statement of such particulars together with such evidence as they require relating to any property which they have reason to believe to form part of the estate of which Estate duty is leviable on the death of the deceased.</P>
    <P>That has been carried down by one Finance Act after another.  The latest one, that of 1971 is the law of the land at present.  Deputy de Valera sat on Government benches when that was being done.  He did not object. We are dealing with section 14 (2) (a):</P>
    <P>If the assessable person is an individual, every person whose property is included with that of the individual under section 4 and every trustee, guardian, committee, personal representative, agent or other person in whom any property comprised in the taxable wealth of the individual on the relevant valuation date stands vested or by whom the <Col N="2058" /> property is managed or the income of the property is collected on that date or within one year thereafter and every person in whom the property becomes vested by alienation or other derivative title after that valuation date, other than by a sale for full consideration in money or money's worth.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera is fearful that that may involve a solicitor in breach of confidence.  He is only made an accountable person if he is managing an estate, if he receives the rent. There is nothing unusual or very new about that.  I am satisfied there is nothing in that to oblige a solicitor to disclose advice which he gave to a client.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley and other solicitors in the House will know that since we commenced practice we have been receiving from the Revenue Commissioners forms requiring us to deliver up to them full detailed particulars of all moneys received by us on behalf of any person.  They were asking us to do what is being done here.</P>

      <P>I am thankful to the Minister.  I will concede one point to him.  He makes a distinction.  If the solicitor is the executor he is not a solicitor.  It is in his capacity quasi as a solicitor that I am talking.  I see the <Col N="2059" /> Minister's point.  On a strict reading of subsection (a) that is embodied there as well.  I do not want to delay the House but it is difficult to make an argument like this without being prolix.  I can see the distinction between the solicitor being an agent in the sense of being a trustee, a manager or an executor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a rent collector. I concede that distinction.  This is where the difficulty arises.  The interpretation of this section seems to depend on a comma.  All the legal people will admit that a comma is very dangerous in a deed.  Subsection (a) to which the Minister referred, all that follows after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is: &ldquo;in whom any property comprised ....&rdquo;  An agent may stand alone.  All of that, &ldquo;in whom any property comprised ...&rdquo;, which corresponds to what is in the earlier Act and even in the Income Tax Act does not qualify the trustee, guardian, committee or personal representative.</P>

      <P>I know it is getting late.  That only qualifies the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  I concede there is no comma after the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo;.  If it will depend on a comma I would advise that it be looked at.  If &ldquo;agent&rdquo; stands alone like the others, then I say this Bill goes further.  I will leave the point with the Minister.  He need not even answer, but I have given him a point there.  If that is so, in the section it is the generality of the information.  Even if I take the Minister's interpretation and say that, on the one hand, it is only right and proper and indeed necessary in the interests of uniformity and equity that no distinction should be made in the case of an executor by virtue of the fact that he is in any other capacity and therefore, a solicitor executor is on all fours with a lay executor or an accountant executor, I still feel that in view of the solicitor-client relationship the lack of qualification of the word &ldquo;information&rdquo;, in other words the phrase, &ldquo;such information <Col N="2060" /> within their possession or power as they&rdquo;&mdash;the Commissioners &mdash;&ldquo;may require in writing&rdquo;, is dangerously wide and suggests a qualification. I do not want to prolong the argument.</P>
      <P>If the Minister replies I am sure I will come up with another reply. Whether I agree with the Minister or not I do not think I will pursue it.  I hope I made the two points clear, (1) that I would strongly vindicate the confidential relation of solicitor and client, <i>qua</i> solicitor; (2) that there are possible constitutional dangers here in that the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo; may or may not be qualified by the clause that follows&mdash;and without the comma it probably is.  As I said, it is dangerous to depend on a comma and I think it would be safer to qualify &ldquo;information&rdquo;. We would ask the Minister to consider that and also Deputy Colley's amendment, which the Minister is going to consider in perhaps an even broader context than it was originally proposed.</P>

I think it is also qualified because it says: &ldquo;Such information within their possession or power as they may require in writing for the ascertainment of liability to, or the collection of, tax.&rdquo;  That is all the information we can ask for.  The word &ldquo;solicitor&rdquo; is not mentioned here. We have managers in it, and it is somebody who is managing property. This information would be sought from him <i>qua</i> manager or estate agent, not <i>qua</i> solicitor.  I would also refer Deputy de Valera to the proviso to section 14 (2) (c) which says:</P>
      <P>Provided that none of those persons shall be liable for tax to an amount in excess of the market value of the property or in excess of the income, as the case may be, vested in, collected or received by him or to which he is beneficially entitled in possession.</P>

I appreciate that I am on very technical ground here.  Say for instance an auctioneer or an estate <Col N="2062" /> agent manages, or as the ordinary man calls it, lets land and gets a very substantial sum.  He is in a very difficult position.  Will he have to go to the owner and say: &ldquo;I want your income tax returns or I want to know if you are liable under this Bill&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>I have seen grazing land being let on the 11-months' system and the client after letting the land returned to England to his employment.  When the Revenue Commissioners wrote to him he either ignored the letter or it was returned and he could not be traced.  The agent got a latti-tat from the Revenue stating that he was now liable.  If the agent or auctioneer had paid all the money over he would be caught by the throat.  This agent had to explain the position to the tax inspector.  The income tax inspector said: &ldquo;You should have known better.&rdquo;  There are not many estate agents or auctioneers nowadays. When this man wrote home from England he kicked up a row.  This should not have happened.  This section is very interesting for the layman. Heretofore when you issued a bill it was the person or the persons from whom you could seek information, which could be your next door neighbour.  I presume this means it could be an accountant, auctioneer, estate agent or a barrister.  This gives very wide scope.  If an estate agent or auctioneer disposes of the property or leases or rents the property or land, how will he fare out under this legislation? If the owner through some elusive way tries to wriggle himself out of his liability, will the agent or auctioneer then be liable, as he was under the Income Tax Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An estate agent or auctioneer would want to be very sure of his grounds before giving advice or disposing of the property of a client.  He would want to make sure that he would have himself covered because if he did not he could find himself in a very awkward position from a financial point of view and he could be held responsible.  I am bringing up this matter because estate agents and auctioneers have been caught under the Income Tax Acts and I presume this may apply also in this case. <Col N="2063" /> People are not too anxious to disclose anything if they can help it.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners with the powers they have under this Bill, have a lot of avenues open to them, such as banks, solicitors, accountants and various other people.  I believe rent and rates collectors come into this.  They may be in a position to give more information than possibly the estate agent or auctioneer, having really transacted the sale of the property or the leasing or letting.  I am worried about the estate agent's liability.  How can he ensure he will not be responsible?  Has he to write to the Revenue Commissioners for a certificate in regard to this, or how does he overcome it?  I am dealing with farmers who can have other incomes, and who may come under the scope of the Bill.  How will the Bill affect such people?  This is going to create an embarrassing position for the estate agent or auctioneer.  Will he have to write to the Revenue Commissioners and ask them for a certificate regarding the liability of Mr. X or Mrs. M?</P>
    <P>The Minister might be able to spell out more clearly how this will affect the people I have mentioned.  I would not like to see a position where these persons or person could wriggle out and hold the agent responsible, which they can do now under the Income Tax Acts.  At an auction not too long ago a person who came over from England said he was not liable and the auction was stopped.  The estate agent involved said: &ldquo;All right I am going to read it out at the auction that you owe me almost £400&rdquo;. When the man heard that it was going to be called off he had to change his tune.  The Minister must admit that it put the auctioneer in a very awkward and embarrassing position but he had to do it in order to claim his money, and small blame to him.</P>
    <P>I would hope that these people I am alluding to would have some way out of an awkward situation that may arise.  As I stated earlier, most of the Members here who have spoken on this matter are highly qualified in legal matters.  I am only reading it as <Col N="2064" /> I see it as an ordinary individual.  I would like the Minister to give me some assurance as to the position.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Connolly's contribution has put beyond doubt that I am not breaking any new ground in this Bill and I am not establishing any precedent in regard to liability for tax.  I am familiar with the situation described by the Deputy in regard to income tax, where auctioneers and estate agents are liable because they collected rent on behalf of clients and parted with the rents without paying income tax.  They should have deducted the tax in certain circumstances from the lettings and remitted it to the Revenue Commissioners. They did not do that and they were liable.</P>
      <P>That has been the position for many years.  Estate agents by virtue of acting as agents rendered themselves liable and sometimes they were held liable by the Revenue Commissioners and they had to pay the money.  I agree with the Deputy when he says that the client invariably resisted violently any attempt by the auctioneer or estate agent to pay over to the Revenue Commissioners and he changed his auctioneer.</P>
      <P>When there was Schedules A and B income tax auctioneers in their advertisements said they were advertising on the instructions of A who was in the United States or in England. That bit of information brought the Revenue Commissioners and the Inspector of Taxes along for six or 12 years arrears of tax.  It did not amount to very much in £ s.d. but the client rebelled and resented it very much.  At any rate sections A and B have been abolished and it does not arise in that way now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connolly asked me if the auctioneer is liable as an accountable person.  I have to be honest and straight with him and tell him that he is, if the property comprised in the taxable wealth of an individual on the relevant valuation date stands vested in him or if the auctioneers manages the property or receives the income from the property.  To that extent he <Col N="2065" /> is liable.  I would invite Deputy Connolly to check over his clients and decide how many of them are in the wealth tax bracket.</P>
    <P>He is dealing, as he says, largely with farmers.  Before a farmer is liable for wealth tax, if he is a married farmer unless he has considerable other property he must have a farm without a house or without a hoof on it valued for £200,000.  If Deputy Connolly is dealing with many of those he is a lucky man and I congratulate him.  I would say that the number of such people he would deal with are very few and far between.  If he is dealing with a person in that category I would ask him to be careful. He need not be all that careful because if he has to pay the wealth tax, the Revenue Commissioners will have a number of options and they will be able to follow the owner of this valuable property if they can get him.  If he is readily available they will follow him instead of the auctioneer. If there are trustees of the property they will follow them instead of the auctioneer.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners will act reasonably but, if as a last resort or perhaps for some other reason, they decide to follow the auctioneer and collect the money from him the auctioneer will not be any longer at the mercy of the client in regard to wealth tax, as apparently he was at the mercy of the client in regard to income tax, because we have taken the precautions here of conferring a right on that auctioneer who paid the wealth tax to recover it from the profit, to sue the owner and to follow the property which was liable to the wealth tax.  The Deputy would agree I think that that being the position he has nothing to worry about.  First of all, it is extremely unlikely that it will crop up, but if the auctioneer finds himself caught like this and obliged to pay the tax he will be able to follow the property for it.</P>

      <P>I want the Minister to provide in that that nobody will be liable under this to the extent that they have paid over moneys they have received prior to notification by the Revenue Commissioners.  There is a similar provision in the Value Added Tax Act, 1972 in section 37.  If there were such provision it would mean that from the point of view of anybody, not just an auctioneer but anybody else covered in this section, that if he receives the money or if it is vested in him and he is notified by the Revenue Commissioners then it is at his own risk if he parts with it.  If he has already parted with it, I would suggest that to be notified by the Revenue Commissioners and held liable, even with the right of reimbursement, is not a situation that could leave Deputy Connolly or anybody else very contented.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The income tax situation would arise <Col N="2067" /> at least 100 times, or perhaps 1,000 times, for every once that the wealth tax situation is likely to arise.  Indeed many an auctioneer could go through his professional life, earn a good living and save a lot of money and never be lucky enough to act for a wealth tax client.  The auctioneers are not being singled out at all for treatment here.  We are dealing with managers of estates, with people who manage estates whether they are solicitors, accountants or estate agents.  Regarding the point raised by Deputy Colley to write in a proviso saving the person who passed over money without notice, that would be going too far in this wealth tax situation. I am satisfied that the provisions in the Act enabling the person who has been obliged to pay over the tax to recover it are adequate.  My advice <Col N="2068" /> to Deputy Connolly, if he is unlucky enough to have to pay up one year is that he should simply say nothing about it but merrily go on and let the farm the next year again.  Then when he has got the rent for it reimburse himself out of the next year's lettings and so inform his principal.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 26bb:</P>
      <P>In page 18, subsection (1), after line 30, to insert the following proviso:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided also that the reference in this subsection to three months after every valuation date shall, in relation to the valuation date in the year 1975, be construed as a reference to the period ending on the 5th day of October, 1975.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under section 15 of the Bill a person who is primarily accountable for the payment of tax in respect of taxable wealth must furnish a return of that wealth within three months of a valuation date.  Under the Bill as drafted the interest-free period and the time allowed for delivery of a return correspond in both cases, three months from the valuation date.  One of the objects of the amendment which I propose to introduce to section 18 is to extend the interest-free period for this year to the 5th October next.  In view of this extension of the interest-free period it is also desirable to extend the time limit for the furnishing of returns to bring it into line with the interest-free period for this year.  In all future years they will correspond, three months from 5th April. That is the purpose of the amendment which I am now proposing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  It goes to the root of the provisions in this Bill even related to other years.  It highlights what the problem is.  The problem is that the Bill provides that the tax is due and payable on the valuation date but it provides for a return within three months thereafter, in other words, in the ordinary year, 5th July.  That is probably where the difficulty arises, that the tax is due and payable before the return is due. The problem is highlighted in this situation, and the difficulty that I am referring to is not a consequence of the delay in the enactment of the legislation; it is a consequence of the provision that the tax is due and payable on the valuation date but the effect of it in this year is, if the Minister's amendment is accepted, that it will be within the legal terms of the Bill to deliver a return on 5th October of this year.  It will also be legal and in accordance with the provisions of the Bill to be subject to interest at 18 per cent per annum on outstanding tax from 5th October.  Whatever the difficulty and peculiar circumstances of this year, I do not think they explain that situation which, on the face of it, is not reasonable and is an anomaly.</P>

      <P>There are extraordinary situations in this year.  We need not go into what they are, but I do not think anyone can criticise the fact that a Bill of this nature should get the examination it has got.  It was delayed by other circumstances. Would the Minister not consider that, in view of this being the first trial, no taxpayer will have any certainty until the Bill goes through both Houses o' the Oireachtas.  There is a certain general warning all right, and it is something more than general once it passes this House.  Let us concede that, but nevertheless there is no final certainty about the liability.  There are penalties for wrong returns or wrong valuations.  Is it not reasonable to give an exceptionally long period at the beginning for the return which the Minister is making?  I am not quarrelling with that.  This will be the first return.  Many returns may be defective, or may raise queries, or there may be inquiries in regard to them, and many returns may require the assistance in the first instance of professional people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People may have to have valuations done.  People may have to consult either accountants or lawyers.  People may have questions to pose to the Revenue Commissioners as well as furnishing the return.  It is not unusual in furnishing returns that questions may be asked.  There may be alternatives and an inquiry as to what alternative is applicable.  In that case, would it not be reasonable to give <Col N="2073" /> some time?  I am not necessarily going as far as Deputy Brugha and saying the Minister should add another three months, but give some time.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to peculiar circumstances arising this year.  I hope he will include in those peculiar circumstances the fact that the Government's White Paper said that the commencement of wealth tax would be on 6th April, 1975.  This Bill makes wealth tax legally due and payable on 5th April, 1975.  I hope he will bear that one in mind.</P>

The indication there is that it will be payable on a fixed day, likely to be 5th April in any year.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am perfectly satisfied that Deputy Colley appreciates that this tax, although an annual tax, is payable by reference to the valuation date.  The valuation date is the date which fixes liability.  It is the focal point.  The valuation date has been fixed on 5th April.  That is the date on which the tax begins and that is the date by reference to which the tax should be paid.</P>
