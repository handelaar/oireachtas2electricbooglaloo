      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £27,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Houses of the Oireachtas, including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I should like to use the occasion to make some remarks on one of the aspects of this Supplementary Estimate. It is regrettable that, as has happened so often in the past, recent weeks have been charged with much emotive and unfair comment about the payment to Members of the Oireachtas in respect of their duties as public representatives of allowances which are specifically provided for in the Constitution of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to put this matter in proper perspective and in an effort to avoid the unseemly public debate which has so often surrounded this issue, I wish to remind all concerned that in 1969 the Government of the day asked the Independent Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector to recommend appropriate levels of remuneration for members of the Government and other office holders and allowances for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. This was done to remove any grounds for the accusation that Members fixed their own levels of remuneration. That uninfluenced review body reported in 1972 but that was still not the end of the outside independent examination of the matter. The recommendations of the review body were sent for further examination by a special committee of the non-partisan Employer-Labour Conference <Col N="2025" /> and ultimately on 22nd December, 1972, the Employer-Labour Conference made their recommendations. In June, 1973, on behalf of this Government, I announced publicly that the Government had decided in principle that increases in the levels of remuneration of parliamentarians, the judiciary and civil servants should be kept in step with the rounds of the national wage agreements.  Our objective in so doing was to maintain what the reference to the review body in 1969 set out to achieve, an independent means of determining appropriate allowances for Members of the Oireachtas and others whose income levels for some reason or another tend to provoke unpleasant comment from some quarters.</P>
    <P>The increased allowances proposed in the new order reflect the independent assessment which has been made of what allowances are now appropriate for Members of the Oireachtas. This simply involves the application to them of the terms of the national agreement negotiated between the trade union movement on the one hand and employers on the other and completely refutes the fanciful allegation that Members of the Oireachtas freely determine their own rates of remuneration.</P>
    <P>The increased allowances which are provided for in this Supplementary Estimate and the increased salaries which will be payable to judges by virtue of a draft order which the Government have tabled in the Dáil provides no more than what was received by people with equivalent incomes to whom the national wage agreement was applicable.  It should be appreciated that the money is being paid in arrear as most of it was payable as far back as 1st June and 1st September last.  There will be no increases in 1976 for either judges or Members of the Oireachtas and members of the Government are foregoing a great deal more.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, notwithstanding their normal entitlement under the 1975 national agreement to have their salaries increased with effect from 1st June, 1st September and 1st December last and indeed to further increases on 1st March next, <Col N="2026" /> the Government have voluntarily and very deliberately declined those increases. Similarly the increases for remuneration will not be paid to Parliamentary Secretaries, the Attorney General, or Chairmen or Deputy Chairmen of either Houses of the Oireachtas.  The value of the increases from 1st June, 1975, to 31st December, 1976, thus declined by the Taoiseach amount to £2,364, and to £1,577 in the case of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Having made an appeal for a national pay pause in 1976, a pay pause which is crucial to the achievement of economic recovery, the Government consider that it would be most inappropriate to pay any new increases to members of the Government or other office holders or to judges throughout 1976 and similarly they have decided that no further increases in allowances will be payable to Members of the Oireachtas in 1976.  This pay pause is greater than that which the Government have been seeking from the community as a whole because the effect of this decision will be that Members of the Oireachtas, judges and the other people affected will not receive the final instalments of the current national agreement which in the absence of this decision would be payable.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to remind everybody that the remuneration of judges, Ministers and other office holders and TDs and Senators is subject to income tax.  As some of the people concerned will be liable for tax at a rate of 77 pence in the £, the real value of their net increases is considerably less than the gross.  This factor, together with the fact that as from April next all the remuneration I have referred to will come within the PAYE system, will hopefully still at least save critical comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's concern to refute ill-informed comment on this matter but he seemed somewhat defensive and unnecessarily so.  I confirm my agreement with the factual position as outlined by the Minister historically in regard to what has happened.  I should like to say that when it came to the <Col N="2027" /> actual implementation of the national wage agreement in regard to the salaries and allowances of Deputies, Senators and office holders, it was not applied in full.  The Devlin recommendations were reduced and the national wage agreement was not applied in full.  That is factually correct but, as far as I can ascertain, the position is that most people who have objected to the proposed increases to Deputies, Senators and office holders, have ignored the fact that payment is being made in arrears.  It was due from June last. They have also been in the main people who either have received the national agreement themselves or who are not prepared to propose that the national agreement should not be applied to anybody, such as the public service or people in the private sector.</P>
      <P>Anybody who is putting forward the case that the national agreement should not be applied to Deputies, Senators and office holders, should be prepared also to say that it should not be applied to anybody else; that there should not be any national agreement, that there should be a pay pause instead of the existing agreement. Otherwise, they are illogical or are singling out Members of the Oireachtas as the one group who should not be allowed by law to receive the national agreement.  That is an untenable position and one I would not accept.  Therefore, I have no difficulty in supporting the Minister's proposal in regard to this agreement.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise a matter on this Estimate which I find a little difficult.  Indeed, I would rather if I did not have to do so, but it is probably the only way I can deal with the matter.  It has come to my attention recently that there has been a certain amount of unsatisfactory industrial relations in the State Laboratory. People who have given many years&mdash;in some cases exceeding 30 years&mdash;satisfactory service under previous State chemists now find themselves involved in difficulties and disputes in the State Laboratory.  I have heard only one side of this story and I do not wish to be taken as condemning the other side.  But it does seem, on the face of it, that what has happened indicates that something has gone wrong with industrial relations in the State Laboratory.  I want to ask the Minister if he would personally, or if, as understandably, he might not be able personally to involve himself in this, designate a very senior officer in one of his Departments, whichever is the appropriate one, presumably, the Department of the Public Service, to look into this matter.  Something is going wrong that should not be happening.  I do not want to drag out here details of what I have heard but I am satisfied that what has happened indicates that it is necessary for somebody to intervene from outside to remedy what is going on.  I am urging the Minister to ensure that that is done.</P>

      <P>The Minister may recall that on a previous year I raised a point and I think I raised it again last year. Speaking from recollection I think the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was standing in for the Minister for Finance on this particular issue.  The point I raised was that there has tended to be an undue delay in dealing with the granting of gratuities and pensions to persons retiring in the public service, the public service in its widest sense.  I have known of cases of considerable hardship arising from this kind of delay.  I was urging that every effort be made to avoid this delay, in my view, in most cases being avoidable.  I think that, when I raised this last year, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs told me that, shortly before that, a special direction had gone out from the Minister for Finance in this regard.  I wonder if the Minister for Finance could now tell me whether there has been any improvement in regard to the delay of which I am speaking.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,287,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for Remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,946,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate contains £8 million extra for telephone development this year in accordance with the announcement made by the Minister for Finance in his June budget statement.  The extra expenditure is fully offset by a corresponding increase in Appropriations-in-Aid as capital expenditure on the telephone system is recovered from telephone capital funds.</P>
      <P>Provision is made for pay increases granted under the first and second phases of the 16th Round and for some other pay increases granted in accordance with the national pay agreements. The cost of these pay increases amounts to £4,996,000.  To this has to be added £500,000 for higher social welfare contributions, but various savings reduce the extra amount needed for subhead A to £4,667,000.</P>
      <P>Under subhead L.2 an extra £30,000 is provided for an increased grant-in-aid to Radio Telefís Éireann because net receipts from wired broadcast relay licence fees will be higher than shown in the original estimate.  The balance of almost £2 million in the Supplementary Estimate is required mainly because of inflation which has affected expenditure under several subheads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" /> The total original net Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs for 1975 was £84,256,000.  This is now being increased to £91,202,000.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go ndeonófar suim fhorlíontach nach mó ná £10 chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Nollaig, 1975, le haghaidh tuarastail agus costais Roinn na Gaeltachta, maille le deontais le haghaidh tithe agus ildeontais-i-gcabhair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é an phríomhchúis leis an Meastachán Forlíontach seo ná gur údar-aíodh ardú 25 per cent sna deontais do mhná tí sa Ghaeltacht faoi Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge tar éis don Mheastachán Bunaidh a bheith foilsithe. Ar ndóigh, tá na deontais <Col N="2036" /> mhéadaithe sin íoctha leis na mná tí cheana féin agus tá beagnach £½ mhilliún curtha isteach sa Ghaeltacht ag mo Roinnse faoin scéim i mbliana &mdash;gan trácht ar dheontais chaipitíochta na Roinne Oideachais, táillí na dtuismitheoirí ná caiteachas na ndaltaí féin.  I dteannta leis an méadú sna deontais tháinig méadú go 16,810 ar líon na ndaltaí a rinne freastal ar chúrsaí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht an samhradh seo caite.  B'é sin an líon ba mhó go dtí seo agus is ionann é agus fás 27 per cent in imeacht trí bliana.  Tá an-áthas ormsa go bhfuil na cúrsaí ag dul ar aghaidh chomh maith sin agus tá súil agam go mbeidh tuilleadh daltaí fós ag triall ar an nGaeltacht feasta chun feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Glactar leis an deis seo freisin chun an soláthar a mhéadú i gcúpla áit eile sa Vóta do rudaí ilghnéitheacha a bhfuil níos mó á chaitheamh orthu i mbliana ná mar a bhí measta.  Mar shampla, tá breis agus £150,000 caite ar an gcóras leictreachais ar Inis Mór Árann.</P>
    <P>Le freastal ar an gcaiteachas breise tá sábhála in áiteanna eile sa Vóta agus, dá réir sin, is é atá á mholadh agam ná Meastachán Forlíontach do shuim chomharthach £10.</P>
    <P>Os rud é nár pléadh an Meastachán Bunaidh agus go bhfuil suas le huair a chloig le caitheamh againn ar an Meastachán Forlíontach seo, glacaim agam gur ceart dom tagairt a dhéanamh don dul chun cinn a rinneadh i rith na bliana seo.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Rialtas breis agus £10½ mhilliún san iomlán ar fáil do Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Gaeltarra Éireann i mbliana&mdash;an t-iomlán is mó riamh agus méadú 150 per cent ar an soláthar a bhí ar fáil dóibh sa bhliain 1972-73.  Leanadh ar aghaidh go díograiseach leis an obair ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá suas le £1.35 mhilliún caite ag an Roinn i mbliana ar scéimeanna feabhsúcháin agus tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht. Chuaigh Bord na Gaeilge i mbun oibre chun leas na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn agus go háirithe labhairt na Gaeilge mar theanga bheo a leathnú <Col N="2037" /> i measc an phobail.  Cheap siad Príomhoifigeach agus tá Riarthóirí á lorg acu faoi láthair.  Beidh an tuarascáil ón gCoiste um Thaighde ar Dhearcadh an Phobail i dtaobh na Gaeilge ina cabhair mhór don Bhord: tá súil agam go mbeidh cóipeanna ar fáil go han-luath anois.</P>
    <P>Tá tuarascáil agus cuntais Ghaeltarra Éireann don bhliain 1974 faoi bhráid na Dála agus foilsithe anois is oth liom nach raibh siad ar fáil i bhfad roimhe seo.  Ní miste a rá go bhfuil treoir tugtha agam do Ghaeltarra féachaint chuige go mbeidh an tuarascáil oifigiúil don bhliain 1975 ar fáil go luath an bhliain seo chugainn. Idir dhá linn tá réamhthuairisc ar 1975 ullmhaithe ag Gaeltarra agus ba mhaith liom roinnt dá bhfuil inti a lua mar eolas do Theachtaí ós iad iarrachtaí Ghaeltarra is mó a chuireann fostaíocht ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Is cúis mhór sásaimh dom go bhfuil suas le 3,000 duine ag obair anois faoi scáth Ghaeltarra.  Is iad na tionscail atá i gceist agam ná na cinn a bhíodh á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra féin, na comhthionscail ina bhfuil scaireanna ag Gaeltarra agus na miontionscail ar chabhraigh Gaeltarra leo.  Sna tionscail sin cuireadh beagnach 400 duine breise ag obair i rith na bliana seo.  Ní beag an dul chun cinn é sin nuair a bhí 1975 ar an mbliain ba dheacra i gcúrsaí eacnamaíochta ó thráth an dara cogadh domhanda i leith.</P>
    <P>Deir Gaeltarra sa réamhthuairisc gur ceadaíodh deontais £2½ mhilliún do 12 chomhthionscal agus 69 miontionscal i mbliana agus go meastar go gcuirfidh siad sin 840 post breise ar fáil taobh istigh de trí bliana.</P>
    <P>Tá béim ar leith á cur ag Gaeltarra ar fhorbairt acmhainní nádúrtha na Gaeltachta agus luaitear go háirithe an obair thrialach atá ar siúl ar fhás oisrí i 15 cheantar i nGaillimh, i Maigh Eo agus i nDún na nGall.  Tá taighde ar siúl d'fhonn feidhm níos éifeachtaí a bhaint as an talamh ar mhaithe le hainmhithe, plandaí, mianrai, móin agus foraoiseacht.</P>
    <P>Fuair Gaeltarra £37,434 ó Chiste Sóisialta na hEorpa i mbliana i leith deontas oiliúna.  Bhí cabhair á lorg ó FEOGA freisin do thograí próiseála <Col N="2038" /> éisc.  Bhí roinnt tograí Gaeltachta san áireamh in iarratas na tíre seo ar chúnamh ó Chiste Réigiúnach na hEorpa.</P>
    <P>Faoin Scéim Forbartha Pobal atá á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra bronnadh duaiseanna don chéad uair ar 16 phobal an mhí seo caite.</P>
    <P>Tá scaireanna ag Gaeltarra anois i 60 comhlacht&mdash;ar a n-áirítear ceithre cinn a bhí mar rannóga déantúsaíochta agus trádála ag Gaeltarra féin cheana. Maidir leis na rannóga sin de chuid Ghaeltarra&mdash;cniotáil, bréidín, snáth agus innealtóireacht phlaisteach&mdash;is léir go bhfuil dul chun cinn maith á dhéanamh acu: meastar go mbeidh brabach trádála £30,000 acu i mbliana. Is iad na díolacháin mheasta do 1975 ná £2,136,000&mdash;méadú 18.4 per cent ó 1974 agus méadú 17.5 per cent ar na honnmhairithe san áireamh.</P>
    <P>Tógadh seacht réamh-mhonarcha i mbliana sna háiteanna seo&mdash;Na Dúnaibh Béal an Mhuirthead, Bun an Churraigh, Cill an tSíáin, An Cheathrú Rua, Béal Átha an Ghaorthaidh agus An Rinn&mdash;agus tá réamhmhonarchana á dtógáil i mBaile na Finne agus i gCorr na Móna.</P>
    <P>Ní beag a raibh ar siúl ag Gaeltarra freisin chun feabhas a chur ar chúrsaí cumarsáide agus pearsanra agus chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Sílim go léiríonn na pointí sin as an réamhthuairisc do 1975 gur maith an dul chun cinn atá déanta ag Gaeltarra i mbliana in ainneoin na ndeacrachtaí uile a bhí le sárú.  Ach feabhas a theacht ar an gcor eacnamaíochta is cinnte go bhfuil Gaeltarra gléasta go maith anois chun brú ar aghaidh go tréan leis an bhforbairt ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfainn a lán eile a rá ach b'fhéidir gurbh fhearr deis labhartha a thabhairt do Theachtaí eile ar dtús. Molaim an Meastachán Forlíontach don Teach.</P>

      <P>Tá roinnt ceisteanna agam le cur ar an Aire mar gheall ar an obair a rinneadh i rith na bliana.  Níl mórán eolais anseo. Sé mo bharúil go bhfuil béim ar thionscail sa Ghaeltacht.  Is maith an rud é sin.  Nuair a bhí an Teachta Faulkner <Col N="2039" /> i bhfeidhil ghnó na Gaeltachta thosnaigh sé leis an dtionsclaíocht.  B'shin tús tionscail dáiríre a chur ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht.  Is gá cuid mhór den saghas oibre sin a dhéanamh.  Is gá fostaíocht a chur ar siúl ar fud na Gaeltachta do dhaoine óga, do dhaoine nach bhfuil chomh h-óg a choinneáil i gcónaí ansin, agus slí beatha níos fearr a chur ar fáil dóibh agus tá an tAire ag leanúint ar an ród sin.</P>
      <P>Sílim go bhfuil an tAire ag déanamh dearmhad.  Tá obair tábhachtach á dhéanamh ag Roinn na Gaeltachta, sé sin, fóithint ar an dteanga agus forbairt a dhéanamh ar an dteanga féin.  Muna ndéantar sin ní féidir an teanga a chur á h-úsáid go foirleathan ar fud na tíre.  Níl an ceangal sin á dhéanamh ag an Aire.  Cé go bhfuil tionscail á gcur ar siúl agus mar sin de níl an ceangal ceart idir na gnóthaí atá ar siúl agus forbairt agus borradh na Gaeilge.  Le roinnt blianta anuas comóradh rudaí áirithe, cuir i gcás, Bliain na mBan, Bliain na Coillteoir-eachta. In abairt amháin, comóradh gné éigin de chúrsaí forbartha.  Molaim don Aire anois go gcuirfeadh sé Bliain na Gaeilge ar siúl sa dóigh go gcuirfí ina luí ar mhuintir na hÉireann ar fad tábhacht na teangan.</P>
      <P>Rinneadh taighde ar dhearcadh an phobail i leith na Gaeilge.  Bhí an tuarascáil idir-dá-linn ag an Aire ó Aibreán, 1974 agus bhí cóipeanna den tuarascáil sin á scaipeadh ar fud na tíre le sé mhí anuas.  Cúpla lá ó shin fuair mé féin cóip den tuarascáil sin. De réir na tuarascála sin, is gá níos mó a dhéanamh maidir le ceist na Gaeilge féin.  Is gné amháin&mdash;gné tábhachtach &mdash; den obair an tionsclaíocht agus mar sin de ach tá níos mó ná sin i gceist.  Ní thuigeann an tAire go bhfuil rudaí eile i gceist chomh maith&mdash;ceist na teangan, ceist an chultúir agus ceist mheon na ndaoine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus níl faic á dhéanamh aige taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht chun ceist na teangan d'fhorbairt.  Níl mórán ama ann anois ach, mar sin féin, tá go leor ama ag an Aire chun réiteach a dhéanamh chun an bhliain 1976 a fhógairt mar Bhliain na Teangan, Bliain na Gaeilge.</P>

      <Col N="2040" /> Roinnt ama ó shin d'fhógair an tAire go dtabharfadh sé Bille isteach chun Údarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú.  Dúirt sé go mbeadh an Bille sin os comhair na Dála roimh shaoire an tSamhraidh i mbliana.  Nuair nach raibh comhartha ar bith go mbeadh an Bille sin os comhair na Dála ag an am sin, chuir mé ceist ar an Aire.  Dúirt sé go mbeadh an Bille os comhair na Dála roimh shaoire na Nollag.  Níl. Cén fáth nach bhfuil?  Nach bhfuair sé cead ón Rialtas an Bille sin a chur os comhair na Dála?  Cad tá á choinneáil siar?  Tá glactha ag an bhFreasúra seo le prionsabal Údarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú.  Táimid taobh thiar de sin.  Táimid sásta pé cuidiú is gá a thabhairt don Aire ach níl an tAire ag tabhairt seans dúinn nó seans don Teach seo Bille a chur tríd an Dáil chun an Údarás sin a bhunú. Sílim gur tábhachtach an rud don Ghaeltacht agus don Gaeilge agus don tír ar fad go mbeadh údarás neamhspleách don Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Thug an tAire gealltanas oíche eile mar gheall ar ghnéithe forbartha eile nár chomhlíon sé ach oiread.  Is olc an rud go mbeadh bolscaireacht ar siúl ag Aire.  Tá céad faoin gcéad de mharcanna gnóthaithe ag an Aire as an saghas bolscaireachta a dheineann sé.  Admhaím go bhfuil rudaí fónta déanta ag an Aire maidir le cursaí tionsclaíochta ach tá a lán dár gheall sé ar na laetheanta seo nach bhfuil curtha i gcrích aige agus seo an rud is tábhachtaí.  Thug sé geallúint faoi dhó go mbeadh an Bille seo i bhfeidhm i mbliana agus go mbeadh údarás bunaithe.  Anois níl sin déanta. Molaim dó an Bille sin a thabhairt isteach go luath san mbliain nua.  Má tá deacrachtaí aige chun a thuairimí féin faoin údarás chur ina luí ar an Rialtas cuideoidh mé leis anois.  Sílim féin gur gá údarás láidir a bheith ann &mdash;údarás go mbeadh baill de na h-eagrais atá ag feidhmiú sa Ghaeltacht páirteach ann.  Ba cheart cuid acu sin, pé scéal é, i dtoghchán a thoghadh agus go mbeadh dóthain airgid chum obair feidhmiúil a chéanamh, go mbeadh cumhacht acu.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios ag an Aire féin an rud atá i gceist agam.  Sílim gur ceart Gaeltarra Éireann a thabhairt isteach <Col N="2041" /> faoi scáth an údaráis sin.  Sílim gur ceart go mbeadh cumhacht phleanála ag an údarás.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh Radio na Gaeltachta faoin údarás. Sin an sórt ruda atá ar intinn agam agus is gá é má táimid chun Bliain na Gaeilge a chur ar siúl.  Sílim gur gá cumhachtaí a bheith ag údarás atá bunaithe sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>De réir na tuarascála ar an dtaighde a rinneadh tá daoine ag rá nár cheart dúinn &ldquo;ghetto&rdquo; a dhéanamh den Ghaeltacht.  Níl sin i gceist ar chor ar bith.  Le blianta anuas tá cabhair faoi leith á tabhairt don Ghaeltacht.  Is gá sin.  Tá riachtanas leis agus beidh sna blianta atá le teacht.  Aon deighilt a rinneadh baineann sé leis an rud adúirt an tAire féin&mdash;Bord Fhorbairt an Iarthair a bhunú.  Sin deighilt níos mó ná údarás a chur ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht. Níl aon eolas ró-mhór tugtha faoi Bhord Fhorbairt an Iarthair ach tuigim nach bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Aire ach cuid de chontaethe an iarthair a chur faoin mbord seo.  Pé scéal é, is rud eile é sin.</P>
    <P>Ba cuid eile den bholscaireacht a bhí ar siúl ag an Aire, na geallúintí a thug sé ach nár chomhlíon sé.  Deir sé anseo go bhfuil 400 post nua curtha ar bun sa Ghaeltacht.  An bhfuil curtha san áireamh aige monarchana agus tionscail a bhí ansin cheana féin, gur chuir sé ainm nua orthu?</P>

      <P>Níor chuir mé isteach ar an Aire.  Cuir i gcás Óstán Ceathrú Rua, Saltoy.  Bhí déantús bréagán ar siúl ag Gaeltarra Éireann le blianta anuas ach toisc gur ghlac Solus Teoranta seacht scaireanna faoin gcéad sa chomhlacht nua Saltoy tá mé ag cur ceisteanna ar an Aire. An bhfuil na hoibrithe atá ag obair i Saltoy i measc na 400?  An bhfuil siad i measc na hoibrithe a chuaigh i mbun oibre agus an bhfuil Saltoy eile liostáilte mar mhonarcha nó mar dhéantus nua?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl mórán ama agam.  Tá scéal fada faoi Quartz Acla.  Cé mhéid duine atá ag obair i Quartz Acla?  An bhfuil 17 ag obair ann?  An bhfuil an 17 i measc na 400 sin?  Mar níl duine ar bith ag obair i Quartz Acla.  Níl déantúsaí ar <Col N="2042" /> siúl acu.  Tá na soilse ansin.  Nuair a tógadh amach an guthán agus nuair a ghearr an BSL amach an solas chuir an tAire iachall ar Ghaeltarra Éireann é sin a chur ar ais toisc go raibh fó-thoghchán ag teacht in iarthar Mhaigh Eo.  Tá monarcha eile in Aicill, réamh-mhonarcha.  Nuair a bhí Ceannaire an pháirtí seo ar an oileán i rith an fhó-thoghcháin bhí na soilse ar fáil lasta sa réamh-mhonarcha sin ach ní raibh obair ar bith ar siúl inti.  Sin cleasaíocht, sin pleidhcaíocht agus cuirim sin i leith an Aire. Cad mar gheall are na haer-stráicí a gheall sé&mdash;aer-stráice in iarthar Thír Chonaill?  Níl rud ar bith déanta faoi sin agus an t-aer-stráice in Aicill agus an t-aer-stráice in Iorras.  Cad mar gheall ar an mbád farantóireachta d'Árann Mhór i dTír Chonaill&mdash;gealltanas eile?  Cad faoi chéibheanna a dúnadh i dTír Chonaill?  Conas mar atá an scéal faoin réamh-mhonarcha a gheall sé i gCloich Cheannfhaoilidh i nContae Thír Chonaill agus a lán rudaí eile nach bhfuil am agam trácht a dhéanamh orthu?</P>
    <P>Luaigh mé cheana féin an ceangal be cheart a bheith idir Roinn na Gaeltachta, an Ghaeilge agus na heagrais atá sa Ghaeltacht.  Níor mhaith liom dá ndéarfadh an tAire liom nach bhfuil béim againne ar thionsclaíocht sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá ach ní leor sin.  An bhfuil aon rud déanta ag an Aire i leith forbairt na Gaeilge maidir le hobair na gcomhairlí gcontae go bhfuil Gaeltachtaí acu chun ceangal idir an Ghaeltacht agus seirbhísí na gcomhairlí gcontae sna Gaeltachtaí sin?  Mar an gcéanna leis na seirbhísí Stáit, na Ranna Stáit.  Ar rinne an tAire aon rud chun comhoibriú a dhéanamh lena Roinn féin agus le Ranna Stáit nó an chuid de Ranna Stáit atá ag obair agus ag feidhmiú sna Gaeltachtaí?  Cén forbairt a mhol sé go ndéanfaí ar úsáid na teangan ansin, na boird Stáit mar Bord na Móna, Bord Iascaigh Mhara?  An bhfuil aon rud déanta aige faoi théacsleabhair scoile agus is tábhachtach an rud é sin?  Is mór an trua nach bhfuil go leor ama chun an scéal seo a phlé &mdash;ceist leabhar scoile agus nuachtán sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba cheart don Aire rud éigin a dhéanamh chun forbairt <Col N="2043" /> a dhéanamh ar Radio na Gaeltachta. Is rud tábhachtach an rud é agus is íontach an méid duine atá ag éisteacht le Radio na Gaeltachta ach níor tháinig aon mhéadú ar na tráthanna craolta.  Molaim go ndéanfaí athrú air sin.</P>
    <P>Ceist eile.  Chuir mé ceist parlaiminte os comhair na Dála chuig an Aire mar gheall ar chaiteachas d'oscailtí oifigiúil agus rudaí mar sin agus taisteal.  Is é an freagra a fuair mé: £900 ar fad. Cad iad na &ldquo;functions&rdquo; a bhí ar siúl i rith na bliana agus i rith na bliana roimhe sin chomh maith agus cé íoc astu?  Níor tháinig an t-airgead as an £900 más fíor an freagra a thug sé dom. Sílim gur chosnaigh ceann amháin an méid sin.  An é Gaeltarra Éireann a d'íoc astu?  Is iad na &ldquo;functions&rdquo; atá i gceist agam iad siúd go raibh an tAire mar &ldquo;host&rdquo; orthu agus go raibh sé i láthair.  An féidir leis a rá an raibh an tuarascáil seo ag Gaeltarra Éireann?  Ní bhfuair mé an tuarascáil seo go dtí inniu.  D'oscail mé an litir leath uair a chloig ó shin.  Is mór an trua nach raibh sí againn inné.  Bhí an tuarascáil seo ag a lán daoine ar fud na tíre roimh inné.</P>

Bhí sí ag daoine taobh amuigh den Teach seo nár ceart dóibh an tuarascáil a bheith acu&mdash;doiciméad príobháideach a bhí ann&mdash;ach ní raibh sí againne.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil aon trácht sa tuarascáil seo, ar an rud ar a bhfuil mé ag caint&mdash;na &ldquo;functions&rdquo; seo agus an méid airgid a thug Gaeltarra Éireann dó.  Ar chuir an tAire iachall an Gaeltarra Éireann an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cathain a bheidh Roinn na Gaeltachta <Col N="2044" /> ag dul go Furbo i nGaillimh? Níl eolas ar bith tugtha anseo faoi sin.  Nuair a chuireadh an Ghaeilge ar ceal maidir le dul isteach sa Státseirbhís an raibh an tuarascáil ar thaighde ar dhearcadh an phobail ag an Rialtas?  An raibh sí ag Aire na Gaeltachta an t-am sin?  Ar glacadh an céim sin toisc an moladh atá sa taighde sin?</P>
    <P>Cad tá á dhéanamh maidir le ceárd-oideachas sa Ghaeltacht?  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil AnCO ag obair i nGaoth Dobhair.  Sílim go bhfuil an iomarca béime ar oideachas acadúil agus gur ceart forbairt a dhéanamh ar cheárdoideachas&mdash;oideachas a thabharfadh na scileanna d'aos óg na Gaeltachta.  Chun na tionscail a oibriú agus an Ghaeilge a spreagadh is ceart béim a chur ar an saghas oideachais sin.  Beidh níos mó le rá agam muna gcuireann an tAire Údarás na Gaeltachta ar bun.</P>

Chuir sé ionadh orm ar maidin nuair adúirt an Teachta <Col N="2045" /> Cunningham gur cleasaí a bhí in Aire na Gaeltachta.  Chuir sé brón agus díomá orm.  Tá meas mór ar Aire na Gaeltachta ar fud na tíre.  Ní raibh riamh sa tír Aire a bhí chomh maith le hAire na Gaeltachta.  Tá sé soiléir ón ráiméis a chuala mé ar maidin nár chuaigh an Teachta Cunningham leasmuigh de Dhún na nGall agus níl a fhios aige cad tá ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Tá sé soiléir nach bhfuil aon tuiscint ag an Teachta Cunningham maidir le cad tá ar siúl ins na Gaeltachtaí mar tá clú agus cáil ar Aire na Gaeltachta ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Bíonn sé ann uile sheachtain&mdash;ar Oileán Cléire, i mBéal Átha an Ghaorthaidh, i Rinn ó gCuanach, i gCiarraí, i Maigh Eo, i nGaillimh agus i gContae Dhún na nGall.  Gach uile sheachtain bíonn an Aire i measc na ndaoine ins na Gaeltachtaí agus tá aithne chomh maith ag na daoine air go bhfuil sé cosúil le comharsa béaldorais.</P>
      <P>Cuireann sé an-áthas orm gur thug an tAire i bhfad níos mó airgid do na mná tí atá ag coimeád na scoláirí ins na Gaeltachtaí arís i mbliana ach tá rud éigin ag dhéanamh scime dhom mar gheall air sin.  Measaim go bhfuil a thuilleadh brabúis á dhéanamh ag na daoine atá ag rith na gcoláistí seo.  Sin tuairim phearsanta. Dúras é cheana agus deirim arís inniu é.  Léas sa pháipéar gur dhein comharchumann amháin breis agus £41,000 brabach as na coláistí samhraidh sin. Ní ceart é sin.  Measaim go mba cheart an tairgead sin a thabhairt do na páistí nó na mná tí i bhfoirm deontaisí. B'fhéidir go mbeadh na mná tí ábalta na páistí a thabhairt ar fud na Gaeltachta agus na rudaí suimiúla a thaispeáint dóibh.  Sin é mo thuairim phearsanta agus deirim arís inniu é.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta Cunningham nach raibh suim ag an Aire i gcúrsaí cultúir. <Col N="2046" /> Thug Aire na Gaeltachta deontas mór d'Oireachtas na nGael.  Thug sé deontas mór do Shiamsa Tíre agus tá Oireachtas na nGael agus Siamsa Tíre ag déanamh a lán ar son chultúr na tíre lasmuigh de na Gaeltachtaí agus maidir le Siamsa Tíre tá cáil orthu ar fud na hEorpa agus i sna Stáit Aontaithe.</P>
    <P>Is é an chéad rud a chaithfidh an tAire a dhéanamh ná daoine a choimeád sa Ghaeltacht.  Chun é sin a dhéanamh caithfidh sé dul ar aghaidh leis an obair mhaith atá ar siúl aige chun a thuilleadh monarchana a chur isteach ins na Gaeltachtaí mar caithfear na daoine a choimeád ann chun an Ghaeilge a choimeád.  Cén mhaith Gaeltachta a bheith ann muna bhfuil daoine ann chun an teanga a labhairt?</P>
    <P>Déanaim comhgháirdeachas le Gaeltarra Éireann agus na hoifigigh atá i gceannas.  Tá siad tar éis a thaispeáint go soiléir go bhfuil suim acu ins na Gaeltachtaí, go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó monarchana ag dul suas agus go bhfuil na daoine ag fanacht ins na Gaeltachtaí mar gheall ar sin.  Chuir an Teachta Molloy ceist orm inné mar gheall ar na daoine atá ag teacht isteach sa tír.  I 1975 tháinig breis is 10,000 duine isteach sa tír.  Níl said ag dul amach a thuilleadh; ag teacht isteach atá said. A lán de na daoine sin, tháinig siad thar n-ais go dtí na Gaeltachtaí go dtí a ndúthaigh féin chun na páistí a thógaint suas ins na Gaeltachtaí ionnas go mbeadh siad ábalta dul ar scoil sa tír seo agus an Ghaeilge a bheith mar gnáth-theanga acu.  Tá an scéal mar sin mórthimpeall na Gaillimhe, Maigh Eo agus i gCiarraí.</P>

    <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht, Mr. O'Donnell, stated in the Dáil on 15th July that 11 new companies had been approved in the period April, 1973-May, 1975 but admitted in an answer which he gave me yesterday in the Dáil that only five new factories were approved for the 11 companies.  The five between them&mdash;<Col N="2048" /> he stated in the reply given in the Dáil yesterday&mdash;were employing 59 persons on 30th June, 1975.  By my figures in regard to the number of new factories I am referring to&mdash;I am dealing specifically with the Galway Gaeltacht&mdash;this means that the Minister's efforts to attract industry since he came into office have resulted in the creation of 59 new jobs in the Galway Gaeltacht.  The Minister informed the Dáil last week that Saltoys' factory in Spiddal, County Galway, which employed 62 persons is about to be closed.  If the net result of the Minister's efforts since he came into office in the Galway Gaeltacht is the creation of 59 new jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. What about the miontionscail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and Saltoys are closing with a loss of 62 jobs, the result of that can only be, as it appears to me on the surface, reading those figures, a net loss of three manufacturing jobs in the Galway Gaeltacht which is a very poor return&mdash; going backwards, no progress.  This is a catastrophic situation and demands the attention of the community and the Dáil who have so willingly provided the Minister with millions of pounds.  Where has this money been spent?  The Dáil is entitled to the fullest information.  From local gossip &mdash;which is the only way one can get information about the Minister's Department&mdash;I believe, and I am informed that over £100,000 has been lost in one factory alone in the Galway Gaeltacht.  Where have the other hundreds of thousands of pounds been spent?  Has the Minister made any reference to a loss of over £100,000 in his speech in the Dáil today?  No: he couched his speech again in the most glowing terms and completely omits to state the hard facts.  We are not getting the full story from the Minister for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enormous sums spent by the Minister on what now seems to have been useless travel abroad and on high entertainment at home have not resulted in the creation of one extra new job in the Galway Gaeltacht. After nearly three years of heavy <Col N="2049" /> spending by the Minister, I think it is imperative that a cost-benefit analysis be carried out into the expenditure of Roinn na Gaeltachta and Gaeltarra Éireann.  The auditor general must be asked to investigate this affair on behalf of the taxpayers.  The Gaeltacht people must be told whether moneys provided by the Dáil for the purpose of providing them with jobs is, in fact, being spent for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that Gaeltarra Éireann have been excluded from the list of public bodies to be examined by Members of the Oireachtas.  Why the attempt to avoid critical examination of an important public body such as Gaeltarra Éireann?  The public are entitled to know if all the industries which receive financial aid from moneys voted by Dáil Éireann are being operated on sound commercial principles.  Why has not the Minister informed the Dáil that 17 men in Achill are being kept on in a factory that has been empty for several months past?  That factory, naturally, is producing nothing but those men are going to work each day and nothing is being produced.  Of course, Achill is in West Mayo and there was a by-election pending and we know the cleasaíocht that went on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>From my own inquiries I now have a good idea of the present position and it does not correspond with the glowing picture painted so often by the Minister in his many statements and in statements by his public relations people at State expense.</P>
      <P>To give an example of the distorted type of information given to this Dáil by the Minister, I need again only quote from the Official Report of 15th July, 1975.  On that occasion he mentioned that 11 comhtionscal nua were approved in 1974 and grants were approved for 82 miontionscal in that year.  He then stated that at the end of 1974 Gaeltarra Éireann were involved in 46 comhtionscal and 268 miontionscal.  He then claimed there was an increase of 80 per cent in the number of comhtionscal and miontionscal that had received assistance from Gaeltarra Éireann since he took office.  If that is so, we must add 268 miontionscal with the 46 comhtionscal mentioned which give a figure of 314. If 80 per cent of that figure is equal to 251, it means that the Minister grant-aided 251 companies in the first two-year period of his being in office. If that is so I would ask him to give the Dáil the names of these 251 companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that in making that request I am doing the Dáil a service by highlighting the manner in which statistics are being distorted in the statements that emanate from the Department and from the Minister himself.  I believe too that he should now state the true position and admit that if he allocates even a £10 grant for a company that he claims this as a new company and adds the same <Col N="2052" /> company in again for the purpose of his distorted statistics.</P>
    <P>Where are the 251 companies&mdash;the 80 per cent he claimed?  It is a shame this has been going on for so long and that the Dáil has been treated in that fashion by the Minister.  It is time he applied the same standards to his statements as the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the IDA apply to theirs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>One would not find this distortion in the claims for progress being made by the IDA.  If that authority rescue a company which employs 300, and is in danger of closing, succeed in attracting new principals and form a new company, and if they save those 300 jobs, they do not claim them as 300 new jobs and say that there were 600 jobs involved altogether. They state the bald facts&mdash; that they managed through their efforts to save 300 jobs.  The Minister is using statistics in a fashion which distorts the true position.</P>

Is deontaisí caogadh faoin gcéad iad seo a bhí le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta i gcónaí.  Níl aon mholadh sa Mheastachán seo go mbeadh na deontaisí seo le fáil.</P>
      <P>Rud eile, maidir le cúrsaí báid.  Chuir an tAire uaschéim £4,000 ar iasachtaí le haghaidh bád.  Ní féidir le duine anois níos mó ná deontas £4,000 a fháil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta cé go mbíodh ocht faoin gcéad den éirlis le fáil ag daoine roimhe seo.  Ó thárla go bhfuil báid ag éirí daor fágann sin go bhfuil sé ag teannadh siar ar dheontaisí a bhí le fáil roimhe seo ag daoine sa Ghaeltacht.  Rud eile, níl mórán airgid le haghaidh bóithre áise, níl aon ardú ar dheontaisí le haghaidh cúrsaí tigh, níl aon athrú ar an scéim tithíochta agus cé go bhfuil daoine ag tógáil tithe sna Gaeltachtaí tá na tithe daor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,609,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, <Col N="2054" /> 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The main Estimate for Agriculture for 1975, amounting to £76,927,000, was passed on 19th June last.  A Supplementary Estimate providing £9 million for consumer subsidies on butter and liquid milk was passed on 18th July last.  This brought the total provisions for such subsidies in the Agriculture Vote to nearly £10 million taking account of the provision of almost £1 million already included in the main Estimate for consumer subsidy on butter.</P>
    <P>This further Supplementary Estimate when added to the previous Supplementary Estimate and the original Estimate for 1975 brings the total net expenditure from the Agriculture Vote to £90,536,000.  The £4.6 million now sought takes into account miscellaneous savings amounting to £11.3 million to which I shall be referring in the course of my statement.</P>
    <P>The first item I shall deal with is the extra provision required in connection with the capital grant schemes operated by my Department.  The total capital grant payments under subheads D.2, D.3 and M.1 with the adjustments now being made will exceed £10 million in 1975 as compared with £6.1 million provided for the nine months of 1974.</P>
    <P>Grants continue to be payable in respect of works carried out under the former land project and farm buildings, water supplies and horticultural schemes.  As recently announced, the date by which works must be completed under these schemes in order to qualify for grant payment has been fixed at 30th September, 1976.  These schemes will thus, effectively, cease to operate as from that date.</P>
    <P>Already, and increasingly so from now on, capital grants to farmers will come under the farm modernisation scheme.  In the present year payments under that scheme are expected to reach about £3.35 million.  Considering <Col N="2055" /> the slow start to that scheme, this represents a satisfactory achievement. The saving on the original provision for the scheme is offset by the extra expenditure under the farm buildings and water supplies schemes.</P>
    <P>The number of applications to participate in the farm modernisation scheme has shown an encouraging upward trend recently.  This reflects the growing confidence of farmers in the future of the industry and their willingness to undertake the investment necessary to expand production and improve efficiency.  It also, I believe, shows a growing recognition among farmers that the financial incentives available under the scheme are very favourable and that the scheme itself is valuable particularly in the emphasis it places on planned development.</P>
    <P>Although the scheme of grants for slurry disposal ended on 1st February, 1974, a large number of claims remained to be processed at that date and a sum of £15,000 was provided in the main Estimate to meet claims coming for payment.  The additional £30,000 now sought will suffice to clear the back-log of outstanding claims.</P>
    <P>On the horticultural side the Supplementary Estimate provides sums of £120,000 for the subsidy on heating oil for horticulture and £50,000 for additional aids to horticulture, including assistance to producer groups.  The extension of the heating oil subsidy was announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech on 15th January and the additional amount provided is to meet expenditure for the period January to June, 1975.  The £50,000 for the horticultural aids scheme is to meet outstanding claims under this scheme which has now been superseded by the farm modernisation scheme.  Because of an estimated saving of £150,000 on grants for glass-house nurseries and mushroom units, the net additional amount required for horticulture is £20,000.</P>
    <P>Turning to cattle, the expenditure provided for the EEC slaughter premiums scheme represents our national contribution to the scheme.  Part of the supplementary provision arises <Col N="2056" /> from the carry over of expenditure incurred in 1974.  At the time the Estimate was framed the scheme was due to end by March, 1975, but was renewed for the period up to the end of February, 1976.  In all about 600,000 animals will have qualified for premiums in 1975.  No national contribution has been payable under the scheme since mid-March, 1975.</P>
    <P>The special premium on exports of beef to the UK relates to an arrangement with the United Kingdom whereby beef from animals qualifying for the slaughter premium here which is exported to that country qualifies for the variable premium there.  Full recoupment is made by the United Kingdom Government and is provided for under Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to provide £45,000 in addition to the sum of £400,000 already voted to meet the cost of premiums payable under the EEC dairy herds conversion scheme in 1975.  Fifty per cent of the expenditure under this scheme in any year is recoverable from the EEC in the following year.  We had expected to spend £400,000 in 1974 and recover £200,000 this year.  In fact, we spent only £300,000 in 1974 and recovered £150,000 this year leaving a shortfall of £50,000 in receipts.</P>
    <P>The total sum voted for the bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication schemes including the voluntary pre-intensive brucellosis scheme in 1975 was £14.3 million.  Receipts from sales of reactors were estimated at £3.2 million, giving an expected net expenditure of £11.1 million.</P>
    <P>Gross expenditure for the year which is comprised mainly of compensation to farmers for reactors removed and fees paid to veterinary surgeons for testing and sampling will be approximately £15.3 million or an increase of about £1 million on the original provision.  This increase will be more than offset by higher receipts from sales of reactors to meat factories, which will be about £4.76 million. The net position, therefore, is that there will be a saving of about £0.56 million on the amounts originally provided for these schemes for 1975.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2057" /> The £2.2 million being provided for cattle feed vouchers represents the advance to the meat industry announced by the Minister for Finance in the January budget to supplement the fund set up by that industry to issue vouchers to small farmers for the purchase of feed for young cattle at a reduced price last winter.  The advance is being recovered from the industry by withdrawing temporarily a VAT credit payable to meat factories and other registered cattle purchasers.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £4 million is being sought for the less favoured areas scheme bringing the total to £10 million.  With the switch by farmers to that scheme, a saving of £4.8 million is envisaged under the beef cattle and sheep headage payments schemes.  A sum of £100,000 arises in respect of payments under the export guarantee scheme on exports of mutton and lamb to Britain.  Under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement this amount will be refunded by the UK Government in 1976.</P>
    <P>The provision for 1975 for lime transport and fertiliser subsidy is £6,340,000 and it is expected that there will be a saving of about £1.9 million on this provision.  This is mainly due to farmer resistance to the purchase of fertilisers at present high prices. In 1973-74 farmers spent £54 million on fertilisers and in 1974-75 they spent £67 million.  In 1974-75 usage had been on a level with that of the previous year farmers would have had to spend £95 million.  This illustrates the impact of price increases since 1973.</P>
    <P>I would again appeal to farmers at least to maintain the fertility status of their soils as there is no prospect in the foreseeable future of any reduction in fertiliser prices.  To cut down on fertiliser imputs now could be false economy leading to a substantial reduction in yields.  The restoration of the fertility status at a later date would be very costly indeed.</P>
    <P>I expect a saving of £230,000 on the subsidised loan scheme for the retention of young cattle.  This scheme was introduced on 8th November, 1974 to help smaller farmers to purchase <Col N="2058" /> winter feed and retain young cattle which would otherwise have to be sold at depressed prices.  A subsidy of 8 per cent per annum was payable on each loan up to 31st October, 1975.  Participation in the scheme was very much below expectations.</P>
    <P>During the year our scheme to provide a socio-economic advisory service for those engaged in agriculture under Directive 161 was agreed with the EEC Commission.  My Department have initiated courses of training in this type of advisory work open to interested members of the agricultural advisory services.  Project work to establish more precisely the requirements of socio-economic advisory work under our conditions is being undertaken.  As the development of the scheme is still at an early stage a saving of £22,000 is anticipated on the Vote provision.</P>
    <P>The scheme under Directive 161 of vocational training for those engaged in farming was launched this autumn and is being operated through the committees of agriculture.  Thirty-five courses are being run by committees at local centres during the present winter and as the scheme develops a wider range of courses at basic and more advanced levels will become available.  To complement the efforts of the committees, my Department recently opened a new training centre in Athenry.  A ten-week course in general agriculture for young farmers sent forward by the committees is already in progress at this new centre. As the operations under this scheme are also at the initial stage, I expect a saving of £60,000 on the sum provided in the Vote.</P>
    <P>A sum of £300,000 in addition to the sum of £2,400,000 already provided in the main Estimate is required to meet the cost to county committees of agriculture of implementing the provisions of the national wage agreement and of paying a salary award to advisers employed by the committees emanating from conciliation and arbitration proceedings.</P>
    <P>The extra provision of £240,000 in respect of the non-capital grant to An Foras Talúntais is to meet the cost of salary and wage increases for the <Col N="2059" /> staff of the institute which became effective under the national wage agreement during the year.  This extra provision brings the total non-capital grant to the institute for 1975 to £4.74 million, a substantial contribution to agricultural research and development.</P>
    <P>Incidental expenses of market intervention are expected to cost a net £3 million more than originally provided; of the extra gross expenditure of £15 million, £12 million is estimated to be recouped from the EEC this year.</P>
    <P>Since the main Estimate was prepared, market intervention in skimmed milk powder has been introduced and the level of activity in beef intervention has proved to be higher than anticipated with the result that the provision for incidental expenses arising out of intervention is inadequate.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, in April, 1975, I felt it necessary to introduce a quota system for factories whereby they could not sell to intervention more than 50 per cent of their weekly kill of eligible animals.  I consider that this step was in the best interests of the factories themselves as a stimulus to commercial disposals and also in the best interest of the intervention system itself as a means of avoiding overtaxing the freezing and storage facilities available to us.</P>
    <P>Intervention expenses include the cost of such items as storage, transport and handling charges as well as interest on the capital used for the purchase of the products.  Such intervention activities are carried out on behalf of the EEC and payments in respect of expenses incurred are received from FEOGA in accordance with a scale of allowances based on average costs throughout the Community. The difference between expenditure and recoupment as now estimated is partly due to our relatively high interest charges.</P>
    <P>I have now covered the main items in the Supplementary Estimate which I commend to the House for approval.</P>

      <P>The end of a year is an appropriate time to review the <Col N="2060" /> agricultural position.  After a year such as 1975 when we had a good harvest and livestock prices were relatively high, one would have expected we would be reporting one of the best years on record for agriculture. However, that is not so and if the Minister had listened to the advice from this side of the House we would now be reviewing with a greater degree of satisfaction the progress in agriculture because there is a lot of indecision and frustration at present. There is the high rate of cow slaughterings.  There is mention even in today's <i>Irish Times</i> of a drop of 590,000.  Coupled with that high rate of slaughterings, there is the cattle decline.  Milk suppliers do not even now know where they stand regarding the skim milk powder mountain. There is mention here also of the farm modernisation scheme, the disadvantaged areas scheme, the drop in the usage of fertilisers, and the falloff in the production of potatoes and vegetables.  I note that the Minister said in his brief that the grants under the old farm project, farm buildings scheme and water supplies scheme would terminate on 30th September, 1976.  I would ask the Minister and his Department to notify applicants well in advance&mdash;especially those people involved in the land project and land drainage schemes which take a considerable time&mdash;to have their works completed so that they will not have to be seeking an extension of the time limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome also the additional money allocated for slurry disposal, a matter we had pressed for in this House on a number of occasions.  It is essential that the terms in respect of the farm modernisation scheme be renegotiated. I have up-to-date figures in respect of of my own county, which are favourable compared with other counties in the west.  In a county where there are approximately 7,000 holdings, 5,500 farmers, applications have been received from 1,500 farmers.  They have been processed and there is a total of 99 farmers classed as development farmers in County Monaghan.  This is a ridiculous situation.  It amounts to something in the region of 10 per cent as against 1 per cent or 2 per cent <Col N="2061" /> in the west with, in parts of the east coast, the percentage being as high as 50 per cent at present.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will have to have it revised so that any farmer who works to a plan will qualify for the maximum grant.  I heard of one hardship case last week, of one very progressive farmer who, because he was over 55 years of age, did not qualify for the maximum grant and about which he felt very aggrieved. We in Fianna Fáil have been stressing that there is an urgent need for this. It never was more urgent when one observes the performance of the farm modernisation scheme since its inception and the necessity that farmers be helped in every way possible with the increased costs of machinery and building materials for development.  Farmers with a potential for development will have to be classified, even if there has to be a special classification for those men working to a plan who have no hope, with present income limits, of qualifying under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned briefly the amount of money involved in the cattle feed vouchers scheme, a scheme which is causing grave concern at present.  It was introduced last October in an agreement between the Minister and the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' Association.  Vouchers were checked and distributed by the land project officers.  The Minister for Finance, when introducing the budget in January last year, congratulated the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' Association on the scheme.  He said at that time that it was hoped to recover a subvention of £2.2 million by the temporary withdrawal of VAT.  I shall not detain the House by reading the replies to various parliamentary questions put down to the Minister in October last by a number of Deputies from different constituencies. The Minister mentioned then that the question would probably finish up as a court case.  I wrote again last week to the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' Association, because there are a large number of small millers involved. They would not be classified as millers; they are men who have equipment for binding and rolling, who buy perhaps ten or 20 tons of barley and who, in their spare time, grind, <Col N="2062" /> roll and sell it.  They supplied feed last year on foot of those vouchers.  They are men working in a business in which the remuneration is very small.  Some of them find they are now owed amounts as high as £1,000 on foot of those vouchers.</P>
    <P>Following those parliamentary questions to which I referred, I wrote to the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' Association on 11th December and the reply I received was to the effect that they must agree with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, when he said in the Dáil on 4th November last, that it looked as if this matter must be finally resolved in the court. They reiterated that they were not responsible. The Minister in the Dáil, they said, on 4th November reiterated that he was not responsible and, therefore, they said, no doubt the matter would have to be resolved in court.  That is a very sad situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Department of Agriculture and the responsible body.  The Minister might say he has no legal obligation but I say that if he has not a legal obligation he has a moral obligation to ensure that those small merchants are paid for the goods and services they provided 12 months ago.  Many of them are working on very hefty overdrafts.  We know there was arson, that the excuse earlier in the year was that it had to be investigated, that it was a matter for the Garda.  The Minister should now get together with the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' Association so that money will be provided either by them or his Department, to pay those small merchants.</P>
    <P>I mentioned previously cow slaughterings and the newspaper report in that regard today.  We have also indecision regarding the future of milk production because of this mountain of skim milk powder.  The Press states also that it will be used as a protein meal in compounds, that there are reservations in different quarters that it will not be suitable because it will be a very expensive protein compared with the soya bean, that the skim milk powder contains, on average, a protein content of 33 per cent.  We ask the Minister to make a statement on the future of milk production <Col N="2063" /> now that this skim milk problem has occurred.  We ask also that the benefits of intervention be passed back to the calf and store producers. I should like to mention also the counties designated by the decision of the Council of Ministers of the EEC, when small areas only were classified as disadvantaged under the headage payments scheme.  If the Minister could extend this scheme to embrace more marginal counties that would be a great incentive to cattle producers. In my county we have only seven electoral divisions.  The Minister said we were a milk producing county but we have only 9 per cent development farmers and that indicates there is need for aid.</P>
    <P>There is a drop in fertiliser usage to the tune of 40 per cent.  Some aid is required here.  Nitrogen was applied this year without any phosphate and potash.  This is a short-term economy because the land will suffer eventually and so will the economy.  A great deal of the blame for the increased price of fertilisers must be placed on the Department of Industry and Commerce. In 1973 we begged the Minister not to withdraw the controls but he did not listen to us and, since the controls were withdrawn, prices have spiralled and usage has fallen.</P>
    <P>A potato marketing board were set up primarily for the exportation of seed and ware potatoes.  They had no function where the home market was concerned.  In reply to a parliamentary question addressed to the Taoiseach last February we were told that £30 million worth of fruit and vegetables were imported.  We should be able to grow our own fruit and vegetables. These are labour intensive crops and many of the unemployed could find employment if this were done.  The less potatoes we export from now on the better it will be because we will ensure seed is available for planting. I would appeal to the Minister to look into this matter very quickly and set up a board for the home market.</P>
    <P>I understand that under the EEC regulations there is permission to pay an additional 10 per cent towards <Col N="2064" /> drainage in classified designated areas. This would be very worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with this Supplementary Estimate and I support the comments made particularly with regard to intervention.  The Minister was criticised very unfairly about this.  I think we should put more effort into selling.  This is a lesson we have not really learned from the EEC. We are still confusing intervention with the market place.  Intervention was never meant to be anything else except an aid and it should not be looked on as anything else.  Perhaps it could be pushed a little further. The Minister should insist on our getting out and selling because this is an area in which we will have to develop, and very quickly.  We produce top quality but we do not seem to be able to sell it.  There is too much diversification.  There should be centralised marketing and none of the existing duplication that there is.  If what I suggest were done there could be a greater concentration on commodities in short supply.  That would be the logical procedure but it is a procedure we do not seem to have cottoned on to.</P>
      <P>There is a serious falling off in the use of fertilisers.  In this regard I would like to see more soil testing carried out because I gathered some rather useful statistics in my own case where I had over-applied potash in particular.  There is such a thing as wasteful application.  There is very little the Minister can do about the high price.  If we want the stuff we must pay for it.  We could have more soil testing done with advantage. These fertilisers last a long time in the ground.  There is room for economy. We can ill-afford wastage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2065" /> I am delighted the subsidy is continuing. It may look small compared with the £100 a ton on compound but it is a very valuable subsidy and I am sure the amount left over from last year will be more than absorbed because I am convinced confidence in farming is back.  One has only to look at the way conacre prices are going to realise there is confidence.  There is good reason to be confident.  We may have temporary problems like the skim milk mountain and that might not exist if we did more at the cheese end. I am not unduly scared.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more emphasis on tillage and being self-supporting. One item not receiving enough attention is the whole area of malt barley and malt barley prices.  This is a very important industry.  The Department have evolved new varieties which are very successful from the malster's point of view but not from the producer's point of view.  Now that the price is linked with that of feeding barley the growing of this barley may not be so attractive.  I should like to see an effort made to compel those who use this gilt-edged product, this very sophisticated commodity, to pay the proper price for it.  A great deal of effort goes into it and I see no reason why these people should not be made pay.</P>
    <P>I am glad the courses for young farmers are continuing.  These should be developed and made full-time courses in our vocational schools.  There is every reason, especially in the light of the present employment situation, for people to take up work on farms.  Farmers are prepared to pay them well but they need good men who are capable of using the very expensive and sophisticated equipment that is used on farms nowadays and who are able, too, to care for valuable dairy herds. I am not keen on the idea of night classes or the ten-week course in this type of work.  We need people who have completed a full-time three- or four-year course and have obtained their diplomas or whatever qualification is appropriate.</P>
    <P>As a producer I am often shocked to notice how mutilated produce can be by the time it goes on sale in the <Col N="2066" /> shops.  This results from bad handling. Such gimmicks as the packaging of potatoes in plastic bags only adds to the cost.  Every effort should be made to have fresh produce available in all cities and towns.  This should not prove very difficult since all our urban areas are not far removed from the land. Townspeople should be encouraged to buy potatoes, for instance, in hundredweights rather than in small packages. This would help to reduce the cost.  In this regard the North Dublin Co-op are doing a very good job.  Where possible people should buy fresh food rather than food that is processed.</P>
    <P>On the question of processed food, this is an area of marketing that could be developed further from the export point of view.  Europe provides us with a great market but we do not seem to be breaking in on it to any great extent and to make matters worse there is much gimmickry advertising to encourage people to buy foreign produce.  Too often, too, one sees Danish Blue cheese displayed much more prominently in shops and supermarkets than is the Irish product although everyone knows that the Irish Blue is far superior to the Danish product.</P>
    <P>The Government should encourage the processing of home produce for export.  To this extent more money should be made available to the processing plants to enable them to shorten the time of processing.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his performance in the Department.  He is doing a good job for us not only at home but in Europe.  Last year the farmers had some problems regarding cattle prices and so on but faith in this industry has been restored.  Prices are at an all time high and the dairy herds are increasing.  There is no reason for pessimism.  One last word &mdash;I appeal to farmers generally to use fertilisers wisely.  There is no reason why 1976 should not be even a better year for agriculture than this year has been.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to protest strongly regarding the allocation of time for this very important Supplementary Estimate.  Since I came <Col N="2067" /> here this is the first time that there has been any opportunity for debate on it: on the other occasions it was merely passed.  In the hour available today it is impossible to go into any detail in relation to the industry. Therefore, in the few minutes at my disposal, I shall make a few points that I consider need to be raised, but first let me say that I endorse what has been said so far by the other speakers in relation to drainage, disadvantaged areas and so on.</P>
      <P>One of the points I would raise concerns the use of fertilisers.  Because of the huge increase&mdash;I think the Minister mentioned a figure of 100 per cent&mdash;in the cost of fertilisers, farmers could not afford to fertilisers their land this year.  The Minister referred, too, to the question of slurry disposal.  I consider it to be of the utmost importance that slurry disposal equipment be subsidised.  This is a valuable form of fertiliser but it must be removed on a couple of occasions during the year.  Very few people have the very expensive machinery necessary for its disposal.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning there is a heading which reads: &ldquo;Clinton forecasts secure future for Irish farmers&rdquo;.  On the same page Dr. Conway of the Agricultural Institute is reported as saying that in order for a farm to be viable at present it would need to be of 100 acres but that within a couple of years this figure would have increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know what type of farmers are secure.  I come from an area where there are very few farmers who have 40 cows producing milk but now we get a recommendation from Europe&mdash;I am glad that the Minister is fighting this&mdash;to farmers to get out of milk during the next five years.  So far as I can see there is no future for the smaller farmer in the context of Europe.  However, we must be determined not to let this happen. I am disgusted each time I read of the inefficiency of some of those in Brussels.  Not so long ago we were bribed to get out of milk production. Now there is this recommendation despite the fact that we walked the roads of Galway and other parts of <Col N="2068" /> the west asking people to go into milk production.  It is a recommendation from people who know nothing about the life of the small farmers but we will not take this dictation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would advise the small farmer not to get out of milk because it is his only hope of survival. Previously when there was overproduction it was cut at the top but now it is being cut at the bottom of the scale.  We are not going to take this lying down.  The only hope for the small farmer who wishes to qualify under Directive 159 is to stay in milk. Now we are told we are being paid to get out of milk.</P>
      <P>When we raised the question of fertilisers we were told they could not be subsidised under EEC rules.  My organisation have asked for a cheap loan.  We want a loan of up to £2,000, to be repaid over five years.  This would help the small farmer.  The loan should carry a small interest rate because it is vital that we encourage farmers to use fertilisers on their land. Surely this cannot be shot down on the grounds that it will interfere with the famous EEC regulations?</P>
      <P>I agree that people had a fair degree of confidence up to some time ago but what will happen now to those who have tried to build up their milk herds?  The Minister is well aware of of what happened to poultry.  A few factory farms are operating in that area now.  A few years ago we pleaded that people who had sows should be subsidised, at a time when pregnant sows were being slaughtered in the factories.  Is it the policy now to drive the milk industry into a few factory farms?  What is left for the small farmer?  For those who will not qualify under Directive 159 we should have a national scheme subsidised by the people at home; this should be payable to anyone who works according to a farm plan so that he will get the same grant as the people qualifying under the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned on many occasions that we should have a balancing fund so that the situation that arose in 1974 with regard to cattle and the <Col N="2069" /> previous situation with regard to pigs will not recur.  If the fund that I suggested is not adopted by Brussels it should be done at national level.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to tillage and the raised the question why people get out of it.  I was engaged in tillage all my life and I was laughed at because it was not paying. It would have made all the difference if I had had got some incentive to stay in tillage.  I discussed this matter with the Minister and I thought they were doing something about it but apparently nothing has been done. There should be a survey of consumption as well as production.  Two years ago I was speaking to a man who thought he knew everything about milk powder and he said there could never be a surplus but we are all aware of what happened in the meantime. A person is entitled to ask if there is any forecasting being carried out in the Community.</P>
    <P>I wish to protest very strongly at the fact that this important Estimate is being discussed in such a short time.  Anyone who knows anything about the basics of agriculture could spend at least one hour discussing the Estimate.  That would be good for the country and the inefficient set-up in Brussels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the previous speaker in condemning the short duration allowed for this important debate.  Having to confine oneself to a few minutes on this debate makes the task impossible because one does not know what point to pick out and discuss.  However, perhaps at a later date we will have a full debate on agriculture.</P>
      <P>One of the most alarming matters at the moment is the decrease in the national herd.  When Fianna Fáil left office the herd stood at seven million but now I understand it is reduced to about five million.  This is a dangerous trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is two million wrong.  It is still seven million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be seven million when one considers all the cows that have been slaughtered in the last few weeks and the Minister <Col N="2070" /> admitted this fact recently in Brussels. I hope the Minister will ensure that this is corrected in the near future because it is of great importance to us.  The soil is our greatest wealth and it is imperative that we exploit it fully.  In order to create employment in agriculture, so far as possible cattle should not be exported live. They should be processed at home and this would create employment.  A recent &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme illustrated this fact and people who knew what they were talking about agreed that it was important to create as much employment as possible.</P>
      <P>I should like to join with the previous speaker in encouraging tillage. One of the more disappointing facets of our agricultural programme in the last few years has been the decline in the acreage devoted to cereals.  We have had to import about 500,000 tons of cereals annually and this highlights the need to increase our grain production. The fall in wheat acreage has been particularly dramatic.  After the bad harvest year in 1974 we had to import milling wheat to the value of £14 million.  With better management and fertiliser usage this import bill could be eliminated while still maintaining, or even increasing, our livestock numbers.  Every assistance, both financial and technical, must be given to farmers to encourage them to achieve this.</P>
      <P>At present the high cost of machinery, fertilisers and chemicals, coupled with the restrictions on merchant credit, have made cereals less attractive to all but the larger farmer. Before our entry into the EEC and during our first year of membership most farmers were led to believe that there was no future in grain growing even though we can produce better crops than most other Europeans. Hearing this advice many farmers switched from grain to livestock breeding only to find cattle prices falling and grain prices rising.  We should have learned from this experience that we must keep a balance in our enterprises and encourage grain growing to guard against another period of tight supplies and rising prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2071" /> Special consideration must be given to enable farmers to store grain for their animal feed requirements.  It does not make economic sense for farmers to sell their barley at harvest time only to have to buy it some months later at a greatly increased price.  New storage methods now allow grain to be held at relatively low cost and special grants should be given to encourage farmers to avail of these methods.  This would be a worthwhile exercise.</P>
    <P>One of the schemes that has caused considerable controversy since it was introduced here is the farm modernisation scheme.  In administering Directive 159 the EEC have lost sight of the primary object of the CAP which is to increase the incomes of farmers while ensuring reasonable consumer prices.  A pre-occupation with structural reforms, based on the Mansholt Plan, has diverted aid and attention from the producer who wants to modernise and it has stifled confidence and investment.</P>
    <P>While Fianna Fáil recognise and support the economic contribution of large scale farm enterprises we are pledged to maintain the maximum possible number of family farms.  The farm modernisation programme should be more positively directed towards the development of family farms.  With personal responsibility family farms are more likely to adopt economic change and new production methods.  The present criteria for allocating modernisation aids are unduly restricted and inflexible. As it exists the farm modernisation scheme will not ensure the viability of a high proportion of our family farms.  The qualifying incomes should be based on regional statistics and should take into consideration the headage payments and other aids for disadvantaged areas.  I believe this would increase the number and type of eligible farms in the developing category.  I hope that in the disadvantaged areas scheme the Minister will take note of the cries from the farmers along the western seaboard to have this area included in the scheme next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of the payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is needed in order to provide additional funds for some of the services operated by my Department and arising from commitments and circumstances which could not have been foreseen when the Estimates were prepared originally.  I shall refer briefly to these services in my statement following.</P>
      <P>The sum of £180,000 provided for under the subhead for Salaries, Wages and Allowances is required mainly to meet the additional cost of the 16th round under the national wage agreement. The extent of that commitment was not known when the Estimates were originally framed and, consequently, must now be provided for.</P>
      <P>The additional £75,000 sought under Travelling and Subsistence arises principally from the increased travelling that was necessary, during the year, in connection with EEC business, including the period of Ireland's presidency of the council; it also reflects extra travel costs by staff engaged on price control duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extra provision of £100,000 is necessary to meet increased costs of <Col N="2073" /> administration arising from the commitments of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards under national wage rounds.  These extra administration costs are being partly met by the lower than anticipated expenditure this year on the institute's building programme, leaving the net additional sum to be provided at £100,000.</P>
    <P>This year's Estimates provided £2,950,000 towards the grant-in-aid for Córas Tráchtála, who now require an additional £150,000.  Despite enormous difficulties and notwithstanding the recessionary trend in world markets total exports for 1975 are expected to reach a level of £1,400 million, representing an increase of approximately 25 per cent over 1974 in value terms and a positive growth rate in volume terms.</P>
    <P>However, we should not lose sight of the fact that our record of export expansion this year has been due in no small measure to the buoyancy of agricultural exports.  Not surprisingly industrial exports have suffered most in the current difficult economic climate and these, though up in value terms, are expected to show an overall drop in volume terms over the whole of 1975.  Certain categories of industrial exports, for example, chemicals, are performing well even in volume terms and it is certainly possible that overall Irish industrial exports will show a smaller drop in volume than elsewhere in OECD.</P>
    <P>This not too discouraging position is a reflection of the determination and initiative of Irish industrial exporters but it has not been effected without pressure on the financial resources of Córas Tráchtála who are providing a valuable service to exporters. Conscious of the limitation on the availability of public funds, particularly in present circumstances, Córas Tráchtála have achieved savings in many areas as against their forecast requirements but nevertheless the £150,000 now sought represents the minimum they require to enable them to provide an effective service to exporters in 1975.</P>
    <P>The additional funds are required partly to meet the further salary costs <Col N="2074" /> arising from the national wage agreement and also to supplement the cost of implementing an intensified programme of market diversification, and further initiatives to assist exporters including an improvement of CTT's current grant schemes.  By these means it is hoped that exporters will be encouraged to make even greater efforts in the future and thus minimise to Ireland's advantage the worst effects of the present world recession.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Deputies will agree that there should be no slackening of our efforts to provide this necessary assistance and encouragement to our exporters particularly at this time of extreme economic difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for the current financial period provided £300,000 towards the grant-in-aid for Kilkenny Design Workshops Limited, who now require an additional £30,000.  This additional sum is needed to cover increased wage costs the impact of which could not have been fully assessed when the original Estimate was framed and if not provided would entail a reduction in the workshops staff with a consequential detrimental effect on the services provided to Irish industry.  I am confident that Deputies will agree that Kilkenny Design Workshop's important contribution to industry should not be so jeopardised.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Government purchased Admore Studios in 1973 with the object of using them as the base on which an Irish film industry could be built.  If the facilities there had disappeared it would have been very difficult, if not impossible, ever to establish a substantial film industry in this country.</P>
    <P>The studios were managed for the Government by RTE on a caretaker basis until July of this year when the new State sponsored company, National Film Studios of Ireland Limited, was established to run the studios.  I appointed a board of directors who have, I believe, the knowledge of the film business and the expertise to run the studios successfully. The new company will provide <Col N="2075" /> the most modern facilities for film production and provide training opportunities for Irish film workers.</P>
    <P>To ensure the success of the Government's investment in Ardmore, the board of the company have been actively seeking opportunities for making feature films here.  They are in an advanced stage of negotiations to make two feature films in Ardmore in 1976 and are negotiating for a number of other feature films and television films which would also be made at the studio during the next year.  In addition the company have made proposals for the introduction of measures which would ensure a continuity of film making activity at the studios.</P>
    <P>The £50,000 voted in subhead S for the administration of Ardmore Studios in 1975 has been exhausted. £50,000 was also voted in subhead T for the Film Board to cover administration expenses, grants and other financial assistance for film making in 1975.  As the Film Board have not yet been established and will not therefore be functioning this year the saving on subhead T will assist in the provision of extra funds to the amount of £50,000 for the new State-sponsored company.  The moneys will be used towards the cost of providing improved facilities to film makers and the cost of having essential repairs to the studios carried out.</P>
    <P>The new company, National Film Studios of Ireland Limited, were not set up under statute.  However, I propose to introduce, early in 1976, a comprehensive Bill which will give statutory backing to this company and will also provide the basis for the general development of the Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>The bread and flour subsidy schemes which were announced by the Minister for Finance in his financial statement on 26th June, 1975, were implemented on 28th July and have been operating satisfactorily. A subsidy is being paid on bread which is controlled in price at the rate of 5½p per 800 gram loaf and the subsidy on flour and wheatenmeal for domestic use is at a rate equivalent to 4½p per kilo at retail level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2076" /> The Supplementary Estimate of £6,332,000 passed by the House on 11th July, 1975, included provisions of £5,570,000 and £680,000 in respect of the bread and flour subsidies, respectively. These figures were based on the rates of consumption then prevailing. On the basis of actual expenditure so far, it is now estimated that the flour subsidy will cost £900,000, that is, an additional £220,000, in the current financial year.  On the other hand there is an anticipated saving on the bread subsidy scheme which appears as an offset in this estimate.</P>
    <P>The sum of £755,000 is required to meet a shortfall in receipts from fees under the Minerals Development Act, 1940, and the Petroleum and other Minerals Development Act, 1960. These comprise royalties from the base-metal sector and from petroleum rentals and fees.  Royalties from the base metal mines are payable on a 4 per cent to 10 per cent sliding scale of profit.  Profits for royalty purposes for 1974 showed a sharp decrease against the amount estimated for.  This is explained by higher operating costs and the collapse in copper prices in 1974. A further significant feature was that companies took advantage of the provision in the new mining taxation legislation which allowed immediate writing off against profits of development expenditure previously spread over the life of mines or 20 years. The impact of this provision will, of course, be considerably less in future years.  Part of the shortfall is due to anticipated receipts from exclusive off-shore petroleum licences not being realised, to the expected degree, in the current year.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the increased expenditure is £1,560,000 but there is an offset of £1,559,990 in savings made up of £1,500,000 on subhead 12 &mdash;Industrial Development Authority capital expenditure on grants to industry; £50,000 on subhead T&mdash;Film Board&mdash;and £9,990 on subhead W.I.&mdash; Bread Subsidy.  I should mention, however, that the £1.5 million saving on the IDA capital expenditure does not mean any falling-off in the authority's level of activity in providing grants for <Col N="2077" /> industry.  That amount is not being called upon, from their allocation this year so that an equivalent amount may be made available to the National Building Agency Limited, for the purpose of providing industrial housing which is a vital service and a necessary incentive in the authority's drive to secure further industry.  Accordingly, the net amount required is £10.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me, having listened to the Minister's speech on this Supplementary Estimate&mdash;which, incidentally, is the third Supplementary, I think, this year for Industry and Commerce&mdash;that the two most important aspects of it are first, the huge decline in the appropriations-in-aid that were estimated at the beginning of the year as a result of the lack of profit in mining operations and the non-granting of petrol licences during the year which apparently had been anticipated at the end of last year, and secondly, the non-expenditure by the IDA of £1.5 million of industrial grants money provided for them by the Oireachtas and which they did not spend.  One can fairly readily conclude that the IDA did not spend the money because they did not have the opportunity of spending it and that in itself is a commentary on our industrial position at present.</P>
      <P>I am fascinated by the Minister's reference to the fact that although the IDA did not spend the money on grants to industry nonetheless the money is not lost to industry but is being given instead to the NBA to build industrial housing.  Is the Minister aware, I wonder, of the position in regard to industrial housing?  Some years ago the NBA were asked to provide industrial housing at a time when industry was setting up all over the country at a tremendous rate and when there was serious difficulty in bringing in key workers in certain industries because they found it impossible to get suitable accommodation for themselves and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the areas in which industrial housing was first provided by the NBA, about 1971, was in the mid-western <Col N="2078" /> region and the NBA built industrial houses in several parts of that region, particularly in Glasgow Park, Limerick. Today there are 83 houses vacant in Glasgow Park in Limerick, houses built by the NBA as industrial houses. How can the Minister now come along and say that the NBA were given this £1.5 million which the IDA did not spend in order to provide industrial housing when in Limerick and elsewhere the industrial housing already provided is unoccupied?  The NBA cannot dispose of these houses because there are no incoming industrial workers to take them up, and SFADCo, who are acting on their behalf, cannot dispose of them either. Those 83 houses have been vacant for well over 12 months.  There are 900 people on the housing waiting list in Limerick but these industrial houses cannot be touched and must be left there because they were built for the purpose of providing houses for industrial workers.</P>
    <P>SFADCo, who build houses under grants they get under this Vote and under the Transport and Power Vote have many vacant houses at Shannon as is well known.  SFADCo will not tell you that because it does not suit them to say that there are many vacant houses in Shannon town, but they are there.  It seems incredible that the Minister should state that £1.5 million which the IDA could not spend is being devoted to industrial housing when there is a considerable surplus of industrial housing because of the industrial recession.  I suspect that the money is not made available to the NBA for industrial housing but is made available to them for ordinary general housing and was probably voted as such under some supplementary vote for the Department of Local Government. I have had no opportunity to check this because the first I heard of it was the Minister's statement here a few minutes ago and it would be impossible to check it but it seems an extraordinary thing when you have lots of vacant houses for industrial workers that the NBA should spend another £1.5 million building more houses that will remain empty when we have no industrial workers to occupy them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2079" /> To return to the first matter I mentioned, the huge shortfall of over £.75 million in appropriation-in-aid from royalties on mining and petroleum rentals and fees, this is more than 50 per cent of what was estimated and discloses a very serious situation.  I suggest that the principal reason for this very serious situation is that the royalties to which the Minister refers here are tied to what he has described as sliding scale of profits.  I and my Party have been advocating in this House and elsewhere that nowadays the preferable method of collecting royalties on the part of the State is a production royalty rather than a royalty tied to profit.  Our views on this matter have been amply borne out by the enormous shortfall in receipts from these royalties on the part of the State this year.  Production in mining has not dropped significantly, maybe by 5 per cent, nonetheless the income from royalties has dropped by 50 per cent or more.  From what the Minister said, the reason for that seems to be that these companies have not shown a profit this year but there may be a variety of reasons, some bound up with legislation or the general recession. There is no guarantee that these companies will want in future to show any more profit than they need to, or more than they can avoid showing, if their payments to the State are bound up with the amount of profits they show in their accounts.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced the terms for the lease granted to Tara Mines in February this year.  It was facilely suggested that the State's take was a total of 67 per cent.  My immediate reaction to that was: &ldquo;Yes, it is 67 per cent of the profit eventually shown by that company, but if there are no profits the State will get 67 per cent of nothing.&rdquo;  In my opinion, 67 per cent of nothing is no good to the State, the Exchequer or the taxpayer. On the other hand, if the approach to Tara, Bula and other mines and natural resources were tied not to the profits which they will or will not eventually show in their accounts but were a take based on the actual production from the mines, <Col N="2080" /> irrespective of what happened afterward, the State would not be in the position it finds itself in today where the Minister says that there is a shortfall of more than £750,000 because the companies did not make the profits expected or did not make any profit at all.</P>
    <P>This is the best possible vindication of the views I have consistently expressed since last February when I heard the Minister's announcement in relation to Tara.  There might well be no profits in the sense the Minister is talking about because it is not beyond the wit of large international companies so to manage their affairs that the profits they show in any particular country can be negligible.  The Minister must know this from the many examples we had in recent years of the activities of the multi-national oil companies in this country, which Deputy Barrett has frequently gone into in great detail.</P>
    <P>The turnover of these multi-national oil companies here is approaching £400 million a year.  The profits they show, if any, can be measured in terms of a few hundred thousand pounds a year.  If on that turnover they were making only a few hundred thousand pounds profit, they would have closed down long ago, but the profit disclosed to the Exchequer and on which they would be assessable for income tax and corporation profit tax here is so small that they pay virtually nothing.  In fact, in some years some of these companies show a loss but the profits that accrue in other parts of the world in respect of petroleum and other oil products sold here are huge.  We are codding ourselves if we think that these multinationals are here for the purpose of providing petrol and oil products to the Irish people at virtually no profit to themselves.  They are making substantial profits but they make sure that these profits do not appear in their books because they would be liable for tax here while frequently they are not liable for tax in other countries.  We may well have the same situation in relation to mining profits. If our royalty &ldquo;takes&rdquo; to the State are bound up with those profits, they will be very small.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2081" /> Although the Minister referred to the off-shore petroleum licence fees not being realised this year, I do not want to go into this in great detail now.  I only hope that, after a long delay in the issue of these exclusive licences, they will be issued on the 1st January and hopefully considerable fees will accrue to the State and considerable expenditure will be undertaken in this State during 1976 by various companies which will engage in this form of work over the next few years.</P>
    <P>It is only right and reasonable at this juncture that one should sound a note of caution in relation to off-shore gas and oil development.  We have been in a fairly euphoric mood about this for the last few years but we should remind ourselves that 22 major off-shore wells have been drilled since 1970 and only one has produced a commercial find, and that not of great size by world standards, even though it is of great significance to us in our limited demand for natural gas.  No oil in commercial quantities has been found.  While one is very hopeful that the poor exploration experience of the last few years will not be repeated in 1976, 1977 and 1978, nonetheless one cannot guarantee that there will be the kind of success we all wish for.  The geological indications, as conveyed to me, would seem to indicate that the best prospects for hydro-carbon finds of commercial viability over the next few years when this new exploration development comes into effect are not in relation to areas close to our south coast.  The one find which has so far been made was where all the conditions are favourable because the gas field lies very close to the shore&mdash; it is only 25 miles off&mdash;and lies in very shallow water&mdash;about 250 feet. However, the geological indications are that if further finds are to be made the most likely place where they would be made is on the Porcupine Bank, about 100 miles due west of Slyne Head in water the average depth of which is 2,600 feet.  A lot of our people do not realise that at present while it may be possible to explore at that depth it is not possible <Col N="2082" /> to recover any gas or oil for commercial purposes.  Until oil and gas exploration technology makes major forward steps it is not going to be possible, in the foreseeable future, to recover any such gas or oil.</P>
    <P>It has been one of the justifications for the extraordinarily heavy borrowing of this Government, particularly foreign borrowing, that there were huge quantities of oil and gas all around our coasts waiting to be picked up.  They may be right; I hope to goodness they are right for all our sakes, particularly in the light of the extremely heavy borrowing which they have inflicted upon the country. Even if that is so, and even if it is found to be so within the next year or so, the prospects of commercial recovery of any such finds that will benefit us before the late eighties are not good, and the late eighties is a long way off when we are saddled with the millstone that was put around our neck in terms of foreign borrowing over the last two years.</P>
    <P>We are foolish to rely as heavily, as this Government apparently rely, on what might or might not be found in our off-shore areas but which even if it is found probably will not be recoverable commercially for ten years or more.</P>
    <P>Most of the other sums voted in this Supplementary Estimate are mainly in regard to increases in wages and salaries which are less matters of principle than the two I have been talking about.  However, it opens up, if one had the opportunity of doing so, the whole question of prices which come under the Minister, the question of industries and the extraordinary increase in unemployment over the past two years.  Because other Members wish to speak on this Supplementary Estimate and only an hour is allowed for this debate I will not avail of the opportunity to talk about these matters.  However, in relation to our exports it is no harm to draw attention to what the Minister said today which in many ways is different in tone from what he was saying in the House last week, that over all there is a drop in volume terms in our industrial exports this year compared <Col N="2083" /> with last year.  I endeavoured to demonstrate this fact last week and I was told that my statistics were selective. I do not accept that they were and I am glad to see the Minister agreeing with me today.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that our exports are likely to reach a figure of £1,400 million in 1975.  I imagine they will or will go close to that but a huge proportion of those exports relates to live animals, meat and milk products, a great quantity of which is being sold into intervention.  The Minister is also aware that in the latter part of this year there has been a considerable increase in the price of cattle we are exporting, dead or alive, and that all the increase in the value of our exports this year is attributable to cattle, dead or alive, and to milk products to a certain extent.  Manufactured exports have shown a decrease in volume.  All our industrial exports have shown a decrease in volume and certain important categories of our manufactured exports have shown a startling decrease in volume.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce this is an extremely serious development, whether he accepts it as such or not. We cannot say that our export figures this year are satisfactory, that they have increased and so on and that we have no reason to worry about the future.  This year has been a once-off year.  Our ostensibly good figures in terms of money for export this year have been solely attributable to cattle and with more than 500,000 cows and heifers slaughtered already this year, and the figure for the entire year likely to exceed 600,000, we are guaranteeing that that kind of figure cannot be repeated in the future no matter how much the price of cattle or beef might increase in future years.</P>
    <P>The only guaranteed future prosperity for this country in relation to exports lies in a steady increase in the volume of our industrial exports every year.  We have had that for years up to 1973, and, to some extent, in the earlier part of 1974, but now we are <Col N="2084" /> moving in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, many members of the public when they read figures produced by the Central Statistics Office for foreign trade believe that when they see the figure in money terms increasing all is well.  What they fail to take account of is that as between this year and last year unless the increase in money terms is in excess of 20 per cent then there is a reduction in volume and the quantity of manufactured industrial exports is decreasing unless the value increases from year to year by more than 20 per cent each year.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to have had an opportunity to speak about various other aspects of this Supplementary Estimate which covers most aspects of the Department but there are other speakers anxious to contribute.  The industrial scene at present is serious; more serious than it has been within the last 30 or 40 years.  It is made more serious by virtue of the fact that things were very good and kept improving until 1973.  They are now on the way back and the loss of what we had is greater and more serious than not achieving what we never had.</P>
    <P>The most eloquent commentary I can make is that as of last week there were more than 109,000 unemployed and that the Government through their spokesman cannot give any guarantee that the number will not be 125,000 or 130,000 next spring.  The failure to provide work for those people and to keep going our industrial drive at the rate at which it was maintained in the 15 years up to 1973 is the one factor above all which will do enormous damage to the country and to which this Government should devote all their energies from the point of view of counteracting these tendencies in the interests of the future properity of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The undisputed importance of the Department of Industry and Commerce in the present economic crisis is one of the reasons why we are anxious to avail of every opportunity to speak on matters concerning that Department directly related to the problems we face.  At the <Col N="2085" /> risk of being accused of repeating what I said here earlier in the week, I am asking the Minister if he has any plans to improve the prospects for industrial development.  I agree with the CII that manufacturing industry is the base from which we must in the main find new jobs.  All economies must have a base and exports, as far as we are concerned, are of paramount importance to economic expansion.</P>
      <P>The Minister must agree that not everything, or perhaps anything, is being done to co-ordinate the forces necessary to create a better industrial climate in order that we may resume expansion at a later stage.  It is frightening at a time when many of the clouds have been clearing from the international horizon that we are not in a position to take advantage of a developing situation.  Import costs are falling, yet the Irish £ is losing its value on the foreign market.  There are changing situations which should be a tremendous help to the competitiveness of our exports, yet in this developing improved international climate we find ourselves receding rather than improving our capacity or in any way concerning ourselves to take advantage of the period of expansion.</P>
      <P>I do not see any hope.  I am amazed that the reduction in imports which in the ordinary course would be a tremendous sign of improved conditions is accepted by all as the opposite, as a sign of stagnation, of our living from the shelf&mdash;out of stocks.  It is a sign that we are afraid to venture into development, even continuing at the rate we have been going at, not alone to talk of creating expansion.  I suggest that lack of imports of essential equipment is one of the things that has added to our trouble.  It has been necessary to import capital equipment and this has been known to be of tremendous importance in plans for further development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CII point out in a recent statement&mdash;I am not in a position to contradict the figure&mdash;that it takes £400 million to create 20,000 new jobs.  The Taoiseach pointed out that the work force should rise annually by 30,000. <Col N="2086" /> He has said that 18,000 have left manufacturing industry in the past. In that context one thinks of the £400 million necessary to create 20,000 new jobs at a time when industry has not sufficient liquidity to maintain past production capacity, and this necessarily disturbs the minds of everybody interested in development.</P>
    <P>As I have said, manufacturing industry is of vital importance if we are to get out of the <i>malaise</i> into which we have sunk.  Can there be any better hope given?  Can we release productive development from the shackles with which we have been binding it in the past two-and-a-half years?  Manufacturing industry has been accepted as the creator of employment and I think it is roughly correct to say that for every person employed in that industry there is one person employed in spin-off industries. Therefore, the whole structure of development must be put in jeopardy if the manufacturing industry is not maintained and developed. In other words, we are in jeopardy when we should be on the mark, ready to sprint forward.</P>
    <P>Most countries have handled their inflationary problems by recognising from the beginning the difficulties which could be controlled domestically and tackling them.  We refused to accept that there were any problems at a domestic level which we should tackle, and the result is that now when the situation has reached crisis proportions we begin to talk about doing something but all we have been able to do is to appeal to people who would be justified in seeking further increases in incomes to refrain from asking for them.  If this nation is to survive it behoves everybody, particularly those in this House, and all those who have a stake in the country to co-operate, because no matter who will be in Government in the future any permanent damage done now will create problems for them.  Therefore, it is imperative that everybody does what he can.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what else the Government intend doing to create a climate more conductive to expansion <Col N="2087" /> of industrial development here.  It is not good enough merely to say the Industrial Development Authority are there with monetary incentives.  There are 101 other things that are important. One of those is the necessity for a plan or programme, which cannot be stressed sufficiently.  It is not good enough to say that Fianna Fáil had programmes and that the targets set were not attained; in some cases the targets were surpassed.  The important thing is to have a plan and programme and know where one is going.  At least that would map out the course we hope to travel and, in that way, would constitute a guide to everybody&mdash;those in charge of credit, those in control of trade unions and, particularly, potential investors. There should be no hit and miss element in our economy at this stage.</P>
    <P>We are now entering the last quarter of the 20th century.  Surely, with all the technological advancement since the beginning of the century, we should have reached a stage where we would have more orderly development of our economic affairs. When one sees the many things reacting against the creation of a better climate, one wonders and one must be seriously perturbed.  I am not saying this for the purpose of agitation or of scoring political points; the facts are there for everyone to see and the position is as bad as it can be.  There is little hope at present no matter how one scrutinises anything in relation to the base from which our economy must develop.  Something really radical and serious has to be undertaken and implemented.  A <i>laissez-faire</i> outlook, attitude or policy will not accomplish anything. Somebody has to tackle the problem seriously and brush aside any of the disincentives to development because, if we cannot have a source from which wealth is produced, if we are to pursue a private enterprise economy, then we must encourage investment and the profit motive.</P>
    <P>There must be reasonable returns guaranteed to those people who are sufficiently enterprising to continue.  We have had sufficient experience of <Col N="2088" /> nationalisation in this country in fields where private enterprise would not be in a position to operate.  Goodness knows, many of them tend to be nothing more than a social service. Were we to depend on nationalisation to create wealth, we might find ourselves in a peculiar position.  Whether we do or do not, we must spell out what we are in favour of.  Are we to continue to support private enterprise? What is the outlook for the future?  To what extent will we give encouragement to those still prepared to invest? Investment in the economy is the most important thing at this time.  The Government and the Minister are seeking merely to guide destiny but the people who invest are those who create the wealth.  Anybody can redistribute it; that is the easiest part of it.  Let us not start boasting about the redistribution of something we are tending not to produce.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the House will bear with me while I make reference to a matter to which the Minister referred in the House recently and which I would like him to repair to some extent.  I refer to the reference to the contract by NET in Cork and in respect of which there was published in the papers the report that a very serious slander has been perpetrated in relation to the firm involved.  The Minister stated in the House that the firm had employed no qualified engineers.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>The firm have a good record in an area where the present economic position is very difficult.  They tendered for a piece of steelwork...</P>
    <P>I believe it was over £500,000 worth. Therefore the use of the words &ldquo;a piece of steelwork&rdquo; rather simplifies it.</P>
    <P>...which is the core of the Nitrigin Éireann plant in Cork.  It is built into the central part of the plant. The tender was for a kind of work the firm had never previously done.</P>
    <P>I say that is wrong.  The firm have constructed some of the most important steel structures in this country and they employ four qualified engineers of high standing.  The Minister's statement is a slander on those people and on the firm.  I know the Minister is going on <Col N="2089" /> the advice he got.  But certainly it smacks of some ulterior motive when he gets the wrong advice.  He will appreciate that for a firm who have wide commercial contacts to be reported in the newspapers as not having qualified engineers&mdash;an important firm who have, by international standards, fully qualified engineers and a quantities control surveyor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>That is wrong.  There is a large number of people employed here.  At some stage the Minister would need to make a declaration of confidence in Irish workers instead of, in this way, showing his complete disregard for the ability of Irish people to do a job better.  I maintain this firm could do it better than any foreign firm. The Minister should take a more serious interest in this matter.  It is creating a bad picture of himself.  He has done immense damage to the firm concerned.  He should avail of an opportunity to undo the slander perpetrated on the firm and the engineers in question.</P>
    <P>In preparing for this contract, before tendering, this firm actually sent men abroad&mdash;as far as Spain&mdash;on more than one occasion to examine other structures and ensure that, in every way, they would do a job which would be a credit to them and would naturally be the cause of enhancing their prestige and reputation, so that they might get further engineering heavy works in this country.  It is the type of industry that needs to be encouraged.  It is one we should give every opportunity to and it is a matter of having confidence in our own people to do things as well as anybody else and, in some cases, better. It is damnable to realise the little faith we seem to have in our own workers.  When they go abroad they are entrusted with all sorts of work, even at the highest technological level, but at home we are inclined at times to regard them as being in some way inferior.  If Seán Lemass will be remembered for one thing more than another, it will be for the act of faith he made in the people and their ability to work, to create and to contribute to the expansion of the economy.  That is lacking today and we have had a glaring example of it right here in this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in reply to a question on 4th November last stated that, while disposals of cattle in 1975 have been unusually high due to the carry-over of large stocks from 1974 and the removal of cows retained beyond the normal culling stage, the overall cattle supply situation is very sound.  Accordingly, no serious unemployment in Irish meat processing factories is expected in 1976-77; indeed recent grant approvals <Col N="2094" /> by the Industrial Development Authority suggest an increase in employment in the industry in the next few years.</P>

I am putting it to him that Clover Meats killings, particularly in Limerick, and I believe in some of their other factories also, are away down on what was the average and there is a likelihood or a strong possibility of pretty heavy redundancies and, in these circumstances, can he or his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, do anything to prevent that situation arising?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of their examination of the Irish footwear industry, the EEC Commission have come to accept that the industry is faced with exceptional difficulties but that nevertheless the requisite conditions exist in Ireland for the maintenance and development of such an industry.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, certain measures have already been taken, with the Commission's approval, to help the industry.  A surveillance system on imports of footwear was introduced on 12th June, 1975, and on 12th July, 1975 an import duty of 10 per cent was applied to imports of footwear with uppers of leather originating in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Though there is a degree of stability in the footwear industry at the moment, the available statistics indicate that the measures I have mentioned have not as yet resulted in any reduction in the overall level of imports of footwear.</P>
      <P>The EEC Commission have undertaken to consider the mobilisation of all means at their disposal, and in particular those available in the social and regional fields to support the reorganisation of the footwear industry in Ireland.  In this connection I have commissioned a firm of management consultants to draw up a rationalisation plan for the industry which will be submitted to the Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy has in mind measures to restrict imports of the goods mentioned.</P>
      <P>This country's ability to introduce new measures of a restrictive nature is circumscribed by the legal obligations imposed through membership of the European Economic Community. Measures have, however, been taken by the Community, in a number of cases, through the negotiation of voluntary restraint agreements, and in two cases, through the imposition of restraints unilaterally, to control imports of textile and clothing items originating in certain third countries. These restraint measures provide for the establishment for each member state of the Community, including Ireland, of quota ceilings for each of the individual products subject to restraint.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a system of surveillance on imports of certain footwear, textiles and clothing has been in operation for some months and that in the case of footwear with leather uppers originating in the UK the pre-July 1st rate of duty, that is, 10 per cent, has been restored for the period to 31st December, 1975.</P>

I think the Deputy is aware that any outbreak of any kind of trade restriction between the United Kingdom and ourselves would be damaging to both countries.

Since this is a project that would cost of the order of £50 million or more there is what is called a pre-feasibility stage which determines the general parameters which will have to be taken into consideration, whether the basic idea is sound.

      <P>First, I will draw the attention of the IDA to the Deputy's remarks.  Secondly, if the Deputy has evidence of the diverting of factories elsewhere he would be doing both the area and my Department a service if he provided the information to me because it is entirely contrary to policy.  We recognise that these areas have a difficulty of a kind that is obvious to all of us and they are, therefore, entitled to extra effort to compensate for that.  That is the policy of the authority and that is a policy which I uphold.  I said recently that I would not be swayed by Deputies' representations in regard to the location of factories.  I meant that I would not be swayed away from the application of objective criteria.  That does not, of course, diminish the right of Deputies to bring these things to my attention. I shall be happy to listen to them if they do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The newspaper report to which I assume the Deputy is alluding, referred to criticisms that the guaranteed Irish mark was not also a quality mark, setting defined standards for Irish manufacturers.</P>
      <P>There are already arrangements under the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961, for laying down standard specifications for different products, and for permitting manufacturers whose goods meet those standards to use the prescribed standard mark.</P>
      <P>It would be a lengthy and complex matter to prescribe standard specifications for every Irish-made product.  The introduction of the &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; mark was therefore decided upon as a quick and effective way of informing consumers that the goods bearing this mark were of Irish manufacture; that the manufacturer was committed to high standards of quality and that every effort would be made to bring about a satisfactory outcome in the case of complaints.</P>
      <P>I might mention that more than 200 companies are already using the new symbol on their products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Department any system whereby, in the case of firms using that symbol there can be a check on the quality of the article?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The carrying out of that scheme is in the hands of the working group which I set up under Mr. Tom Hardiman.  I understand there is scrutiny at the time when the mark is given.  As regards a follow up, this is a new scheme and I am not familiar with the position.  I think the point the Deputy makes is important because it is clear from probing public opinion that the public first want identification, secondly, quality and thirdly, a guarantee that in the event of complaint some notice will be taken.  There is an agreement signed between the working committee and the company before they can use the mark.  I think that for the success of the scheme it is necessary that it be widely supported and the figure of 200 companies is twice the number of companies it was anticipated would be <Col N="2112" /> signed up at this time.  The scheme has been welcomed both by the trade unions and the CII and although there has been criticism it is in very small volume compared with the amount of support.  The condition of success is to have sufficient numbers participating for exclusion from the scheme on the basis of unsatisfactory performance to be a serious penalty. That means that if it is to succeed, whatever the criticisms may have been in the past we should welcome it and try to make it work.  Only when it is widely supported will being shut out from the use of that guaranteed Irish mark constitute a penalty.  I understand the promoters believe that position can be reached fairly quickly.</P>

I understand that these increases were necessary to compensate compounders for increased costs incurred by them.  I might add that the prices charged for animal feedstuffs are constantly kept under the closest scrutiny by my Department to ensure that no unwarranted price increases are applied and I do not see any need at present for any other action on my part.</P>

Barley increased by £1.01 per ton; wheat by £6.50 per ton and maize by £2.57.  The overall increase in ingredient costs also increased the borrowing costs of firms who must have bridging finance.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Control of the prices of alcoholic spirits is exercised at different levels.  At retail level, drink <Col N="2116" /> prices are controlled by maximum prices orders in 17 areas throughout the country.  Manufacturers may not increase their prices without giving two months' notice in advance to the Minister.  Importers and wholesalers of alcoholic spirits whose annual turnover exceeds £250,000 proposing to increase their cash margins on any products are required to give similar period of notice.  Proposals for increases in prices are considered by the National Prices Commission who make recommendations to the Minister.  Increases in prices or margins would normally be allowed only on foot of vouched unavoidable cost increases incurred by the applicants.  I have been informed that it is not correct that popular brands of whiskey are now being processed by patent still, and that furthermore there is no standard brand of Irish whiskey being sold by the distillers at 50 per cent more than the price of popular brands.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make regulations regarding the advertisement <Col N="2120" /> of life insurance policies; and if he will ensure that any person investing in such a policy which claims to pay a dividend will not incur a serious loss due to inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have received hardly any representations about advertising of insurance policies and it is not my intention at present to make regulations such as the Deputy suggests.  I do not think there is any known way in which it can be ensured that people taking out life assurance policies will never incur a loss due to inflation.</P>

      <P>What about indexation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It came to my attention recently that a person who had a life assurance policy, allegedly earning bonuses every year, got a notice saying that his bonus this year was so much.  When he went to surrender that policy, he was offered approximately the same amount which he invested, even though he had been investing over the last 25 years and the buying power of £1 25 years ago and £1 today differ widely.  Surely there should be some protection for people taking out life assurance policies when they are young.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that these policies are funded by the investments made by the companies.  If the companies are working in a falling equity market and their investments are worth less, they are in some difficulty.  It is not a matter which the Government could step into with a view to ensuring that the value was indexed.  This is a matter for the companies themselves and for the consumer to make the best deal he can with the company that can offer the best terms and has the best policy in relation to the investment of its portfolio.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware that a young man starting out in life may take out a life assurance policy to protect his wife against the mortgage and so on he raises on his house.  The companies are making a profit on that <Col N="2121" /> money over all those years, yet when the young man tries to surrender the policy he finds he is at a loss.  Surely the State should protect him?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the action he intends taking with regard to uncontrolled roadside trading and with regard to traders who rent halls or other large premises for a few days before moving to another area, in view of the fact that such people are promoting the sale of foreign manufacture, which could mean ultimate unemployment for Irish workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Restrictive Practices Commission to carry out a study of the types of trading referred to by the Deputies.  When the result of this is available to me I hope to be in a better position to consider what action should be taken to curb the undesirable effects of such trading.</P>
      <P>In the programme of consumer protection legislation on which I am embarking, any provisions which apply at the point of sale will apply to roadside traders in common with all other retailers.</P>

      <P>This study is being carried out by the Restrictive Practices Commission, a body which is constituted for carrying out studies in relation to fair trading matters.  It has other studies on hand also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not accept that in respect of roadside trading there is ample evidence that the consumer is in need of protection?  There is no need for a special study group to learn that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is one of (a)  having legislation which is fair to all parties because roadside traders have rights just as other traders have and (b)  having legislation which would be enforceable.  It is the latter which causes the biggest problem in relation to roadside traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that roadside traders have a right to sell but what is the position if they sell, for instance, a watch which is known to everybody to be very inferior?  Is there any protection his Department can give to the purchaser?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the roadside trader gives a statement which is manifestly false that is one situation.  If the person buying something thinks it is something that it is not and of his own accord buys it without having any representation being made that is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that although this unfair competition is going on for many years we are now talking about having the matter investigated.  The Parliamentary Secretary is placing emphasis on roadside traders but has not mentioned those who sell in dancehalls and in other accommodation, particularly during the Christmas period.  Such people are causing further unemployment and causing hardship to storekeepers who have to pay high rates and the trade union rate of pay to their staff.  It is wrong that they must suffer this unfair competition but all the Parliamentary Secretary can tell us is that the matter is being investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said last night, I was surprised, and rather disappointed, with the Opposition.  I went to the trouble of reading all the speeches and I noticed that there was an appalling lack of any constructive alternatives put forward by the <Col N="2181" /> Opposition.  I am objective in my criticism and I am equally critical of the Government.  The Opposition could have proposed alternatives to the Government in the present critical state of the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned but I am concerned that the Opposition should be more constructive.  The public will see their contributions as lacking constructive criticism.  A Government is only as good as its Opposition and if there is not an effective co-ordinated Opposition there will be a lax and arrogant Government.  This is an important debate, a review of a year in which we had an unprecedented economic crisis.</P>
      <P>The problems facing the Government are many.  We had a serious crisis when the Arab countries demanded extra money for their oil and this had a devastating effect on our economy.  In a situation like that any Government would have to face the options open to them.  Do they have massive unemployment immediately and not provide for the people in such a situation or do they cushion them against the bad effects of the situation? In the circumstances, the Government chose the right thing, to cushion the people against the adverse effects of this.  However, I do not think they did sufficient.  The problem they were faced with was whether to fight inflation and preserve employment at the same time.  It is very difficult to deal with those problems because if the Government decided to fight inflation and adopt deflationary policies we could have had more unemployment. They had to face an agonising choice.  The Opposition blamed the Government for spending too much, creating the inflation, but I did some work on the questions on the Order Papers and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I should like to point out that for this debate which has been described as an important debate there is no representative of the Government present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>So I have an audience. The main criticism of the Opposition is that the Government are spending too much and, therefore, that they are an inflationary force. Anybody who would take the trouble to do a little research will discover that the Opposition would be big contributors to this expenditure.  For instance, in Private Motions we have called for reliefs in CIE and ESB charges, we have had demands by Deputy Leonard to take VAT off furniture, from Deputies O'Kennedy and Power to build more Garda stations, for more money for coast protection in Donegal, for more water and sewerage schemes.</P>
      <P>All this money must come from Government sources.  We are all guilty in this respect.  I have demanded expenditure on the provision of more employment on public works. Other Deputies have asked for increases in post-primary education grants.  In this way we are not facing up to the problem.  We do not realise that if the Government complied with our demands we would be increasing the expenditure by, in my estimation, £200 million in the current year.  It is easy to rant and rave about the economic crisis.  We can parade depressing facts and figures, and we have a great supply of them, but if one expects to be worthy of being heard above the din, one must couple criticism with some constructive ideas, with areas which deserve investigation.</P>
      <P>I try to be constructive in my proposals. If we were to use the time of the Dáil in more constructive criticism we would be a much more effective legislative body.  If my comments here are considered to be critical, at least I hope they will be looked at as responsible in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2183" /> The OECD Report is alarming.  In a way, it points out the harsh fact that things are bad, that we must try to provide 28,000 extra jobs each year. In these circumstances what alarms me is that there does not seem to be an economic plan.  We seem to be drifting along day by day hoping for the best.  We had had a severe crisis during the war and the Government then failed to formulate a policy for the years following the world catastrophe: they just drifted along and we were, therefore, very slow to catch up with the rest of Europe who in the aftermath moved quickly.</P>
    <P>Unless the Government of today plan today, we will be following the same pattern as our predecessors in the fifties.  The Government may say this is not the time to do it but the Minister for Finance has been planning ahead through his capital taxation legislation.  The revenue from these bills will be negligible, but that to my mind does not nullify the need for them.  This is the time to plan and, therefore, this is the time to have brought them in.  Anything we borrow these days involves large interest plus capital repayments many years ahead. I was disturbed by the statement of the Minister for Finance, reported in Volume 277, column 220 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Of all the tasks which could engage my attention, the least realistic would be the publication of a medium or long-term economic plan based upon irrelevancies in the past, hunches as to the present and clairvoyance as to the future.</P>
    <P>I disagree.  This is a time to plan for the future because otherwise the growth which will inevitably come internationally will pass us by and we will find ourselves lagging behind our colleagues in Europe.</P>
    <P>An interesting aspect of the OECD Report relates to the question of restraint. They say that reflation is needed, with more money for housing and so forth, for the provision of temporary jobs for the unemployed.  This is a hobby horse of mine, in line with recommendations I put to the Government <Col N="2184" /> during the last year for a massive public works programme that would mobilise the unemployed for socially important projects such as schools, other public works, community projects.  This would have a big effect in easing the psychological malaise we have as well as having residual effects.</P>
    <P>We pay over £100 million a year by way of unemployment benefit and the other benefits that accompany it.  That is a wonderful and humane gesture. This unemployment is demoralising. Were we to introduce a programme such as the one I suggest, it would have an uplifting effect on the unemployed. We could mobilise this force, have them working on community projects and give them an interest.  If this leadership were given, it would make a great difference to our people. I feel very strongly about this and the OECD recommend such temporary measures.  Why not, because we would see the results of this work in the community.  The only effort I have seen made at present is a pilot scheme being undertaken in one area.  This engaged in on a massive scale could help our economy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the pay pause.  We have to be realistic here and to give the Opposition their due they have fallen behind him in recommending this.  However, when one speaks about a pay pause, it is important that one elaborates on it and also on the other measures which we hope will be taken if the congress of trade unions responds to the Government's request.  In my mind it would not be good enough to have a profits pause or a freeze on dividends.  The pay pause will mean that the man does not get paid and where dividends and profits are concerned it could mean deferring payment of them so that in a year or two this money would be paid out to shareholders in the normal way.  I submit that would not be an equitable sharing of the sacrifice.  I hope the Government will consider seriously making it clear to those who receive dividends and profits that they must be ploughed back into the company to create more jobs and not merely put in cold storage to be <Col N="2185" /> handed out later.  It is important that we get that understood.  If that were done it would have a dual effect.  It would be seen by workers as a serious attempt by the Government to restrain the other side of industry and would also have the effect of creating more jobs.</P>
    <P>One of our difficulties at present&mdash; and it is important that it be said&mdash; is that, unfortunately, we equate inflation with pay increases.  We speak about products being non-competitive because pay and salaries are too high. I disagree with this contention because in every single country in the EEC the pay rate is higher than that in Ireland.  Also we tend to forget the other aspect of non-competitiveness, if we may call it such.  There is also the question of technology and managerial expertise.  These are matters never referred to by anyone.  I believe that it is not necessarily pay increases which make a product non-competitive. A product can be non-competitive if one does not have the most advanced technology available in its production.  In the same way, if there is not management with expertise, the product will be non-competitive.  It is an aspect of competitiveness of products we should consider seriously. We should give it more attention and not concentrate so much on the question of pay increases.  It has been said over and over again that the worker is responsible for the fact that a product is non-competitive.  I think that is incorrect.</P>
    <P>I realise that a number of industries are experiencing a tough time at present; profits are not being made by many of them.  Our financial institutions have a very important role to play which I do not think they are fulfilling.  I believe that governments have not power, that the real power in this country lies in the hands of those who control the economy, who control the finances of our country and they are the financial institutions, the banks.  We have banks with resources of almost £3,000 million.  They control everything.  Therefore, they hold the power.  They can cripple industry, create recessions, move their money abroad, do anything they like and we are totally dependent on them. <Col N="2186" /> It is debatable whether they live up to their responsibilities in our society. With resources of almost £3,000 million one wonders are they fulfilling their proper role.  Do they contribute sufficiently to the economy, industry and society in general?  I wonder should we not ask them&mdash;with accompanying legislation, if necessary&mdash;to contribute a lot more to the economy. What would be wrong with their lending money to industry at very reduced rates of interest?  Many industries at present cannot borrow money to invest because of the high rates of interest being charged.  It is completely useless to attempt to do so in many cases with profit margins so low.  We should be able to compel our banks to lend money for investment in industry at very nominal interest rates.  In that way we would have a stimulated economy. We would have industries here able with advanced technology to compete in world markets.  As a result, we would have more people employed, more demand for goods and a solution to many of our problems.  The banks have a vital role to play in this.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that to my way of thinking the Government were faced with a problem and they decided to gamble.  I think they were gamblers and I do not mean that in a critical sense.  They were justified in gambling as they did.  Even the most knowledgable experts in the world believed that the recession would be of short duration. Last year there was every indication that the recovery would commence in May, 1975.  Unfortunately, such was not the case.  The Government have incurred borrowings that are really phenomenal. They borrowed in 1975 over £700 million and they are still very short.  The interest to be paid on those Government borrowings will reach, I think, £100 million next year which will be a rise of 50 per cent on the preceding year.  What can they do now? First of all, they can increase taxes, curtail expenditure or work with a combination of both.  Those are the options open to them.  If they increase taxation, it will mean that there will be less spending power, less demand for goods, increased overheads in industry, fewer goods sold, more unemployment, more people receiving social welfare <Col N="2187" /> and, in all, greater demands being made on the Exchequer.  That is what will happen if they increase taxation to any extent.  If they do not do that but rather go for more borrowing, the interest on the borrowings will be such that it will take a very high proportion of the gross national product and that would not be feasible.</P>
    <P>The question then arises as to whether it is possible to spread the load, cast the taxation net a little wider.  With due respect to my rural colleagues, it is easy for me, a city Deputy, to criticise the farming community but I believe there are many of our farmers who could afford to pay more by way of taxation.  We know they had lean years.  So did industry. I think the big farmer of £100 valuation and over could afford to pay more by way of taxation.  There are many farmers with very high incomes who are not paying any tax at all.  Too big a burden falls on the other sector.  This is not an equitable situation.  We talk about everyone sharing the burden.  It is a burden we will all have to share. We will all have to make sacrifices and the farming community will have to be asked to contribute more.  The £100 valuation will barely scratch the surface but the Government must get more by way of taxation from the farming community.  If they do not do this, then the section carrying the burden will no longer be able to carry it.  One must spread the load.  If one does not get tax in, then the Exchequer will not be able to pay out.  One section is being asked to pay too much.  We will have to strike a balance and ask the other section to pay also.</P>
    <P>Looking back on the budget in January of this year, I find it cost the Government £50 million to provide the increases in social welfare benefits. Those increases merely took account of the inflationary trend, which was then 21 to 23 per cent.  All the Exchequer got from taxation on drink, tobacco and other items was £30 million.  If the same increases are applied in the coming budget, all we can expect to get is £30 million Increases in social welfare benefits designed to keep pace with inflation <Col N="2188" /> will cost at least another £50 million.  I am wondering from whence will the extra taxation needed come. It is very difficult to see how the money will be found.</P>
    <P>Public service pay accounts for 33 per cent of Government spending.  I believe there is need here for a pay pause.  At the same time, there is a certain section of the community which might have to be exempt from a pay pause.  It is important that we should look at this matter very seriously, with a patriotic eye, and say to ourselves that we are able to live.  I appeal to those in the public service to appreciate the fact that there are people living in very great hardship. We should all recognise this, especially those in the public service.  We are all finding things difficult, but some find the situation much more difficult than others.  We have become too selfish.  We are all trying to feather our own nests.  Sectional interests is a predominant feature and nobody is prepared to be the first to call a halt. We should be prepared to do this, to tell ourselves our jobs are secure and we will not be out on the dole.  I would ask those in the public service to assist the Government by accepting a pay pause.  The other evening I was told those in the public service had got their increases under the national wage agreement but they were still looking for more.  This is very selfish remembering there are so many unemployed.  The interesting thing about the unemployed is, and this is reported by the Confederation of Irish Industry, that they are suffering a 50 per cent reduction in their real income as a result of the recession. Those on pensions and so on are suffering a 25 per cent reduction. Those in secure jobs should bear this fact in mind.</P>
    <P>I was wondering if the Government would give more by way of incentive to creating employment.  The employment premium is excellent and it was recently extended to cover additional industries.  Possibly it could be extended even further as a productive use of Government money to stimulate employment.  We should place more emphasis on labour subsidies <Col N="2189" /> rather than on capital grants for the purpose of guaranteeing employment. This is done in other EEC countries. They are more concerned with labour subsidies than they are with capital grants.  There would have to be an assurance that the subsidies would be used for the purpose of creating more employment.</P>
    <P>I believe we have been too lax in the allocation of grants to various sectors.  We have given grants for hotels.  Why not establish a central loan fund from which loans could be made at zero rate of interest over so many years?  If the borrowers cannot afford to pay the money back, then they will not be asked to do so.  Where loans are concerned, there need be no stipulation that they must be repaid within a certain time but any money coming into the fund could be used for productive purposes.  I think the policy of giving grants was a mistake and the time has come when we should change our whole approach in this matter.</P>
    <P>I was in Malta earlier this year.  It is a very interesting little island.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Mintoff, has done wonders.  He is loath to give grants for anything.  He gives loans only.  Loans mean money coming back all the time and that money can be used over and over again.  The Government should seriously consider this whole matter.  With regard to grants given to agriculture, when I asked for in-information about these I could not get a satisfactory answer.  The Minister would not give the information. Many millions have been given to agriculture and there is no information as to what the money was given for or to whom.  I asked for the names of those who received grants in excess of £500 and I could not get the information. We get information, however, when grants are given in the industrial sector.  I was surprised and disappointed to learn that the information could not be made available to the public, because since public money is involved there should be public accountability.</P>
    <P>There is much talk of price increases and of the policing of prices but we should look realistically at this <Col N="2190" /> whole question and have regard to the fact that a stricter surveillance in this area means further Government spending in so far as a greater number of inspectors must be employed. We must ask ourselves whether such expenditure is justified because when the upturn in the economy occurs and there is free competition there will be no need for these extra civil servants and the cost of maintaining them would be phenomenal.  Is it worth while, for instance, reporting the owner of the small huckster's shop which stays open until midnight for charging an extra 1p on small items? Might we not regard this small additional cost as part of the service charged?  These people do not make fortunes and we might be only harassing them in having this stricter control.</P>
    <P>However, there is a real need to have regard to the overcharging engaged in by publicans.  These people are making very high profits in an industry which has a very fast turnover. They have readily disposable products and are making profits of 40 per cent and more whereas the grocer makes a profit of less than 6 per cent. I am a non-drinker and, consequently, drink prices do not bother me personally, but I am concerned for all those who are affected by the overcharging.  Groups of people such as publicans can defy Governments openly but this situation should not be tolerated.  As a people we should stand up against any such pressure groups and not be intimidated by them.</P>
    <P>At a time when sacrifices are being asked for on the part of the entire community groups such as publicans should not be exempted.  This applies, too, to professional people and any others who may be seeking large increases. I was disturbed to read in today's papers that barristers are seeking an increase of 66 per cent.  Again, this is an exploitation of a situation and is defying openly Government appeals for restraint.</P>
    <P>The Opposition made much capital of the fact that the situation in the building industry is not good.  I agree that it is not good but I do not accept <Col N="2191" /> that this was an orderly industry prior to the change of Government.  Up to the time we took office speculation was rampant within this sector and vast profits were being made especially in relation to the building of office blocks which were being constructed all over the place.  However, these buildings are empty now.  The ending of that situation accounts to some extent for the significant drop in the number of people employed in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition referred to the fact that money was being spent on local authority housing in preference to spending in the private building sector.  I trust that Deputy Lynch did not mean this because it is in the area of local authority housing that we should concentrate most effort and, consequently, provide houses for those who are most in need of them.  As a result of the speculation that went on in relation to building in the past, many people have made fortunes.  One very enlightened piece of thinking on our part was the restriction of auctioneers' fees.  Some of these auctioneers were making so much money that they were able to build office blocks for themselves. There is one office block in this town that was built by an auctioneer specifically for use as his own premises.  This is an indication of the level of profits they were making.  The situation now is that the vendor pays the fees concerned but the purchaser of the house is not required to pay any such fees.  This change too, accounts partly for the drop in the number of people employed in the building industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to see in operation a public works programme with the concentration, not on office blocks, but on work that is useful socially. Office blocks may be built by foreigners but with Irish money.  Some of these people came here and were able to get the money for their operations from Irish banks.  However, their boom time has passed.  Every effort must be made to employ as many people as possible on public works programmes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2192" /> Deputy Lynch also referred to the question of rates and said that his party wished for the abolition of rates. I am objective in my criticism.  I can be scathing with the Government on occasion but in this instance I must be critical of the Leader of the Opposition. Referring to Fianna Fáil's promise before the general election to abolish rates Deputy Lynch said that while it was late in the day that they thought about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suggest that Deputy Fitzpatrick read his Leader's speech.  I am not being offensive to Deputy Lynch but he was naive, not only in regard to the rates question but in referring to family law in respect of which he said that when his party return to power they will ensure that family law legislation is implemented.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to ask what his party were doing during 16 years of office that they took no action in regard to this legislation.  Now he realises how enlightened is our thinking in this regard.  For many years in opposition we had been asking the then Government for legislation in this sphere.  We had been asking, too, for rates relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lalor during the course of his contribution last night was forthright and honest in some of the points he made.  I enjoyed listening to his speech and I found it most constructive. I said that the Opposition can contribute significantly to the debate by offering constructive criticism. When we were in Opposition we did this and Fianna Fáil listened to us and implemented some of our suggestions. One of our suggestions was the establishment of a National Prices Commission and in the medical area we called for the abolition of the dispensary system.  To give Fianna Fáil their due, they implemented our suggestions. It is the job of an Opposition to make suggestions.  Once they are implemented it does not matter <Col N="2193" /> who takes the credit for them because all that is important is the welfare of the people.</P>
    <P>We have been given every indication that the budget will be a very tough one.  For a while I thought this was a conditioning process, that we might be told this repeatedly and then when the budget was presented that it might not be as bad as we thought.  I often got that impression in the weeks preceding other budgets and I thought this might be the same kind of propaganda. However there seems to be every indication that the coming budget will be a tough one.  I am convinced we must look at the bright side.  The recession will not last forever and there is definite evidence that there is light at the end of the tunnel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We must not become too despondent.  There is enough despair in the world without talking too much about depression.  It is not too much to expect us to give one year to the country and this also applies to the irresponsible people who go on lightning or unofficial strikes. We should appeal to everyone to try and make the coming year a strike-free year because this would help the economy and would encourage everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Labour to consider the question of some kind of early warning system.  All of us know that strikes are settled in the end and we must ask why we have not got some machinery to investigate them more quickly.  The Labour Court is not entirely without blame because it has taken considerable time to examine the question of strikes.  I remember the very serious bus strike that had devastating effects on the economy of the city.  I was obsessed about the matter and wanted very much to have it solved.  I was not too happy with the attitude of both sides: one said they could not continue the discussions because the World Cup matches were on and the Labour Court could not meet <Col N="2194" /> until the end of the following week. In a situation like that there should be machinery available to investigate the matter urgently, even if it meant working on Saturday or Sunday and into the night.  We have had too many strkes.  Many of them were unjustified and could have been averted if the proper machinery were there.  We should do our utmost to make 1976 a strike-free year; this would be the greatest contribution to our economy.</P>
    <P>There is a depressing feeling throughout the country.  We should try to instil confidence in the people, tell them that there is light at the end of the tunnel but that we must prepare for it.  We should have our plans ready to meet the upturn and to be able to cope with it.  As I see it, it will come within the year, but there is no use in our sitting back and twiddling our thumbs.  If we do that our country has no hope of recovery. Now is the time to prepare for it, to give the incentives to industry and make our banks play their part.  We should spread the net more fairly so that all sections play their part.</P>

      <P>The short time available to the House does not allow Members time to deal with the various aspects of the problems that face the country.  One can only lightly touch on <Col N="2195" /> a small selected group of problems, whether by way of criticism or constructive suggestions.</P>
      <P>While there has been much talk in this debate about unemployment, the depressed state of the economy and high prices, such has been the deterioration in recent years that the public have become almost immune to such talk. They are not reacting as they might have been expected to react in the past. Formerly because of public pressure, sometimes exerted in violent ways, there was a much quicker reaction from Governments.  While our periods of depression may have been just as severe they tended to be shorter and the upswing was quicker because the Government were forced to take remedial measures at an earlier stage.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the cushioning of the public from real want has left the Government without the real prodding they might have expected, and it may be responsible for their lack of action to remedy the situation.  It is absolutely essential that we have an upturn in the economy; otherwise we will stay down, and nobody wants that.  That we have more than 100,000 people unemployed does not seem to strike any great chord; it does not disturb us as it would have done ten, 20 or 30 years ago.  That is a pity.  We appear to be cushioned to such a degree that the effects are not severe enough to make us react sufficiently quickly to prod the Government into the action which they now propose to take.  We have yet to see if their proposed remedies have a hope of making any impact on the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prices situation is like the killings in the North: they used to be the first headline news on our radio station but are not any longer.  The other night in ninth place we had the shooting of a 17-year-old boy.  I only mention this to parallel it with the daily increases in prices which five years, ten years or 20 years ago would have set off an alarm system which we would all have heard and taken some action about.  Those increases have been taking place so frequently that we are deadened to their effect.  Rounds of price increases take place day in and <Col N="2196" /> day out without any reaction from the public that would make the people in this House, particularly the Government, sit up, because they have the responsibility to try to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>This apathy in regard to unemployment and rising prices is very dangerous. Added to this we have the Government's contribution.  I have heard various speakers, not only in this debate but in others, tell us about the impact the increases in oil prices have had.  The Arabs are blamed for all this.  The increases which have been imposed for all sorts of spurious reasons in this House are far greater than the total amount the Arabs get for the raw product.  We should not try to cod anybody, least of all ourselves, that the increases in oil prices are totally because of the price the Arabs have looked for.  Justly and belatedly, they have sought those increases for their products.  In the not-too-distant future oil supplies will run out and they will probably find themselves in some hole with nothing at all to sustain them.  The Arabs were bled white in the price they took for their oil while others throughout the world got rich on it.</P>
    <P>When we were asked to pay the increased price for oil there was a huge outcry from everybody.  We attributed all sorts of disasters, economic recession and increased costs of production to the Arabs.  The increases we imposed, giving extra money in taxes to the Government, were at a greater level than the increases caused by the producers, who are getting no more than that to which they are entitled.  We, like other countries, use their product in order to gather taxes in a big way.  I have no doubt that the Arabs and other oil producers, now that they have looked at the situation, will continue to put the pressure on and continue to push up their rake-off for their product.</P>
    <P>Nobody likes paying taxes.  But now there is such pressure on because of the Government's lack of funds, that they come in shoals to many people who before this might not even have had to fill up a tax form.  They have to engage in all sorts of form filling nowadays.  The people who have to pay <Col N="2197" /> the piper, those from whom the taxes are demanded, are, nine times out of ten, in no position to understand the intricacies that have been woven into the tax system over the years.  When they have to pay they pay blindly and this leads to frustration and the feeling that what one does not understand is unfairly taken.</P>
    <P>I wonder in all this welter of new tax codes if the brains of the civil service&mdash;and there is no lack of brains there&mdash;should not be devoted to the simplification of the whole spread of taxes as they apply to our workers, wage earners, farmers, industrialists, right across the board.  Nobody will deny that our tax operations are difficult to understand.  The lack of understanding of the system we apply makes it more objectionable and obnoxious to those who pay.  In many cases they cannot comprehend completely, if caught in various tax nets, where they are.  This is not a good thing.  It must be within the competence of the civil service to devise ways and means of simplifying the whole tax procedure. It is probably too much to expect, that a simplification of the tax system might also mean that taxes would cease to soar, as they have been doing.  We are burdening the backs of the people still fortunate enough to be working, considering there are over 100,000 out of work and little prospect that things will change in the foreseeable future.  This depression has been pretty lengthy and I believe we are not at the bottom of the pit yet. The longer it takes us to go down the longer it will take us coming up. The present depression appears to be worse than the depressions we have had in the past.</P>
    <P>All sorts of efforts have been made to control prices.  I do not believe that the most ardent supporter of this Government or the last Government will claim that these efforts have been successful.  While an eye is being kept on certain things, price increases and price mark-ups are taking place day in and day out all over the country and no notice is being taken of them. When one can find things 50 per cent dearer in one shop than in the next door shop surely there is a need for <Col N="2198" /> some sort of control.  It is not good enough that there can be such disparity in prices.  It does not speak well for the effectiveness of the price control system we have.</P>
    <P>I referred to oil and petrol prices. Without doubt petrol will be soon £1 per gallon and that will be a crazy situation.  In many cases private transport has to be used by a man as part of his everyday working life. Why has he to pay such exorbitant prices?  Why, for instance, must the price of a car be almost 50 per cent greater on this side of the Border than in the Six Counties and England, and that for cars not manufactured in England but elsewhere?  This is a fact.  We are paying more for insurance and nobody can tell me that the incidence of accidents in the Six Counties is less than here.  Why does the discrepancy arise and how can it be justified?  Despite all the concern the Minister expresses, how is it that insurance continues to rise here and that on every level it is beyond what is being paid across channel or across the Border where the accident rate and incidence of accidents, fatal and non-fatal, is greater than here? Who is codding whom and who is getting the rake-off?  This is an additional imposition on our motoring public after the cost of the vehicle, cost of spares and the cost of repairs. All these cost more here than they do across the Border or in England.  Tax is also higher here.  How do these things arise?  The long-suffering motoring public are entitled to an answer before there is any further twisting of the motorists' tail by further taxation on petrol and oil&mdash;which is very likely to happen in the coming budget or before it.  It is better that we should know about these things because it is bad enough paying but it is worse when we are in semi-ignorance of the reasons why we have to pay more than people living a short distance away or across the channel. It is time we had such information. We can then see if there is justification&mdash;and this we all doubt&mdash;for the discrepancies under all these headings.</P>
    <P>We should also take a hard look at the fishing industry.  Great play is <Col N="2199" /> made in the glossy annual report that emerges and tells, on a purely percentage basis, of how well we are doing in regard to fishery development measured by the value of landings, exports, number of craft on the water, amount of money provided by State agencies for the purchase of new boats and gear and the occasional improved landing facility that is provided. I am not saying this in any carping way; I have said it innumerable times, even when I was in charge of fisheries within the Government.  I maintain that our whole approach to the fishing industry has been too smallminded over the years and this is still so.  The smug complacency with which we present the return showing that a 20, 30 or 40 per cent increase has been attained in value of landings or in exports or in the provision of boats over last year or over the last five years is, I think, the cause of our failure to reap the reward that our seas hold for us, particularly off the west coast which seems to be a haven for every fishing nation across Europe.</P>
    <P>It is no exaggeration to say that if the Russians can fish off the north or north-west coast of Ireland and if Europeans from all the fishing nations can do so and find it profitable&mdash;they would not be there if they did not&mdash;it should be extremely profitable for us to put our backs into developing the fishing industry on our doorstep.  We would be doing two things at the same time: providing an outlet for the chronically unemployed people of the west coast and building up the industry to be one of the most important in our economy.</P>
    <P>This is all possible.  Instead of looking at other approaches to our unemployment problem and the problem of increasing production and output, here is one solution washing our toes and this has been the case for generations under different Governments and Ministers.  Our thinking is so small and our outlook so smug that to show a 10 per cent or 20 per cent increase from one year to the next seems to be something that merits a clap on the back whereas a good, hard kick is deserved for looking at the matter in <Col N="2200" /> that way at all.  We are far too small-minded about the fishing industry, which seems to be treated as if it was a sort of social service, whereas potentially it is one of our greatest assets that can be no less an asset in the future than it is today and it is a great potential asset today.</P>
    <P>We need better landing facilities, anchorages and harbours particularly along the difficult west coast and the back-up on-shore facilities also.  I think they will be provided if the landings are taking place, if the harbours and anchorages are provided, the men trained and the boats going out and the fish coming in.  On-shore facilities can be left fairly safely to private enterprise which in many cases in the recent past has shown that if the goods are there, the enterprise will be there to process them.  We are certainly not doing enough about harbours and anchorages and we are not doing anything like enough about educating our people in the skill and craft and knowledge associated with a thriving fishing industry.</P>
    <P>We have a fishery school which was specifically erected at Greencastle in my own constituency.  The extent to which it has been used since it was provided is a disgrace.  I do not think the Department or the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary are much more than aware that it exists.  If they are aware of its existence the use to which they are putting it is nothing short of scandalous.  What is being done in that fine, new school is no more than what was being done in a semi-derelict, disused old national school that we got on loan many years ago to launch this project while the new building was being erected.  After spending a lot of money on installing new equipment we are doing no more in it than was being done in the old, disused national school at Moville before we got the new building.  I had envisaged Newcastle school as ultimately developing into what one might regard as the fisherman's university, that it would not just provide skipper's courses which can be done anywhere&mdash;a six months' course which can be provided and has been provided in other places and this could continue to be the case.  There is <Col N="2201" /> much more that could be added to the base that has been established there about the development of which nobody in the Department responsible seems to be taking the slightest interest. One can only assume that this is a reflection of the lack of interest by the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary in doing a really good job at Greencastle.  It is being under-used to a scandalous degree. This would be only one of the two centres which should be in the country; the other preferably should be down south.  I see the money spent on the present building as a waste because it is not used enough and the people responsible for using it have shown a lack of imagination.</P>
    <P>We want our fishery limits extended. While 50 miles are being talked about at the moment, if our fish industries are to be preserved and exploited in the future to the advantage of our country we should be talking about a 200 miles limit.  Side by side with an extension of the limit&mdash; or even without it&mdash;we must have protection from marauding foreign trawler fleets.  They are visible daily right around our coasts and they scuttle off when one of our few protection vessels approaches.  When a number of them are fishing, one can be sacrificed while the others skidaddle. We are not doing enough about this.</P>
    <P>I have never believed that we can properly police our coastal waters and protect our fishery beds by the orthodox system, that is, the Irish Navy.  We must look at what is available to us and think in terms of recruiting from our fishermen.  These men could be trained.  In every port, big or small, there should be an armed vessel and on that protecting vessel there would be a Navy NCO in charge.  I am not suggesting that we should put guns aboard every fishing boat or that even on the selected boats which would be mounted they should be left in the hands and at the dictates of part-timers&mdash;fishermen and protection men when the occasion arises.  We must develop along these lines.  Whether the limit is 50 miles or 200 miles is not important if we cannot protect ourselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2202" /> Salmon conservation is another subject which will probably come before this House as a result of the commission's report which was circulated lately.  I do not agree with the gist of the report.  There are two elements in salmon fishing to be catered for: the rod man up the river and the traditional, genuine fisherman who derives a substantial amount of his annual income from taking salmon at sea.  I suggested a long time ago that the traps, charter fishing and estuaries are the places where our fishing stocks are being destroyed.  It must be remembered that there are only about 16 nights of the entire running season that are net fished by our fishermen. This is such a small proportion of the entire time limit that it is no exaggeration to say that more must get through so far as the sea going salmon fishermen are concerned than they take, despite what the figures produced will show.  In my view they can take the amount they are taking at present and still preserve for spawning the stocks without which the system will break down.  Salmon may be lying at the mouth of the river for weeks at a time waiting for the flood and these fishermen do not have only one chance, they have chances every time they swing a net.  They have so many chances that it must be said the fish have no chance at all.  We must step in there.  You cannot throw them out. I have always held against bitter critics that this is a right which must be respected and cannot be abandoned or taken from them.  If it is taken from them, they must be paid compensation. I fully subscribe to this.</P>
    <P>The Foyle Commission in my opinion were responsible for more depredation than the poachers they are allegedly trying to control.  Do not let the State take over and say: &ldquo;We will take over this estuary, these traps or these charter rights and fish them ourselves.&rdquo;  Let us stop fishing them altogether and let the fishermen at sea fish as they have done traditionally and let our sportsmen, fishermen and anglers have the run of the river. Between them I do not think there is the slightest danger to the continuation of a very lucrative take by our salmon fishermen in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2203" /> In regard to social welfare, as I have said on previous occasions, I take great exception to the fact that a person can have benefit stopped overnight for no specified reason but just for investigation purposes.  There is a precept in law that a person is innocent until proved guilty.  It should be the same with social welfare.  If it is shown after investigation that a person is fraudulently or otherwise drawing money the whole or part of which he is not entitled to, there is the ordinary course that the Department can follow in seeking to have the amount repaid or, if it is a blatantly fraudulent case, of prosecuting the person concerned.  However, seeing that they are the Department whose main function is to look after those who for one reason or another are not fully able to care for themselves, they should ensure that no hardship is inflicted on anybody who is drawing social welfare benefit, until it can be proved that they are not entitled to it.  Such action can bring desperate hardship upon innocent people who are ultimately found to be in the clear and entitled to what they are getting and to whom the back money is paid.  However, during the weeks or months of investigation how are these people to exist?  Where will they get credit?  There are dozens of such cases week in and week out, and it is time this was stopped.  By all means, deal ruthlessly with those who are getting what they are not entitled to, but do not hurt those who genuinely need it by setting traps on a hit and miss basis for those who are fraudulently getting it.  I have no sympathy for the latter, but I have a great deal of sympathy for those who are cut off and who suffer great hardship as a result of these reinvestigations.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to local government and its housing grants and loans system.  Everybody, most of all the Minister for Local Government, must be aware that if grants were ever justified, then either we were paying far too much ten years ago or we are paying far too little today.  I subscribe to the latter view.  Grants at <Col N="2204" /> their present level are ludicrous and should be increased not only for the benefit of the person who can reach the point at which he can avail of it but for the benefit of the building industry, the importance of which is accepted by everybody in the House.</P>
    <P>The SDA loans limits are also totally unrealistic.  Again, it is not only a matter of helping a man who wants to build his own house but a matter of the loss within the building industry which is going through a bad time and is likely to go through a worse time in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I find school transport to be one of the greatest nagging problems there is, particularly in rural areas.  It was inadequately researched as to how best to do it, and it is, perhaps, costing more than it should.  I recommend to the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary the undertaking of a searching investigation into the whole application of the school transport system.  In so doing he could well not only improve the system, which has so many faults in it and which causes so much difficulty in rural areas, with unfair decisions being made, but save money by giving a better, more efficient service.</P>
    <P>In regard to national school and second-level school premises, there are so many pre-fabricated buildings around the country, it is hard to see the original school building.  At the same time, more space is needed by many of our schools, not always, unfortunately, due to increased numbers of school-going children but rather due to the almost stupid attitude of the Department in closing down perfectly good schools in order to bring about their amalagamations, which seem to be almost sacred.  There is so much to be done in regard to school buildings that where amalgamations are not &ldquo;on&rdquo; for one reason or another we should not be rowing about it; let us have them where they are &ldquo;on&rdquo;.  Greater progress would be made in that way.  The closing down of recently built schools in order to fulfil a blueprint that was in somebody's drawer in Marlborough Street is not something on which we should <Col N="2205" /> waste too much of our time, energy or money at a time like this.</P>
    <P>There is discrimination in regard to grants for third level education.  The facilities available to those who decide to go for the academic or professional fields in the universities are not available to those who attend the regional technical colleges.  Why is there this discrimination?  Surely those who go to our regional technical colleges are entitled to at least the same consideration, financially, from the national purse as those who are proceeding towards professions.  They are not and never were given a fair deal.</P>
    <P>Our regional technical colleges which were built at great cost by the dedication of the management and staffs are getting a raw deal.  It is the country's loss that they are being given that raw deal.  The raw deal is the discrimination against those who attend those institutions rather than the universities.  In addition, there has been an insane approach in the non-sanctioning of lecturers' posts in those institutions.  If it was fully examined, it would be found to be an insane policy.  We have the potential to do so much in those institutions and yet we permit the ship to almost sink for the want of a ha'porth of tar.  Something should be done about this.</P>
    <P>There are peculiar difficulties in so far as my constituency is concerned and they are so many and varied that I would not have time to go into them in detail.  There is a large, though falling population in Donegal but we are truly in a disadvantaged position.  This has never been fully recognised by this Parliament.  We are regarded as part of the South with none of its advantages.  We are isolated on the one hand by an unnatural Border and on the other by the broad Atlantic.  We do not get from our own Dublin Government the special consideration we are entitled to.  We are the products of Partition and our disadvantages are largely due to Partition, and we are treated in much the same way as those who live west of the Bann have been treated by Stormont governments.  As far as the Dublin Government was concerned it was through total ignorance <Col N="2206" /> and in the case of the other it was deliberate and with complete determination to keep those west of the Bann in their places by not giving them jobs or houses in the hope that they would go away thereby diminishing in number to a point that would upset the balance of political power in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>There is no such problem as far as Donegal is concerned but we have all the other problems created by Partition and we are left there.  As far as transport is concerned, the only public service provided is by bus.  That bus service goes through the Six Counties, through the kind hands of the occupying forces of the British crown, at Strabane and at Aughnacloy. That is what our Government are providing the people of Donegal with.  It is not very luxurious and far from what it should be since we have no rail, air or sea service.  It is totally inadequate and could be described as a service provided for second class citizens which apparently we are in Donegal except when somebody wants something from us.  In that case we are the best in the world.</P>
    <P>That is all we have by way of connection with Dublin for trade and commerce.  The bus must travel through County Tyrone and the Border checks by the British Army. The British Army gives special consideration to intimidate the travellers from Donegal to anywhere in the South.  It is not unusual to find in the most inclement weather a bus load of passengers travelling from Donegal standing in the rain while they and the bus are searched.  I have not heard any crib from our Government about that treatment.</P>
    <P>On the constructive side, I should like to state that the EEC Regional Fund would be better spent in providing a proper air service to and from Donegal, with feeder links to our main airport, rather than filling the gaps and holes in our sanitary services, which the Government have not put up enough money for.  We are using that fund by spending a few thousand here and there although Donegal needs an air service without which we can never develop.  We also <Col N="2207" /> need a sea service into our county, particularly a car ferry service.  The fishing potential of that county is second only to our tourist potential. We know what the potential is but we are doing damn all about it from a national point of view.</P>
    <P>We have also in Donegal one of the best natural ports in Europe but all we hear about is money being spent on surveys and technological operations to ascertain how other ports can be improved without a word about the Lough Swilly port.  That port is on the northwest approaches and surely has a potential beyond measure. It has never been looked at with any benevolent sort of gaze by any Government Department who could and should be doing something about it.</P>
    <P>We have suffered from Partition and continue to suffer and our Government in Dublin do not understand our problems.  I hope they will be a little more realistic in the future, particularly as they have come to be so concerned about the problems of the Six Counties, especially the Loyalists'.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs devoted his contribution to this debate to the situation in the Six Counties.  He told us that we have to identify the problem and went on to do so having given us a warning that careless words here and there could cause damage and death in the Six Counties.  He told us that fear led the Unionists to the breakaway but that the decisions of 1920 and 1921 did not end their fears. He told us that fear has manifested itself in discrimination and oppression &mdash;a nice way of putting it.  That Minister told us that the Unionists or Loyalists suffer from a lack of a sense of security and a lack of a sense of identity, an identity they could find if they were allowed to do so by the usurpers in the Six Counties, the British, who should not be there at all.  Those people are as much Irish as I am so that there is no problem about their identity if the shackles were taken off the Six Counties by the occupation which has been a feature of this island for centuries by Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs told us that the Loyalists were no <Col N="2208" /> longer clear where they belong or stand but how could they be when they were cosseted and nurtured by British occupation forces down the years for, undoubtedly, Britain's own gain in the past although it may be to her disadvantage now?  It is very good to hear all this from the Minister.</P>
    <P>What I would like to say to him is in the form of questions.  Why all this concern for the Loyalist Unionist people in the Six Counties?  Why all these exhortations to do everything we can to understand their problems, even to changing our Constitution if it will do them any good?  There is another element in that population who have resented, fought against and will continue to fight against their position in the Six Counties, which is only a small part of the island, that is, the half million minority.  I set them against the million that we hear all about.  We were exhorted time and again not to bond them into a united Ireland.  Nobody wants to bond them into a united Ireland or into anything else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nobody.  Nobody wants to bond them into anything.  I want to say a word on behalf of the half million who have suffered discrimination and oppression.  Last night the Minister said that fear had manifested itself among Loyalists over the years, fear about oppression and discrimination.  That is a terrible way to put it.  It is his view not mine.  But what about those on whom discrimination and oppression have been visited during the past 50 years?  Are they to be abandoned by us as they have been throughout the years?  Are they to be told: &ldquo;The majority up there want it this way and even if that means walking on your neck, it is better to walk on half-a-million necks rather than there should be any question of the million getting into line and coming back to where they belong and telling Britain to get out as she should, and must, if she has any sense.&rdquo;  She must give this declaration of intent the demand for which has been so maligned not only by Members of the Government benches but by Mr. Rees, if you do not mind.</P>

      <P>It has come to be criticised as such and to be defended as such, and for short phraseology I think it is much more descriptive than any other form of words one could use.  Mr. Rees is critical of this and has trotted out what we have been told so often that, perhaps, everybody down here now believes it, that if the British presence were to go even ten years from now there would be rivers of blood in the streets of Belfast.  That is what we are being told here by the British.  The country should know the truth, that unless and until Britain declares that she no longer has any intention of indefinitely remaining in the Six Counties there can be no rational reasonable talk with or between the two communities or with the Loyalist group in that community.</P>
      <P>It is totally unrealistic to expect them to talk of this island as a united island while Britain declares her intention to stay.  The converse is that Britain declares her intention to go. Then, and not until then, will we get reason and a sensible approach which Loyalists and others in Ulster would be prepared to give.  Not until then will we have a true unification of our people.  We are as blind to that today as we have been in the last 50 years, and there are British politicians, including Mr. Wilson and Mr. Rees, who seem to think we do not know anything down here.  There is nothing so tragic as to hear Mr. Rees, after his short couple of years' association with the problems of the Six Counties, about which he may or may not have had knowledge, chiding us and blaming us for our ignorance.  It is the ignorance of the Loyalists he is blaming us for, not ignorance of the cause of the problem today and in the last 50 years.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I have not time for that gentleman, Mr. Wilson, <Col N="2210" /> who when he was in Opposition not many years ago, put out some kind of a programme&mdash;I do not know whether it had 14 points or 15 points &mdash;about a British withdrawal.  Now that he is in Government there is no word about it, and Mr. Rees is lambasting us down here.  All I would say to that gentleman is that when he is as long around, about and through the Six Counties and the Border and its problems as I and others like me have been, then it will be time enough for him, as Secretary of State or otherwise, to start telling us about the ignorance of the people of the South of the problems of the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>What does he know about it?  In recent months he has demonstrated nothing but abysmal ignorance of the whole problem that is the Six Counties. Indeed, one can only wonder that when the opportunity was available Mr. Rees was not replaced by somebody who would have had some semblance of thought as to what the whole thing was about.  The Great Britain Prime Minister is without doubt&mdash;I admire him for it though it may not be a very complimentary thing I am about to say&mdash;the most adept political ballet dancer outside Faulkner of the Six Counties over the years.  I admire him on a purely political basis, but I would say to him: &ldquo;Do not take your ballet dancing into the arena of the Six County problem. We have enough problems there and they are bad enough without this sort of talk and double talk.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would ask him finally: &ldquo;Where has the money been coming from to the Loyalists in the Six Counties? Has he checked out what subscriptions have been paid in money and in guns from the Masons throughout the world to their brethern above in the Six Counties?&rdquo; He should not be selective when he is condemning what is going on.  He should understand and realise that there are two sides to this problem.  There is a Minister sitting over there who sees only one side as well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The greatest problem facing the country today is that it is leaderless.  The country is only too well aware from experience of this Government that solutions announced for the purpose of getting the economy on its feet again will not be followed to their logical conclusions. Ever since the Government assumed office our economy has been in decline, with one possible exception in the period up to autumn 1973 because of sound Fianna Fáil financial policy when the economy continued its forward movement.  From that time on the crazy financial policies of this Government began to take effect. The economy took a downward plunge until it reached its present frightening and deplorable state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During all of that period we did not have any shortage of declarations by the Government in relation to what they proposed to do to correct the shocking drift which has now reached danger point.  There is little doubt that the Government had a considerable amount of expert advice on the steps which should be taken to correct this trend from their own advisers, from the Central Bank, industrialists, farmers, trade unionists and Deputies on this side of the House.  The evils of inflation were pointed out and, on occasion, decisions announced by the Government were such as might have gone some way at least towards correcting the downward plunge of the economy.  But, as I said a moment ago, the disastrous thing for this country was that they never carried out those decisions.  At the first sign of opposition to their proposals, at the first sign of political danger to either of the parties in the Coalition Government, they pulled back and the economy was allowed to continue to drift into chaos albeit, of course, the Government using very carefully chosen language to cover up the retreat or withdrawal, to try to make it appear that the withdrawal, which in fact was taken in the face of opposition, was simply another facet of their declared policy.  Whatever the words used to cover up this retreat&mdash;and a retreat it was in every instance&mdash;we, the people of Ireland, are paying <Col N="2212" /> dearly for it today.  We are paying dearly for the vacillation of this Government and, as far as we can see now, we will pay even dearer in the future.</P>
    <P>We have always held on this side of the House that coalitions were fair-weather governments, that if such governments were manned by reasonably intelligent people&mdash;when times were good and there was plenty of room for manoeuvre&mdash;they could put on a show which appeared to be a worthwhile performance.  But, when the clouds came down and the problems and difficulties came apace, then the inherent incapacity of coalitions to take difficult decisions became very apparent.  The basic damage resulting from such indecision is tremendous, has very far-reaching effects, touching, as they do, every single individual in our community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In defence of this Coalition it has been said that most countries in western Europe are governed by coalitions.  The fact is that, in most of those countries, the parliament is made up of many small parties and the coalition is usually formed from a group of parties who have some natural affinity.  One would never find a situation such as we have here where the support&mdash; and I emphasise support&mdash;of one party is made up of a very conservative element in the community while the support of the other ranges from left of centre to radical socialism.  Of course, that underlines the basic difficulty this Government have in making decisions and in giving leadership.  Again, let me emphasise that I speak of the type of support which each of the parties has in the country.  I do not speak of the parliamentary parties themselves because, as has been rightly said by the Leader of this party, the Labour parliamentary party now stands to the right at least of a certain element in the Fine Gael party.  Whenever a difficult decision came to be taken <Col N="2213" /> which would spell out trouble for one or other of the Coalition parties, then it was not taken, whatever might be the detrimental effects on the country as a whole.  Whenever one of the parties was frightened by the reaction of the public to a particular policy announcement, just as surely that policy announcement was shelved.  This is no airy-fairy pronouncement on my part.  It is a description which can be shown to be factual of what has been taking place in this Government since they assumed office.</P>
      <P>Through this lack of decision-making and its follow up, we find ourselves in this present deplorable situation.  It has been said sometimes of Fianna Fáil that perhaps they are also a coalition.  If this means that there are different viewpoints and so on within the party itself, that can be a fact.  But the important thing is that the Fianna Fáil Party is a unit which decides on policy by a majority decision and proceeds to put that policy into operation in the knowledge that, whether it is popular or unpopular, it will affect every member of the party in the same way. Therefore, decisions were taken by the Fianna Fáil Government, not on the basis of the problems they might cause the party itself but on the basis of whether or not the decisions taken were in the best interests of the country.  Over a period of time Coalitions have proved themselves to be incapable of taking action when faced with great problems.  Each of these Coalitions has led the country into financial chaos, such as we find it in today.  Crucial decisions have been put to one side or have been taken too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this Coalition we have seen that in their efforts to be all things to all men they brought in budget after budget, each more damaging to the economy than its predecessor. The Government in their first budget had the benefit of the £30 million saved from agricultural subsidies because of our entry into the EEC.  That money was used for social welfare purposes.  We were all aware during the general election of 1973 that this money was available and we <Col N="2214" /> had all promised that it would be made available for social welfare purposes. However, this apart, I wondered &mdash;in the early days of this Administration&mdash;where the rest of the money was coming from used for purposes other than social welfare.  There were times when I thought we must have been misled in some way or other in regard to the amount of money available. Of course, I now recognise that we were not being misled because we are all only too well aware of where the money came from.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what perturbs me now is the knowledge of what happened previously in relation to the Government, when they took certain policy decisions and backed out of them at the first sign of opposition, and dodged every major issue.  What worries me now is how we can believe that this same Government are likely, even if they have the policies and if those policies are announced on the day of the budget, to carry those policies to their final conclusion.  How can we be sure these policies will be implemented?  If we are to judge by the actions of the Government on many occasions since they took office the only conclusion we can come to is that, irrespective of what decisions are made, the Government are more likely to back off carrying through these decisions designed to get the economy back on its feet again, more likely to pass up standing by these decisions, more likely to do what they did before, We can only hope they will face up to the exceptional problems which have brought this country into very imminent danger.  We do not want to end up like New York.  We should remember that, unlike New York, we unfortunately have no fairy godmother in the shape of a federal government to come to our aid.  The Government have not had the political courage to take the steps that should have been taken and the sooner they make way for another Government the better.</P>
    <P>The power of persuasion of the Government publicity machine has created a fatal flaw in present-day thinking which, while it may be a useful ploy by the Government, can mean that the road to recovery will <Col N="2215" /> be much longer than it might otherwise be.  They have succeeded in brainwashing people into believing nothing more can be done than the Government are doing, that things are as bad in other countries as they are here and a change of Government, therefore, would make no difference.  In fact things are very much better in other Common Market countries than they are here, with the possible exception of Britain, and Britain has taken some action; she has, of course, a greater capacity for survival than we have.  The fact is that where a nation is convinced nothing can be done to overcome its problems an atmosphere of inertia is created and that leads ultimately to destruction.</P>
    <P>For too long our people have been told by the Government that all our ills stemmed from the oil crisis and we had no control over this crisis. That continued to be the Government's line until it became clear that other EEC countries suffering the same oil crisis problems had overcome the difficulties and were making rapid progress towards recovery.  I have no doubt the Government would still be sheltering behind the oil crisis had not the Taoiseach been forced to change his mind because the national wage agreement negotiations were about to begin last week.  At that point he began to tell us the problems were largely of our own making.  His purpose was to try to get a lower increase in incomes than that visualised.</P>
    <P>Reaction to a given situation rather than planning ahead has become an integral part of Government policy. The Government told the people we were caught up in a world-wide inflationary situation over which we had no control.  This was accepted by the public and by some of the media for quite a considerable time.  The frame of mind created by this attitude resulted in our inflation rate continuing to escalate while the inflation rate in almost all our partners in the Common Market was being quite considerably reduced.  I remember during a debate on a Private Member's Motion earlier this year on the footwear industry mentioning the steps taken by Italy <Col N="2216" /> to protect her industries.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked me to take note of the detrimental effects this particular policy had on Italy.  He referred to the fact that the Italian Government had fallen.  The fact is that by the time I brought in a similar motion six months later the situation in Italy was that they had cut their inflation rate by half while our inflation rate continued to soar.</P>
    <P>We advised the Government on more than one occasion prior to the budget of last January to introduce food subsidies and remove VAT from a number of commodities as a temporary measure.  We pointed out the effects which would flow from such an action in regard to the cost-of-living index and the effect on the national wage agreement which was about to be negotiated at that time.  The Government refused to listen and the effect on industry since has been catastrophic.</P>
    <P>It has also been catastrophic where employment is concerned.  After the earlier efforts to achieve a national wage agreement appeared unlikely to be successful the Government's main objective seems to have been to have a national wage agreement at whatever level.  We were not concerned about what the effect might be of such an agreement but, when the agreement was negotiated the results were highly praised by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour.  A few weeks later the Minister for Finance had to issue a statement in which he said that, unless changes could be made in the agreement and unless it could be reduced in size, the effect on the country would be very severe indeed. This showed a complete lack of leadership.</P>
    <P>The Government are now seeking the adulation of the public because they claim the action they took in the June budget has succeeded in keeping the cost-of-living index increase below 3 per cent and this is proof that the measures taken in that budget were the correct measures.  I would once again underline the fact that we on this side repeatedly asked the Government to take these steps in the January budget and, had they done so, they would have succeeded in <Col N="2217" /> keeping down the rise in the cost-of-living index between January and June and they would then have been in a position to negotiate a national wage agreement which would have assured our competitiveness in the export markets as well as on the home market and many of the industries which went to the wall, due to the ineptitude of Government policy in regard to inflation, would still be in existence and the workers who are now swelling the unemployment figures would still be gainfully employed.  In my own constituency I have seen a number of industries closing down completely and thousands of workers becoming redundant.  Inflation is the bugbear which has undermined our whole economic position and the Government did not have the political courage to tackle it until it was too late.</P>
    <P>I should hope that for the country generally it is not too late to take some action but, unfortunately, it is too late for the many people who have lost their jobs.  A typical example of the detrimental effect of the Government's failure to control inflation is that of the closing down of a clothing industry in my constituency. This was an industry of German origin which exported 90 per cent of their total production, mainly to Britain.  They employed more than 100 workers but the escalating rate of inflation priced their products out of the market.  To get a picture of their difficulties I would cite as an example an article produced by them and sold last year for £100 but which would have to be sold this year at £120 to £124 while a similar article produced last year at the same price at the parent company in Germany could be sold this year for £106.  How could the Irish subsidiary compete in such circumstances?  Although the situation had been clear to the ordinary worker in Louth for a long time, the Government failed to do anything to help.  It is symptomatic of the Government's approach to the grave problems facing us that regarding this industry they appeared to have been much more concerned with ensuring that it did not sell more than 10 per <Col N="2218" /> cent of its products on the home market than in ensuring that the factory could continue to operate.</P>
    <P>There are now 110,000 people unemployed. Regardless of what excuses or comparisons the Government may seek to make to explain this situation the fact remains that we are facing the most frightening unemployment situation ever in the history of the State.  Our percentage of unemployment is the highest in all of the Common Market countries.  The situation is particularly bad for our young people.  Instead of showing some signs of trying to cope with the problem the Government are showing signs of panic and the policy appears to be now simply to react to situations as they arise.  There is no overall plan for future development.  The Government are merely muddling along and getting nowhere.</P>
    <P>It is well known that there is no industry which can produce jobs as quickly as the building industry, that is, if it is properly financed.  Therefore one would have expected that a real effort would have been made by the Government to develop this industry. The manufacturing industry is very useful in terms of the creation of jobs but this is a relatively slow process.</P>
    <P>There are no indications from the Government of their intention to develop the building industry.  Instead we are treated to a constant reiteration of housing statistics in an endeavour to prove that the Coalition are building more houses than were built by Fianna Fáil.  We are anxious that more houses be built, but even if the Minister's figures are correct we are far from doing sufficient in this industry, not only to provide the new jobs that are so badly needed but to retain the jobs already in the industry. Here again inflation has played a big part.  The inflation rate in the building industry was running at about 32 per cent, which was very much higher than the general rate.  It is heartbreaking to find from the official statistics issued within the past few days that the greatest fall in employment during the past 12 months has been in the building industry, that more than <Col N="2219" /> 8,000 workers who were engaged in the industry 12 months ago are now out of work.  These included skilled as well as semi-skilled workers.</P>
    <P>The most recent figures I have here show that for the month of November there were 8,204 fewer workers in employment in the industry than there were for the same month last year.  It is a grave reflection on the Government that they have allowed such a situation to develop.  During the past year, too, sales of cement have fallen by approximately 9 per cent.  There has been a fall also in the demand for building material such as timber, concrete blocks, chipboard and so on with a further loss in employment in the retail end of the business.  These people and those on the manufacturing side who lost their jobs are not included in the figure of 8,204.  All the Government can do in these circumstances is to issue housing statistics in an effort to prove that they have built more houses than were built by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>When we were in office there was continuing development in housing and in construction generally and the volume of employment continued to increase.  During the past two-and-a-half years, though, the trend is in the other direction.  The Government may say that in relation to the unemployment in the industry there are elements other than housing, but they cannot deny the drop in the number employed in the industry.</P>
    <P>On many occasions we demanded that the Government take action to ensure that the industry made the progress it was capable of making but we were constantly told by the Government that the industry was in perfect condition, that there was no need to worry.  We see the results now.  Far from giving the industry much-needed incentive, the Government have done the opposite.  The SDA loans and grants were the backbone of the private house sector of the building industry.  In May, 1973, the maximum loan level was £4,500 and it is still the maximum loan level in spite of the enormous escalation in costs since then.  The qualifying income <Col N="2220" /> limit in May, 1973, was £2,350 per annum and it is still the qualifying limit in spite of the raging inflation we have experienced since then.  This loan is useless so far as industrial workers are concerned.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on a previous occasion, the average wage of an industrial worker is now about £400 higher than the level of the income limit.  We must remember that these loans were intended originally for such people but now they cannot qualify for them.  Anyone who qualifies for an SDA loan today must get another loan elsewhere to make up at least part of the difference between the loan and the cost of the house. The average price of a house built with the help of an SDA loan was given some time ago as £7,500, but I have no doubt that the price has increased considerably.  The borrower's repayments will be far above the percentage of his income which could be regarded as tolerable.  This is mainly because of the fact that he has to borrow a considerable sum over and above the loan level if he is to buy or build his own house.</P>
    <P>The way the Government met the problem was not to increase the maximum loan level as we asked.  It was not to increase the qualifying income limit as we asked.  Rather it was to increase the interest rates on the SDA loans issued by local authorities from 10½ per cent to 11½ per cent and to reduce the repayment period from 35 years to 30 years, thus adding a further disincentive to the development of the building industry.</P>
    <P>Having increased the burden on the SDA loan borrowers, the Government then proceeded to increase the burden on borrowers from building societies by removing the subsidy which has been paid by the Government to the societies. This resulted in the societies, with the consent of the Minister, increasing their mortgage rate by 1 per cent and thus putting an additional burden on the already overladen shoulders of those anxious to own their own homes. These mortgage holders were already at their wits' end trying to make ends meet and now they are faced with this added imposition.  Many of them had <Col N="2221" /> become redundant during the year due to the inept policy of the Government in dealing with inflation and their inactivity in providing more employment. We should try to visualise how these people will face the new year.  They will draw little consolation from the statement of the Minister for Local Government that they are assisted in the repayment of their loans by the high inflation rate.  I always assumed that as the inflation rate increased the societies were permitted to increase their rates.</P>
    <P>The increase in rates throughout the country is phenomenal.  No matter what averages the Minister for Local Government may present in this House, the fact is that the rates are now an intolerable burden.  It is universally accepted that they are unjust and inequitable and that they bear no relationship to the ability of people to pay them.  Our policy which we declared before the last general election, which we have reiterated since and which I now state, is that when we are re-elected to government we will remove rates from all dwellings, urban and rural, and that the portion of rent payable as rates by all tenants of flats or houses, whether on the differential or fixed rent, will be reduced or removed.  Of course this will reduce the weekly payments of such tenants. Rates will also be removed from the dwelling portion of residential business premises.</P>
    <P>I have been asked how we propose to finance the removal of rates from private dwellings.  Perhaps I could repeat here what I said earlier today, that if I were asked how I would do this in 1972-73 when we left office I would have said we would have done it from buoyancy.  At that time the economy was in an exceptionally buoyant condition.  Of course, today it would not be possible to make a similar statement because of the shocking situation, both economic and financial, which the country is facing due to the ineptitude of the Government. Therefore, it would be necessary to replace the income from rates by some form of taxation.  This tax would be spread out, it would be broadly based and it would be much more equitable. <Col N="2222" /> Might I add that the rates of taxation suggested in the ESRI document as being necessary are far and away above the rates that would be necessary, as we discovered as a result of a very deep investigation which we made.  The fact is that only about 3 per cent of the total revenue taken up by the Government would bring in the amount of money necessary to take the place of the money that would no longer be available from rates on private houses.</P>
    <P>Today a report was issued on the rates system by the ESRI.  It dealt with the economic aspects of local authority expenditure.  This report was commissioned by the Minister for Local Government.  I find this document very disappointing.  There are no stimulating new proposals in it to deal with the rates problem.  There are no new proposals in it as far as I can see. It appears to me to be simply a repetition of established and departmental views.  I am not putting any blame on those who did the research.  I feel they were given very narrow terms of reference and, therefore, the results were predictable.  It is almost a repetition of the Minister's views.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to note the cavalier manner in which they appear to dismiss the Fianna Fáil policy.  The principal recommendations to me appear to be that there should be a general revaluation carried out in the country.  There is nothing new about this and it will be quite obviously a long time before anybody undertakes this.  If it was undertaken it would not solve the social problems involved.  A Government which cannot afford a relatively small amount of money to have a census this year can hardly be expected to rush into a general revaluation of the country.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation refers to the removal of exemptions, something which was recommended already in the inter-departmental report on local taxation.  We would not accept one suggestion which has been made in relation to the removal of exemptions: the suggestion that the rates remission from new houses should be abolished.  I believe this rates remission is an incentive to young people <Col N="2223" /> to buy houses and build them.  I certainly want to put my views on the record of the House in relation to that matter.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation is simply a further development of the Fianna Fáil scheme of rates waivers and the transfer of their costing to the central fund.  There is nothing radical in the recommendations put forward in this report.  There is nothing in it to raise the hopes of the over-burdened rate-payers. I am not critical of those who caried out the research.  Their terms of reference were such that they could not have taken a much broader view of the situation and come up with solutions to the rates problem.</P>
    <P>The only worth-while proposal on rates is the Fianna Fáil policy which, as I said before, is to abolish rates completely on dwelling-houses and replace them with a more equitable form of taxation.  The rates of taxation suggested by a spokesman for the ESRI are far above the rates which would be necessary.  In the event of our returning to office we would have to have a good look at the priorities of this Government.  It is quite possible that in some areas we could also have money transferred to help to solve the rates problem.  In financing the removal of rates from dwelling-houses it is likely we will use a combination of methods, but the overall effect would be that the additional taxes which would be imposed would relate to ability to pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In reply to Deputy O'Connell the principal objective of the Fianna Fáil policy on rates is that local bodies would be given a greater say in deciding how to spend moneys received from central government. One way of achieving this might be to give the local authorities a block grant, which would be calculated not only in relation to population but to needs and indicating the minimum level of service which must be supplied but leaving the local body <Col N="2224" /> free to decide how to allocate the remainder of their funds.  In doing this we would not only ease the rates burden but we would give a real meaning to the phrase &ldquo;local democracy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil decided to introduce the free education scheme it was generally pooh-poohed by many people on the basis that it would not be possible to find the money to do it.  We believed it was the proper thing to do and that it was essential that our young people, whatever their backgrounds and whatever the incomes of their parents, should be entitled to free education.  We said we could get the money to do it and we did.  We also believe firmly in our policy in relation to the removal of rates on the homes of the people.  It is an inequitable and an unfair tax.  The only solution is to remove rates from dwelling-houses.  We will get the money to do this.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government referred to planning.  I should like to refer to one aspect of it.  There was a great flurry when the Planning Bill, which was prepared but not finalised by the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Molloy, before he left office was introduced into the House by the Government.  We were told that they were particularly anxious to get this Bill through the House as quickly as possible so that they would be able to fulfil their commitment to the electorate and hand over the adjudication on appeals to the board. The Government, when introducing the Bill, did their utmost to garner whatever kudos were available for the transfer of the Minister's power in relation to planning appeals to the board, but they and the Minister appear to want to have their loaf and eat it.  They want to have whatever credit is available but at the same time keep the Bill in cold storage.  We have now had a full session of the Dáil without any reference made to this Bill.  It has not reappeared since the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding in the summer was that it would have been possible to have taken the remaining Stages of the Bill in a very short time before the Summer Recess, that the amendments that had been agreed and promised <Col N="2225" /> during the debate on the Committee Stage could have been ready and that we could have expedited the passage of the Bill, but we are now in the Christmas period without having made an iota of progress since the summer.  I hope that very early in the new session this Bill will reappear so that we can have it on the Statute Book as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In this Government are many Ministers who have failed to live up to the very bright promises held out for them in the media in March, 1973.  In fact it is difficult to point to even one successful Minister especially after discarding the well organised ballyhoo from their so-called performance.  One of the Ministers who has been a failure is the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the tragedy is that it is to this Minister the country looks for more jobs through industrial expansion and retention of the jobs that exist.  The rapidly rising unemployment figures show how he is losing out on both counts, neither retaining the jobs of those at present employed nor creating sufficient new jobs.  Industries have closed and are closing all over the country and far more jobs are being lost than are being created.  I underline the word &ldquo;created&rdquo;.  One of the most useful propaganda words which this Government have created is this word because jobs &ldquo;created&rdquo; mean that you can refer to thousands of jobs when the number actually filled could be counted in tens or twenties.  The remainder of these &ldquo;created&rdquo; jobs can be filled some time or possibly never.</P>
    <P>My constituency, one of the most highly industrialised in Ireland under the Fianna Fáil Government, is now feeling the full brunt of the inadequacy of Government efforts to control inflation and the failure of the Minister for Industry and Commerce adequately to protect industry.  We had a number of industries closing completely and quite a number of other where large numbers of workers were declared redundant.  I refer particularly to the footwear, textile and clothing industries.  On several occasions I moved Private <Col N="2226" /> Members' motions on behalf of the footwear industry which was, and still is being decimated by goods imported from low cost countries directly and also imported through some of our EEC partners, particularly the United Kingdom.  I pointed out that it was impossible for us to compete with those imports coming in here at a lower price than what we would pay for the raw materials in this country.  Neither the footwear industry nor I were asking for a complete prohibition on imported footwear; we were simply asking that the competition should be fair.  I explained in detail our rights under the Treaty of Accession in regard to an important industry where there was serious danger but we got no reaction of any serious consequence from the Minister.  We had a task force here which it appears did not accomplish very much because since then we find there are 200 more going on the unemployment register from the footwear industry in Cork and that a considerable number have become redundant in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The Government, as far as I can see, have no policy in regard to Northern Ireland.  In this, as in all other spheres, they react to situations as they arise.  There is no initiative, no forward planning because the Government are in the strait-jacket designed for them by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;I am glad he is here when I am speaking on this matter.  In the past two-and-a-half years he has dominated Coalition thinking on Northern Ireland and today when it is clear that the star in this respect is on a downward path they are unable, much as they might like to do so, to find their way out of the mire into which he has led them. At a time when there is so much violence and destruction, caused in part by paramilitary groups of all persuasions and in part by institutionalised violence, and when no end is in sight, it is more important than ever that the policy of the Government here should be clearly stated, that it should be unequivocal and that it should be based on ultimate unity, at the same time being flexible so as to embrace all shades of political <Col N="2227" /> opinion.  It should be so geared as to help all of our people, whether Protestants, Catholics, Unionists or Nationalists to recognise that it is only through unity in whatever form that we, as a people, can reach our full potential and so raise our standard of living and remove the spectre of unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is only through united effort that we can provide a worth-while future for our children.  Many solutions to the shocking problem of the North have been produced and tested and they have all failed.  The only solution which has not been put to the full test is that of unity.  Now is the time to put it to the test.  We all recognise that violence is no solution; violence and unity are contradictory terms. Therefore, we know we cannot have unity unless we have the agreement of the majority in Northern Ireland. Equally, we cannot accept the situation where a minority of the people of Ireland can retain a permanent veto on Irish unity.  Therefore we must endeavour to create the conditions where a rethinking of the whole matter can take place.  What contribution are the Government making towards creating those conditions? The answer is none.  Their softly-softly policy is but an excuse for a policy.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have issued a restatement of their policy on Northern Ireland, a clear and forthright statement with the full support of the whole Parliamentary Party and of many more than the 50 per cent of the electorate whom we represent.  It has vast support among the Nationalist population in Northern Ireland, as those who were so quick to denounce it are now very well aware.  The document repudiates violence and underlines the desire to have unity by agreement.  It calls on the British Government to declare their commitment to implement an ordered withdrawal from involvement in the Six Counties.  This is consistent with the attitude of Fianna Fáil through the years expressed by its various leaders. We have set no time limit for the withdrawal.  Britain has many responsibilities, <Col N="2228" /> political, financial and others, which she must shoulder and discharge before she leaves so as to ensure peaceful reunification of the country.  Is it not clear that only after the declaration of such a commitment by Britain that the Unionists whose stock reply today is &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; will find it necessary to begin to think in terms of reunification?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take advantage of the brief time at my disposal to make a short, factual statement about the industrial dispute in the Dublin postal district.</P>
      <P>The first thing I want to say is that the Department very much regret the inconvenience and hardship to the public which must result from the restrictions in postal services which we have had to introduce today.  The disruption of the post over the Christmas period when it is so widely used is indeed a serious matter.  I can only wonder if the staff concerned really appreciate the consequences of what they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will explain briefly the background to the dispute.  Postal traffic during the pre-Christmas period runs at about four times normal levels and special operational arrangements are necessary to cope with it.  These arrangements involve the working of considerable amounts of overtime by the regular postmen staff in all centres and the recruitment, through the National Manpower Service, of numbers of temporary staff.  As in previous years, the Department's special arrangements this year are based on a forecast of the probable volume of mail traffic and on providing a due course service to all the Christmas mails.  Christmas postal traffic has been falling for some years past and both the overtime attendances scheduled and the number of temporary <Col N="2229" /> staff to be recruited during the pre-Christmas period are lower this year than in 1974.  I would like to stress that a very substantial level of overtime would still be worked and all the regular staff would share in it.  Even more important, the Department have made it clear that, if the volume of traffic were higher than expected, the necessary additional overtime would be worked to clear it.  Deputies may well wonder from this last point, and I can only say that I would share such wonderment, in what way the Department could be accused of being unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The great majority of postal staff are operating the Christmas arrangements as usual.  Postmen drivers in Dublin, however, have refused to work overtime today.  Their action is unofficial and is in support of a demand by them that the Department should agree beforehand to the working of a higher level of overtime in the period between now and Christmas than the Department considers will be needed to handle the expected volume of mails traffic.  A particular demand is that deliveries should be provided in Dublin on Sunday, 21st December, although the Department are satisfied that this would not be required to dispose of the mails.</P>
    <P>The effect of conceding such demands would be that postmen drivers would be paid at overtime rates for attendances at certain periods which would not be required.  Let me repeat that the overtime which has been scheduled is very substantial&mdash;postmen drivers in Dublin would obtain about £50 on average in overtime payments for the week before Christmas&mdash;and that extra overtime would be worked if the traffic so required.  The staff concerned have, unfortunately, not been prepared to accept this.  Apart from postmen drivers in Dublin, one other group at Crumlin have refused for similar reasons.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I have described, it would not be possible to handle the increased volume of mail that would ordinarily be dealt with between now and Christmas.  In order to maintain the ordinary letter services, <Col N="2230" /> therefore, it has, unfortunately, been necessary to restrict services to a scale which can be operated without requiring the working of overtime by the drivers.</P>

      <P>With the Deputy's permission, I expect to speak for about two minutes more.  I would ask him for the courtesy to allow that.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Colley, the House and the Chair. Dublin is the hub of the national mails distribution network and the postmen drivers who have refused to operate the arrangements proposed for extra attendances play a key role in the movement of the mails.  The effects of the action taken by these drivers are particularly serious.  The restrictions in services which have been necessary have, therefore, been severe.  If the services were not restricted, a chaotic situation would very quickly develop and it would not be possible to maintain any sort of postal service.</P>
      <P>From today, the following postal services have been suspended until further notice:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  acceptance of parcels at post offices in the Dublin Postal District; (ii)  acceptance of parcels at post offices in other parts of the country for delivery in the Dublin Postal District; (iii)  acceptance of second class mail, including Christmas cards, in the <Col N="2231" /> Dublin Postal District, and (iv) acceptance of second class mail in other parts of the country for delivery in the Dublin Postal District.</P>
    <P>The public have been asked not to post second class mail of the categories referred to and are being told that such mail already in the post will be subject to indefinite delay.  Other postal services, including incoming mail from Britain and other countries, may suffer delay.</P>
    <P>Discussions regarding the Christmas postal arrangements were protracted and concessions were made in an effort to avoid disruption of the mails. The Department could not, of course, accept that overtime should be scheduled to an extent not required by the estimated traffic or that former levels of overtime should be maintained regardless of traffic trends.</P>
    <P>I would like to say again that I very much regret the effects on the public of the unreasonable action by the staff concerned.  The action will not bring any benefits to the staff and will result only in a loss of earnings for themselves and for their colleagues, including the temporary staff who had been specially recruited.  I would earnestly appeal to the postmen drivers and to the postmen at Crumlin to call off their action so that further inconvenience to the public and to their colleagues can be avoided.  I can naturally assure Deputies that services will be restored as soon as at all possible on the termination of the dispute.</P>

If they do not desist but maintain <Col N="2232" /> their present position, unfortunately, the dispute will continue.</P>

      <P>This Adjournment Debate is, of course, concerned with the performance of the Government in this session of Dáil Éireann which is now ending.  Of course, the shocking state of our economy overshadows all our other problems.  Before dealing with that, I want to refer to one or two other matters.  Firstly, I want to refer to the situation with regard to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Suggestions have been made in the news media in the fairly recent past arising out of the murderous bomb attacks on innocent people at Dublin Airport that Fianna Fáil's attitude to the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Bill might be altered.  I want to make it quite clear that such suggestions were both ill-founded and dangerous.  I want to make it crystal clear that Fianna Fáil will not be stampeded on this or any other matter by the criminal activities of any group, whether they come from the North, the South, or abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or from within the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Our stance on the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Bill has been determined by a careful appraisal of its contents and by what we conceive to be the best interests of this country.  Neither violence nor threats of violence will alter that stance.  Only those who wish to bring the democratic institutions of this State into disrepute can hope to gain by suggestions that Fianna Fáil will bow to the violence of the bombers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must admit that some superficial credence may have been given to those suggestions by reference to the attitude of the Fine Gael Party when in 1972 they vigorously opposed the <Col N="2233" /> Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act and then cravenly changed course after the bombs went off in Dublin.  I viewed that <i>volte face</i> at that time with the utmost contempt and I still do.  What must be understood, however, is that Fianna Fáil, which is the major party in this country, are made of sterner stuff.  No bomber is going to stampede us.  That is one of the many differences between Fianna Fáil and this Coalition and it is also one of the reasons why our people know that in a real emergency they can depend on Fianna Fáil but not on the Coalition.</P>
    <P>We had peculiar criticism of the Fianna Fáil restatement of policy in regard to Northern Ireland.  I say &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; because it was impossible to pin it down with any degree of certainty or precision.  I challenged any spokesman on behalf of the Government to say with what portion of that statement he or the Government disagree. Nobody did so except, perhaps, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whose objections seemed to be to its timing.  He is entitled to his views, as is anybody else, on the question of timing, but I would suggest that the manner in which it was misrepresented suggests that there was a great deal more substance in the objections made to that policy than a question of timing.  It is significant that no objection of substance to that policy has been forthcoming from the Government. I would suggest also that the threats which are now emanating from loyalist circles in the North to the effect that they will not go back to the Convention in any circumstances show how relevant the Fianna Fáil policy in regard to Northern Ireland is and how irrelevant and even dangerous is the Government's low profile policy, as the Taoiseach called it, which is, I suggest, a euphemism for no policy.</P>
    <P>The whole performance of the Government over most of their areas of activity has been inept, to say the least.  Even the relatively minor matter of getting under way studies of cross-Border economic co-operation with the assistance of the European Economic Community has been mishandled <Col N="2234" /> and delayed for a very long time.  Only very recently there was an announcement in this regard and that announcement was, in substance, what the British Government had indicated they were willing to do at least a year ago.  That virtually is what has emerged from all the talk and all the delays, and I suggest it is another example, small, perhaps, but typical, of the ineptitude with which the problem with which this Government are faced is handled.  The Taoiseach, speaking in this debate, said, and I am quoting from his script as issued:</P>
    <P>We in Government have, as strongly as anyone in this House, an aspiration to see the unification of our island, but we see just as clearly that this cannot be brought about by violence.</P>
    <P>That last statement, that it cannot be brought about by violence, is, of course, re-echoing the Fianna Fáil statement of policy in regard to the North.  The first part of it I am afraid I must beg leave to doubt.  I would not have doubted it some years ago, but I do now.  I am not going to go into all the evidence as to why it should be doubted except to remind the House of the notorious statement by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to the effect that he was not actively working for Irish unity.  That statement was not repudiated by the Taoiseach or the Government, and we must assume, therefore, and, indeed, the general stance of the Government would entitle us to assume, that it represents this Coalition Government's approach to the whole question of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It does not represent the Fianna Fáil approach, and I want to make that perfectly clear.  We are actively seeking Irish unity, knowing the problems and abjuring violence as a method of achieving it.  However, we are certainly not prepared to agree that the matter should be forgotten or left in abeyance.  We believe that all the thinking and all the activities of an Irish Government should be directed actively to seeking Irish unity, because, apart from anything else, we believe it is in the best interests of all <Col N="2235" /> the people of Ireland, North and South.  I notice that the Taoiseach also stated in his speech today:</P>
    <P>We have also gone a long way towards making our courts more effective in the struggle against violence, and where there are defects or shortcomings in their operation, we have shown ourselves ready to remedy them.</P>
    <P>That is an interesting statement by the Taoiseach.  It is in line with the general stance of this Government of trying to paint the members of this Government as being devoted law and order men and to paint the Opposition as being very doubtful law and order men.  Of course, the facts do not bear that out.  The facts are that it was Fianna Fáil who set up the Special Criminal Court.  The facts are that it was Fianna Fáil who enacted the 1972 amendment of the Offences Against the State Act, two of the major weapons on which this Government are relying to deal with subversion.  We did it in the teeth of the opposition of the men over there, including the members of the Government and those behind them.</P>
    <P>It was Fianna Fáil who enacted the Forcible Entry Bill in the teeth of their opposition, and it is a very poor commentary on the stance of any Government in relation to law and order that you can have a situation in which there are something like 700 squatters in Dublin Corporation dwellings today, that there are cases on record of people going out to funerals, going out to shop, and coming back and finding their furniture out on the road and squatters in; that a whole protection racket is growing up in the city of Dublin whereby gangsters are doing this and are collecting rent from those squatters they put in, and using violence and force to achieve their aims; and nothing appears to be done about it by this so-called law and order Government.  I wonder whether it is due to political difficulties that they are facing in operating the Forcible Entry Act, which they opposed so vehemently and which they now know was so necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2236" /> I want to turn now to one aspect of the economy referred to by the Taoiseach and of particular concern to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is, I understand, going to reply to this debate on behalf of the Government. The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>Satisfactory agreements were recently concluded by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with private mining interests for the exploitation of the Navan lead/zinc ore body and the question of maximising the the amount of processing of the ores in question in this country, whether by smelting or other activities, is being methodically pursued.</P>
    <P>I understand there have been certain technological developments whereby a chemical process can be used in place of what we know as smelting but, at the moment, at any rate, it operates only in relation to copper and has not been sufficiently developed to operate in relation to lead or zinc.  If that is what the Taoiseach had in mind when he said &ldquo;or other activities&rdquo;, I understand it.  If it is not, perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce would elaborate on it.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Taoiseach had in mind, we are entitled to ask why is it that, in the granting of those mining leases in respect of that ore body in Tara, no conditions appear to have been imposed and, indeed, no conditions were imposed, which would ensure the operation of a smelter or other activities if there is technologically another way of doing it at the moment.  We all know that this type of operation, particularly a smelter, would make a major economic contribution and would be of great importance in the employment scene.  The non-imposition of such conditions raises large question marks over the Taoiseach's statement that satisfactory agreements were recently concluded.</P>
    <P>If we look at our economy generally, I think we could be forgiven for wincing and looking away again as fast as possible.  Comparing ourselves with our EEC partners, we see a picture of inflation running about three times the level of some of the other EEC countries.  Our unemployment rate is the highest in the EEC.  Incidentally, <Col N="2237" /> I put down a parliamentary question to the Taoiseach recently asking the percentage of the work force unemployed in each of the member countries of the EEC.  I got a reply which set out certain qualifications, and then gave a list in columns.</P>
    <P>The first column was headed &ldquo;Country&rdquo;.  To my amazement, when I counted down there were ten.  I thought there were nine countries in the EEC, but there were ten in this. The tenth one, believe it or not, was Northern Ireland.  The reason was obvious if you looked at one of the other columns.  That was the only one which had a higher rate of unemployment than was shown for this State. Of course, the question was in relation to the member countries and the clear answer was that, amongst the member countries, we in the Republic have the highest percentage of our work force unemployed.</P>
    <P>Inflation and unemployment are, of course, two of the major problems with which we are faced.  Although, perhaps, not so obvious to the general public, borrowing is an even more major problem now under this Government. As the Leader of this party pointed out when speaking in this debate, proportionately we have a far higher rate of borrowing than any of the other countries in the EEC, including even Britain which is considered to be in such a bad way, and which has had to borrow terribly heavily in order to defend sterling. Even allowing for all that, we are way above any of them.</P>
    <P>We also see in this picture of our economy that our industrial exports have fallen between 7 per cent and 8 per cent this year.  Our whole economy has contracted.  Dealing with the economic situation, and describing it as it was by the Government early this year, and the budget which was then introduced, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;We aimed at careful expansion.&rdquo;  In the light of what has happened this year, all I can say is that the Government should take lessons in marksmanship. If an aim at careful expansion produces that kind of result, clearly there is something wrong with the Government's aim.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2238" /> In the January budget of this year, a huge deficit was provided for, estimated at £125 million.  The actual deficit at the end of the year turned out to be about £280 million.  That is an increase of just 125 per cent.  In January of this year, borrowing was estimated at £450 million.  It turned out to be £700 million.  That is an increase of 55 per cent.  What did the Taoiseach say about this?  He said: &ldquo;We adopted a courageous budgetary policy.&rdquo;  I want to suggest that, with the kind of estimating we got in January of this year and, indeed, subsequently in June, either the Government were deliberately cooking the books, or the situation is totally our of control and they have not got a clue at what will happen next.  To underestimate your budget deficit by 125 per cent and your borrowing by 55 per cent is incredible.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has described the position facing us in the coming year and, allowing for cuts, and pay pauses, and so on, he still comes out with a gap to be filled by borrowing and taxation amounting to £1,000 million.  On the basis of the Government's estimate in January of this year, at the end of next year that figure is likely to be £2,250 million. Is there any guarantee that the estimate this year is more accurate than last year's?  If there is such a guarantee, perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce would tell us what it is.  What reason have we to believe that the gap to be closed will remain at or in the region of £1,000 million considering what happened earlier this year?</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago a number of people saw on television or heard on radio the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party boasting&mdash;anybody who saw or heard him would agree that is a fair description of what he was doing; he was boasting&mdash;about the amount of borrowing which this Government have done.  Now, a few weeks later we are told this cannot go on.  Of course we all know it cannot go on.  It is not something to boast about.  The truth is that, since they took office, this Government have deliberately budgeted for deficits <Col N="2239" /> which were economically unjustifiable at a time when the problems were nothing like what they are now.  As a result, they have frittered away our national substance, and now when we really need it, it is not there.  That is nothing to boast about.  The Taoiseach also told us of the situation as it was seen in January this year.</P>
    <P>We expected that the international situation would show some improvement.</P>
    <P>That has been the excuse and the plea of the Government for quite some time.  They were depending on other Governments to do their job, or they were depending on the discovery of oil.  Anything in the hope that something would turn up rather than face the harsh, difficult decisions any Government doing their job are faced with but particularly liable to be faced with in times of international difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce in the past has been fond of trying to pretend that on this side we ignored the existence of international difficulties.  On one occasion when he said this I challenged him to produce from the records of the House one record of a speech by a member of this party suggesting that there were not international difficulties, that the Government had not international difficulties of that kind over and above those normally expected. Of course we were not so unrealistic as to pretend that.  What we have been saying is that faced with these international difficulties the Government failed to take account of them, to take the decisions which would have been difficult, to cope with them, to take the people into their confidence, explaning exactly what the implications would be, for instance, the increase in oil prices: effectively that meant we could have a 3 or 4 per cent growth rate without any increase in our standard of living in order to pay for the increased price of oil.</P>
    <P>But that is not what they did.  They borrowed and they borrowed again and they borrowed again, and now we are all facing the reality we have been <Col N="2240" /> pointing out to the Government all along.  Arising out of the June budget, on a television programme I made a present to the Minister for Finance of the information that there would be no improvement in the international situation as far as our economy was concerned in 1975.  Still at that time he was talking about an improvement at the end of 1975.  Now, for nothing, I will make another present to the Government by telling them there will be virtually no improvement in the international scene as far as we are concerned in 1976.  Please do not base economic policies for this country on the assumption that there will be.  Let us base our economic policies on reality for a change, and if there is an improvement, and if I am wrong, that is a bonus which I am quite sure we can put to good use.</P>
    <P>But let us have no more of this Mr. Micawber approach.  Let us face the reality and work on the basis of the resources we have available to us and not be depending on other Governments to do the job our Government should be doing.  This gambling on improvements in the international scene or on the discovery of oil has to stop.</P>
    <P>The records of the House are littered with our warnings to the Government of what would happen to our economy given the international situation and the Government's approach to it.  I will not bore the House by giving the quotations: they are now well known and it has been well established that we told the Government from the beginning what would happen, we told them the consequences of their actions or inactions, and now unfortunately it has come to pass.  From the beginning and in their first budget this Government indulged in wild taxation increases directly increasing the cost of living and fuelling inflation.  I commented during a previous budget debate on the contributions by the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Finance and Foreign Affairs.  They had posed the problem of what the Government were faced with in regard to expenditure and receipts, and the possible courses open, and they ended up purporting to justify what they had done in the way of a deficit.  I said that not one of them <Col N="2241" /> mentioned as a possible line of approach the pruning of Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be misrepresented again in regard to deficit budgeting.  I have pointed out that I was the first Minister for Finance in the history of the State to budget for a deficit and I pointed out in regard to previous budgets that deficits are justified, but it is the size of the deficit and what you do with the money that is important. If you put it to productive use, good, but if you do not and if you simply use it to pay ordinary day to day expenses you are deliberately fuelling inflation, much more so than any workers making wage demands, than any business people seeking price rises. It is a deliberate mathematical result of the Government's budgeting for a deficit over and above the extent to which they can put the money to productive use and the capacity of the economy to grow.</P>
    <P>We pointed that out to the Government at the time but now, ignoring that, we are faced with the consequences which if they could be put down to one single cause would be inflation which has caused the situation in which we have had this enormous borrowing.  It has caused a great deal of our unemployment, which will grow.  It will cause a lot more trouble for us unless we get it under control.</P>
    <P>Getting inflation under control is no easy matter: there is no magic wand and it cannot be done overnight or in one or two years.  I freely acknowledge that and I have never suggested otherwise.  But getting inflation under control requires a determination on the part of the Government that they will do it, and it requires hard decisions.  It requires saying to the people: &ldquo;Yes, those projects you are urging on us are well worth while and we will certainly undertake them as soon as it becomes possible for us to do so, but to do it now when we cannot pay for them would simply have the effect of running down the economy, throwing more people out of work and it would mean that eventually even the essential services <Col N="2242" /> to be provided by the Government would be in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>We are fast approaching that stage, unfortunately, all because the Government refused to face up to hard decisions when they would have been a lot easier than they are now, when they would have effected a lot fewer people and inflicted much less hardship. They would not do it and we are all, but particularly our young people, now paying the price for that profligate approach by the Government.</P>
    <P>Not alone did we tell the Government what was going wrong and what would go wrong as a result of their general economic policies, but we told them precisely what should be done. One area now notorious is in regard to the green £.  The Government dithered in regard to the green £ for something like nine months but eventually they did what we told them should have been done.  The problem was that by adopting the green £ the cost of some basic commodities would be increased, and certainly the cost of living, but the fact is that if they had done what we told them, they would have adopted the green £, they would have introduced subsidies costing about £10 million a year, the cost of living would not have been affected, the great bulk of the articles involved are exported, and the net result to the economy would have been something in the region of £30 million during the time in which they delayed.  However, the whole economy would have benefited, and agriculture, which was going through a bad time, would have benefited considerably, and our growth rate would not have disappeared out of sight.</P>
    <P>The Government did not listen, and eventually, far too late, they took our advice.  They introduced subsidies at a time when the cost of living went up. I suppose the most abject failure and the most inept performance of the Government was in relation to the subsidies, the relief of VAT rates, fares and so on, and tied in with that, the handling of the national pay agreement.  Previously, in September of last year, and indeed before that but specifically in September, we <Col N="2243" /> spelled out what the Government should do in regard to such subsidies and VAT reliefs.  We told them that by doing so they would ensure that the Exchequer and business and industry generally would save a very considerable amount of money under the existing national pay agreement, and furthermore, that the new agreement could have been negotiated at a much lower level if the Government had done that.  That was totally ignored in January.</P>
    <P>The Government were aware, when they brought in the January budget, not alone of the logic of what we were saying to them but that the national pay agreement talks would be taking place shortly.  The agreement was concluded in April on the basis of much higher cost of living figures because the Government had not accepted the advice we had offered.  Clearly the problem was becoming enormous.  So, six weeks after that agreement, the Government bring in another budget which did what we had urged them to do.  But they did it after the damage had been done and then asked for renegotiation of the national pay agreement which was not in the terms the Government had sought, terms which were supposed to be a condition for the subsidies.  If ever there was an example of how not to handle a problem it was the Government's whole approach in that regard.  As I have said, it is not as though they did not know what was involved.  We had told them.  Now we are faced with the consequences of that ineptitude.</P>
    <P>I must say I have not a very high opinion of the capacity of the members of the Government, but even so the mishandling of that whole situation was incredible.  I do not know how it was so badly mishandled with such dreadful results for our whole economy.  The position is that we have reached a stage when according to the Taoiseach we are faced with a gap to be closed by borrowing and taxation of £1,000 million.  If that is estimated on the same basis as last year it would be £2,250 million.  Let us assume it is £1,000 million.  The <Col N="2244" /> extent of the deficit which this Government have allowed to grow up, the gap between Government expenditure and receipts, is now so great that it may well mean there will be no real increase in expenditure on things like education and health for quite a number of years because that gap has got to be closed.  Even the Government acknowledge that we cannot go on as we have been going.</P>
    <P>If that enormous gap is there and if there are limitations on borrowing, and there are, and if there are limitations on the amount we can raise by way of taxation, and there are, where will the money come from for real increases in expenditure on such things as education and health?  I suggest that that is mortgaging the future well-being of our people over and above the mortgaging involved in our enormous borrowing and having to pay it back.  It is another aspect of the mortgaging of the future in which this Government have engaged.</P>
    <P>We have had some suggestions as to how this problem might be solved. When things get really difficult, there is always somebody who has an easy remedy, to wave a magic wand.  In this case the man with the magic wand is Senator Halligan, the general secretary of the Labour Party.  His magic wand is to break the link with sterling.  I should like if the Minister for Industry and Commerce would tell us whether the general secretary of the Labour Party, in talking about breaking the link with sterling, is talking for the Labour Party or for himself. Do the Labour members of the Government subscribe to the views he expresses?  If they do not, do they think it is helpful to have a man in his position propounding these views?</P>
    <P>Of course the truth is that while we may well reach a stage where it could be advantageous to us to break the link with sterling&mdash;I think we are getting closer to that, certainly closer than we were a few years ago&mdash;we are not at it yet.  But supposing we were, there is one aspect of this matter which has been very carefully glossed over.  It is that if we were to break the link with sterling the discipline we would have to exercise in the conduct <Col N="2245" /> of our economy would be such that Senator Halligan would run a mile from it.  Certainly this Government would be in no position to produce deficits of the order they have been producing if we broke the link with sterling.  Certainly, any failure to do so would result in the most appalling unemployment and lowering of the standard of living of the great majority of our people without that discipline.  For Senator Halligan, in his position as secretary of the Labour Party, to talk about breaking the link with sterling while he supports fully members of the Labour Party in a Government totally lacking in discipline is either ignorance or hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>One of the casualties of the Government's mishandling of the situation is the provision of equal pay for women.  I want to put it to the House that the economic and financial circumstances inducing the Government to go back on the legislation passed in this House in regard to equal pay were well known to the Government a long time ago and that the Minister for Labour has been deliberately bluffing his way through, up to the last minute, pretending that he was introducing equal pay when he knew, as did his colleagues, that he was not going to be able to do it.  The discovery of the problems involved did not, I hope, occur to the Government within the last week or two.  If they did, then the situation is even worse than I suspect.</P>
    <P>One of the major remedies proposed by the Government to deal with the situation with which we are now faced is a standstill in pay.  The Taoiseach said in his brief, from which I quote:</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear now that it is the intention of the Government, if agreement on a pay pause is reached, to introduce legislation providing for restraint in non-pay income, including dividends, directors' fees and rents similar to that which would apply to pay under the present agreement and the pause.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask, if the Taoiseach makes that conditional, as he does, on agreement on a pay pause <Col N="2246" /> being reached, what if agreement on a pay pause is not reached?  Then what do the Government propose to do?  Do they propose to restrain non-pay income, as described by the Taoiseach? Do they propose to restrain pay income?  If they do not, do they propose to let everything rip?  I believe the time has passed when the Government can afford to indulge in this kind of play-acting.  It is much too serious and the Government must take people fully into their confidence. They have gone some of the way in spelling out some of the stark economic facts with which we are faced but I suggest they should go the whole way, say precisely what they intend doing and give the lead. In the long run it is not the duty of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association or anybody else to make decisions as to what is going to be done about our economic problems, huge as they are.  That responsibility rests clearly on the Government.  They may consult all they like with those people and others but the decisions have to be made by the Government and the responsibility is that of the Government.  Whether those people agree with them or not, that responsibility rests on the Government.</P>
    <P>Ultimately what is at stake here is the relationship between the Government of the day and the people.  These various interest groups are important but they are not the people, they are only sections of the people, and a lot of people are not represented by them.  The people as a whole are entitled to be told what the Government intend doing.  They are entitled to get a lead from the Government. They are entitled to be told by the Government what they want them to do and be encouraged by the Government to follow that lead.  That is the role of Government.  That is a role this Government have singularly failed to play up to now.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have had White Papers; we have had talks about national partnership, a lot of high sounding phrases over a year ago, but <Col N="2247" /> the situation has got steadily worse. We cannot afford that any more.  We need action.  We need to know what action the Government propose taking and intend to make stick, because the time has passed for any other approach.</P>
    <P>There was a most interesting phrase, to me anyway, in the Taoiseach's statement, and it was this:</P>
    <P>Without investment and the profits that come from it there is no future for this country.  In today's world they are, in the end, the means by which employment is created and sustained.</P>
    <P>I would agree with that fully.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance stated recently in my hearing that the problem we must tackle now is expansion of the private sector.  He is right.  Compare that approach with that of a Government which set out, apparently deliberately, to sap all confidence in the private sector, to give an impression that they did not want to see the private sector thrive and prosper.  In particular, compare it with the approach of a Government which introduced a totally irrelevant wealth tax in this country, which I suspect is not going to yield very much, but which did a great deal to sap the confidence of the very people on whom the Taoiseach says we depend, on whom jobs and growth depend and, what is worse, did it in such a way as to penalise Irish people as against foreigners who show any enterprise and initiative in this country.</P>
    <P>I suggest that is another example of the total ineptitude of this Government. In my view we would be far better off to have a full-blooded Socialist, even virtually a Communist Government, in the economic sense, than to have this kind of nonsense from this Government, where they pretend, on the one hand, to operate alleged socialist principles, on the basis of alleged equity and, on the other, tell us about the importance of private enterprise while killing it.  The Government ought to make up their minds where they think the salvation of our economy lies.  If they think, as <Col N="2248" /> the Taoiseach says, that it lies in investment and profits, then let the Government gear their policies to encouragement of investment and profits, getting them ploughed into our economy, not frighten them out of the country.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach made his announcement on radio and television in regard to the appalling state of our economy, we through the Leader of our party, outlined some steps that should be taken.  Pay restraint is necessary, of course.  We certainly would not dispute that.  Indeed without it there is no hope, I would say, for the future of our economy.  But pay restraint requires a good deal more, if it is to work, than simply people on wages and salaries not getting any increase in 1976.</P>
    <P>The Government must be restrained. They must restrain their spending and their borrowing to match the restraint they are seeking from the workers.  A great deal of our difficulty is due to the failure of the Government to restrain themselves. Of course there are political kudos in spending money.  There are political kudos, if you can get away with it, in borrowing money and dishing it out here, there and everywhere.</P>
    <P>There are great political difficulties in restraining Government expenditure. I know.  I went through it.  I was Minister for Finance and I know what has to be done and I know how unpopular a Minister for Finance has sometimes to make himself with his colleagues and, indeed, with the general public.  Failure to exercise restraint is totally irresponsible for not just the Minister for Finance and his colleagues but for every man, woman and child in the country who has to pay ultimately.</P>
    <P>Restraint by the Government in their spending and in their borrowing is necessary.  Furthermore, we suggest that great care and restraint has to be exercised by the Government in regard to any additional taxes that may be imposed or increased charges for services under Government control. Regard has to be had to the impact of such things on the cost of living.  An <Col N="2249" /> effort has to be made to direct spending under Government control into productive purposes, into the creation or the maintenance of jobs because, unless we can get growth back into our economy, the economy will continue to contract with more people being thrown out of work, more people depending on a smaller national cake.</P>
    <P>That is what is happening at the moment and, to reverse it, you have got to get growth into the economy. We will get no growth in the short term certainly from any State activities. The private sector, as the Minister for Finance has said, and now the Taoiseach, is the one we are depending on to get growth back in the economy.  Let the Government bear that in mind in their approach to trying to solve the problems they have themselves largely created. There are areas, such as house building, mining, shipbuilding, footwear and textiles and other areas where judicious policies and judicious expenditure by the Government would yield far greater returns than the investment involved.  That is the kind of thing that ought to be in the Government's mind.  Above all, what is needed is realistic economic planning. We have been urging the Government for at least two years to give us some kind of realistic economic plan and for a long time the Minister for Finance told us there was no need for it&mdash;things were too uncertain.  Then he made noises to the effect that, perhaps, it could be done.  Then he said they would have something by the end of the year.  We are very close to that now&mdash;the Dáil is about to adjourn&mdash; and we still have not got anything approaching a realistic economic plan.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister for Finance really means a word of what he says.  Something may be produced but I rather suspect it will be something like the White Paper on National Partnership, a whole lot of window dressing with no reality in it. Maybe I am wrong.  I hope I am but, for God's sake, let us get it and get it soon.  I do not want, and I hope I will not, to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce telling us that we urged no deficit in the budget <Col N="2250" /> or that we would have thrown a whole lot of people out of work because we would not have had the huge deficits this Government have had because what has put so many out of work is the inflation which has occurred under this Government and that inflation was deliberately fuelled by the Government. The extent of the borrowing the Government have gone in for and the extent of the deficits on the budget, not related to productive purposes was, as I said earlier, mathematically calculated to produce inflation.  That is where the problem is and, if you did not have that problem, you would not have anything like the unemployment we have today and you would have a chance of competing and increasing our exports as the world economic situation improves.</P>
    <P>For myself, if I had been Minister for Finance presiding over an outcome such as we are faced with today after practically three years in office I certainly would not hesitate.  I would resign recognising clearly that, whatever other qualities I have, I did not have the qualities required of a Minister for Finance.  But I should not single out the Minister for Finance.  I think all of his colleagues, some of them professing to be expert economists, are equally guilty and, if I were in their shoes, I would have a good hard look at the results of my efforts and I would know what the right course in the interests of this country was&mdash;to resign, to get out, and let us get the country moving with some chance of success.</P>

      <P>I want to take up on simple, factual grounds three items that have been referred to, not by backbenchers who might be forgiven as newcomers to the Dáil for saying silly things, but by people who were former Ministers and, in one case, a former Taoiseach.  I want to preface what I have to say by saying that I suppose Irish people have found at various times, dealing with other countries, that we are offended because we are not taken seriously, because we are Paddies, because we are funny chaps, nice to have a drink with, but not meticulous about facts and not meticulous in carrying out our work.  This is a national slander that has offended us from time to time and, therefore, I hate to hear it pushed here in this House with almost lightheartedness.  I would beg people to please be serious, to please do their homework.  We have had some very shocking examples, to my mind, of the contrary from people here who ought to know better.  I bring this in because it relates to major things and here I want to try to set the record straight in regard to national growth, to inflation and to investment&mdash;all major things.</P>
      <P>In the speech made earlier in the debate by the Leader of the Opposition he said&mdash;I cannot give a reference since the Official Report is not printed yet&mdash;that in terms of lack of national growth we are twice worse off than any other EEC country.  That is a specific and a serious charge and I want to indicate that it is wildly wrong but I will indicate this by way of outside statistics, mostly by way of OECD reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This charge, from a man who was Taoiseach and who at one stage held the office which I hold now, is extraordinary. The December, 1975, OECD Forecast of Industrial Production has become available and gives figures for <Col N="2252" /> the whole year.  If these figures should be wrong in respect of one country they would be wrong in relation to others but I shall quote the figures for eight countries.  Luxembourg is not included. We are told that the estimated fall in industrial production for eight Community countries, including Ireland, was as follows: Belgium, 9 per cent, Denmark 8 per cent, The Netherlands, 6 per cent, Italy, 10 per cent, France, 9½ per cent, Germany, 7¼ per cent, the UK&mdash;the lowest&mdash;5 per cent and, the next lowest, Ireland at 5½ per cent.  To be told in these circumstances that we are twice worse off than any other Community country when we are second best is not traducing this Government but traducing the industry of this nation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take up my own area of responsibility, industrial production, and here again my source is the OECD and their report of the main economic indicators for 1975.  They give figures for industrial growth for the Community countries taking the year of 1970 as a base line of 100. From the various quarterly figures available I have chosen the fourth quarter of 1973 because that was the quarter during which the oil crisis <Col N="2253" /> began.  Also, it happened to be shortly after we came into office.  We have not yet got the figure for the third quarter of 1975 so for this year I have chosen the second quarter.  Taking all nine countries the best performance of any country for the fourth quarter of 1973, compared with 1970 was an increase by France from 100 to 122 while our increase in that time was from 100 to 120 leaving us joint third.  If you take that increase to the end of the second quarter of 1975 and still taking 1970 as 100, we are first in the list of the nine Community countries.  The figures are, Belgium, 107, France, 111, Germany, 103, Ireland, 116, Italy, 106, Luxembourg, 92, The Netherlands, 114 and UK, 101.  Yet, an ex-Taoiseach and Minister for Industry and Commerce traduces the economy of this country by saying that in terms of lack of national growth we are twice worse than any other EEC country. This is an example of the twisted figures which are due either to profound malice or profound ignorance or, possibly, to a mixture of both.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of inflation rates.  There is a habit on the part of the Opposition whereby, regardless of whether something is true, they pluck it out and repeat it continuously on the assumption, presumably, that if something is repeated often enough it will be believed.  On the 14th March, 1973, the day on which we took office, Deputy Lynch said, as reported at column 28 of the Official Report for that day:</P>
    <P>The success of these actions on prices and incomes can be judged not alone on the falling off in the rate of inflation, which is now more than 2 per cent below the level of two years ago and still falling,...</P>
    <P>We know about Deputy Lynch's memory but in the previous quarter from mid-November, 1972, to mid-February, 1973, prices had risen, according to the index, by 4 per cent &mdash;from 2 to 6.5, to 235.4, that is, 9.1 points which expressed as a percentage is 4 so that when it was alleged to have gone down by 2 per cent in the previous two years it had increased by 4 per cent in the previous <Col N="2254" /> quarter.  This shows the Opposition's regard for information that is obtainable easily.  However, it might teach some people a lesson about distorting the truth in regard to inflation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan who is not a backbencher and who has had ministerial experience, talking last night about the previous Government's performance, said that prices were rising but that we should remember that in February, 1973 we had a modest 3 per cent per annum inflation rate.  The figure was 10 per cent.  It was 4 per cent in the previous quarter.  Why twist the truth in such an irresponsible way?</P>
    <P>We do not measure monthly in this country; we measure quarterly.  In the quarter to mid-August, 1975, there was a decline of .8 per cent and in the quarter to mid-November, 1975, there was an increase of 2.8 per cent.  Taken over a half year, you add the two and find an increase of 2 per cent.  That is one of the lowest rates in Europe. It is evidence that the package of June, 1975, which was a firing of cannon in a very expensive way to try to break the self-accelerating cycle that we got into in the course of 1974 from external causes, was successful. The evidence of the two quarters since then is that that cycle is breaking and that people are behaving in a responsible way.  In 1974 inflation was generated externally but in 1975 it was beginning to be generated internally by exploding wage costs.  Now we are finding great maturity and great restraint on the part of trade unionists and the people about a halt in the expansion of consumption to which we had become accustomed.</P>
    <P>We find that the past figures and the present figures are distorted about the real performance.  I do not suppose this is a specific piece of wickedness to drive people crazy so that restraint will not work.  It is only silly, trivial, half-wicked and irresponsible, but it has that effect.  I am quoting examples of a way in which an Opposition are producing an end result that I am sure they do not want.  I am not accusing them of that, but they are doing it out of silliness and incompetence and, above all, out of a lightheartedness in <Col N="2255" /> regard to readily available factual things.</P>
    <P>I am not picking up the remarks of Fianna Fáil backbenchers; I am commenting on remarks of former Ministers who should know better.  Last night at 10 p.m. Deputy Lalor made a point that the cost per job for new industrial projects in 1975 was £18,800 and for domestic industry it was £23,000 per new job.  He then went on to compare this with when he was Minister.  He should know about this because it is something a Minister for Industry and Commerce has to deal with.  He said the cost per job was between £2,000 and £3,000.  What is so shocking and worrying is that he is mixing the total fixed asset investment on the one hand with the amount of grant on the other hand. His figures for total investment are about right but our figures for grants are between £3,000 and £4,000&mdash;a little bit more than when he was in office but comparable.  This is such basic silliness that one is terrified for an Opposition that can get themselves into such a mess.  One is terrified for the effects they can have not through specific villainy but by sheer silliness on the balance and morale of an economy at a difficult time.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with another matter that relates to my Department and which also relates to basic economic policy for the country, where some specific charges were made recently, because the effort is being made, I think irresponsibly, to promulgate the impression that we as a Government are, and specifically that I, as a Minister, am indifferent on the matter of choice between the use of Irish products and non-Irish products, that I really do not care where the products come from.  It was not my initiative but that of a group I set up a year ago that, for the first time, in the history of the country, we have a serious, intelligent, well-thought out and well-executed programme for the promotion of Irish goods.  However, that is an aside.  I want to deal with specific charges that suggest that we are lightheartedly using foreign products when Irish ones are available.</P>
    <P>I was charged by Deputy Brennan <Col N="2256" /> earlier today with insulting and slandering a firm&mdash;I shall not name it but it is known to both of us&mdash;in regard to the erection of a particular piece of the NET plant at Marino Point. He said I had been inaccurate and had slandered people and he asked me to withdraw what I said.  I have checked what I said.  I did not slander them; the facts were as I stated.  When we are choosing between a product to go into a piece of high technology like the plant using the natural gas at Marino Point we must think of the jobs of Irish workers doing the construction work.  However, we must also think of the jobs of Irish workers working there and the well-being of the people who are depending on the production of that plant.  If we force particular firms&mdash;assuming that such were possible either in the law of the country or of the Community, and it is not possible&mdash;to use a piece of technology that was not the best available, or to distort their best economic and technological decisions, then we would be jeopardising the health of that company and the future of the people working there.  We were specifically accused by Deputy Fitzgerald of using foreign steel in the NET plant.  That accusation is not true.  NET have insisted on Irish steel in that context but it did not stop the Deputy making his remark in the same kind of mischievous way that I have indicated has characterised the use of statistics earlier.</P>
    <P>There was also an effort in regard to Verolme shipyard.  I saw the Verolme workers two days ago.  We had an amicable, sensible and calm meeting and we agreed that when these matters were made political footballs everyone suffers.  What we are doing in regard to Verolme, far from threatening the future of the shipyard, is guaranteeing its economic health and its future.  It is bad for the jobs of any sector if we force people into uneconomic activities, into activities that are not competitive with other countries, and which are too expensive <i>vis-á-vis</i> other competitors in a free trade association.  All one does by those sort of actions is to jeopardise the future of that section of the economy, to dig a hole in the ground into which one throws money <Col N="2257" /> forever.  If one builds a fundamentally false economic situation the jobs in such a plant are in threat forever.  It is good for nobody to do that.</P>
    <P>I have said something about price increases in the recent past, about the evidence that there is an ebbing, about the effect of our package of measures last summer.  Now I want to return to the responsibilities of my Department and the National Prices Commission with regard to price control because it seems they are often misunderstood and criticised wrongly on the basis of this lack of understanding.</P>
    <P>First, let me make it clear that both trade unions and consumers are represented on the National Prices Commission and when I implement a recommendation from the NPC I do it on the basis that it comes from them unanimously and that it expresses the consideration of consumer and trade union interests in that recommendation. Secondly, the tightrope the NPC have to walk every day is the one I have to walk.  It is the tightrope where if you fall off the threat on one hand is that prices rise too rapidly and inflation disrupts society, but on the other hand that you screw down prices so tight that nobody can make a profit and you produce bankruptcy and unemployment. It is necessary to balance on that tight rope, not falling off in the direction of increases which are not permissible but not falling off in the other direction which would refuse increases which are essential for the economic health of the particular firm or planning.  If that balance is not kept, one can destroy employment and one can deny to people the profits they need to re-equip to retain efficiency and, therefore, to guarantee the future of the enterprise.</P>
    <P>We recently altered the terms of price control in response to the circumstances which now exist and a rise of 2.8 per cent in the last quarter was a very low rise in terms of the past and in terms of other Community countries.  We have intense competition in the country at the moment in certain sectors, we have very low profit rates and that competition is a very effective traditional brake on price rises.  We have drawn <Col N="2258" /> off the forces of price control from people we were pursuing at all levels of the scale and are concentrating our surveillant mechanism on to the big firms which are the dominant fish in each pond.  That is not a dismantling of price control.  It is a sharpening of it so that we target it most effectively.</P>
    <P>I do not want to have a circumstance where we make absolutely binding terms for every sector of the economy, every shop, wholesale, distribution and retail.  I do not want to disrupt people.  I do not want to take people to court.  I want the price mechanism to work but I also want to target the efforts of my inspectorate so that they produce the maximum effect.  That is what we have done.</P>
    <P>I want to say something on the European Community because I do not think we discussed it very much in the House.  This is an Adjournment debate not at the end of the Irish Presidency but at the end of another half year of very active Community activities.  I particularly make reference to the Community and our role in it in the light of a specific reference by the Leader of the Opposition.  He referred to my criticism of the Community in a speech I made last summer.  There is an effort to suggest that Ireland is not effective in the Community, is not pulling her weight, is missing opportunities. I want to say it, firstly, because he is not here and, secondly, because it is obviously true, that in the Minister for Foreign Affairs we have a leader of Ireland's activities in the Community who has won&mdash;anybody who reads the newspapers fairly will recognise this&mdash;an extraordinary admiration for his own abilities and vigour but also an admiration for the role of Ireland. It is fair to say that largely due to his efforts but also due to the efforts of other Ministers and the staff of various departments, the estimation of Ireland in the Community has altered from one where in the past they thought that, perhaps, we were charming but were not quite serious to an estimation of us now where they take us as a mature, effective, serious, practical, and vigorous country.</P>
    <P>I see no fault, no defect and no contradiction in other Ministers or I <Col N="2259" /> criticising the Community very severely.  In spring, 1972 we had a referendum and we had the good fortune to get a clear result.  It will be four years since then by the time the next anniversary comes around.  I accept that result wholeheartedly as do the Labour Party.  We know we identified many of these defects correctly. We know that the Community was oversold in Ireland in a sort of euphoria where it had no warts at all. We believe we served a useful democratic purpose in raising that debate and in raising it on the correct issues. We believe our criticisms have stood up well to the experience of almost four years.  When that is said, I want to be absolutely explicit that we are in the Community and from the moment we went in my task as Minister, because of the trade and commerce bit, in my Department but with other Ministers of the Labour Party is to reform that Community, to humanise it, to make it work and to force the changes which are necessary because of the inadequacies we pointed out.</P>
    <P>I do not believe anybody looking at the Community will pretend now that the warts are not there, that the mechanisms are satisfactory or, indeed, that the Community is not in very serious difficulties in certain ways and is not in need of reform, humanisation and of pushing forward.  Our position is not alone that it needs reform in pushing forward but it is also the position that what is needed most specifically is the strengthening of the central institution as a protection against the great countries which would seek to rule the Community alone without letting the little ones in.  The dangerous thing in the Community seems to me to be the axis of Schmidt, Giscard and Wilson and leaving out other countries so that they cannot be heard through the proper democratic mechanism.  Our efforts are entirely constructive.</P>
    <P>That needs to be said because of the efforts to present them otherwise as negative or destructive.  I believe it is no harm to put it on the record that one of the things one has to learn to do in politics, as in life, is to learn to <Col N="2260" /> lose wholeheartedly.  As far as I am concerned, when the referendum results came in May, 1972 I lost wholeheartedly. I am now concerned wholeheartedly in Community reform in the directions I have said.</P>
    <P>I also want to say a few words about the Industrial Development Authority because in the present economic difficulties the role of the IDA is very central and because I have heard from Deputies from the Opposition, in private and also in a debate very recently on the IDA Bill, and through the ordinary bush telegraph channels that exist all over the country, criticisms of the IDA which seem to me to be unfounded and damaging.  That is not to say that the IDA are beyond criticism or the need for reform.  There seems to be a sort of persecution feeling being fostered that Irish people who want industrial development are not treated as well as foreign people, that the IDA, the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Government prefer to create a job by foreign investment than to create it by Irish investment, that Irish entrepreneurs or Irish firms coming forward do not get a fair crack of the whip. That feeling, which is a sort of paranoid, is a travesty of the truth.  The truth is that through many schemes, the small industries scheme and our recently announced project identification scheme, which is working very well and about which I will give more information, and the general attitude and policies at all levels of the IDA, where there is favouring done it is favouring of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The sequel to the thought, which is particularly dangerous, that Irish people or Irish firms are differentiated against is an effort to try to write a statutory limit, as was done in an amendment from Deputy O'Malley a few days ago, which he did not move, to the percentage of what would go to overseas firms.  If we were in the middle of a boom, where we had five projects for every £ we had to spend, I would see very powerful argument for channelling the great bulk of our efforts towards Irish industry, towards indigenous industry.  The position we are in now is that, firstly, we cannot get enough sound Irish projects coming forward and, secondly, in the middle of a <Col N="2261" /> depression I will support industrial jobs provided they are sound projects wherever they come from.</P>
    <P>I do not have to choose between Irish and foreign projects; I am glad to maximise both in hard times.  I shall refer to the IDA's statistical performance in a moment.  It is one that they and the country can be proud of.  My point is that this growth of xenophobia in a depression is spreading insecurity.  I am not inventing this; it has been said to me by overseas industrialists: &ldquo;Are we not welcome any more?&rdquo; That sort of xenophobia can damage what exists and hamper&mdash; for instance, if we had passed that amendment&mdash;the job creation activities of the IDA.  It is unnecessary at this stage because the problem is to get sound projects coming forward in sufficient numbers from Ireland. No sound project from Ireland will be unanswered in financial terms.  If there has to be any pleading that we cannot proceed with the project because we have not the money for the grant, it will be said in regard to the foreign ones, not the Irish ones which have first call.  In fact, at this time there is no conflict.</P>
    <P>I must say that there are people going around saying: &ldquo;They would not help me&rdquo;.  There are circumstances where the IDA do not help.  For example, I had a parliamentary question today about why the IDA were not helping a particular industry in the concrete products area.  If you help a particular industry you must think of all the jobs in all the other plant in the same industry.  There are areas where there is over-capacity where the IDA will not give aid.  Since moneys spent on industrial promotion come from the taxes of all the people they have to be spent with probity.  The IDA have a good record.  I have encouraged them to be a little more risk-taking because I certainly will not reproach them if they make an occasional mistake. There is no way in which we can ensure that they will have no errors.  It is not possible to make selections with total certainty.  Their track record is very good for staying away from duds, but if people come forward without proper management experience, <Col N="2262" /> proper quantification of the project, with something dreamed up on the back of an envelope which is not real and serious.  I will sustain the IDA in refusing those sort of projects from wherever they come because we cannot have circumstances where public money is wasted.</P>
    <P>I want to say something in the context of the world economy about the IDA's performance.  Recently, I heard Opposition speakers making dramatic contrast between the effectiveness of their industrial promotion in their time in office and the way we are driving away investment, saying that we are against private industry and profits and that we are damaging the whole atmosphere so much economically that the work of the IDA is made impossible and the whole thrust of our industrial investment programme is being rendered completely ineffective.  I shall give figures for new jobs at full production from projects approved over a series of financial years including one nine-month period&mdash;because we changed the basis of the financial year &mdash;and also the terms of the IDA financial commitment and the amount of the fixed asset investment.</P>
    <P>When we talk about new jobs it means the total new jobs in a project. The project can be approved within a certain period but all those jobs do not come on stream necessarily within that period.  I want to make that clear. But all the figures I give from one year to another are comparable, all spread downstream from the year in which the decision was taken.  Projected new jobs at full production for 1970-71 were 12,487; for 1971-72, 8,734; for 1972-73, 14,139; for 1973-74, 23,316; for the nine months to December, 1974, which was a short year, 19,818.  In that nine months it was not the carry-over of the previous Government because we were well into our term of office then and in that nine months there were more jobs than in any 12 months of the time when the Opposition were in office.  In 1975, in the middle of the worst depression for 40 years, the number is 17,000.  That is well down on 1973-74 and it is well down on a 12-month basis on the nine months of <Col N="2263" /> 1974, but it is more than in any year during the Opposition's time in office. I think that is very creditable for the people concerned.  It is a statistical answer to the sort of thing that I heard Deputy Colley say an hour ago&mdash;and he said it with more polish perhaps than many of his colleagues from whom there was the same sort of suggestion&mdash;that we were wrecking the IDA's job creation effort because we had created a bad environment.  I think the figures are the answer.  They speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>I could talk in terms of the money committed which has continued to increase&mdash;that is State money committed. I could talk about the total of fixed asset investment which, I agree with Deputy Colley, is an extremely important figure, and that has continued to increase.  Let me give an example: in 1970-71 it was £94.7 million; in the nine months to December, 1974, fixed asset investment was £287 million&mdash;nearly three times higher in nine months than it had been for a whole 12 months three years previously. People may not like the conclusions I am drawing but those are the figures and they represent the vigour, maturity and strength of our economy which I am bound to say I am proud of as coping very well with very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have said it before but let me say it again and we might reach a consensus on all sides of the House to say it to everybody in the country because there is a sort of romantic double-think that we can be very realistic during the day; then, when we have had a few beers and we sing a few &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; songs that it does not much matter what we do after dark from the point of view of the economy.  I want to give figures that are at best a guess; they do not purport to be absolutely accurate; it is not a sphere in which you could be entirely accurate but I hope to indicate to everybody in the country and&mdash;I have no words to describe the category of people I want to include because the word republican has been so prostituted in debate but if I use it in inverted commas I suppose they will understand <Col N="2264" /> themselves&mdash;the romantic &ldquo;republians&rdquo; who believe that physical force methods are a means of solving Ireland's problems, what that has cost us; some parts we can quantify; some parts we cannot.</P>
    <P>In extra public expenditure from 1969 to now it is about £80 million for various sorts of security, perhaps a little more or less.  The current annual extra expenditure is about £25 million&mdash;what could we not do, what could not each individual do with £25 million?  As regards the indirect cost, in tourism we have lost the equivalent of one year's tourism since 1969; we have lost some industrial investment and lost some growth.  We have areas in which it is very hard to get investment because of the security situation. Because of the fears of overseas investors we have lost something like £300 million.  If one does compound interest on the security expenditures and other losses since 1969 to bring them to current figures, it is something in the region of £400 million and £500 million.  That is a vast sum of money capable of transforming the whole economic environment.  It has always seemed to me that the greatest argument one can offer to people you are asking to join you is to say: &ldquo;Look, we are richer than you; we are better off; we do things better&rdquo;. That is a very powerful argument. Yet, that £500 million is the difference between being poorer and being a good deal richer.  Apart from other arguments&mdash;arguments of humanity, hatred of brutalisation, hatred of death, destruction and cruelty&mdash;I wish they would ponder on the economic argument also.</P>
    <P>I am not going to anticipate a budget speech.  The budget date is known and it will be discussed very soon after we reassemble.  But I want to say something about the general line of policy in regard to budgeting in our period in office.  I know the freedom of Opposition.  I came into this House in Opposition.  I know that substantially one can say almost anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>And did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that different Members of an opposition say things <Col N="2265" /> and even if they are in the same party, they do not have to be reconciled with each other.  I know the discipline of Government is not there.  Even allowing for that, a great deal of the urgings we get from the other side of the House are for more expenditure. If anybody doubts that, let them read parliamentary questions and the supplementaries.  We have then been consistently urged to have less taxation, that we were being too expansionary. The third simultaneous irreconcilable is that we should have less borrowing.  It may seem too simplistic to put it like that, but that, in a very brief form, is the content of the criticism: firstly, that we should be doing more of a rescue aid stimulant kind, secondly, that we should be taxing less, and thirdly, that we should be borrowing less.  When put like that, it is obviously contradictory and silly, but the assaults we have had on our budgetary policy in our period in office have been contradictory and silly.  I could agree sentence by sentence with many of the less extreme things said. I know Deputy Colley is given to a rather inflated form of utterance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not nearly as inflated as the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and excessive forms of words come to him very easily, but he knows that timing is crucial in economic matters.  He knows there is time for stimulation and time for restraint.  It is like the wild illogic: if at one time you are for stimulant and another time you are for restraint, that is inconsistent, why can you not be the same all the time?  Of course it is appropriate to do different things at different times.  What seems to me unanswerable is that in the course of the years since we came to office&mdash; three years in the spring&mdash;had we been less stimulant, less expansionary than we were in the budgets, had we acted according not to our own decision of what was correct but according to the Opposition's criticism at the time, we would have had deeper recession and more unemployment than we have currently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people want to go back and read through those budgets and the debates <Col N="2266" /> they will realise that it is not given to people to get something as delicate as budgeting exactly right.  Anybody with hindsight, especially at a time when all the pundits are wrong and all the economic factors have been pointing in different directions simultaneously, not alone in Ireland but all over the world, can see that the people who claim expert knowledge have been saying contradictory things and have been codded.  Anyone who claims perfection in decision-making is totally wrong. That sort of wisdom is not given to people and it is possible to be wiser afterwards.  The general thrust, the general assessment and the general response to that assessment of each of those budgets was in my view correct, and I believe that any reading of those budgets debates will validate that.</P>
    <P>I want to say a very little not alone about wage policy but general income and consumption policies over the year 1976, because it is absolutely crucial to our economic health.  It is a simplistic and wrong analysis to say in these concise terms: diagnosis&mdash;wages are going up too fast; cures&mdash;stop wages going up.  That is part of the truth but taken by itself it is a dangerous oversimplification.  Let me put it another way.  GNP is declining.  If, when GNP which has in different sectors different slices of the cake, and if when the whole cake is shrinking a little, one particular sector of that cake wants to grow, it can only do so at the expense of the others.  If therefore the various sorts of distribution for spending increase when the GNP is static or shrinking, then the sector of productive reinvestment gets robbed. You are not able to make the cake grow.  You are eating the seed corn and consuming the future if you do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that if you say to people to <Col N="2267" /> control wages and not look for increases in consumption, that is reasonable and, in my opinion, we will get a very mature and reasonable response on that, but it means simultaneously that other forms of distribution are controlled too.  I believe it is possible to do that without damaging investment and the economic health of this country.  That undertaking on behalf of the Government by the Taoiseach yesterday to the effect that the restraint would be shared and borne by all the sectors of the community was a very important one, and was the condition of our having a positive and mature response from the trade union movement, which I believe we are going to get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to stick out my tongue and say &ldquo;boo&rdquo; to the Opposition about by-election results but they are important measures of what the public feel.  Even allowing for all the local conditions one could think of this Government got a very important endorsement in Mayo.  I cannot read it any other way.  It is very reassuring for a Government to find that the people understand in desperately difficult times what we are trying to do and to find that they sustain it.  Because, in the end, strength comes not only from one's own conviction and analysis but <Col N="2268" /> from the support of the people.  They put us here and they are the source of our strength.  We have received the strength and encouragement of their endorsement to a remarkable degree.</P>
    <P>We are going away at this Christmas in desperately difficult times but in times when the division, the uncertainty, the in-fighting, the chaos and the instability are not in the ranks of the Government but in the ranks of the Opposition.  I think that the people of Ireland have demonstrated that they analysed the situation in that way by the Mayo result.  Speaking as a Minister I found that immensely heartening.  We are unified.  I believe this is a hardworking and able Government, but apart from my belief, I am satisfied from the figures that the public think the same.</P>
    <P>We are going into hard times, unified and resolute and, above all, sustained in our policies by the people.  Those three qualities&mdash;unity, resolution and the support of the populace, who understand what we are doing and believe it to be correct&mdash;are the guarantee that we will emerge from the difficulties and I believe, the guarantee that 1976 will be a better year for us than 1975.</P>

However, the school transport scheme is designed to cater for children who are eligible for free transport and the economic deployment of school buses must be arranged by reference to the transport needs of such eligible pupils.  Fare-paying children are catered for only to the extent that space is available for them on the vehicle when the eligible children have been accommodated.</P>

      <P>In regard to a national processing scheme for recruitment of students, I informed the House on 22nd October, 1975, that An Bord Altranais, who are the responsible body for nurse training in this country,, were not in favour of such a procedure They did, however, consider that some modification of the existing practice was desirable by, for example, grouping hospitals on a regional basis in such a way as to give each training hospital a say in the selection process.</P>

As a result of recent relaxations of the means test, a widow with a war pension of less than £14 a week, and no other means, would qualify for a partial old age pension and, provided she was otherwise qualified, for the free electricity allowance and TV licence.</P>

      <P>In my reply of 8th April, 1975, to a question from the Deputy I pointed out that I was not aware of any advantages which would accrue to social welfare recipients if my Department should be decentralised on a county basis.  Further consideration has not altered my position in this matter.</P>

      <P>Weekly unemployment stattistics compiled by the local offices of my Department are issued as a national summary by the Central Statistics Office.  The current form of these statistics&mdash;approved by the Government at the time for adoption from January, 1966&mdash;do, in fact, distinguish various categories of unemployed persons but as regards recipients of unemployment assistance the only breakdown of age is for over and under 65 years.  &ldquo;School leaver&rdquo; is an imprecise term and as recipients of unemployment assistance must be aged at least 18 years, new recipients at that <Col N="2146" /> age, even if they were separately identified, could include many persons who had not attended school for some considerable time.</P>

      <P>The rate of unemployment assistance payable to the person concerned was reduced as a result of a decision by a deciding officer assessing his weekly rate of means for qualification certificate purposes at £18.15 with effect from 23rd July, 1975.  This assessment was confirmed on appeal by an appeals officer.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this rate of means the applicant, is entitled subject to the usual conditions for receiving it, to payment of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £6.05, that is the maximum rate of £24.20 payable in his case less £18.15 means.  An appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed old age contributory pension on 21st January, 1975.  He had no title to pension on his Irish insurance alone and he was informed of this on 4th February, 1975.  As he had British insurance also, the investigation of his pension entitlement under EEC regulations on a combination of his Irish and British insurances was then undertaken jointly with the British Department of Health and Social Security.  The investigation has now been completed and he has been <Col N="2147" /> awarded a pro-rata Irish pension from 4th April, 1975&mdash;the date pension became payable at age 67&mdash;at the following weekly rates, £3.59 from 4th April; £4.70 from 11th April; £9.15 from 12th September; £10.10 from 3rd October and £8.75 from 21st November.

      <P>In accordance with the provisions <Col N="2148" /> of section 5 of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973, income from pay-related contributions is paid into the Social Insurance Fund.

      <P>The pay-related benefit scheme is a relatively new scheme having been introduced in April, 1974, to offset the sharp drop in income previously suffered by many workers when they became ill or unemployed. Like all new schemes its effectiveness in achieving the purpose for which it was established has been continually under review.  As a result of earlier reviews it was considered that the most significant improvement that could be made in the scheme was an extension of the duration for which pay-related benefit was payable.  During the course of this year it has been possible to double the original duration of pay-related benefit with the result that it is now payable for 12 months&mdash;the same maximum duration as for flat rate unemployment benefit.  Until sufficient time has elapsed to enable the financial effects of these improvements to be assessed, I would not feel justified in altering the existing financial arrangements.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 126 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on 9th April last, overall policy in regard to waste management involves a number of Departments.  My primary concern is to ensure that the waste collection and disposal services provided <Col N="2155" /> by local authorities are operated adequately and efficiently from both the economic and environmental points of view.  As to methods, I believe the existing method of disposal by land fill is the only one that makes economic sense in our circumstances.  I cannot say I am entirely happy about the standards of dumping but I believe that standards are improving gradually as a result of the detailed advice and guidance which I have issued to all local authorities in the matter.  I have called on the local authorities to reorganise their operations using modern equipment and tipping methods and I have drawn attention to the need for close supervision over private dumping operations.</P>
    <P>A specific review of the existing controls on waste collection and disposal has been undertaken in order to see whether new measures are needed to cope with emerging problems, and to assist in giving effect to certain EEC directives.  This review is now well advanced.  In addition, the Interdepartmental Environment Committee is conducting as examination of the existing arrangements for dealing with pollution control generally, including consideration of problems relating to waste.</P>
    <P>When the investigatory work has been completed I shall consider what new measures, if any, fall to be adopted to ensure that local authorities are well geared to deal with the growing waste problem, and to contribute, as may be appropriate, to overall waste management.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, all planning authorities were required to prepare <Col N="2156" /> a development plan for their area within three years of the coming into operation of the Act and to carry out a review of the plan at least once in every five-year period.  All planning authorities have prepared development plans; 83 authorities have reviewed their plans and four plans are due for review in the next few years. In general, I am satisfied that present development plans are of a reasonable standard.</P>
      <P>Circulars issued from my Department in 1971 and 1972 giving guidance on the review and variation of development plans and officers of the Department are available for consultation in this matter.  Many authorities have engaged consultants to prepare advisory plans for particular areas, for example, areas of high amenity, urban renewal or major expansion. in addition, the work of An Foras Forbartha should be of considerable assistance to planning authorities in the review of their plans.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to a similar question from the Deputy in April last, I am prepared to consider any representations which may be made to me by non-governmental organisations in so far as they relate to any functions which I may have in relation to the architectural heritage. The question of consultation is, however, more directly related to the powers and functions of planning authorities.  There are already adequate statutory arrangements to enable representations to be made and to ensure that such representations are considered by planning authorities when making or reviewing development plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards financial support, planning <Col N="2157" /> authorities may consider, under section 14 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, assisting bodies or persons in their areas concerned with the preservation or development of amenities, including buildings of architectural interest.</P>

      <P>In so far as the position regarding pollution of rivers generally is concerned, surveys carried out by An Foras Forbartha show that while the overall situation is reasonably satisfactory, localised and seasonal pollution, serious in places, is occurring.

      <P>I am aware of the comment made by the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities in a recent report on an EEC directive on bathing water quality.  The report also pointed out that bathing waters generally in Ireland have a much higher standard of quality than is aimed at in the directive and that works in progress or in planning by local authorities will improve the water quality in a number of areas.</P>
      <P>The directive on bathing water quality was approved at an EEC Environment Council meeting held on the 16th October, 1975.  I pointed out at the meeting that an elaborate monitoring system, as envisaged in the directive, would be a needless and wasteful exercise in the case of bathing waters remote from sources of pollution.  The directive has not yet become operative but I have arranged that the monitoring implications be examined in detail in my Department with a view to the preparation of guidance for local authorities.</P>

      <P>To reduce to 60 years the compulsory retirement age of public servants would involve the Exchequer in substantial extra costs. Furthermore, compulsory retirement at that age could be regarded as a worsening of conditions of service, particularly for officers obliged to retire without full pension.  In view of all the circumstances I am not satisfied that the proposal should be implemented.</P>

      <P>Value-added tax is a general tax on the consumption of goods and services and the burden is ultimately borne by consumers buying at retail level.  Under the VAT system it would be quite impracticable&mdash;even if it were desirable&mdash;to have for the same types of goods different tax rates depending on the circumstances of different manufacturers or the stage of distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2170" /> The 19.5 per cent rate of VAT applies to wide ranges of goods and it would be invidious to select some lines for special treatment in order to benefit particular undertakings. Furthermore, it is not permissible under EEC provisions to apply different rates of VAT to goods of Irish and foreign origin.  Any VAT concessions would have to be general in their application and, coming on top of the zero-ratings which I announced last June, could have considerable budgetary implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in the period from March to June, 1975, return forms were sent to farmers who appeared to be chargeable to income tax on their farming profits because they occupied farm land with a rateable valuation of £100 or more.  They were asked to indicate the basis of assessment for which they were opting for the year 1974-75. Where returns and accounts were completed, assessments were made giving all the deductions and allowances to which they proved title.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners say that a large number of farmers, however, failed to complete returns or claim personal allowances.  In the absence of returns or claims for allowances inspectors of taxes had to make estimated assessments in the relevant cases. These assessments were made on the basis (a) that the net profit would not in any case exceed £40 per £1 of rateable valuation, and (b) that the single personal allowance of £500 would be due.</P>

Much more of this work is, however, done by the Inland Fisheries Trust and the boards of conservators and substantial grants are made to these bodies each year from the Fisheries Vote to enable them to carry out their various functions, including that of restocking fishery waters.  Having regard to the healthy state of the salmon and trout stocks I am satisfied that the restocking programmes are proving satisfactory.</P>
