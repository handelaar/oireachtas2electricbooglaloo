    <Title>Wealth Tax Bill, 1975: Report Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 17:</P>
    <P>In page 12, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(m) productive property situate in the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;Deputy Colley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that the wealth tax system in Ireland will be unique in the world.  It will be the only wealth tax system which will give preferential relief for productive assets. There is not in Europe, and as far as our research disclosed, anywhere else, any wealth tax system which gives relief for productive assets as such.  It is the first time in our taxation code that relief is being given for productive assets.  No such relief is given under the corporation profits tax code, no such relief is given under the income tax code and there was no relief whatsoever for productive assets under the death duty system which wealth tax is replacing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence of the Government's imaginative approach to preferential treatment for productive assets, there will be encouragement for people to get out of non-productive assets, to sell off non-income yielding assets and to invest the proceeds in assets which will directly provide employment <Col N="820" /> in Ireland.  The test of whether an asset is productive or not is whether it provides employment.  It is clear, therefore, that our approach to wealth tax is one which will encourage people to use their wealth usefully, not merely for their own advantage, but also for the common good.</P>
    <P>This assessment of the situation which I believe to be the correct one is one which is supported by international commentators the latest of whom has written in the <i>New Law Journal</i> of July this year that:</P>
    <P>Capitalists can take heart that the Irish Government have equated the ownership of shares with the direct provision of employment.</P>
    <P>This view underlines the Government's approach which sees that wealth properly used can be productive and can be conducive to the common good.  The encouragement we are giving through the wealth tax system to the useful use of wealth will help our economy, will confer benefits upon the owners of wealth which is productively used and will also contribute to social equity.  It is not often one can devise and apply a tax code which can simultaneously achieve these three objectives which at times may seem to run counter to one another.  We have devised a code which is tuned to Irish problems and which is tailored to ensure that the best results, for the community and the individual, flow from the application of the code.</P>
    <P>For these reasons we consider it would be wrong to accept Deputy Colley's amendment because it takes no account of the positive encouragement which already exists in the Bill for the sensible use of wealth for productive purposes.  It seeks to exempt a whole range of properties to such an extent as to make wealth taxation null and void.  The amendment, in fact, runs counter to the resolution the Dáil passed many months ago in favour of a wealth tax.  The Dáil resolved that wealth above certain levels, that is above the level of £100,000 for a married couple in addition to the other totally exempted property such as private residences and <Col N="821" /> contents and so on, should be taxed. In those circumstances it would be tantamount to rejecting the clearly expressed will of the Dáil to accept Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are hearing a replay of records on this amendment. This is only justified by the essential nature of what is involved in this amendment.  I have a certain amount of sympathy for the Minister in the way in which he has presented his argument.  He has dragged everything in.  It is a typical administrative exercise&mdash;paper and talk&mdash;but while we have plenty of paper and talk we have a serious depression outside which I concede to the Minister is part of a large environmental problem involving the whole of Europe at least.  I will not quarrel with the Minister when he said it was world-wide but it has its local aspects.  When a ship is in a storm it minds itself and the captain does not let it founder on the excuse that all other ships are in the same condition.</P>
      <P>We have a problem which we are not tackling.  We have administration, neat briefs and statements from a Minister, complacent patting on the back for what he has done, theoretical dissertations on the social values and levelling and so on when outside there are 100,000 people unemployed and others afraid of losing their jobs. There is unrest and the Government unable to make up their own mind and having made a complete mess of the remuneration problem.  In this context the key to the situation is brushed aside, and that is productivity and economic activity.  At the moment there is too much talk about rationalisation and nice tidy paper work.  Rationalisation is a great word. Institutes and individuals are saying that it must be economic and so on when the things that matter are people, their jobs and their standard of living.  This neat brief from the Minister this morning is all very well in its place, but in the context of what the Government and the country are up against is out of place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with why we are on productive assets.  As the Minister said, and I concede it has been <Col N="822" /> agreed by resolution from the Dáil that unproductive wealth, luxurious wealth, should be taxed and we should have the social aim of levelling out. All that is conceded, but even that has administration and costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last night that this will promote employment.  It will promote employment at the administrative end; it will promote the recruiting of people to collect this tax but that is not productive employment. This is ancillary employment which depends on production.  If the basic production and the basic productive economic activity is not there then it is futile to hope it will support the other.  What is the problem in the public service at the moment, for instance?  The economy cannot support it.  Why cannot the economy support it?  The economy cannot support it because the productive element of society has, to some extent in certain sectors, collapsed.  The economy cannot afford it because productive units have gone out of business, productive firms have gone into liquidation.  The economy cannot afford it because a productive element of the building industry has large unemployment. The building industry was producing real wealth, buildings, and it was adding to the totality of the real wealth of our people.</P>
    <P>Those are the basics we have to think of and what has to be supported. It is side-tracking the debate to pretend that this is a wonderful social achievement that will benefit us even in normal times.  Even if there was surplus wealth around some care in approach to the problem would be needed, but at a time like this it can make no contribution.  It could aggravate it.  I should like to refer to what I think is a basic confusion here.  I am using the word &ldquo;confusion&rdquo; because one could lose sight of what we are talking about when we talk about production.  The first question is to ask what do we mean by production when we are talking about production in this sense, productive assets?  It means the production of real wealth and what is real wealth in practical terms for the community as a whole?  It is the production <Col N="823" /> of these things which enable people to live and improve their standard of living and which at least maintain the standard of living achieved and, one would hope, give the further chance of improving that standard of living.</P>
    <P>What is real wealth?  Real wealth is not just the money.  This is the mistake we are making.  It is not the pay cheque.  The pay cheque is only a chit for the wealth, as we all know now with inflation.  It is only a chit, it is only part of the administration of paperwork.  The value of that chit depends on the reality that backs it, in the last analysis.  With all our modern economists, Keynesian or otherwise, I think one gets back to Dickens when it comes to finance, but it goes back to Adam and Eve when they were told that by the sweat of their brow they would earn their bread.</P>
    <P>What is this productive wealth we are talking about?  First it is food, the production of food.  I concede to the Minister that this is recognised in the Bill, and we urged too the recognition of agriculture as a productive industry. Full marks to the Minister.  I should like to go a little bit further with that. I cannot include the whole economy in one amendment on Report Stage.  I will have to forego following up the question of the distribution of food and the problem that brings in.  I will make the remark that unfortunately the Minister's problems, our problems and all the economic problems of the western world, are all bedevilled by a superstructure of finance and banking which is international and which is bedevilling the whole situation in that the productive units, the productive companies, productive factories or productive units, tend to be chits again which are passed along, the subject of a kind of brokerage, if you like, at that higher administrative level. That is not productive and the productive units are subordinated therein.  That is the basic fault as far as I can see but that is beyond our control.  That would bring me into arguments of another nature.  I merely express that to point out that the basic <Col N="824" /> ill of the west at the moment is this failure to realise the problems of production and distribution in real terms, and to subordinate the administrative to the real physical economic activity instead of the way things have developed where the reality has been completely subordinated to the conventions of the administrative.</P>
    <P>That is a general statement and I thank, you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to make it.  But it is important on this amendment to realise that what we are talking about here is first of all real wealth&mdash;food, clothing, shelter and the other things that are needed to keep up the standards that we have.  It is the production of something tangible.  You do not feed people by having a lot of economics about production.  You will do it if the farmer does it.  You do not rule people by having a lot of great statistics about the clothing industry.  Take our footwear factories and their problems at the moment. You do not house people by having a lot of statements about policy on housing and so forth.  You have to build houses.  Building houses means having material and having workmen, a work force to do it.  In doing it you are producing wealth, you are giving employment and you are adding to the total wealth of the community and raising the standard of the individual, keeping jobs.  I could follow that right down to the less important things but I have taken these as the principal ones.</P>
    <P>What we want here is the necessary production and to do everything we can to stimulate the provision of this production and to stimulate productive activity.  I shall make this further general comment about the whole Government's approach to this.  Their failure to understand the true nature of productivity and what is involved in real terms, to think in terms of employment has brought about many of the tragic positions we have today. While we are not building up the productivity here that will give us the resources measured in administrative and financial terms to keep people in employment with adequate remuneration, we are drawing on dwindling resources <Col N="825" /> to support people who should be gainfully and progressively employed. We are giving relief.  We are drawing more and more, and this is why there is need for all the taxation. The camel is living on his hump.  He cannot live on his hump forever.</P>
    <P>When we talk about productivity we are talking about everything that can be done in the present situation to stimulate that activity.  Take the building industry, for instance.  The Minister for Local Government talks about houses and shelter.  That is very important, but there is another type of building activity and the building workers of this city of Dublin know it. So do the firms concerned.  A number of these were the targets of the doctrinaire socialism and armchair economics of certain people.  I am afraid I cannot exclude the Minister for Finance from the category in a certain regard. While that activity exists there will be always people who do not understand; there will always be people complaining. The philosophy of envy was exploited to a certain extent but at least you can say that people were in good jobs, earning good money and that that money meant something.</P>
    <P>But the first fundamental error we are making is that we are not concentrating on the promotion and stimulation and provision of productive activity and in so far as this comes into the picture at all it is more or less on the negative side in the provision of reliefs, which of course are absolutely necessary&mdash;you cannot let people starve.  You have to meet a situation like that.  Let me be fair.  So far as certain sections are concerned, whether it is outside their control permanently or transitionally, this kind of approach will always be necessary, but it should be as a supplement.</P>
    <P>Therefore the bone of contention between the Minister and ourselves on this Bill as to whether it should apply to productive assets or not&mdash;&ldquo;productive assets&rdquo; is an administrative, if you like, an economic phrase&mdash;is that while we must give relief, in giving those reliefs we should do nothing to aggravate the <Col N="826" /> problem.  What is the use in giving reliefs on the one hand and imposing extra taxation on the other?  The Minister talks about taxing the wealthy, but when he introduced his budget last month it was distributed over a much larger area than the people he is talking about now.  If the Minister were to pay a visit to any office in the public or private sector where money is being paid out he would soon find out the realities of the situation.  These are the basics behind this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that this Bill would promote employment.  It will promote employment in the administrative side as against the other.  It will mean more staff being needed to cater for the extra paper work.  Will the return be worth it?  There is a total misconception in this Bill which could be very simply rectified by this amendment.  The more diversified and complex production is the more you need to have perfected your administration and your financial structures. I understand the difficulties facing a Minister for Finance here with this superstructure of international banking and finance to contend with. Nevertheless, productivity in a tangible sense must be sufficient to support the administration.</P>
    <P>A good example to take would be an army.  In a war an army are for fighting.  They are made up of the infantry, the artillery and the cavalry. They must consists of adjutant generals, quartermasters' departments, paymasters' sections to look after accounting and so on.  There is a semi-area like the medical corps, the signal corps, which are supporting services.  These are all a necessary and important part of the army.  But let us not be misled into thinking that the administrative services could win the war without the fighting services.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies to the State.  If we take the newspaper industry, about which I know something, we shall see that the most important element is the editorial section, the printer and transport&mdash; distribution of the papers.  If the papers are not sold then business collapses. <Col N="827" /> In order to do that it is necessary to have accountants, circulation departments, advertising departments, exactly analogous with an army.  So it is with the State.  If the community have not got the productive element working, if the farmers do not produce the food, if the factories do not produce the clothing, if the building force are not active modernising our accommodation, whether administrative or for human habitation, if our gas company are not producing gas, if our electricity undertaking is not producing electricity, if all this collapses, the wherewithal to support our administrative staff would not exist.  The result would be, as we have seen here, that the State would have to try to keep up its administrative level by increasing taxation, and we reach the point where the camel is living off his hump.</P>
    <P>It was a necessary counter-balance to the Minister's statement this morning on what he had done.  I do not want to take credit from him for what he has done.  I have more than once sympathised with him when he said: &ldquo;I give a little and then you press for more.  Where do I stop?&rdquo;  He said on one occasion, rather ruefully, and I certainly had sympathy for him: &ldquo;It would be better if I did not give anything at all there.&rdquo;  The Opposition's job is to press things.  We have pressed him for reliefs and so on.  I am not saying that nothing reasonable has been said by the Minister, but I am emphasising what I have said in order to show the other side of the coin, to bring a balance and a sense of reality to the discussion launched by the Minister this morning.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given many exemptions on section 9.  They are listed at (a) to (k).  All of them have been approved and can be justified. Frankly, I can understand the Minister's rejection of amendment No. 16. If one goes through the list one finds that only two are directly exempting productive assets.  When I say that I am conscious of section 10.  I am speaking solely within the framework of section 7.  I am conscious of <Col N="828" /> the fact that relief is most properly given to agricultural property and farm machinery, to fishing boats and to hotel premises.  We had that on Committee Stage.  Out of these 12 subheads, there are only two that can be classed as being in the positive productive category that we are talking about.  One is (c) and the other is (d).  The first two, (a) and (b), are proper ones to have in and so are the rest.  But it is still significant that out of 12 exemptions there are only two &mdash;&ldquo;livestock to which a person who is a farmer within the meaning of section 10 is beneficially entitled in possession&rdquo; and &ldquo;bloodstock&rdquo; which are productive assets and rightly exempt.  After that it seems to me that there is a hiatus and I advocated earlier that it should be a broader field.  I understand and I allow that there are complications for the Minister particularly in the approach he has taken.  We would have to be here for a long time to work out all the ins and outs of the relationship of the shareholding in a public company &mdash;I am talking of public companies now, big enterprises in other words&mdash; to the productive activity of that.  To put it shortly there is an indirect repercussion here.  However, there are ways of doing it.  To some extent, it is a matter of the quantity of the relief rather than the relief as a whole.  We are seeking to get the principle of relief as a whole recognised and it can possibly be adjusted by increasing the partial reliefs in certain areas.  The marginal note to section 10 reads &ldquo;net market value of productive property&rdquo;. However, that section only refers to agricultural property, fishing boats and hotel premises.  There is much that is not captured there.</P>
    <P>There is the case for the plaintiff, so to speak, on this amendment.  I would like to round off what I have to say, since it is Report Stage and I can only speak once, by some further remarks on what the Minister said.  I hope that by trying to focus attention on the real issue we can see the rest in perspective.  The Minister has made comparisons with other countries.  I can understand a Minister doing this. It is a valid point to make in a way. <Col N="829" /> But my answer to that is very simple. We are dealing with the problems of this country in its own specific circumstances. That is more difficult nowadays in the context of our European commitment.  It is difficult because of the world situation but it is a question of the commandment &ldquo;Man mind thyself&rdquo;.  The Community must mind itself and this country must mind itself. Therefore I think there is a certain danger in getting involved in paper comparisons with other countries.  The same applies to what the Minister said about relief under other codes.  He is perfectly right in what he said but the logical conclusion of his argument would be that this has been the situation in the past and we should not try to change it.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He is the first to say that we had not changed it, that Fianna Fáil in office had done nothing and to claim that he was doing something.  If you take that point of view you cannot, at the same time, take the point of view that the old codes did not do it and therefore it should not be done here. There is a certain lack of logic in that. The Minister quotes international commentators. These are a bunch of what I might call theorists and economic and administrative specialists and prophets. Sometimes they are right and sometimes they are wrong.  They told us that by the beginning of 1976 everything would be all right but the Taoiseach, not so long ago, had to come back and say: &ldquo;That is not so: The clouds are still there&rdquo;.  I have a certain sympathy with the pundits.  They are like the weather forecasters before scientific equipment was invented for reasonably accurate forecasting.  Even with advanced equipment, meteorologists are often wrong in their predictions. Economic forecasters have not got sufficient information or sufficient means for making reliable forecasts.  I must be pardoned if I am a little sceptical about much of the prognostications that emanate from Brussels or anywhere else.  I am not saying people are not trying to do their best.  In a time of flood a man should look to his own house to see if it is watertight and when he has done the best he can he can then study the impact of the flood on a larger area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> The key to our problems lies in adopting a certain approach, not quarrelling at this stage or seeking to differentiate, although one would be prepared to do it even if misrepresented. The genuine benefit of the people in the long term is what matters.  People in politics will always be misrepresented but they must still strive for the good of the people.  In this spirit I ask the Minister to consider our proposals.  We cannot afford the political conventions at the moment, where one side vilifies the other.  Let us be objective.  I have tried to be as positive and as definite as.  I can be about the mutual roles of administration and production.  I have pointed out that the administrative is supported by the productive.  But let us also realise that the administrative is as important as the productive.  What is involved is a co-ordination and balances.  In the case of taxation, if we do not achieve the proper balance the inevitable result will be either that the administrative will be starved, which would be wrong, or else, if the productive element were neglected, then the wherewithal to support the administrative element is gone.  That would result in further taxation, further pulling back and fewer people from whom to take money.  That is what I mean by the camel living off his hump.</P>
    <P>I say these things for the sake of reality and not without recognition of the extremely difficult problems which face the Minister and the Government and not without a degree of understanding and sympathy, notwithstanding the political conventions. There is a difficult time ahead of us and we cannot afford to indulge in scoring debating points or shouting from soapboxes.  I am, therefore, avoiding opportunities which the Minister is providing for excess criticism of his policy.  I hope the Minister will give me credit for not seizing upon them.  The Minister must see that there is a solution to the problem we have been talking about here.</P>
    <P>In the section now before the House there are 12 provisions, of <Col N="831" /> which only two can be placed in the productive category though allowance must be made for provisions within the Act as a whole such as section 10. Therefore, I am emphasising that it is the principle of totality of exemption of productive assets that I am speaking of here.  One should be reasonable.  If the principle were admitted and applied how to work it into the Bill would be a matter for co-operation and understanding and these would be forthcoming from this side of the House.  If the Minister adds the phrase &ldquo;productive property situate within the State&rdquo; that is all we want to have included.  We want that exempted to promote productive activity, economic activity, the provision of jobs, sufficient remuneration for work.  I admit it would be a small contribution towards the solution of all our problems at the moment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should anticipate what the Minister may say to me.  He might ask: &ldquo;Does the Deputy think that by doing this in the Bill he is going to solve all the problems facing the country, the Government and this House at the moment?&rdquo; Of course, I do not.  I know the contribution this will make will be small but it is a worthwhile contribution in the opposite direction and we should do nothing in the way of disincentive even if it were no more than a psychological disincentive.  We should not do anything of this nature at the moment.</P>
    <P>The justification for making this amendment in the Bill while based on the general principles that I tried to outline is not based on the ridiculous assumption that to do this, or indeed that this Bill at all, will help significantly anything in the State.  It will help the present position.  It will take more money back into the Exchequer. It is imposing taxation.  In some cases it gives general reliefs and I give the Minister credit for that, but by including these productive assets you are at least not providing a psychological disincentive.  That simple fact, small as it is in proportion to all the other factors that govern the situation, is in my view <Col N="832" /> ample justification for our pressing this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is terribly important to keep things in proportion.  The Minister will recognise, I hope, that I have not invoked the social aspects from the point of view of the philosophy of envy that he talked about, however applied.  He was able to use that argument both ways.  He used it one way earlier in the debate and he used it another way on an amendment yesterday, in the opposite sense.  That may be all very well for debating but the Minister might consider accepting the amendment.  The Seanad gave a formula.</P>
    <P>I have from the beginning of the introduction of this taxation strongly pressed the Minister at all Stages to empower the Revenue Commissioners more.  I have asked for a few things and these are relevant to this amendment and its implementation.  I have continually asked the Minister to give empowering legislation to the Revenue Commissioners.  At the end of these debates I am as firmly convinced as I was at the beginning that given the Revenue Commissioners as they are and have been and their staffs as they are, I would have no hesitation in conferring that discretion. I was glad to see that the Seanad brought in something of that nature.</P>
    <P>In the interests of the Revenue Commissioners great care should be taken to avoid complexities adding to their administrative difficulties because I fear that if the Revenue Commissioners become a very complex organisation their high standards may be difficult to maintain.  It is the experience of everybody in this megalomaniac world that when you get big organisations where units have to be complex and big to deal with complex problems standards are difficult to maintain.  Therefore, while pleading for discretion for the Revenue Commissioners, I will also plead for simplicity for them.  I say to the Minister that I will understand arguments about administrative complexity here and if the Minister bases his arguments on matters of that nature then he is on ground where we can have constructive debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> I have a feeling that the Minister's rejection of our overtures on paragraph (e) were in the last analysis not based on the argument of equity but based on the argument of administrative complexity and unworkability. That I can understand. Although we voted against his not accepting our point of view, nevertheless, I confess personally that I can understand that argument.  I can also understand this argument in connection with the present amendment.  Then I would say as I have said on so many occasions to the Minister, can you not solve it with discretionary power here or let us have specific examples as to why not?</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the case of public companies but one would also mention the case of the property of private trading companies where there is an employment content.  All these things come into the picture.</P>
    <P>We have been putting this amendment to the Minister, in the temporary absence of the mover, Deputy Colley, who is at an important meeting in the House, on the principle of where production stands in relation to administration. That is the fundamental approach to the argument.  I tried to develop that.  Perhaps the Chair was indulgent in allowing me to develop it to the extent that I did at the beginning.  I thank the Chair and the House for that indulgence.  If I was somewhat vehement in the presentation of it, it was for the sake of emphasis on the objectivity and for no other purpose.  If one looks at the thing that way, then one has to say that having regard to this subsection, even making allowances for what is elsewhere in the Bill in regard to productive assets, there is still need for some such clause but apart from this there is the principle that there should be no disincentive.  We do realise that of course this is not the panacea for our problems.  The panacea is certainly not to be found in this Bill.  I have not therefore sought to put the thing any further than to say that any disincentive is not helpful at the moment and taxation no matter how you look at it is a disincentive.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a number of industries, <Col N="834" /> perhaps the Minister might, even at this hour, consider.  If the amendment in its simple form is not acceptable, if it gives rise to administrative difficulties&mdash;the arguments against the whole matter that can be advanced from an administrative point of view have probably some element of validity&mdash;I am still brash enough to urge the Minister to take his courage in his hands having been given the empowering legislation there to confer the discretion on the people who will be exercising the power, to take care, however, that they are in a position to exercise their discretion and to use their power in the most efficient manner by minimising complexities for them as far as possible.</P>

      <P>The amendment in many ways illustrates very clearly the extreme contradiction within the Fianna Fáil Party.  I sat in Opposition from 1969 to 1973 and never once was there any suggestion that productive property should be exempt from death duties.  We never heard a tittle from that party.  Yet it has now succumbed to what can only be described as right-wing ultra conservative philosophy of taxation which it is a shame to see coming from any political party at this stage.  For example, I do not own any productive property situated within the State. Nor do, say, journalists in the Gallery or the average worker, the average tradesman.  He is not necessarily a man of property.  He pays tax on the <Col N="835" /> earnings which derive from the use of his skills.</P>
      <P>I would not think that Deputy Moore is a man of great productive wealth or property, and he pays income tax on the earnings his skill gives to him.  We have not yet had from Fianna Fáil, though I would not be surprised if we had in the remaining dying hours of this Bill, a proposal that everybody's skill should be exempt which, after all, is their intrinsic property.</P>

      <P>Quite frankly this is not what I clearly implied to Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I am talking about a foreign company setting up a holding company in Ireland and transferring their assets over here solely for the purpose of holding such securities in this country.  Deputy Fitzpatrick automatically gives them total exemption. He knows perfectly well what I am talking about.  Are Fianna Fáil sane? We have had utter ráiméis from Deputy de Valera for the past hour. We have had about three months of it here.  We have had a sustained effort from the Fianna Fáil Party to represent at the most a couple of hundred extremely wealthy people in this country.  One would need to have extreme wealth to be liable for this very nominal wealth tax.  Fianna Fáil have made very special pleading right down the line.  It is wrong that a party should so disgrace themselves.  When these debates are read in a few years ahead, that will be the universal verdict of Irish taxation experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks to exempt productive property situated in the State.  Where will it end?  Let Fianna Fáil be honest and say they are totally opposed to taxation of any productive propery in the State.  Presumably this would mean we should never have any alternative form of taxation.  It is <Col N="837" /> hyprocrisy on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party to propose an amendment of that nature when, in fact, productive assets were always included and never exempted from death duties.  The Fianna Fáil Party will send out appeals for support in the next general election and will probably promise 30 or 40 of the most wealthy people that they will exempt productive property situated in the State if they support them in the general election.  I have no doubt they will get a response because such people will say: &ldquo;We never thought we would get away with it on death duties but now we are getting away with it, not only on the abolition of death duties by the National Coalition, but also in relation to wealth tax.&rdquo; Therefore, I think, the amendment is also getting away with it in relation to the wealth tax as such.  The amendment is tantamount to a typical piece of hypocrisy from the Fianna Fáil Party.  They know perfectly well that this Bill will in no way inhibit the productive economic use of productive property and productive assets in the State.  I challenge them to ask anybody from the lowest to the highest economist in the Central Bank, or any economist from the Social and Economic Research Institute&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When I hear the Fianna Fáil Party saying that the ordinary skilled and unskilled worker or the professional man who does a day's work in an office, or in a professional capacity, should be given exemption from the payment of income tax, I will begin to take seriously that kind of a proposal contained in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to the simple fact that not one wealth tax in operation in Europe gives a total exemption, or even a special exemption, for relief of productive assets as such.  The Fianna Fáil Party know that.  I suggest that this is another piece of spurious pleading on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  God knows we have listened, not with a great sense of irritation, but with a certain degree of sadness, to Deputy de Valera's statement in this House. In my opinion the Deputy has been conned by a very vague, peculiar, but not an unusual type of conservative, anti-taxation, anti-social, approach, the kind of conservative elitism we had here this morning with talk of generals, and adjutant generals.  This kind of evocative throw-back to the 1930s, was epitomised by a recent statement by another managing director of a major company that: &ldquo;We are the leaders, we lead the Army, we own the productive assets of this State; we should not be taxed; we are the epitome of all ability inside the community&rdquo;.  The <Col N="839" /> owners of so-called productive assets want total exemption.  They do not want to pay anything.  They do not want to pay income tax; many of them do not want to pay corporate profits tax, death duties, now they do not want to pay wealth tax.</P>
    <P>What struck me as peculiar was that many people have come to me and said: &ldquo;I do not like this wealth tax.&rdquo; After about ten minutes they learn that they are in no way liable and not in their lifetime or their children's lifetime will they be liable for a wealth tax.  One gets the impression that they want to pay the income tax, death duties, estate duties and so on.  This is a very special type of support being given by the Fianna Fáil Party to that feeling within the community.  I have heard nobody in that party saying at any time during the course of this debate that taxation was necessary, and is one of the best forms of obtaining money for the running of the nation.  I have heard no indication from the Fianna Fáil Party, apart from a mealy-mouthed concession during the course of the Capital Gains Tax Bill when they suggested that some form of capital gains should be taxed.  They put down so many amendments that we finish up having nothing out of capital gains.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at Deputy Fitzpatrick. I thought he had more sense. I am not surprised at Deputy de Valera because quite frankly I think his remarks reflect his ultra-conservatism. I am in no way surprised at Deputy Colley because in putting forward this amendment, he has succumbed to those who had successfully advised the wealthy people of this country to evade virtually every piece of taxation, estate or death duties over the past 20 or 30 years.  Everybody knows that the evasion of death duties and duties generally was a matter of national public scandal and was conceded by the Fianna Fáil Party to be such when they were in office.  We tried to do something about this by bringing in a fairly tight Bill.  Admittedly many people who would have been liable to death <Col N="840" /> duties are now exempt.  It is better for people to know the extent of their liabilities.  Therefore, this amendment is simply another piece of band wagonism on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party to negative the whole purpose of the Wealth Tax Bill.  This is the classic reaction of that party in their efforts to sabotage this essential taxation reform.  I do not believe that there is any electoral support to the viewpoint of the Fianna Fáil Party. It may have some support from the very conservative and very elitist sections of the very wealthy community. They have pandered to that particular section in the community in a big way.  They have also indulged in some of the most disgraceful propaganda I have ever seen in relation to the effects on employment and the use of productive property in the State.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on the stand he has taken throughout this Bill.  He has been very courageous. The fact that he has succeeded in introducing the Bill and in passing it through this House at a period when the economic climate was not the most conducive or the most beneficial&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will go down as a Minister who was reforming, courageous, in many ways generous in terms of eliminating death duties and who provided threshold limits of an extremely generous nature.  That <Col N="841" /> must be said and must be put on record and I, for one, am not sorry to see the end of this Bill because the revenue from it is going to be very little.</P>

      <P>No one will deny, or try to deny, Deputy Desmond's right to speak here today, but one must ask why he made the speech and what bearing had it on the amendment.  I hope the Minister is laughing with Deputy Desmond rather than at him. We, on this side of the House, can only laugh at such an atrocious contribution to what should be a serious debate.</P>
      <P>At the moment there are 103,000 people without employment and this figure is rising all the time.  While over 30,000 of Deputy Desmond's fellow citizens in this city are without employment, we have to listen here to a fatuous, and facetious contribution, with not a serious note in it.  It is simply a distortion of this amendment. In many places democracy may have become a little irrelevant, but we expect a more serious attitude from Deputy Desmond and from the Government benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to briefly speak on why the Minister might well accept this amendment which was so brilliantly spoken about this morning by Deputy de Valera.  I know the Minister is very concerned about the state of the <Col N="842" /> economy and the need to increase productivity so that our unemployed can get back into employment as quickly as possible.  In this city there is an industry which is in trouble.  I spoke to the workers and the management during the past few weeks and asked what will happen to them. Many of the workers said the Government can do something.  In fairness to the Government I pointed out that the Government can do very little in this respect, because even to try and stop the importation of the commodity which is produced in this factory would not help.  I also pointed out that if one looked at the figures for the product manufactured in the United Kingdom one would discover that despite their economic difficulties, they had increased their productivity to such an extent that they could sell their products on the Irish market cheaper than we can produce them. Therefore, when we ask the Minister to exclude productive property in the State, we must bear this in mind.  We have to let the cold wind of realism sweep into every corner.  We have to try to get people to think seriously and believe that we have to find our own salvation.  No one will deny that the worldwide situation is not conducive to quick prosperity.</P>
    <P>While the influences of the outside world are felt very much here, the Government cannot do everything to insulate our people from the cold winds of realism.  The Government have aggravated the situation and have brought more trouble on the people which could have been avoided if they had listened to the speakers on this side of the House.  We told them months ago that they should have become involved in the national pay agreement but they refused to listen to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I just referred to it in passing.  But the point I am making is that the Government, by their attitude as exemplified by Deputy Desmond's contribution, show that they will not listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> This morning, when the economic outlook is so bleak, one would hope that the Government, having seen the growing danger signs, would at least make some gesture towards this principle of productivity and accept the Fianna Fáil amendment.  This would bring home to every worker and employer that unless, even at the eleventh hour, we try to solve our own problems&mdash;and this cannot be done by fatuous promises or speeches such as that made by Deputy Desmond&mdash;and unless the Government set the headline for these men and women to increase productivity, we will be in trouble.</P>
    <P>We heard what the Minister had to say yesterday on the pay agreement. The Government do not realise that our products are being out-priced. The home market, small as it is, is no longer sacrosanct or reserved for native industries.  The Government should accept this amendment, so that production can be increased and we can achieve success in foreign markets.  We can start on the home market by ensuring that Irish concerns are competitive.  People should be encouraged to buy Irish in preference to the foreign made goods, not solely because they are Irish made, but because they are good and can be sold at a price that people can afford.</P>
    <P>Therefore the Minister should, as part of his plan, tackle the growing ills as exemplified by the terrible problem he faces under the national pay agreement.  When I spoke in the budget debate, I pointed out when the national pay agreement was being debated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is the kernel of our trouble.  Unless we can ensure that our costs of production allow us to produce goods at competitive prices we will run into trouble.  I appeal to the Minister, as he prepares for the next week of tough negotiations, to try to salvage something <Col N="844" /> from the fires raging on the economic front.  He should accept this amendment because it would be a contribution towards greater productivity and, by increasing productivity on the farm and in the factory, we can reduce the numbers of unemployed or, at least, prevent more from becoming unemployed.  One of the causes of unemployment is the fact that we are being outpriced.  Yet the Government at this grave hour of our existence is adding further taxation to the already meagre production.  If the classical economists mean anything, they laid down certain lines to be followed. They told us to increase the size of the national cake so that it could be distributed and each of our people would have a bigger share of it.  This is a basic fact of economic life.</P>
      <P>The Government, in applying the wealth tax to property, are providing a disincentive to people to work harder.  The tax will also raise production costs which means our goods will sell at higher prices than imported goods.  The vast majority of people today are feeling the strain of reduced resources and the ever increasing inflation.  They will be forced to buy the cheaper goods, whether or not they are made in Ireland.  Goods are not bought because of better quality but because they are cheaper. Even for people who would be patriotic enough to insist on buying Irish goods, there is the temptation to buy the cheaper article because the income&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate I am wandering a bit.  Productive capacity will be impaired if this wealth tax is applied to productive property.  By applying this tax the Minister is taxing the base of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond suggested that we would not be quite honest if we did not tax all productive property.  The operative word is &ldquo;productive&rdquo;.  We seek to have productive property exempted from tax.  When the cold <Col N="845" /> winds of realism are blowing and unemployment figures are rising it is time for the Minister to take steps to achieve greater productivity in all industries.  He could do that by accepting this amendment.  I support the case made so brilliantly by Deputy de Valera this morning.</P>

The people who have concerned themselves with the issues involved in this Bill are to be congratulated on the manner in which they have brought them home to the people.  I wish to congratulate Deputy de Valera on his objective analysis of the wealth tax proposals. He gave us a good outline of what is involved in the Bill.  I support this amendment.  I believe it can be accepted without any loss of face on the part of the Government.  Productive property could be exempted from wealth tax.  I had hoped Deputy Desmond would put forward more forcefully the Labour point of view. I had hoped that he would be more objective in his arguments and more positive, but his contribution was mainly a criticism of Deputy de Valera's and Deputy Colley's comments on this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that.  It is difficult to confine oneself specifically to the amendment without mentioning some of the broader implications of these wealth tax proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is widespread concern throughout the country regarding the economic situation of the country at present.  The Government must be concerned by the fact that at present there are over 100,000 people unemployed and the figure is still rising.  I dread to think what it may be like next December or January.  This amendment would go some of the way towards helping to cure this situation.  There has been a great deal of talk about wealth, productive wealth, real wealth and so on. I wonder where all this wealth is about which the Government talk.  They seem to be concerned about getting at the few millionaires in the country.  I <Col N="846" /> do not think this is the right attitude at all.  We all realise that it is important to have wealthy people in the country to invest their money here for productive purposes and to give employment. Down through the years successive Governments have been encouraging such people to come here and invest here.  They have given certain concessions and I think it would be unfortunate if the wealth tax proposals outlined here frightened these people away at a time when we need them most.</P>
    <P>The Government do not seem to be concerned about the implications.  Some time ago the Minister for Local Government said on a radio programme &ldquo;To hell with the rich&rdquo;.  I do not subscribe to that philosophy.  I am not a wealthy man by any means&mdash;I suppose I never will be&mdash;but I know that wealthy people are an asset.  We have seen some set up in business here and they have done a fine job and provided valuable employment.  If these wealth tax proposals go through the Government will have to draw on dwindling resources to provide assistance for those who should be gainfully employed.  I am referring to the people on the dole.  They will have to be paid assistance and, as I said, the Government will have to draw on dwindling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that I have strayed from the amendment. The Minister could accept this amendment without a loss of face.  I have no doubt the benefits which would accrue to the country would be great. Let us not think for one moment that all the wealthy people are on the <Col N="847" /> Fianna Fáil side of the House.  Listening to some of the speakers on the Government side one would imagine that that was the case.  I have no doubt that if this exemption were given, if productive property were exempted from the scope of this Bill, that would benefit all of us because it would help to create employment and that would would be a real asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If one thinks seriously about having any decent type of capital taxation, particularly a wealth tax, then one must reject this amendment.  I do not think the Opposition could be very serious about it really.  Productive property should be subject to tax.  Taxing such property encourages greater productivity to meet the tax.  A manufacturer will inevitably be spurred into increasing production.  This is a healthy exercise and, as far as I am concerned, it is welcome.</P>
      <P>The same argument applies to people who have vast tracts of land. The impression given by some people is that farmers will be terrorised and go out of business.  But when one looks at the reality of the situation one finds that a farmer with something in the region of 200 acres worth £150,000 and gross assets valued at £244,000 will be paying nothing.  We are talking about a farmer with over £250,000 paying nothing.  The Opposition always maintained that theirs was the party representing the ordinary man. The stand they are taking on this tax is a clear indication that they no longer represent and do not want to represent the ordinary man.</P>
      <P>The position in industry will be that a man with total assets of £137,000 will pay nothing.  The Opposition are concerned about that.  If we want a just system of taxation then taxation must be fairly and squarely apportioned. When people acquire wealth they generally acquire it as a result of the labours of others working for them.</P>
      <P>I am all for people acquiring wealth.  That is a healthy exercise and we must see that it continues.  But logically those who acquire wealth must bear their fair share of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> I wonder what all the hysteria is about.  Opposition Deputies talk about money flowing out.  I do not think that is true but, if there is any element of truth in it, then it is because of the mass hysteria engendered and the mischief-making on the other side of this House.  I cannot see the reason for this opposition.  Why must they put down this amendment when the object is to make industry more efficient.  We have <i>per capita</i> here a very low rate of production <i>vis-à-vis</i> our partners in Europe.  We should remember this if industry is forced into a situation in which it has to become more productive, then that is healthy because we will have greater production and greater exports.</P>

      <P>£3,500 by way of tax is very low.  It will act as a spur to make industrialists use their plant to its fullest capacity and get the best out of the people they are employing.  The sooner we wake up and encourage that kind of mentality the better.  We have been carrying dead weight in industry for far too long.  We are coming to the stage when we have got to face up to facts.  I am sure our elements of production are right.  The Minister has no option but to reject this amendment.  In my view, it ill became the Opposition to put it down in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief but I shall have to ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to allow me to stray a little.  I listened to the Minister last night and this morning.  He went over the whole general principle of taxation and so did Deputy de Valera, in order to prove their points.  It is hard to confine oneself to what is very relevant to the amendment which seeks to exclude productive assets within the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>No man sat through more of the debates on this Bill and the debates on the three taxation Bills than I did and I took very little part in the discussions but I would like to support this particular amendment because it is concerned with productive assets within the State.  I wish to give my reasons for supporting it.  I am a left wing man but I must be practical. I must realise that money talks all kinds of languages, whether I like it or not. I resent the remark from Deputy O'Brien that nobody is representing the underdog.  I have always represented the underdog.  I want to see the workers kept in employment.  I do not have much money.  As I said, money talks all kinds of language in this conutry and in every country in the world.  I do not like this, but that is the position.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his recent statement pointed out very clearly that we must provide incentives for people to invest money here.  But the Minister in this Bill seems to be acting contrary to this statement.  We have had three taxation Bills.  I agree with some of their provisions: I believe in taxing people who should be taxed.  I listened to lengthy debates on the Bills but because most of the matters raised were of such a highly technical nature I did not take part in the discussions because I am not qualified to speak on them.  Political football was not played to any great extent.  The debates were purely objective and were conducted in the spirit of improving the Bills. Many amendments were put down and accepted both on the previous Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Without interrupting the Deputy, what the Chair wants to do is&mdash;this is one of 37 amendments&mdash;is to keep the debate relevant to the amendment before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with your ruling but I am trying to point out that if I want to make a point which is relevant to this amendment, I must widen the scope a little, and this has been done by previous speakers.  As <Col N="850" /> one who does not take up much time in this House but who sits here for long periods, I am trying to make my case as to why I think that it is important that we should have this amendment.  It refers to productive assets within the State.  The point I am making is very relevant to productive assets within the State.  That is why I must stray a little from the terms of the amendment.  If the Chair says I am not correct in doing this, I must accept that ruling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair wants to help the Deputy.  If the Deputy relates his remarks to the amendment that is before the House he will be in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly trying to do that, but I must give reasons why I think this is a good amendment. In order to give these reasons I must stray slightly.  The Minister may have administrative difficulties.  I have great sympathy with him and the Revenue Commissioners and the civil servants in trying to administer income tax Bills because they are very complicated.  The employment element is definitely included in the Wealth Tax Bill.  Extra staff will be needed to administer the Bill.  But I do not understand how the Minister and Deputy O'Brien can say that the provisions in this Bill will lead to an increase in employment and how it will make industry more efficient.  I should like to know how this is to be done.</P>
      <P>Without people to invest money to provide employment we cannot exist. If we had the situation where the State could provide all the necessary employment I should be very happy.  But that is not possible in our society.  I believe in being practical, even though I am a socialist.  Until we can change it, we must accept the existing situation.  In the European Economic Community and throughout the whole world, as I have already said, money talks all kinds of languages and we cannot do without it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had one objection to this taxation legislation on the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  We put down amendments to assist the man who made his money the hard way as opposed to the speculator. <Col N="851" /> I have no objection to wealth tax but I do support amendments which have been put down.  A number of our amendments have been accepted. In regard to the farming sector one very important amendment was accepted and growing timber is now excluded.  We also put down an amendment in relation to private companies owning hotels.  That was not accepted but a 30 per cent reduction on shares was allowed before taxation. This was a step in the right direction but we still hold that the private company should be excluded.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the question of productive assets within the State, and all we are asking is that they should be exempted because of our serious economic situation.  In principle, I do not object to wealth tax but at the present moment with three taxation Bills before the House I am concerned about our employment situation. Money must be there to maintain employment. The psychological effect on investors must be that this is not as good a place as it was heretofore for investment.  It is very wrong that we should tax productive assets within the State.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this amendment.</P>
    <P>As I said, I listened to the debates on the three Bills and many good amendments were put forward.  Good amendments were put down by the Minister but they were always as a result of worthwhile debate on the Bills.  This amendment is a good one and I appeal to the Minister to accept it if there are no serious administrative difficulties to be overcome.  I am extremely left wing but I acknowledge the truth of the saying: &ldquo;Laugh and the world laughs with you; weep and you weep alone&rdquo;.  No matter what your ideals are, whether they are capitalist, socialist or anything else, if you are without money, nobody gives two damns about you.  What we want for everybody in this country is work, and without money we cannot have work.  That is why, as a left wing man, I support this amendment to protect productive assets within the State. <Col N="852" /> Again, if there are no serious administrative difficulties, I ask the Minister to accept it.  It would help to create the climate which the Taoiseach said must be created if we are to survive. The most serious warning ever given to us was given by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Taoiseach said we must create a climate here to encourage people to invest money.  All we are trying to do in this amendment is to help create this climate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Deputy Callanan reflects our views as to why we oppose this Bill. We oppose the Wealth Tax Bill because we believe that the timing is wrong.  As Deputy Callanan said the principle of wealth tax at another time could be considered but we are considering what effect it will have on the economy at this particular time.  We made our opposition to the Wealth Tax Bill known at the outset.  Our opposition was based on the present state of the Irish economy, of underdevelopment, lack of capital and the fact that we want to encourage foreign assets and foreign expertise into this country.  We do not oppose wealth tax for the sake of protecting rich people. I would like to refute what Deputy Barry Desmond said about a small group in this party putting forward these proposals of a conservative nature.  We on this side of the House believe that fundamentally at this time the wealth tax is a dangerous type of taxation to introduce.  We stated at the outset&mdash;and the Minister agreed and Deputy Desmond agreed&mdash;that the amount of revenue to be collected from this tax is insignificant.  Only a few million pounds can be collected from this particular Bill.  That is of no significance to the national Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must get our facts right and see what we are talking about when we talk about capital taxation.  Are we distributing wealth?  If this was a Bill to distribute the wealth of the country &mdash;if there was wealth in the country&mdash; we on this side of the House would not oppose it.  This is why when we come to this amendment we ask the Minister to look at the present state of the <Col N="853" /> economy, the weakness of it today in comparison to some of our competitors abroad, and see that you could not pick up a worse period to introduce a Bill such as this.  We have, to a certain extent co-operated with the Minister as regards the taking of the Capital Acquistions Bill.  During the debate on the Capital Gains Tax Bill we put forward our proposals and although we criticised the Bill we did not object to the principle of it.  We regret that the amendments we introduced were not accepted.  We are talking about Bills to replace death duties.  We contend that the two Bills, the one gone through the Houses&mdash;the Capital Gains Tax Bill&mdash;and the other about to come before the House are sufficient at this time to replace the revenue which will be lost to the Exchequer on death duties.  We contend that no reason was given why a Bill of this nature should be introduced in the under-developed state of the economy and especially when we look at countries such as France and Italy and Belgium which do not tax productive assets.  They do not have wealth tax at all.  They do not consider it advisable at this stage of their development.  They are far more advanced from an industrial point of view: they have far more mineral wealth in Italy and France and in Belgium where there are huge investments from abroad at the moment.  They deem it unwise at this time to introduce this form of taxation.  Productive assets are not taxed in England.  They have their economic problems also. They are taking positive steps to remedy the situation.  They have issued a White Paper on this particular type of tax but I have not seen, over the past five or six months, any indication that they are going to introduce a tax such as this.  Surely when we look at countries such as these and compare them to the Irish economy we will see how dangerous a Bill this can be.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach have pointed out in public statements that we have lost our competitiveness abroad, that we are losing foreign markets, and the terrible consequence this will have for unemployment in this country unless <Col N="854" /> something is done about it.  I could not agree more with statements like that.  That is as we find ourselves today. The unit cost of production has gone too high.  Manufacturers told me 12 months ago that if the trend continued they would find themselves in an impossible situation in the foreign markets.  The Government have now become aware of this situation.  That should have happened six months ago.  We let time slip and lost our competitiveness abroad, but is there any reason now at this late stage that we should put a further charge on a manufacturing firm, a further charge on the shareholders of a manufacturing company or on an individual?  This is a charge of 1 per cent on productive assets, 1 per cent on a manufacturing company that finds itself today unable to compete in foreign markets.  Surely there is nothing so ludicrous and unbusiness-like as that type of approach.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Barry Desmond has mentioned, the Exchequer will not benefit to any great extent by this Bill, but it is the philosophy and the ideology that matters to Deputy Barry Desmond.  We have established a certain type of socialistic philosophy in our country and that is being practised here.  That is all Deputy Barry Desmond is concerned about.  He is not concerned about what revenue accrues to the State: he is not concerned about the detrimental effects it will have on manufacturing industry.  Once the principle is introduced, everybody must be satisfied, especially this element in the Labour Party.  I take an entirely different view to that.  I take the view that if this Bill returned a substantial amount of revenue to the Exchequer, something in the region of £60 million or £100 million I would say it might be worthwhile but a Bill like this will give to the Exchequer something in the region of £2 million or £3 million&mdash; that is all it can give&mdash;and it undermines confidence.  That is the important thing: the country lacks confidence. During a time of recession and difficulties you know perfectly well what will happen if a person despairs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> The real test of a man's ability, whether it be a worker or a person in charge of a factory, is whether he has the resilience to fight back and overcome his difficulties.  There is no doubt about it, manufacturing companies and other people in small industries are finding it very difficult today.  In the past two or three years wages, the increase in ESB charges, gas and all the other expenses which they have to meet have gone completely ahead of their production unit.  In such a situation it is impossible to expect anyone like that to carry on and keep viable.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Quite right, 489 companies, and there are many companies today that have held on.  Of course people hold on to the very last.  If there is one thing a man wants to avoid it is to go into liquidation or close down his company. He will try to secure money from his normal banking channels and if this is not possible he will try all kinds of financial institutions where he might be in a position to get certain loans at very high overdrafts.  All avenues will be exploited before a businessman goes out of business.  I know that and I am sure everybody in this House is fully aware of it.</P>
      <P>The problems of trying to satisfy the bank manager, trying to pay for goods, to meet overheads such as rents, rates, electricity and other costs are putting the pressure on business today.  What the Government should do at this time is to try to help people to stay in business and overcome their difficulties. These difficulties will be overcome because this legislation is not the end of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic chart is subject to variations.  We all know that but it takes guidance and encouragement to stabilise the situation.  When the chart goes down it all depends on the attitude of the governments and people as to how quickly it rises again.  I doubt if we have yet reached the bottom of the chart.  It is the duty of the Government to charter the economic policies of the country, to ensure that we get to <Col N="856" /> the point of upswing as quickly as possible. Other countries are already adopting positive policies to get the economic cycle going quickly.  We should try to get our business people moving along these lines but amendment No. 17 is doing the very opposite.</P>
    <P>The average businessman is, at the moment, on the down scale, and taxing productive assets will make his position worse.  This is the time the Government should be giving encouragement to him, when they should be bringing the country out of this recession. A deliberate economic policy should be drawn up.  We have wasted the time of this House since last January discussing Bills of a capital nature.  Not one job will be created by the three Bills going through the House now.  The unit costs will not be reduced and we have not enticed any new industry into the country.  If our economy was in a viable situation, if we had full employment and sufficient wealth, it would give me pleasure to come in here and talk about capital wealth and taxation.  It is very difficult to introduce a wealth tax into a country that has not got its own resources.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the Minister had to bring in a section exempting foreign assets.  Foreign companies holding trading companies in this country are exempt from wealth tax and this compares unfavourably with the situation as it will affect native Irishmen. That is why I say a wealth tax would be suitable if the biggest proportion of the wealth within the country was held by Irish shareholders or business people.  In European countries, for example in Germany, the greater part of the wealth is held within the country.  We have to devise a method whereby we exempt foreign shareholders against Irish shareholders. This is undesirable and it will have a depressing effect on Irish industrialists, manufacturers and business people.</P>
    <P>We pointed out to the Minister on several occasions that the climate at this time is totally unsuitable for the introduction of a wealth tax.  We have tried to get exemptions in various sections of the Bill.  The Opposition were deprived of sufficient time to <Col N="857" /> debate the Bill, which is of fundamental significance.  It is one of the most important Bills to come into this House since I became a Member 11 years ago.  It changes the whole capital taxation structure and it is certainly the worst Bill I have ever seen come through the House.  It will have a long-term detrimental effect on the economic expansion of the country.  There are several sections in this Bill which have never been debated in Committee Stage because the Minister and the Government were reluctant to let the people know what this Bill really contains.</P>
    <P>I do not want to move from amendment No. 17 because I want to confine my remarks to productive assets and what they really mean within the State.  I have outlined the reasons we object to the Bill.  We believe the timing is wrong.  The depression which we are experiencing at the moment will not be helped in any way when this Bill goes through this House and the Seanad within the next few weeks.  I have spoken to people throughout the country during the past few weeks and the one thing that appears to be emerging is that the people have completely lost confidence. I am not saying that as something which I have thought up while I am standing here.</P>
    <P>During the past month I have met farmers and hoteliers in the south of Ireland.  The same message is coming across loud and clear&mdash;confidence is lost.  Confidence is lost but the only thing the Government can do at this stage of our economic depression is to introduce a Bill of this nature. Surely it is negative thinking to tax productive assets.  I would ask the Minister when this House goes into recess to find out for himself what people think.  He should get away from the atmosphere of Dáil Éireann and capital taxation and talk to the ordinary people of the country.  They will tell him they lack confidence at the moment.</P>
    <P>All of us have had our ups and downs.  Business has its periods of expansion and depression but it is much easier to pull out of a depression <Col N="858" /> where there is confidence and where help is given.  It would be much easier for some of the companies who have found themselves in this siuation to pull out of their present economic difficulties if they were helped and given encouragement by the Government. It is difficult enough even with that assistance.  A businessman who has built up his factory or business over the past 25 years, who now finds himself in an economic recession with the possibility of his entire savings going into liquidation, is looking for encouragement and confidence to pull him out of this recession.  This is what the Government should be doing now.  Three hundred or 400 factories have gone into voluntary liquidation.  There are thousands at the moment who are just trying to hold their heads above water.</P>
    <P>The most detrimental thing any company or any businessman can say is that they are in financial difficulties. We all know what would be the situation with regard to creditors. Companies are trying to negotiate with banks to keep a cash flow or they are trying to negotiate with other financial institutions to try to pay wholesalers and suppliers.  How long can they stay?  It would not be very helpful for such a company to receive a letter from the Revenue Commissioners to submit their valuation for wealth tax.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am trying to point out the situation of a firm or businessmen when they receive a bill or an application from the Revenue Commissioners to submit a valuation for wealth tax. At the moment such people are not able to survive and yet the Minister is talking about wealth tax.  No businessman in his right senses would dream of introducing such a Bill at this stage of our economic depression. Evidently the Minister is not concerned about economic expansion because for him the important thing is his philosophy. Deputy Barry Desmond was very concerned about the principle he <Col N="859" /> has now established although he admits that there will be very little revenue from the tax.  I can tell the Minister and the House it will have psychological effects which will be very difficult to overcome.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to introduce the principle of a wealth tax let him search around for non-productive assets and tax them if he wants to please Deputy Desmond and his colleagues in the Labour Party.  I think that might satisfy them because they are concerned about ideologies but I am not concerned one way or the other about ideologies.  I am concerned about people and employment; I am concerned about the 103,000 unemployed. This amendment is designed to ensure that we expand industry to try to relieve them from a charge of wealth tax. Ideologies will not get a man his bread and butter or take 103,000 off the dole.</P>
      <P>We have been talking on the Wealth Tax Bill for the past four or five weeks but even at this late stage the Minister does not seem to comprehend the psychological effects this will have upon the whole country.  It certainly has had detrimental effects abroad, whether the Minister likes it or not, although I agree that further sections in the Bill have exempted shareholders who have a holding company abroad.  The attitude abroad is that the Government have reneged before on an important agreement as regards mining.  People abroad have long memories.  How do they know that they will continue to be exempted in this Bill?  It certainly has undermined confidence abroad as well as completely undermining confidence at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is even listening to us.  He seems to have gone beyond the stage of seeing the realities of life and the economic situation as we find it today.  I would advise him to forget about this, to walk around his own constituency of Rathmines and to talk to some of the business people there.  They will bring him down to earth very quickly as regards their financial situations. All you have to do is to look at the annual accounts of every <Col N="860" /> company.  In nine out of ten cases profits have gone to rock bottom over the past two-and-a-half years.  The Minister knows that.  He has only to look at the stock exchange and see where the shares have gone, to see how much the shares in the leading companies have dropped in the course of two years.  Look at the price of shares today in comparison with three years ago.  Ask any businessman if he puts up his business for sale today what he will get now in comparison with two or three years ago, not taking inflation into consideration. Unless we build a strong economic base we can forget about a good social welfare system.  A good strong comprehensive social welfare system can come only when we have a sound economic base, where we have people working.  I am sure there are 50,000 or 60,000 unemployed today who would prefer to be back at work in preference to drawing the dole.  That is what they are looking to the Government for.  A social welfare benefit should apply to the weak, the underprivileged, the orphans and those suffering from a disability.</P>
    <P>If we want to have that built up in a proper fashion let us get our economic base right.  Let us get people back to work and restore the confidence and respectability which they demand from a Government. They know well, I know and so does the Minister, that they have no desire to be in the dole queues; they want a job they can go out to in the mornings, return to their family at night time having done an honest day's work.  No amount of dole will give them that standard or that confidence.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to get the economy going along those lines, encourage more wealth into the country, he should adopt the amendment.  The encouraging of investment and restoring of confidence should be our first step. This Bill is doing the exact opposite, it is completely sapping away whatever confidence remains in the community, our business community especially. Deputy Colley is giving the Minister a last chance.  This is an important amendment.  If the Minister <Col N="861" /> changes his mind to this type of thinking people outside will respond. This is the type of leadership we want today, but if we keep the negative attitude of excessive taxation we will find that the present economic situation will get worse next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will affect everybody and especially the business people.  Last week an industrialist from a foreign country asked me how our taxation laws were.  He was not interested in grants; they were all right, but he wanted to know about the taxation laws.  I told him that Bills going through the Dáil would affect the situation.  These Bills are going to have an adverse affect on the economy.  Nobody should try and tell us anything else.  In the Midlands people are afraid to expand.  They are afraid to do anything.  They are asking: &ldquo;How is it going to affect me? What way is one going to be caught?&rdquo; Are we going to ask those who are anxious to expand where they got the money?  If one has not got the money one cannot build or do anything. Employment was brought here through the people with money.  We depend on the people with finance to get business and industry, and, above all, to give employment.</P>
      <P>Since January we have been accused by the Press, and everybody else, of holding up business in the Dáil.  We should not be accused of that because we put down a number of amendments to this Bill.  We have been reasonable and have put forward the facts, as we see them, that are going to affect the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being so Deputy Colley's amendment is reasonable.  It will be in the best interest of the community from an employment point of view.  We have factories closing, and others about to close.  Some of our biggest concerns are in serious financial difficulty and there is no use saying they will get over it.  If taxation of this nature goes through we will do nothing to bring about further employment.  Confidence is something we do not have.  People are afraid to do anything because they do not know what is going to happen. We have reneged on our mining programme <Col N="862" /> and given an undertaking to the people coming in.  Whatever can be said about them they had the money to do the job.  They gave good employment The public are hit very hard.</P>
    <P>I gave my views on the Bill earlier. It is going to have an adverse effect on employment and, above all, on industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was speaking on this amendment he inferred that we had said, and in particular that I had said, in proposing this amendment that all our economic difficulties dated from the production of the White Paper on Capital Taxation. Of course, I never said any such thing.  What I have said is that world economic circumstances of course affect us.  It is now clear that most of our competitors are operating on an inflation rate below ours, and our position is deteriorating daily.  In that context any steps open to the Government should be taken in order to get our economy moving and get people back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are limitations on what the Government can do but there are things they can do, and things they can avoid doing, which would help to get the economy moving.  They could avoid the imposition of wealth tax on productive assets.  The Minister did not attempt to suggest that the imposition of wealth tax on productive assets would create any jobs other than non-productive jobs or that it would increase growth in our economy. He could not attempt to justify that argument because it is self-evidently false.  Apart from the climate created by the imposition of wealth tax on productive assets to the extent that the wealth tax on productive assets brings in any appreciable revenue, that revenue will be charged on those productive assets and will operate either on the basis of increased prices or reduced employment of productive assets in agriculture, industry or distribution.  To that extent it will either cause the loss of jobs or prevent the creation of new ones, all of this at a time when more than ever before we need to be directing all our efforts to protecting existing <Col N="863" /> employment, creating new employment as far as we can and getting growth in our economy.  It could not be suggested that the imposition of wealth tax on productive assets will help in any way those priority areas.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made by Deputy Fitzpatrick might be worthy of consideration by the Minister if he has a political problem on his hands with some people who, for ideological reasons, feel there ought to be a wealth tax.  The imposition of wealth tax on non-productive assets might keep such people happy and solve the political problem the Minister has. We cannot afford the luxury of ideological hang-ups that some people may have if the cost of satisfying those ideological hang-ups is to add a further burden to the use of productive assets here.  We have made it clear that we disapproved strongly of the imposition of wealth tax on productive assets.  It is my considered view that the imposition of wealth tax on productive assets is crazy. Whatever reasons the Minister may have for doing this he has not attempted to justify them in economic terms; he could not possibly do so. The impossibility of doing this is highlighted by the fact that there is a Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas which proposes to pay an employment premium to employers who provide a job for persons at present unemployed.</P>
    <P>At the time I said it was an imaginative approach though it has a number of practical difficulties attached to it.  I applauded it for its imaginative approach to one of the major problems we are facing.  I cannot reconcile that imaginative approach with imposing a wealth tax on the people to whom the Minister proposes to pay this employment premium.</P>
    <P>The whole concept involved in applying the wealth tax to productive assets is not alone economically unsound but is one that is being forced on the country because of the ideological hang-ups of a small number of people.  Few, if any, of the people who are pushing this are themselves <Col N="864" /> creators of employment.  Few of them understand the factors that go into achieving growth in our economy. Few of them will be personally affected if further unemployment results. It is a luxury that these people can afford to indulge, but it is not a luxury that our economy in general can afford to indulge.  This amendment provides a last opportunity for the Minister to show a little sense in regard to the management of our economy and what it requires.  The last thing it requires is the imposition of an additional tax of this nature totally without regard to whether the assets subjected to the tax are being used productively or non-productively.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that he has provision in the Bill to give some relief to assets which are being used productively, but the relief is not very significant.  What is significant is the mentality which would impose this tax at this time on productive assets on which we are all depending if we are ever to get out of the appalling economic situation we are in today.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that although he is being afforded the opportunity by this amendment to take wealth tax off productive assets, and, if necessary, to apply them to non-productive assets in order to satisfy those who seem to have this ideological hang-up in this regard, he is not prepared to do this.  If that is so the consequences will be serious. It may be difficult to measure those consequences because of all the other factors operating adversely to our economy at the moment.  But the imposition of wealth tax on productive assets will not help.  On the contrary, it will hinder even further our prospects of recovery.  If the Minister persists in going ahead with his proposal, then, as we said at the beginning and say now at the end, we think this is crazy.  The consequences flowing from persisting in this misguided proposal rest on the shoulders of the Minister for Finance, and his colleagues, and on the Government Deputies who go into the division lobby to support this proposal, not on this side of the House, for we have done our best to highlight the misguided <Col N="865" /> nature of the thinking behind this, of the inappropriateness of it in our present circumstances.  If we have failed it is because the Minister has a <Col N="866" /> majority behind him who are prepared to support this proposal.  On their heads be it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) In estimating the market value of shares in a company part of the assets of which do not constitute taxable wealth the total value of the shares shall be reduced by the same proportion as such assets bear to the total assets of the company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We discussed a similar amendment on the previous Stage and the Minister refused to accept it.  I hope that now he has given more thought to the matter he might be prepared to reconsider it.  It is ridiculous to provide, as we do in section 7, for the exemption of various items from wealth tax and then to refuse to exempt them if they form part of the assets of a company, be it a trading company or a non-trading company.  That is what will happen unless this amendment is accepted.  The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In estimating the market value of shares in a company part of the assets of which do not constitute taxable wealth the total value of the shares shall be reduced by the same proportion as such assets bear to the total assets of the company.</P>
      <P>One would have thought the logic of this was self-evident, but the Minister refused to agree to this proposition before on the ground that other factors come into the valuation of shares and the underlying assets.  That is true, of course.  Nevertheless, if one takes the situation in which, say, 50 per cent of the assets of a company consist of exempted properties, for simplicity sake let us say bloodstock, you cannot pretend that if one were to take that 50 per cent out of the valuation, it would make no difference to the valuation of the shares.  Of course it would.  But the fact is that in so far as the shares were assessed for wealth tax on the basis of market value, particularly if one takes the shares quoted on the Stock Exchange, that quotation takes no account of the items which are excluded for the purpose of wealth tax, because they are being valued for two different purposes altogether.  If one takes the value of shares as being their quoted value on the Stock Exchange, which is what the Bill provides for, then in doing that one is not taking account of the extent to which the assets of the company may consist of exempted property.</P>
      <P>I suggest that to provide in section 7 for the exemption of certain properties, at the same time not to provide that such exemptions will operate in regard to the valuation of shares where that property is held by a company, is inconsistent and, indeed, ridiculous.  To suggest that we are giving that exemption when, in fact, we are not giving it if the property is held by the company, is, to say the very least, misleading.  In effect, shareholders in companies are being deprived of the alleged exemptions on various kinds of property provided in section 7.  It could be argued that it is not possible to take into account in calculating the value of shares the exemption of certain property. I do not accept that.  It may be difficult but it certainly is not impossible. To say that because of difficulty we should not do it at all is to say that we are not going to give exemptions as provided in section 7 to shareholders in a company, trading or non-trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should make up his mind whether he is proposing to exempt the items listed in section 7, or that <Col N="869" /> he proposes to exempt them only if they are in the hands of an individual and not if they form part of the assets of a company.  There is no excuse, in my view, for purporting to exempt those items in section 7 if, in fact, one is not doing so in all circumstances.  If one is not doing so in all circumstances the Bill should say so.  It does not say that but it works out in practice, without this amendment, that that is what is going to happen as far as shareholders are concerned.</P>
    <P>I believe that the valuation of shares should take account of underlying assets which are exempt for the purpose of wealth tax.  If the Minister thinks that is not a sound proposition then the Bill should contain a provision to make that clear.  In my view, the correct approach is to accept this amendment which will at least, whatever the difficulties involved, make it possible to take account of that exemption. I repeat that the valuation of shares and the ascertainment of the market value of shares for the purpose of wealth tax, particularly in the case of quoted securities, cannot, by definition, take account of the exemption provided in section 7.  We are dealing with two different things here.  The Bill should recognise this and take account of it.  Anything else is misleading. Therefore, I urge the Minister to accept this amendment now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of serious fundamental reasons why the amendment should not be entertained, and there are a number of practical difficulties which would arise even if it were accepted.  The amendment concerns itself with the valuation of shares in a company.  It is, therefore, dealing with the valuation of shares in all companies which do not come within the meaning of a private non-trading company within the meaning of section 6.  The reason for this is that, as we saw when discussing section 6, a private non-trading company is itself an assessable person, and its assets, as such, are liable.  The assets are the taxable wealth of the private non-trading company.  In any case, therefore, where assets are not taxable wealth, <Col N="870" /> for instance, where assets are exempt, they are not liable in the hands of a private non-trading company.  Trading companies as such, whether they are public or private, are not themselves liable to wealth tax.  The shares of such companies are liable to wealth tax, only if such shares are held by persons who themselves have total taxable property in excess of the thresholds.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to reduce the value of shares in trading companies in cases where the assets include assets which would be exempt if held by an individual.  This suggestion is not acceptable for three reasons, primarily.  The amendment proposes that the value of the shares be reduced by the same proportion as the exempted assets bear to the total assets of a company.  This assumes, quite wrongly, that the shares of a company are valued on an assets basis.  I pointed this out to Deputy Colley on the Committee Stage and I am disappointed that he has not yet grasped the significance of that.  In valuing shares, underlying assets are but one of the many elements which have to be taken into account in addition to the company's current performance, past history, future prospects, dividend record, nature of its product, market conditions, liquidity, gearing and so forth.  To isolate the whole or part of the underlying assets of a company from all the other constituents which go to make up the value of a share and then to apply an exemption to certain assets and have that exemption reflected in the value of the shares would be virtually impossible. It would be particularly difficult, indeed it would be impossible, where shares are quoted on a stock exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason why the amendment is not acceptable is that, even if it were possible, it would present virtually insoluable valuation problems for both the public and the private sector.  The conflicting issues and problems that would arise would not be irreconcilable.  Thirdly, the amendment is of little practical significance as the majority of the exemptions apply to assets which would not <Col N="871" /> normally be owned by a trading company such as a private dwellinghouse and its effects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The exemptions Deputy Colley has in mind purport to cover those I take it.  Perhaps not, but if you examine the various exemptions in the Bill most would not be taken into account.  Superannuation benefits or their funds, artistic objects, gardens, growing timber are things not normally the property of a trading company. We debated on the Committee Stage whether superannuation benefits or their funds were the property of companies.  I pointed out to Deputy Colley that they were not, they were the property of the beneficiaries. Deputy Colley had some difficulty in accepting that contention but it is a true one and, therefore, superannuation benefits would not be calculable as part of the property of a trading company.</P>
      <P>Exemption from tax can be given only to property which is liable to the tax.  Since the property comprised in a trading company is not liable to tax an exemption cannot be applied to it.  The shareholders who own shares which are liable to tax are not themselves entitled to the underlying property.  The underlying property is the property of the company and not of the shareholders and therefore, the shareholders are not entitled to any exemptions to which an owner of the property as such would be entitled.  The Deputy's suggestion is that you see through the company, as it were, right on to the shareholders. That is breaching a fundamental principle of the laws of property.  The assets of the company belong to the company, not to the shareholders.  They may be reflected in the value of the shares but that is only one of the factors which are reflected in the value of the shares.  I am sure Deputy Colley accepts that there are many elements in share valuations far beyond the assets.</P>

      <P>The number of cases <Col N="872" /> involved must be very small indeed. I would accept that that is no reason for not doing the right thing, if it is the right thing to do.  If one person is to benefit by doing right then we have an obligation to consider his position fully. The number of occasions when an exempted property would be held by trading companies in such a significant way as would be reflected in the shares would be exceedingly rare.  It would not justify, to my mind, doing violence to the fundamental and logical elements in the tax.  Besides, the productive assets relief for the shares themselves, in addition to all the other relieving elements in the tax, will ensure that hardship cannot arise for any shareholder in a trading company by not applying exemptions to underlying property.</P>
      <P>We have provided so many exemptions, concessions and reliefs in this wealth tax as to greatly undermine its effectiveness as a revenue collector. Having done so much, it seems to me we must take a serious look at the Bill and consider whether it is prudent to go any further with reliefs and exemptions. I am satisfied it would not be prudent to do so.  We will have, when this Bill goes through, the softest wealth tax in the world.  There is not the like of it anywhere else.  Yet I doubt if any other country has debated at such interminable length a tax which will touch very few.  If it touches them at all it is because they are unusually fortunate to have property in excess of most people.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister would be able to tell the Deputy better, but I will give him the information I have at my disposal.  If VAT on furniture was reduced it would mean that VAT on many other articles would have to be reduced as well.

For instance, bed clothes, curtains and furnishings generally would have to be reduced.  That is why we cannot make fish of one and flesh of another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners held it under lease since 27th October, 1948, and the present landlord is William Molloy who purchased the premises in 1960.  In 1960 negotiations were entered into with Mr. Molloy for the purchase of a site for a new station but the matter was deferred at his request due to road widening by Sligo County Council and also pending a decision by the Department of Justice on the future policing arrangements for the area.  In September, 1973, the Department of Justice informed the Commissioners of their revised requirements and asked them to acquire a site.  A site was brought to the notice of the Garda and offered in response to an advertisement and agreement was finally reached in November, 1974, for the purchase for £2,000 of a site offered by Mr. Molloy.  The agreement for sale is being executed and it is hoped the legal formalities will be completed shortly.  The existing premises will be surrendered by Mr. Molloy when the new station is completed. It was not, therefore, really the fault of the Ministry of Justice.</P>

      <P>While I accept that the gap between farm incomes and other incomes was declining up to 1973, I find it difficult to understand why the Minister is not able to tell the House what the average income can be estimated at since the Agricultural Institute have seemingly had very little difficulty in determining that the average income of farmers in 1974 was £1,500 and this must represent a very considerable decline on incomes in previous years. Assuming that the Minister admits, as he does rather reluctantly, that there is a very sharp widening of the gap between farming and other incomes, could he tell the House what steps the Government have in mind to remedy the situation?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries why the Malohiffe ED in County Kerry was not included in the disadvantaged areas scheme, having regard to the low incomes, the size of the holdings and the fact that the quality of the land in this area is less than the national level.</P>

      <P>As part of County Kerry, Molahiffe district electoral <Col N="881" /> division is included among the areas designated as disadvantaged for the purposes of the EEC directive and farmers there will be eligible for special assistance in the form of extra investment aids.

      <P>I think the Deputy knows that the same group of people made the decisions in Kerry and all over the country and that they used all available data to try to decide what were the disadvantaged areas.  He also knows that there is continuing provision for review in any area where people feel they have been wrongly treated.  It is not sufficient for part of an electoral division to be severely handicapped to have the whole division included.  You are not allowed to include part of a division.  It has to be the whole division and if a small part of it qualifies it cannot be included on that basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike other Community countries, over four-fifths of Ireland's production of beef has to be exported in one form or another. This involves substantial transport and marketing costs which are reflected in a lower market price here.</P>
      <P>I might, indeed, say that the difference between the Irish and UK prices is somewhat greater than is indicated by the reference prices as the quoted UK figure does not include the slaughter and variable premia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of price for cattle here is, of course, one of the matters being looked into by the review body on <Col N="888" /> intervention.  An interim report has recently been furnished by that body and is at present being examined by my Department.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that reference prices in the United Kingdom and in Ireland tend to be much lower than on the Continent? In England, Wales and Scotland the United Kingdom farmers have the advantage of the variable premium payment which makes up the difference between the actual market price and the level to which it would need to be compensated in order to bring it to the guide price but farmers here and in the North of Ireland have no such advantage.

      <P>The Minister should not attempt to obscure the question by bringing in the export refund that arises from the different devaluation of the green £ that operates in the United Kingdom and the south of Ireland.  I am talking about the difference in the level of the variable <Col N="889" /> premium that has been introduced by the United Kingdom for the whole of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, in view of (a) the rapid strides being made in Great Britain towards greater self-sufficiency in beef and the consequent likelihood of a smaller market there for Irish cattle and beef and (b) the increasing monetary taxes on Irish beef and cattle going to the Continent, he will indicate the prospects for Irish cattle producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the trend towards increased beef production in the United Kingdom and of the problems which monetary compensatory amounts create for our cattle and beef industry.  I am, nevertheless, convinced that the long-term prospects for our cattle producers are good.  A recent study forecasts that the EEC will in 1980 have an export surplus of only 29,000 metric tons of beef despite an increase over 1975 estimated production of 385,000 metric tons, including an extra 60,000 tons in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly sought to have the disadvantages of the MCA system for this country eased and my efforts have met with success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the Irish beef industry will need to look more closely at continental markets and sell more actively? Would it not be better for the Government to induce the Irish fresh meat industry to sell on the Continent and, if necessary, to spend some of the enormous profits made last year rather than have that industry <Col N="890" /> taxed in order to subsidise the cost of living for the benefit of other members of the community?  Would it not be better to invest their earnings in a sales campaign on the Continent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy on the need for a greater effort to sell on the Continent but the prospects now are much better since we got the devaluation in the representative rate of the Irish pound and because of the improvement in sterling. We are now in a much better position to compete on the Continent and I hope our people will take advantage of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the connection which the Deputy makes between the present prices for calves and what he asserts to be the virtual elimination of beef-suckler herds.  The latter assertion is in any event not borne out by figures for applications under the beef cattle incentive scheme.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the price problems relating to calves and young cattle.  It is my aim to secure equitable distribution of the benefits of the intervention and slaughter premium systems amongst all producers of cattle and I have set up a review body to advise me on how this might be done.  Already that body has submitted an interim report to me which I am having examined.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the problems I referred to in my question will not go away by the incantation of pious platitudes?  I base my assertion on the fact that cow slaughterings last year were more than three times the normal annual slaughterings and the undeniable fact that calf prices have dropped to nothing. Does the Minister not agree that it is a reasonable assumption that the purchasers of calves who maintained the price of calves up to now were the beef-suckler herd owners?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Some decrease took place in cattle prices in early July, influencing factors being the effects of drought, larger numbers of animals coming forward for slaughter and seasonal dullness in the UK trade. The market has since improved and substantial price supports are available in the form of intervention purchases of up to 50 per cent of eligible factory throughput, the EEC slaughter premium on all other eligible clean cattle and the additional variable premium paid on our live clean cattle and beef imports into the UK.</P>

It is like a yo-yo business at the marts and elsewhere; they can take what they like unless competition comes from England. It is that which has put up the price.

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult, at this stage, as the relevant statistics are not yet available, to arrive at a reliable estimate of the quantity of hay and silage saved.  It is certain, however, because of the ideal weather conditions that the tonnage already saved is of good quality and field and storage losses will be minimal.  The availability of adequate feed next winter will depend a good deal on growing conditions for the rest of the season and also on the amount of silage saved in the autumn.  Pressure on available supplies will, I expect, be decreased as a result of increases in the number of animals slaughtered and exported live in the first half of this year as compared with the corresponding period of 1974.</P>

      <P>I was explaining the great difficulties which would arise if the suggestion contained in the amendment were to be entertained and Deputy de Valera posed to me the specific question as to what problems of valuation would arise.  As Deputy Colley acknowledges there are many aspects to the valuation of company shares.  Valuation of underlying assets is a somewhat easier matter to determine if each asset can be valued in isolation but if, having made your valuation of the shares, you were to proceed to subtract the market value of a particular asset or try to make an apportionment you could well end up with a figure for the shares which would be quite artificial and quite different from the market price of those shares if the shares were to be sold on the open market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be different because the market value does not have regard to exemptions under section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that it should be different but it would be a coincidence if it turned out to be the same.  It would be very seldom that they would be exactly the same because, of course, share values can often not be even the equal of the <Col N="941" /> underlying assets.  There is frequently argument about whether or not shares are properly valued having regard to the value of underlying assets.  Quite clearly all these problems would be multiplied if the suggestion were entertained. I would respectfully suggest that the amendment is not well founded and, therefore, there is no need to concern ourselves with the problems of valuation.  I do not imagine it is necessary for me to go into any illustration of the points I have made.  I think they are self-evident and from what Deputy Colley has said about the asset value and the share value not coinciding I think he understands the specific problems which would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the problems but I do not accept that they are insoluble as the Minister seems to suggest.  The Minister said before the break that he felt it would be most unusual to have a company whose assets included the items exempted by section 7.  I do not think this is so. For instance a trading company which is engaged in farming would certainly be likely to have a considerable amount of its assets consisting of livestock coming under the exemption in subsection (1) (c) of section 7.  I already mentioned the possibility of a company having as a considerable portion of its assets bloodstock coming under paragraph (d).  It is quite unrealistic to say that where such assets are held by a company no account should be taken of the various exemptions in section 7.  In effect that is what the Minister is saying as I understand him.  Quite apart from the difficulties which he has referred to he is saying it would be wrong anyway to give this relief.  That does not seem to me to be correct but anyway if the Minister intends the exemption in section 7 to apply only where the assets are held by an individual then the section should say so.  The Minister will note that the exemption in relation to a dwellinghouse is specifically confined to an individual.  The exemption in respect of livestock is confined to a person&mdash;which, of course, includes a company&mdash;who is a farmer within the meaning of section 10.  Bloodstock is <Col N="942" /> exempt without any qualification at all but what the Minister is saying is that, in effect, none of these exemptions is to be available except where the property concerned is in the hands of an individual, that if it is in the hands of a company it is not to be available.  If that is what the Minister's intention is I think the Bill should say so.  It does not say it.  For the reasons I have indicated I do not think it should say it but if that is what the intention is the Bill should say that. Where it specifically confines some exemptions to an individual and then, in other cases, does not mention any limitation the clear implication is that where no limitation is mentioned it is intended to be available to any taxpayer as defined in the Bill.  In practice that is not so and the Minister has indicated that his intention is that it should not be so.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances I would suggest that section 7 is defective to the extent that it does not make clear that that is what is intended.  Indeed it may well be argued in due course that because of that difference in approach in section 7 the meaning of section 7, for instance in the case of bloodstock, is to apply the exemption to all possible taxpayers under this Bill.  There may be some interesting court cases arising out of this.  The acceptance of my amendment or alternatively the clear statement in section 7 that it is intended only to apply property in the hands of individuals would obviate such a risk but the Minister does not seem to be prepared to accept either.  It may be that the Minister is becoming enamoured of ambiguous statements.  He is certainly engaging in that in this section in refusing the amendment and refusing to spell out in the section what he has said in the House.  Either way it is unfortunate but I do not wish to take up any more time on this matter when it is quite clear that the Minister does not intend to accept it or to amend the section to correspond with what he says is the intention.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 42, after &ldquo;each&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;such&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is concerned with subsection (1) of section 9 which deals with the valuation of shares in a private trading company held by an assessable person who controls such a company.  In the course of the Committee Stage, it was pointed out that the subsection as drafted was ambiguous and, as the Deputy knows, I do not like ambiguity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was pointed out that the subsection was ambiguous in that it was capable of being read in reference to all the shares of the company and not, as was intended, to the shares in the hands of an assessable person who had control. The amendment removes the ambiguity and makes the position clear. The section applies only to shares in the hands of the assessable person who has control of the company.  This is done by the interpolation of the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; with the result that the section refers to the market value of these &ldquo;such&rdquo; shares&mdash;that is the shares referred to in the immediately preceding lines, namely, those, and I quote:</P>
      <P>included in the taxable wealth of an assessable person on a valuation date.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley's amendment No. 20 is designed to produce the same result but, with respect, I would suggest to him that the words he has added to the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; are not required in the circumstances and the insertion of the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; suffices to achieve clarification of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister says, both his amendment and mine are designed to do the same thing.  The only question which arises is do they, in fact, both do it and, if so, of course the Minister's amendment is the one <Col N="944" /> that should be accepted.  I must confess to having some doubts as to whether the Minister's amendment does what he wishes it to do and I think my amendment leaves it beyond any doubt.  If the Minister looks at the subsection, it reads:</P>
      <P>Where there are included in the taxable wealth of an assessable person on a valuation date shares in a private trading company which is a company controlled by that assessable person on that date, the market values of each such share&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Now it will read with the Minister's amendment in&mdash;</P>
      <P>shall be ascertained, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
      <P>I think the Minister said that &ldquo;each such share&rdquo; would then be referring to the share in the taxable wealth of an assessable person.  That is clearly the intention.  I would suggest to the Minister that it could be read as meaning &ldquo;each such share&rdquo; as referring to the shares in a private trading company which is owned by that assessable person.  This was the original cause of the ambiguity and the reason why we were trying to clarify it.  I am suggesting to the Minister that, although the wording in my amendment is longer, it is clearer.  It would read:</P>
      <P>each such share included in the taxable wealth of that assessable person...</P>
      <P>That leaves no room for doubt as to what is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significance of all this, of course, as the Minister appreciates, is that unless we make it quite clear what is intended the result would be that a minority shareholder would find his shares being valued for the purpose of wealth tax as though he controlled the company when in fact he does not.  I am suggesting to the Minister that, even with his amendment, the references to &ldquo;each such share&rdquo; can be interpreted as &ldquo;each such share in a private trading company controlled by the assessable person&rdquo; whereas in my amendment &ldquo;each such share included in the taxable wealth of that assessable person&rdquo; leaves no room at all for doubt. <Col N="945" /> For that reason, I would urge the Minister to accept my amendment No. 20 rather than his amendment No. 19.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My natural inclination to be humble would lead me to accept the Deputy's amendment if it had greater merit than my own, but I am satisfied that the one word I seek to insert achieves the goal we both have in mind.  I would point out that the word &ldquo;shares&rdquo; in line 40 refers only to shares which are included in the taxable wealth of an assessable person on the valuation date.  Therefore, the words which Deputy Colley seeks to insert after the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; are already in the subsection and the shares can relate only to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where they are included in the taxable wealth of an assessable person on a valuation date: what are we considering as being included? Shares of an assessable person on a valuation date&mdash;only shares in a private trading company which is a company controlled by that assessable person on that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, but where part of the taxable wealth includes shares in a private trading company which is controlled by the assessable person, that is when the whole operation arises.  Then when we refer to &ldquo;each such share&rdquo;, cannot that reference to &ldquo;each such share&rdquo; be to shares in a private trading company controlled by the assessable person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But, if they are included, then the reference can be to the shares&mdash;in other words, all the shares in a private trading company. The subsection only arises if some of the shares in a private trading company so controlled are in the taxable wealth of an assessable person; otherwise it does not arise at all.  But, once it does arise, is there not the possibility <Col N="946" /> that the reference to &ldquo;each such share&rdquo; could refer to shares in the private trading company with which we are concerned?  However, I will not delay the House on this amendment.  It is an effort at clarification. If the Minister is satisfied, well and good, but I take another view.  I suppose eventually it will be sorted out in another place.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 25, to delete &ldquo;having ceased to be&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;not being&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a textual amendment which was suggested on the Committee Stage as preferable to the original draft.  The purpose of the subsection is to deem a company to be a controlled company (1) if it was controlled by an assessable person on a valuation date, or (2) if it was controlled at any time in the previous 12 months but was not so controlled on the valuation date, it again becomes so controlled at any time in the subsequent 12 months.  The subsection deals, therefore, with two situations: First, where there is control on the valuation date or, secondly, where there is no control on the date but there is such control in the 12 months before and after that date.  As drafted, it is arguable that the ceasing takes place on the valuation date which of course is not what is intended and would make the subsection practically meaningless.  I think Deputy Colley mentioned this on the Committee Stage.  The amendment clarifies the matter and improves the text as the contrasting situations are brought out more clearly.  For instance, line 10 will read:</P>
      <P>controlled by that person on that date</P>
      <P>and line 13 will read:</P>
      <P>not being so controlled by that person on that date.</P>

      <P>In page 16 to delete lines 52 and 53, and lines 58 to 60, and in page 17 to delete lines 1 to 3, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  in the case of an individual other than&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  an individual to whom paragraph (a) applies, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  a minor child to whom the proviso to this section applies,</P>
      <P>a sum of £70,000&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a little difficult to deal with this. This is, in fact, the third of a set of amendments I put down, all of which were aimed at the same thing but, of necessity, they had to appear at different parts of the Bill.  The object of the three amendments together was to create a framework in the Bill on <Col N="948" /> the basis of which a married woman would be treated under this Bill as an individual in her own right and not merely as a chattel of her husband. The particular effect of this amendment would be to provide for individuals in the case of the thresholds being provided.  Under the Bill, as it stands, individuals are divided into different categories, the first being a married man living with his wife and that includes the wife; she is automatically included in that category. The second is the widow or widower and the third is a minor child.  This amendment seeks to provide that the individual would be only a minor child, a widow or a widower or any other individual thereby ensuring, as I say, that a married woman would be treated as an individual in her own right.  The effect would be that the threshold would remain as in the Bill in the case of the widow or widower but, in the case of a married couple taken as individuals, each would have the same thresholds as either a single person or separated persons.  If you take them together they would have the sum of the two single thresholds but, in fact, the effect of this would be that they would not be taken together but taken, as I said, as individuals.</P>
    <P>There would be a number of cases, I presume, in which, as a result of this amendment, people would pay more wealth tax than they would under the Bill.  That would arise in the case where the property or the bulk of the property in a family was held by the husband.  Nevertheless it seems to me&mdash; and the Minister has used this argument frequently on this Bill&mdash;that people could re-arrange their affairs if they wanted to.  It is more important in my view to establish the principle in this Bill, a new Bill dealing with the new tax, starting in 1975, that a married woman should be treated as an individual in her own right and we should avoid the kind of anomalies arising under the Bill whereby there is a bigger threshold in the case of a married couple who are separated or in the case of two single people than there is in the case of a married couple living together.  Furthermore, it avoids, <Col N="949" /> taking the other amendment with it and the framework it provides, the whole problem of a married woman's property being included in the wealth of her husband, whether she wishes it or not, making the husband liable to account to the Revenue Commissioners for that property and, therefore, entitled in order to fulfil his statutory obligations to know all about it and have all the details of it.  It avoids the situation which arises under the Bill in which the husband not only has to account for his wife's property to the Revenue Commissioners but he has to pay the wealth tax on it.  I indicated before the situation that arises where, if the wife is the one who has the property and the husband has little or none, nevertheless, under the terms of the Bill, the husband is the one who is accountable to the Revenue Commissioners for the valuation of the property and is also accountable for paying the tax on it.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is an acceptable approach today and this amendment is part of a series of amendments I put down designed to remedy that situation and produce under the Bill an approach in which the married woman is treated as a separate individual and is treated equally with all other individuals except, on the one hand, widows or widowers or, on the other, minor children, who require separate treatment.  But the real significance of it is that she is treated as an individual in her own right equal in all respects to her husband, to her single friends or neighbours, be they male or female, and to her separated friends or neighbours, be they male or female.  That is the right approach to adopt today.  I regret that the Minister so far has refused to agree with this approach.  I have not any doubt it is the approach that should be incorporated in this Bill being passed in 1975.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Colley is still tempted to roll along on the women's lib bandwagon particularly when acceptance of his amendment would do a very serious disservice to all families.  In our capital legislation we have been very careful <Col N="950" /> to protect the family.  We have respected the normal Irish wealth producing situation which is in a family situation.  There is not much tendency in Ireland to fragment holdings or capital between individual members of a family or between married couples.  The tendency is to hold the property in a family situation.  It may be in the name of one person for generations.  It may be broken up at different times.  But it is convenient to have it in one name.  The consequence of accepting the amendments of Deputy Colley would be to confer benefit upon the wealthier families while doing a disservice to a family of more modest means.  By having a family threshold&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The family threshold of £100,000 and £2,500 for each child means that the family can enjoy the potential threshold of not less than £100,000.  Four children would add £10,000, in a family situation.  If Deputy Colley's amendment were accepted the result would be that the family wealth threshold would only be £70,000 plus whatever children there might be unless both spouses were fortunate enough to hold individual wealth of more than £70,000 each.  It could then rise to £140,000. But that is not a normal situation.  It occurs, and one does not speak with any hostility towards or envy those in that position but it is not a normal situation for separate holdings of wealth to exist in family situations of that kind.  I would not consider that we would be justified in introducing an amendment to deal with an exceptional situation in Irish circumstances if as a result of doing that we were to harm the normal family situation.  It is in the interests of the family I am speaking now and I consider that to be the most important aspect of this proposal.  It would be against the family interest to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to abandon the treatment of the family as a unit we would encourage fragmentation, and mitigation or avoidance of wealth tax <Col N="951" /> would be all too easy by collusive action between members of a closely-knit family.  Confirmation of the necessity to avoid that is available from all the wealth tax systems in Europe where the wealth of husband and wife are aggregated.  That happens even in societies where broken marriages are more frequent than in Irish society.  It happens in countries where individual wealth ownership of husband and wife is more frequent than is the norm in Ireland.</P>
    <P>No other country even approaches the generous thresholds of exemption which we are providing for individuals, married couples or widows.  No country identifies the widow as a person deserving a higher threshold than a single person except Ireland, with a threshold of £90,000 for a widow and £70,000 for a single person.  The comparisons, are relevant so that it can be seen how fairly treated they are in this country.  The threshold in Luxembourg is £1,100 and the home and its contents are not exempt.  The next highest to us is Denmark with a threshold of £31,500 and no exemption for the home and its contents.  These are the realities of the European situation. These are the realities of the comparisons, so it can be seen that both the individual and the family are being very gently treated in the context of the Irish wealth tax.</P>
    <P>The proposal to grant a separate threshold to a husband and wife is not attractive for the following reasons.  In the majority of households only one spouse is the person who holds the wealth, be it a farm, business or property.  Such a person holds the property and works it in trust for the family.  That is the normal practice.  It does not have to be put in joint names in order to have property used for the benefit of the family.  In all these cases the family would lose if the amendment were accepted.  The wife would lose as much as the husband because the net money left in the family would be less.  The family would lose because the threshold would be reduced from £100,000 to £70,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> The amendment would discriminate against the husband or wife whose spouse had no taxable wealth.  It would favour those families where both spouses had wealth.  They occur, but they are not the norm.</P>
    <P>The existence of separate thresholds would put undesirable pressure in many cases on farmers or businessmen to place their property in joint names for purely fiscal purposes.  It might be desirable socially; it might be an actual response to natural love and affection; it might be the proper way to manage a family fortune to put it in joint names.  These are all good reasons for doing it, but a bad reason for doing it would be for fiscal purposes. The effect of this amendment would be to force people to make decisions in relation to family fortunes for fiscal purposes only.  Sometimes the circumstances of a family require that family wealth be held in one name until such time as an appropriate decision can be made regarding the disposal of the family fortune.  As regards the family where the wife has as crucial a part to play as the husband and in which the children are as vital a part as either of the married parties I must reluctantly decline to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This, like other parts of the Bill not only appears to be something like a long playing record but we are getting to the stage when it is like a tune that goes round and round in our heads and we cannot get rid of it.  The Minister has repeated the same things and we are urging the same things and we do not seem to be making any progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two fundamental, related points here.  I feel that the Minister is changing from one to the other when convenient for the purpose of his argument. The status and position of the married woman in regard to property ownership and the threshold are the points at issue here.  One can be invoked against the other or with the other.  In fact, the Minister has invoked the thresholds to support this argument in that he argues that a husband would be, under this amendment, worse off in a particular way where the threshold is <Col N="953" /> concerned than under the Bill.  I think Deputy Colley would agree with this. But this depends on what the thresholds are.  As we have gone into this in very great detail in Committee it should be sufficient to try to recall the kernel which is composed of the two points I have mentioned, the position of the married woman in regard to property-owning and the question of thresholds.</P>
    <P>The difficulty that the Minister has propounded can, I submit in one regard at least, be solved by a simple adjustment of the threshold.  The Minister will come back on his own argument: I gave so much, why not give more?  Here, it is the Minister himself who talked about certain fundamental principles.  He has expanded at great length about the family and the necessity for keeping the family as a unit.  I recall that on the Committee Stage he referred to what he was giving the family in such eulogistic terms that it evoked from this side of the House the comment: to the extent of docking them £40,000.</P>
    <P>We have two things here and for clarity I will try to keep them separate.  At the end, in resolving the dilemma we come back to the simple solution that if you treat the word individual in its natural sense and attach it to the threshold sum of £70,000 then you have practically overcome all your problems: it is a question of drafting after that.</P>
    <P>Let me, therefore, deal with the position of married women where property is concerned.  Deputies have accused us of jumping on the Women's Lib bandwagon.  The Minister can put it whatever way he likes but it does not get away from the fact that we are living in an age when more and more equality of women generally, whether married or otherwise, is a matter of social importance and a feature of our social life, and to recognise it has come to the stage of being a necessity for social stability.  Why should a married woman not be treated, where a property is concerned in any event&mdash; and I am strictly confining myself to that&mdash;like anybody else?  She is competent <Col N="954" /> to hold a property in her own right.  She is utterly competent to dispose of it as far as property is concerned. She is very much <i>sui juris.</i> It is only under the accidents of the law, either by history in particular cases or by legislation such as under the Succession Act&mdash;which, incidentally, applies to both spouses&mdash;that the right to property disposition as well as property-ownership is restricted.</P>
    <P>If that is so, if she is fully competent to hold property, fully competent to dispose of that property, fully the proprietor of that property in every sense, I fail to see why she should not be fully competent where taxation is concerned and why she should not have whatever benefits are going where taxation is concerned.  It has been an old complaint, and I do not want to go into the Income Tax Acts, that a married woman who is earning and living with her husband is at a disadvantage already for income tax purposes.  This case has been made and I think there is some substance to it.  That is not directly germane to what we are talking about now.  But there has been a great deal of talk about this.  There have been representations, I believe, to Ministers and Governments in this matter before now.  So, why, in a Bill of this nature, do we perpetuate that kind of thinking?  Why do we still, even with the very laudable&mdash;from a traditional and even constitutional point of view &mdash;sentiments of the Minister in regard to the institution of marriage and the family degrade women?  It seems to me that the principle should be accepted that if she is accountable for her property, competent in every way to own and dispose of it, she should be held responsible physically for it as well and therefore fully entitled to taxation reliefs as well as any other individual married or unmarried, married and living with her husband or separated.</P>
    <P>These cases have been provided for in this Bill.  We have pointed out on Committee Stage that because of this mistaken approach&mdash;very understandable for traditional reasons, and perhaps supported by the sentiments expressed by the Minister when it is <Col N="955" /> not examined more deeply&mdash;we have had to bring in some extraordinary anomalies like the position which we referred to in the Committee Stage of people who are separated.  Why does all this arise?  It arises in theory, it would appear, because of the Minister's approach as adumbrated here today and before this by himself and the Minister for Lands on his behalf.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether this approach that has been so emphasised by the Minister has not been an <i>ex post facto</i> justification of something that just happened because of, shall I say, the normal or traditional or conventional approach to this problem in taxation law.  That is no reflection whatever on the people who drafted or inspired this legislation in the first instance.  It is one of the reasons why it is reviewed by both Houses of Parliament.  It is a very necessary practical ingredient in the making of law.</P>
    <P>With all that the Minister adverted to from the theoretical point of view, I am just wondering if this was in mind when the Bill was drafted.  I am rather inclined to think that the approach in this Bill was the conventional, traditional, one and that limits were fixed.  There were three categories, married, widowed, single. When the married category was considered again there had to be provision for spouses living together or separated.  The logic of including the widower in the scheme has not been touched on and there is no point in going into that now.  In the case of the single person, that was the case of the individual <i>simpliciter,</i> and no doubt that was the baseline taken.  From this all the rest of the consequences flow.</P>
    <P>So much for the theoretical approach. From the practical point of view, I do not think the Minister would be putting up all the obstacles if in the actual approach the figures had been worked on the basis of so much for the individual with a double allowance for married people.  If that had been done many of the difficulties we have been discussing would disappear and the Minister might be more amenable to the current pleas in regard to the <Col N="956" /> status of women.  He gets into difficulties because he will not increase the allowance to £140,000 for a married couple.</P>
    <P>It is going a little bit outside the terms of the amendment to argue that the limit for a married couple should be £140,000 and not £100,000.  It is not going to mean an awful lot to the Exchequer but it would mean a great deal in simplification of the approach in principle that the Minister has talked about.  At the moment this threshold might not be of very great consequence but I am always hopeful of a brighter future.  The difficulty the Minister and Deputy Colley saw, that in certain circumstances a married pair might be worse off under the provisions of the Bill, would disappear. The temptation to fractionate would disappear and many of the Minister's arguments would be answered.</P>
    <P>I simply cannot understand the Minister's strong objection to this particular adjustment of a threshold although I have often understood his difficulties when it has been sought to extend thresholds.  Such a procedure would immediately obviate incidentally all administration worries about whether people were single or married. The difficulty about whether they were living together or were separated would disappear and it would be left to the husband and wife to arrange between them as to whether the £140,000 should be divided into two sums of £70,000 or whether it should be left as one unit of £140,000.  The provision for a minor child could remain exactly as in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Colley said, in this treatment of thresholds the status of women does not become an issue.  I support Deputy Colley in this amendment on the basis of the recognition of the reality of the position where women are actually concerned in our social life both in regard to employment and to how they live&mdash;whether they are single or married&mdash;and on the question of the parity of the sexes which is so much in the news and which is causing the Government some difficulty with regard to parity in pay.  I have not been given what I <Col N="957" /> regard as a sufficient reason for not dealing with the threshold in this case. This is not just a question of thinking of a number.  If it was a question of just fixing a level, I would not press the Minister, with the qualification that I have mentioned in regard to inflation.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for future inflation in the Bill and this is a cause of some anxiety.  Taking the facts as they were in the first half of 1975 when this Bill was introduced, the Minister, with justice, can make certain claims but here we must consider what is the sensible, realistic thing to do where one threshold figure is concerned.  Even if the Exchequer did lose the 1 per cent on the excess between £100,000 and £140,000 completely, having regard to the simplification in administration by not having to inquire into the status of an individual, much less inquire into the question of cohabitation, that loss would be so small as to be in that negligible category that was referred to in the last Bill where the Minister was very wise in writing off small sums more or less or the basis of <i>de minimis non curat lex</i>&mdash;that the law does not take account of trifles.</P>
    <P>It all depends on the raising of the threshold in one particular case.  I fear the Minister has not given me a sufficient reason for that.  It is not for the money value or as a taxation relief that I am pleading for it; it is to resolve the type of problem that has given rise to this amendment and to resolve the problem that arises when we approach this amendment on the basis of the property rights and liabilities of a married woman.  I do not want to put the Minister to the trouble of telling me all over again about the levels, comparing with other legislations and all that.  That is conceded. If it is a pat on the back the Minister wants for the good things he has done, we have not spared the bats so he is welcome to the bouquets too.  I would not mind presenting them and if he met us in this case, I would be prepared to walk across the floor and present one personally.  I wonder if <Col N="958" /> some of the married women Deputies in his party could persuade him?</P>

      <P>They might be listened to more than I will be.  This is one amendment, more than any other, which can be simply solved in such a simple way.  I commend the spirit in which this amendment is offered.  It could become a very automatic and simple thing and, quite frankly, if it was not for the threshold the Minister would have been there before us in propounding many of the points of view we have propounded.</P>
      <P>We are coming to the end of this debate and the House is going to adjourn.  Before the end of this year we will hear more about parity, the rights of women and so on.  Let us on the last day of this session legislate a genuine token of sincerity in the professions that we have been making in this area.  I was going to say the noises we have been making in this area because I am afraid there has been a lot said&mdash;outside this House particularly&mdash;that has been more noise than useful pleading in the whole area of women's rights.</P>
      <P>Here is a simple case of recognising the full property-owning rights of a woman if she is tied in matrimony. To take the Minister's point of view one has to say tied in matrimony; if the Minister carries on in this way that is what he is doing because he is putting her in an inferior position and he is putting the institution of marriage in an inferior position.  We have all given a great deal of attention to these points and the Minister has made his case here.  He has one very simple solution.  It will cost him very little.  It will resolve all the problems, namely, to restore the recognition that marriage is the union of two individuals. If the Minister does that one simple thing and makes an adjustment in the wording, there is no further problem.</P>

      <P>The Minister's concern for the family unit is most edifying and laudable.  However, when one finds that what he says is one thing and what he does is another one has to look again.  What he does in this Bill is to provide that in the case of this family unit with which he is so concerned he gives them a threshold less, by the sum of £40,000 and a dwelling-house and contents, than he gives to two single people or a separated married couple.  That is the measure of the Minister's concern for the family unit, whatever his mellifluous words and phrases in regard to the family unit.  We can judge the Minister's concern by what he does in this Bill rather than what he says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has sought to give to a married couple living together the same treatment as to a married couple who are separated or to two single people, but it has also sought&mdash; and I think this is much more important&mdash;to recognise the role of a married woman as an individual in her own right.  This Bill does not just ignore the role of the married woman in her own right but goes out of its <Col N="960" /> way to downgrade her.  It says that no matter what property she has, her husband is the one who is to account to the Revenue and to pay the tax on it.  I do not believe that any married woman, whether she is directly or indirectly affected by the wealth tax or not, could with any degree of equanimity accept the approach set out in this Bill to a married woman.</P>
    <P>I was listening to the Minister talking about the family and the pattern of Irish family life and the blow that it would be to it to approach the matter in the way suggested in this amendment by treating the married woman as an individual.  I was thinking, while listening to the Minister, that no doubt similar sentiments were being expressed when the Married Women's Property Act was being discussed in 1890 or so.  I am sure that at that time many expressed the view, and believed it, that the idea of allowing a married woman to have control over her own property and that the property she brought into the marriage should not thereby be placed totally at the disposal of the husband who knew far better, of course, than she did of how to handle it, that this concept was going to ruin married life and the family as a unit.  Here is the Minister, in 1975, expressing virtually similar concepts.  Whatever the Minister says about the level of the thresholds&mdash;and I have indicated what he is doing in that regard&mdash;this Bill, as drafted, specifically provides that the married woman, whatever her property, is to be treated as a chattel of the husband.  She has no role under this Bill.  If she has property and her husband has or has not property, in either case he is the one who has to account to the Revenue for it and pay the tax.</P>

      <P>There is a parameter within which the Minister is working, obviously, and he cannot see anything outside it.  There are many things wrong with the Bill but two things are wrong with this aspect.  One is that it penalises a married couple living together.  One can measure the amount of the penalty involved <i>vis-à-vis</i> two single persons or a separated married couple.  That measure is £40,000, plus a house and contents.</P>
      <P>The other serious defect is the fact that the married woman is being treated as a chattel, not as an individual in her own right.  Whether or not she has property, she is entitled to be treated as an individual, but the Minister is refusing to do that.  It is unfortunate but not, perhaps, too surprising.</P>

      <P>We have tried, not as the Minister suggests because we are trying to get on any women's lib band wagon; that is an insult not only to us but to Women's Lib.  It is self-evident to us, in 1975, that a married woman is entitled to be treated as an individual, like any other individual.  It is unfortunate that it is not the Minister's belief.

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 7 and 8, but in section 13, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Each of the sums mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) and in the proviso to subsection (1) shall be appropriately increased on the 5th day of April, 1976 and on every subsequent valuation date in accordance with the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index during the period of one year commencing on the next preceding valuation date and such increased sums, if any, shall be deemed to be inserted in place of the corresponding sums in subsection (1) on the appropriate valuation date&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to introduce into the Bill a provision to provide for inflation.  I suggest that not to provide for inflation really amounts to sharp practice.  The Minister for Finance gave an undertaking in another context in resisting an amendment of this kind that the Government would review the matter there concerned, which was income tax allowances.  He said it was not necessary to have such an amendment because he was giving a firm commitment to review the income tax allowance thresholds in the light of inflation.  The clear implication of what the Minister was saying was that such allowances would be adjusted in the light of inflation, but they were not.  When inflation was running at 25 per cent per annum they were adjusted at the rate of 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> The Minister resisted a similar amendment in regard to the capital gains tax and resisted an amendment which was somewhat similar in intent, though not in precise detail, in regard to the wealth tax on an earlier stage. I regard this persistent refusal by the Minister to build in provision for inflation as ominous especially in regard to a Bill of this kind where the major portion of the Minister's effort to sell the idea behind the Bill has been based on the statements that it will apply only to a handful of people and they are all very wealthy people.  Whatever the merits or demerits, the morality or immorality of that case, unless there is provision for inflation in this Bill there will be a lot of people in a short time who will be directly affected by it.  At present they think it can never affect them.</P>
    <P>We have had all sorts of red herrings advanced in regard to this matter in the past by the Minister and, indeed, by Deputy Esmonde who spoke on this on the last occasion.  The Minister in the past has suggested that there is not any agreed way of measuring inflation. He has said that the consumer price index, the method suggested here, is not an accurate measure of inflation. Deputy Esmonde said it would be most unfair to provide something on these lines, say if it were related to the consumer price index to somebody who owned, say, land if land was to increase in value at a faster rate than the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>I regard these arguments as plain dishonest in the absence of a proposal from the Minister which would deal with it.  The real choice being faced is that we either have some provision for inflation, say, based on the consumer price index if this amendment is accepted, or none at all as the Bill is drafted.  In the absence of a proposal from the Minister which would be designed to adjust the thresholds for inflation the choice is to have nothing at all or the adjustment based on the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>I venture to suggest that while there may be arguments between academics as to the manner in which inflation can most accurately be measured, as <Col N="965" /> far as the great majority of people are concerned, and certainly as far as those who are going to be directly affected by the wealth tax are concerned, they would opt any time for a provision for inflation such as is built-in in this amendment based on the consumer price index as against no provision or any other provision that would not be as easily measurable as the consumer price index.  Such arguments are pure red herrings.  The basic issue is, should the Bill contain a built-in provision for inflation or should it not.  That is the net issue.  I have no doubt that it should contain such a provision.  The Minister, apparently, on the basis of what he has said up to now, does not accept that.  I take issue with him on that.  I have no doubt that this should contain provision to adjust for inflation.</P>
    <P>It should also be recalled that this is not just a matter of whether people's private property in the ordinarily understood sense is going to increase in value or not.  We must not forget that wealth tax is being applied right across the board to productive assets as well as what might be described as non-productive assets and that its effect on business can be substantial.  There is a provision in the Bill whereby the valuation of property can be agreed for a three-year period, that the agreement would stand for a three-year period as between the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners with some loopholes in that, but basically that is so.  If one takes the stock-in-trade of a business valued at £100,000 and if inflation is running at 25 per cent per annum as we have at the moment, in the first year it will be worth £100,000; in the second year, £125,000 and in the third year, £156,000, without any increase in real value at all. I hope the Minister will see the potential for damage to a business where assets are productively employed if there is not a built-in provision for adjustment in line with inflation in this Bill, either in the threshold or in the method of valuing the property. This amendment seeks to make the adjustment in the threshold.  It is not the complete answer to the problem <Col N="966" /> but at least it goes some of the way. As the Bill stands there is no provision at all for adjustment either in valuation of property or in thresholds in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>With regard to stock-in-trade I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in the case I have mentioned in the three year period involved that goes up to £156,000. The Minister may say that if the people have agreed with the Revenue Commissioners on the valuation of property that will hold for three years.  That will not hold in regard to stock-in-trade because that will be turning over in those three years and it will be a different property that will be involved.  From the point of view of the taxpayer concerned the stock which is worth £100,000 in the first year, the exact same quantity of stock if the price of it only goes up in line with the consumer price index, would be worth £156,000 in the third year without any increase in the stock at all.  It is turning over all right but the same quantity of stock would be worth £156,000.  Of course, wealth tax is being applied to that apparent increase in value; it is only an apparent increase.</P>
    <P>At this late stage I hope the Minister would see the necessity, if this wealth tax is not to do even more damage to business than it is otherwise likely to do, of providing for an adjustment in line with inflation.  If the Minister refuses to accept this amendment and, at the same time, refuses to put in an amendment himself which would adjust in line with inflation there is only one conclusion we can be left with, that the Minister intends to ensure by reason of the process of inflation to bring in to the wealth tax net many people who are being led to believe at the moment by the Minister and his colleagues that they will never be subjected to wealth tax.  But if that is so, I think it ought as far as possible to be clearly spelled out now so that the people will know exactly what is involved in this.  The Minister's <i>bona fides</i> are in question in this regard.  He can, I suggest, remove any doubts in that regard either by accepting this amendment or by amending <Col N="967" /> the Bill himself on the basis of adjustment for inflation, but if he does not do either, then there are, I would suggest, very good grounds for doubting the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister in regard to this aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows well that this amendment is irrelevant to the Wealth Tax Bill because valuations made in April, 1975 are to stand for three years.  If it has relevance, what Deputy Colley is asking is to have these valuations revised every year.  We are supposing that 1975 valuation will remain for three years. That will be a very significant benefit to holders of capital in these highly inflationary days&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It will not apply to all properties but it will apply to those properties which have to be specially valued for the purpose of the tax. Other properties will be reflecting changes in valuation while other properties will reflect inflation in various forms.  But considering that a very large proportion of the kind of property which will bear wealth tax will remain at 1975 valuations, there is a built-in safeguard.  We would have to remove that safeguard, that protection, if the Deputy's amendment was to be pressed.  I do not think anybody would thank him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ever since we started debating this tax system in the early days of 1974 this has been one of the principal points of debate.  I cannot see that a <Col N="969" /> useful purpose can be served by reopening it at any great length at this the 11th hour of the debate on the Wealth Tax Bill in the Dáil, or I should say at the 125th hour of debate of the Wealth Tax Bill in the Dáil. The problem of dealing with inflation and taxation is a very big one.  Inflation touches all forms of taxation. There has been no agreed formula in any Constitution to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Where consideration has been given to that and when there has been an acceptance of the multitude of problems about which there has been a grievance, when there is acceptance that the best way of meeting the problems generated by inflation is to go for a low rate of tax and generous thresholds, we have done that.  If we were to have a Bill with a very sensitive inflation index, then the argument in favour of more generous thresholds would fall and lower thresholds would be appropriate.  But we have generous thresholds which will exclude the overwhelming mass of our people for many years to come, even if inflation was to continue at its present appalling and insufferable rate.</P>
    <P>That is one of the realities.  The principal form in which many people hold capital is their private residences and their contents.  They are going to be exempt altogether because those elements will not be touched at all no matter what the inflation rate might be.  We have given assurances in the White Paper and on many occasions since in the name of the Government that the thresholds for the new capital taxes will be reviewed to take account of inflation.  There is a firm commitment to review the thresholds for wealth tax by 1978 when the three-year review of valuations will occur.</P>
    <P>Naturally, when the thresholds come to be reviewed in 1978 the change in the value of money between now and then will be one of the factors to be taken into account, but it is only one of the factors. There are other aspects in practice which determine the amount of wealth tax to be paid.  They include the rates, the thresholds, the exemptions, the reliefs, the ceilings and so <Col N="970" /> forth.  I have pointed out in relation to suggestions that indexation be built in for all taxations, that it is a simple thing to give but if the consequences of giving indexation in tax levels is to necessitate an increase in the rates in order to produce the same revenue as heretofore there is little point in engaging in the exercise.  If we are to have indexation of taxation levels&mdash;in principle it is difficult to argue against it&mdash;I would accept it. But we would have to consider its introduction for all taxes, not just for one.  Why should it be available for only one and not for others?  The Opposition may well argue &ldquo;All right, bring it in for everything.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We tried in regard to the other taxes, too, including income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Yes, we will bring it in for everything.&rdquo; Will the Opposition accept the consequences?  Will the country accept the consequences if it is to reduce revenue?  Will taxation operate then so that expenditure will be reduced, according to Deputy Brugha?  That is the logic of it.  If the principle is good in one respect it is good for all.  There is a great clamour for indexation in relation to the interest paid to savers, to depositors.</P>

Indexation is fine to the receiver of the benefit, but nobody wants to pay the <Col N="971" /> cost of it.  Who will do it?  Is the State to do it, with people contributing less revenue to the State because they insist on getting indexation?  Where will that get us?  Into a bigger and bigger economic plight, and the Deputies know that well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the people are demanding the State to spend too much.  Perhaps the State is being forced to expend too much because the private sector will not spend enough.  There are a multitude of considerations here which if we discussed them all would take us outside the immediate ambit of this amendment. But do not let us have a proposal which says: &ldquo;Let us have indexation because it is nice and we will benefit by it.&rdquo; That is to be the end of the logic.  &ldquo;We will have indexation when we can make on it but we will let somebody else carry the consequential burden.&rdquo; If one person gets benefit through a lower rate of tax the Revenue is required by the State to make up the loss somewhere else. I am saying this by way of <i>obiter dicta</i> and not by way of opposing the suggestion that the rates of thresholds and exemptions to the wealth tax are just to reflect inflationary trends.  I believe that is as far as it goes without committing oneself to doing it, but I insist now, as I have on numerous occasions in the last year, that when people call for indexation they be honest with themselves and with the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indexation to a rate of inflation which is too bad ensures one thing; that is, that we continue to be propelled down the slippery slope towards ruin.  It is like scutting on the back of a lorry which is out of control and expecting that you can travel safely to your destination.  You could be thrown off or involved in a very serious collision.  Indexation is one of the panaceas being offered in recent times by a number of commentators, who see it only as conferring benefits without looking at the <Col N="972" /> association between indexation and inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a new tax such as the wealth tax there will obviously be additional work in the early years for both the taxpayer and his advisers and for the Revenue Commissioners in becoming familiar with the tax. These problems are increased when adjustments to valuations have to be made.  Until such time as people become familiar with the working of the system, the time taken to reach agreement will probably be greater than it would otherwise be.  But having agreed to this first year's valuation and assessment in the light of the provisions of the Bill, I feel sure that the work involved in complying with the administration in the immediately succeeding years will be much lighter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to further easing the burden, the Bill provides in section 12 for the maintenance of the valuation <Col N="974" /> for the next two valuation dates.  Naturally if the valuation is frozen, except in the circumstances indicated in the section, it is logical that the thresholds should also be frozen for the same period.  That is why the Government are committed to the thresholds and refer to a three-year period.  The proper thing to do is to look at both the valuation and the thresholds in 1978.  As it is the taxpayer and not the Revenue that is exempted by that arrangement I would suggest that the amendment should be withdrawn.  The work would be eased and a service would be done to the people the Opposition believe they are benefiting by offering this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister excelled himself in his pleading and entertained us as well.  Before I deal with the main point which the Minister was making may I say that he let slip the significant phrase &ldquo;produce the same revenue&rdquo;.  Now the cat is out of the bag.  This Bill has been sold to us all the way through for its social merits, for its equity and so on, but briseann an fhirinne and there it is.  Like every other taxation measure, no matter how well the package is dressed up, the whole object of the exercise is to get the money in.  This is what taxation is all about, but I am glad we recognise it and we have put a lot of things into perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's case as I understand it is that if you try to adjust thresholds on the basis of CPI or on any other basis then because of the three-year provision for valuation you would have to let either one or the other go unless for revenue-producing purposes.  That is where the phrase slipped in.  If that is what it is all about my only comment is that if you are going to produce revenue you will have to cast the net wide enough. That justifies our fears and suspicions that this net, no matter how wide-meshed and narrow in circumference it is will quickly expand and the net will quickly contract with the flow of time and in that case a lot of what has been said in this debate can appear to posterity only as a rather <Col N="975" /> good selling job.  That is no credit to anybody in the House.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the Minister made the point about thresholds and valuations. The fact is that the valuations are for three years.  As I understand this Bill, and it is complex enough, there are certain discretions for review in regard to valuations.  In regard to certain properties and shares a valuation will be accepted for three years.  It is not as definite a statutory limitation as the thresholds.  There are areas which are not covered by that. So the absolute limit of the thresholds on the one hand is not compensated for by what the Minister tried to tell us here, that everything is fixed for three years.  That is only a partial statement of the situation.  That argument is open to the further objection that in the case of anyone above the thresholds all the inflation works to suit them, notwithstanding that the thresholds in relative values as well as the real values that Deputy Colley spoke about, are decreasing in the social and financial circumstances that are developing in the case of rapid inflation of the order of 20 per cent onwards.</P>
    <P>If one considers the partial nature of the review, subject to revision in certain cases where it applies&mdash;there are certain cases where it would not apply at all, if that makes it partial; when you take inequity and the iniquity, of penalising a class of the people above the thresholds, then I find it hard to accept the Minister's arguments and I am left with the anxiety as to what the content of this legislation will mean for a lot of people in, say, four or five years' time.</P>
    <P>I have a shrewd suspicion that the preparation of this legislation did not envisage the calamitous impact of inflation in this year.  The work that went into the preparation of this code is only too apparent and the thinking that went behind it did not happen in a night.  I suspect that the Minister may have rushed it, thinking he was on a good political wicket and mistimed it.  I should imagine that when the founding concepts were laid <Col N="976" /> there was not present to mind the level of inflation that has been reached and the rate of increase in inflation that has been experienced was not perceived.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument is, at best, only a partial reply to us.  His argument that you would have to reduce the thresholds does not stand up and is simply to be interpreted with the phrase which he let slip, &ldquo;produce the same revenue&rdquo;, which is probably the key.</P>
    <P>I can, of course, understand the Minister's sensitivity to indexes at the moment and I sympathise with the Minister in regard to the operation of mechanical calculators like CPIs. These arithmetical and mechanical operations have led to embarrassment, and it was quite apparent the last time the Taoiseach was talking about these matters in the House that he was more concerned with the cost-of-living index and holding that and thinking in terms of an index rather than in terms of the realities of production, the matters I was talking about this morning, the realities of the economy.  He was thinking more in terms of index and accountancy control than about economic activity and productivity and getting the economy underway and getting a drive to secure employment and all these other things.  I was surprised at the time but I must confess that I felt it was a question again of staff thinking.  In the light of subsequent events I can understand the Taoiseach's concern about the CPI, and the Minister must be very worried about it also.</P>
    <P>For his consolation, Deputy Colley or I or any member of our party would be quite prepared to accept any alternative proposals that would effectively, perhaps in a broader way, perhaps in a more discretionary way, provide for inflation.  What we fear is that when these inflationary limits are tied statutorily they will be allowed to remain, that the fiscal factors that are working at the moment to depress money values will continue and that the level of these <Col N="977" /> thresholds will fall in real worth and the tax net will be widely extended in scope and the mesh will become so narrow that many people will be caught who are happy about their situation at present.  They will be caught in an alarmingly short space of time if the experience of the past two years is to be any guide.  The Minister's argument is only a partial reply.  It is a good pleading reply.  One has to make one's case.  I can understand his index-phobia but the substance remains.  These thresholds should be geared to inflation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of Article 17.2 of the Constitution the Government recommends that it is expedient to authorise such payments <Col N="980" /> out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to enable the Minister for Labour to make, by means of a scheme to be known as the Premium Employment Programme, payments to employers engaged in Agricultural (including Horticultural) and certain manufacturing industries for the purpose of encouraging employment, and to provide for other matters connected with the aforesaid matter.</P>
    <P>We authorised payments of money necessary to implement the provisions of the Bill restricted to employment premiums for manufacturing industries. Now we are expanding the scope of the Bill.  The Government are seeking authorisation from the Oireachtas for the necessary moneys for the purpose of this expansion.  I put it to you that the Oireachtas, of which this House is part, is entitled to discuss this new amended Money Resolution as we would have been entitled to discuss the original Money Resolution.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 26 to 28 deleted and the following substituted;&mdash;</P>
      <P>`(3)  The Scheme shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) so far as it applies to agriculture (including horticulture), come into operation on the 3rd day of August, 1975, and</P>
      <P>(b) So far as it relates to manufacturing industries, be deemed to have come into operation on the 29th day of June, 1975,</P>
      <P>and shall cease to have effect on the 26th day of June, 1976, without prejudice to any conditions of the Scheme which continue to apply after that date.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to permit the extension of the scheme to agriculture. It is consequent on the amendment of the long title of the Bill.  It specifies a commencement date, the 3rd of August 1975, for the application of the scheme to the agricultural and horticultural sectors.  The date of the commencement of the scheme for manufacturing continues unchanged.  The scheme, of course, in respect of all sectors will cease on the 29th June, 1976 and payments in respect of amounts due at the closure of the scheme will be made after the final date.  A query was raised about the date in the Seanad today, as to why the 3rd August was chosen in respect of agriculture.  The 3rd August and the 29th June, 1975&mdash;both Sundays&mdash; are the commencement of PAYE weeks and the 29th June, 1976 Saturday, is the last day of the PAYE week.  It is purely for convenience that <Col N="982" /> these particular dates are the ones chosen here.  The amendment in its choice of words without prejudice to any conditions of the scheme which continue to apply after that date is intended to cover the eventuality of an agricultural employer, a farmer, taking on an additional worker on, say, the 1st June 1976 to qualify for a premium in respect of that worker.  The programme will specify that he must be kept in continuous employment because Deputies will be aware that this was a problem that we considered in farming this legislation, the need to avoid introducing the scheme where seasonality ruled.  To overcome that we decided for agriculture to adopt the nine-month scheme until at least 1st March, 1977. The premium payable will be in respect of 1st June to the 29th of June, 1976.  I made the point in introducing this legislation that our prime objective is to assist manufacturing industry, that part of industry which has always been hardest hit and which has been hardest hit in the course of the present recession.  It is to assist that part of our economic life which has been most affected.  That is the main purpose of the Bill.  As I explained at earlier Stages those industries which have been most affected in the course of the present recession are those which are to the fore in inquiries on this Bill so far&mdash;textiles, footwear, engineering and plastics.  These are the kind of inquiries we have been receiving so far.  Agriculture is a major industry and it stimulates industrial employment. Obviously the prosperity of agriculture assists other parts of our economy and even though agriculture may be doing better than other parts of the economy at the present time I thought that agriculture might be able to bring back workers into gainful employment.  This will be the State's first intervention in the area of assisting agricultural employment during the course of this recession.</P>
    <P>I remind Deputies that the purpose of the Bill is to assist those industries which have been most affected during the recession.  We have always tolerated in this country an extraordinarily high unemployment figure.  As Deputies opposite will know, during most of the <Col N="983" /> so-called prosperous 1960s we lived with an unemployment rate of 7 per cent which no other democratic State in Europe would tolerate.  Now that always bad unemployment situation is aggravated because of the present recession.  Our proposals under this legislation are designed to induce employers to take back workers that they might not otherwise take back into employment, to ensure that industries in local areas retain their work force, and to ensure that workers are available to us in the early spring and summer of next year when it is expected that conditions of general recovery will be evident in our major export markets and here in the home market.</P>
    <P>That is why we added agriculture. I received many representations from my colleagues in Government and members of the parties in Government on the necessity of bringing agriculture into the programme.  My thinking continues and remains that the main thrust of this legislation is directed towards manufacturing industry, sadly the areas which have been worst hit.</P>
    <P>Agriculture itself can assist us also. In an otherwise rather bleak picture at present, agriculture remains one of the bright sports in the economy, and whatever arguments may arise around the common agricultural policy the fact is that the agricultural policy of this country has gained a hearing in Europe and our ambitions in agriculture are protected by the provisions of that Treaty.  This is why I commend the desirability of adding agriculture to the scope of the provisions of this legislation with the change, of course, that here to preserve continuity we do require a nine-month period of continuity of employment.  We do require this nine-month period and the payment will be at the end of that nine-month period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening statement in introducing this amendment has gone to the hub of the point I was trying to make, that in effect he has expanded the scope of the Bill to include agriculture which, he said, was at the instance of arguments he heard from some of his colleagues <Col N="984" /> in Government and some members of the parties who are represented in the Government.  The Minister very conveniently neglected to refer to the fact that there was a specific amendment from this side of the House to achieve this very purpose but under Standing Orders it was ruled out of order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister conveniently neglected to refer to it.  The reasons that we are discussing these amendments here this afternoon, within an hour or so of their being recommended in the Seanad, are almost exactly as I anticipated they would be when we debated the guillotine motion in this House three weeks ago, the guillotine motion which restricted debate on this Bill as well as three, four or even five other Bills.  I said then that this Bill would most likely go to the Seanad and, because of the limitation of time given to the Second Reading debate here and the total elimination, one might say, of time given to discuss amendments, that the Bill would go to the Seanad in an incomplete state.  I said that the Seanad would then have to try to repair whatever defects appeared in the Bill and that there was a likelihood that, because of the shortage of time, because of the date on which the guillotine was to fall, that is today, it would be unlikely that the Dáil would have the opportunity of debating recommendations for amendments made in the Seanad. Now by reason of the consent and co-operation of the Opposition notwithstanding the continued operation of the guillotine motion, this is exactly the situation we now have before us. We are now debating amendments that could, and most likely would, have been debated in at least the Report Stage of this Bill in the Dáil had the guillotine not been applied to it.  I say this because I accept that the Ceann Comhairle was within his rights in ruling that the amendments proposed from this side of the House which almost had the same effect as the Minister's amendments now were not in accordance with Standing <Col N="985" /> Orders and could not be debated.  It was open to the Minister, if he had time to have a proper Report Stage debate in the House, to introduce the amendments at that time and, therefore, the Bill might have left this House in a reasonably comprehensive condition, reasonably reflecting the views of Members of this side of the House&mdash;apparently the views of Members on all sides of the House now as the Minister seems to have admitted.</P>
      <P>We are now patching up the Bill in a manner that we had already proposed. Not only is this another example of Government bungling but is indicative of the diversity of approach within the Government to many measures that were essential to the well being of our economy.  It is obvious that some Ministers wished agriculture to be initially included in the employment premium scheme.  It is obvious that other Ministers did not want it.  There was ultimately pressure, either within the Government or without, to have agriculture included.  That is the reason why we are back here.</P>
      <P>While the Government have been fumbling and muddling from one political crisis to another, from one procedural point to another, political commentators generally continue their benevolent indulgence towards this Government, notwithstanding all their failings.  Some of these correspondents are like a broken down record in their efforts to denigrate the Opposition in order to divert public attention from the ineptitude of performance of this Government.  It seems to me, on the contrary, that Fianna Fáil are obviously performing too well to suit the views of the Government orientated press.  The Irish public are far too politically mature to be deluded by such subjective newspaper comments.  I am sure it was this maturity that caused the justified criticism that we read in this morning's press of the most recent example of Government mishandling of this whole situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent <Col N="986" /> handling of the Government's economic package of which this Bill forms part and is now before the House.  Fianna Fáil will continue to give support to the principle outlined in this Bill even though yet it does not go as far as we would have wished.  The Minister has extended it now to include agriculture.  He has imposed conditions even in this respect that will make it difficult for many farmers to benefit from it.  We encouraged, too, that the provisions of the Bill be extended to the service industries and the building industry. Had that been done, then this Bill would have been a truly worthwhile one.</P>
      <P>Let me say quite frankly and openly that we welcome the initiative of the Government in introducing the principle of this Bill, but unfortunately they have fallen down in giving it sufficient scope.  I believe, as my colleagues will show eventually, that had the Government extended the Bill as we proposed then it would have cost the Government far less in the drain from the Exchequer by way of social welfare payments.  That can be clearly exemplified.</P>
      <P>We will continue to support the Government's package even though by this stage it is a very tatty package indeed.  I have already supported the Government's call for modification of the national wage agreement, notwithstanding the Government's failure to give a clear and courageous lead to the country and to those who were parties to the national wage agreement. I hope the Government's failure in this respect will not diminish in any way the realisation of the necessity on the part of trade unions and indeed employers, and everyone else for that matter, to do their best in trying to overcome the very serious threat to our economic survival the present situation poses&mdash;a situation which the Government have allowed to develop tragically by reason of the negligent fashion in which they approached this problem from the very beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may have more to say as the debate progresses but I thought it only right that at this stage I should express my condemnation of the <Col N="987" /> Government's attitude, activities and ineptitude, and to express our continued support of the reasonable measures, as I have said before, of the Government to overcome and offset the present serious situation.  I feel sure that notwithstanding the ineptitude of the Government, the ordinary people, who will be imbued with a sense of practical patriotism, will come to the help of the country as a whole even if the Government fail to give an adequate lead to them.</P>

      <P>We have got an advantageous extension to the employment premium with the inclusion of agriculture.  I give credit to the Opposition spokesman on Labour for his amendment in this regard.  I should like to point out that those of us who spoke on it at the time thought it should be included as well.  Everyone thought it was a good idea.  Perhaps people who had to figure it out thought that perhaps there were too many snags in it and that it would be difficult to implement.  In dealing with manufacturing industry you are dealing with a relatively small group of people and a limited type of machine. When you are dealing with agriculture and individual farmers you are widening the administrative net quite substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone has to admit that the whole of Europe is going through an economic recession.  I believe that poverty in Europe is a very relative term and that there is great scope for the expansion of our agriculture. Europe is wide open for a sales campaign and the only way to do it is to produce more of the goods of the quality we are producing at the moment and the way to do that is to get more people on to our farms. Because of industrial development a great many people who would normally have stayed on in farming have found their way into various industries.  I would hope that they <Col N="988" /> would be encouraged back with this premium to work on the farms where work awaits them.  In view of the EEC regulations with regard to hygiene and improvements to farm buildings and so on, there is a need for substantial numbers on the land.  There was a time when farm workers started to move downwards while farm equipment started to move upwards. We still maintained production but now the law of diminishing returns is taking effect and we have a situation in agriculture where there is a shortage of manpower.  If this Bill includes agriculture it will help substantially. When the period is up and the premium comes to an end it may well be that these men will stay on in agriculture.  Industry appears attractive and agriculture very unattractive, but industry was an eye-opener to some people.  It was not as pleasant as they thought it would be, but they had burned their boats.  Now it may be that they will return to the land given this encouragement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I expect great things from it because, as I said, if we are to get out of this recession and if we are to forge ahead, we really have to make a go of this nation.  It is all very well to talk about oil and gas and minerals.  The real wealth of this land is the wealth that we can get from agriculture.  It is generally accepted all over the world that our agricultural products are among the best.  Since we entered the EEC we are inclined to get a bit lazy when it comes to selling.  We have many marketing boards and all sorts of marketing arrangements, but we have become lazy when it comes to the hard business of selling farm produce. In Europe there are excellent markets for our products.  We are really only scratching the surface.</P>

      <P>I welcome this very important amendment because it includes agricultural workers.  A sum of £12 each week is a substantial sum. It will encourage farmers to employ labour.  That is a good thing.  Many people do not like reporting to the unemployment exchange.  They like to be employed and this will be good for the morale of our work force especially in areas like my own where there is a massive farm-building programme at the moment and a general improvement in dairies and so on.  There is work on silo yards in order to qualify under the farm modernisation scheme grants and an additional work force on the farms will help to get all this work done.  As I say, I hope this work force will stay on the land.  The land needs them permanently and it is for that reason that I commend the Minister in introducing this Bill.  Obviously, he has had problems.  There will probably be administrative problems, and so on, but I have no doubt that all these things can be solved and that the end result will be a good one. This is only a beginning.  I do not know how the manufacturing side is reacting but I can forecast fairly accurately that agriculture will avail of this very valuable scheme.  I do not want to detain the House.  I give credit to both sides of the House for putting pressure on here.  The more of that we have the better.</P>

      <P>The contradictions in the Minister's opening remarks on this amendment are a further indication to us of the muddled thinking there is within the Government.  It is significant also that this amendment on this Bill coming back from the Seanad to us tonight formed part of an amendment I tabled for Committee Stage last week. It was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has now accepted part of the amendment tabled then.  I cannot understand why he has not accepted the balance of that amendment or the other activities covered under that amendment, neither can I understand how a Deputy with a certain amount of common sense like Deputy Hegarty, would not have convinced <Col N="990" /> the Minister from that side of the House of the urgent desirability of including the other activities.</P>
      <P>Let me go back to the contradictions. Last week I disagreed with the Minister.  I saw the prime objective of this Bill as being an effort to create employment and job opportunities. I looked on that as the primary object of the Bill.  This is what I hoped for but the Minister told me on two occasions he saw it as a Bill to aid ailing industry, a Bill basically designed to aid ailing industry.  He reiterated that tonight, but I could not get clearly from him the reasons why he selected only agriculture out of the group of industries I mentioned in the amendment last week. For example, why does the Minister not accept the building industry, our second major industry?  I mentioned the building industry in that amendment. The arguments put forward today by Deputy Hegarty with regard to agriculture were reasonable and could equally be advanced on behalf of the building industry, but with one major difference, and I emphasise this major difference.  The major difference is, of course, that far more jobs will be created because of the easy way in which the building industry can respond to support from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take a conservative figure of 6,000 more unemployed in the building industry now as compared with last year, if some of those could be, through this Bill, encouraged back in by being re-employed by their employers, that would have a major impact. I am surprised that the building industry has not been included in this further amendment.  I am amazed that the Minister's colleagues in Government were so out of touch with the situation that they did not twist his arm or encourage him to include the building industry as well as agriculture.  They have said here in the House that this inclusion is due to pressure from the Minister's colleagues.  I do not believe that for a moment.  I am certain that it was because of the amendment from this side.  But, if it were so, or if it were true, why then could these people, <Col N="991" /> who should know the situation in the building industry not have encouraged him in that direction also?</P>
    <P>What I have said about the building industry applies equally, of course, to the service industries.  I told the Minister last week that if this Bill were the means of employing not only the 10,000 that he hoped but 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 he would have all our support from this side of the House.  I have a certain concern here. We have 102,000 unemployed.  There is no point in the Minister, or anybody else, saying our employment figures were always high.  We have at the moment approximately 36,000 more people unemployed than there were at this time last year.  I have already referred to 6,000 of those belonging to the building industry, so one in every six unemployed at the moment belongs to the building industry.  The Minister has not included it as the main industry we believe it to be though all the indications seem to point in that direction. He has not accepted it under that heading, neither has he combined it with agriculture.</P>
    <P>My worry in regard to this amendment is the inadequacy of the number. I welcome it.  I pushed for it and I am glad it is being made, but what we want is a major upsurge in employment. We had figures last week of £35 million being spent by way of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance in the period from 1st January, 1975, to 30th June, 1975: £17 million of that sum related to unemployment benefit.  These are staggering figures.  There is no point in the Minister saying things were bad in the past.  If things were bad in the past they are very much worse now.  Worse than that, they will deteriorate further. Let us not disillusion ourselves. I am amazed that a Labour Minister in this Government could agree to a Dáil recess from now until the 22nd October during a period of crisis never before experienced in this country, with a Government who have mishandled and mismanaged every aspect of government right along the line.  To think that that Government during the next <Col N="992" /> three months will be without an Opposition to fight and point out their mistakes to them.  I think it is disgraceful. I can point to savings where the Exchequer is concerned.  A man, his wife and two children can draw almost £21 unemployment benefit.  He can add on his pay-related benefit.  If that man can be re-employed, his employer will receive a premium of £12.  We have a saving of £9 on that man, plus his pay-related benefit which may be anything up to £7 a week, a substantial saving for the Exchequer.  But now there is an added bonus for the Exchequer because in addition to the saving of the £12 paid out by one Department there will be, of course, by way of health stamp contributions from the employer and the employee approximately £4.50 of the £12 coming back again to the State funds.</P>
    <P>I take it the Minister or his officials did look at our amendments and say which of them could be accepted.  If we accepted every one of them we would encourage employment in every sphere of activity and we would be doing the Exchequer and the economy and the morale of the workforce a good service.</P>
    <P>I was critical last week of the piecemeal way in which we were given the Bill.  I referred to it as a &ldquo;shell&rdquo; Bill, which description I think the Minister did not particularly appreciate.  There was no detail in the Bill.  We got certain conditions issued by the service operating the scheme, the National Manpower service, already completely overworked because of the economic climate and the unemployment situation. These conditions were amended on the Second Stage.  It was a piecemeal operation with no very real thought being given to it over a period despite the fact that our live register had increased by about 36,000 people.</P>
    <P>We are now told that the commencement date for agriculture will be 3rd August.  Why is it 3rd August? Is there a date for the workforce level as there is for manufacturing industries? Is there a specific date?  Is it a wide open date?  What other conditions govern this?  These have not been spelled out for us.  For example, can a person in receipt of unemployment <Col N="993" /> assistance qualify for this?  Can this employer qualify under this scheme?  The reason that I ask this question is that, if the other schemes apply, the unemployment benefit recipient would be the only person entitled to qualify and in rural areas particularly you have many people in receipt of unemployment assistance who if they were employed by local farmers would result in a saving to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this Bill should be brought to us in the manner in which it is.  There is no point in anybody saying that extra time was promised.  Extra time was promised at the expense of other measures.  The position is that the two parties forming this Coalition Government deliberately and designedly proposed in this House on the 9th of July a guillotine motion, guillotining this among other Bills.  Now we have the situation that a Bill to which obviously very little thought had been given is accorded an hour-and-a-half on Second Stage, an hour on Committee and Report Stages, was taken to the Seanad and not enough opportunity was given to our Senators who had many comments to make on it.  We have it back now for a limited period and if we talk too long on it I am sure it will be guillotined.</P>

      <P>I have said before that there is imagination in this idea.  It has much to commend it.  I also pointed out that the most a job could cost under this scheme was about £500.  This is cheap, particularly in comparison with what jobs cost by way of capital expenditure under IDA schemes.  Admittedly, there is a vast difference.  We are in a period of crisis and if we pay £12 over a period of nine months and if we pay £6 over a period of three months it is a total of about £500 from which is deducted the stamps and possible income tax payments which return to the Exchequer. Also, of course, there is the saving if these people are in receipt of social welfare.  In view of this one could say that the total cost to the Exchequer will not be a cost but a gain.  I hope this will be the position. Certainly, the Minister can expect support from this side of the House in any way that he wants to broaden the Bill.</P>

Every person employed, irrespective of what category of activity he is employed in, is a saving to this country.  It is a boost for morale.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not accept an amendment I put down last week in regard to the unemployment benefit where the man has to be four weeks on the live register immediately prior to his re-employment to qualify under this scheme. We expressed our concern about this. It is completely unnecessary.  Any technical or operational difficulties encountered could easily be got around if the goodwill was there.  We want to help the Minister.  I have already assured him of my concern and my support for any broadening of the scope of this Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment and in return we will accept an amendment from him.  I have pointed out that there is no cost to the State: it is probably a gain for the State.  It will help create more and more jobs.  Not enough jobs will be created within that sector, not nearly as many as would be created within the ailing building industry and within the service industries.  The Bill could afford to cover all activities within our country at no further cost to the State and with tremendous benefit to the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I heartily welcome the Bill.  On Second Stage I was one of the people who exhorted the Minister for Labour to bring agricultural workers within the ambit of this Bill.  I spoke at some considerable length on the Second Stage of this Bill and I asked the Minister to ensure that agricultural workers were brought within the scope of this Bill.  For this reason, now that it has been brought in, I heartily welcome this extension. In fact, on a previous occasion in this House, on the 7th May, 1975, dealing with the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) (Amendment) Bill, 1975, I mentioned to the Minister who was taking that Bill, Deputy Clinton, that some scheme would have to be devised <Col N="997" /> whereby agricultural workers would be paid a premium such as is being offered at present.  I will quote what I said on the 7th of May, as reported in the Official Report at column 1275:</P>
      <P>Schemes will have to be devised to help farmers retain their employees because it is not possible to find employment for all of them in industry.  Our aim should be to keep them on the land.  If farmers cannot afford to employ workers, we should provide some incentives for them to do so.  Perhaps the Department in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare, could devise some sort of farmers' remuneration scheme whereby financial assistance would be given to farmers to help them pay their workers.  I doubt if such a scheme would contravene any EEC regulation but something of this nature is absolutely essential.  It would be a good deal better to maintain a worker in employment than to have him draw the dole.  It should not be very difficult to devise a scheme of direct subvention to farmers for this purpose.  Neither should its administration prove too difficult because the subvention could be paid to farmers, say, every three months....  It would be an incentive both to farmers and to their workers.</P>
      <P>In regard to this matter it is essential. I believe that in this country our most important natural asset is our land. For this reason, because of this important natural asset and because of our vast potential, because of our vast agricultural exports, we have to maintain sufficient men in agriculture.</P>
      <P>A situation had been reached in which approximately 10,000 annually were leaving agriculture between 1951 and 1971.  A constant drain of this nature is alarming and dangerous.  A crisis situation, if this continues, is bound to occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill of this nature may stem some of this flight from the land.  We have to maintain our numbers to be able to continue to keep our farms working and be able to maintain our exports. Our agricultural exports in this country are highly important.  Added to this, <Col N="998" /> we have to maintain our employment so as to retain the necessary expertise in many different aspects of farming, let it be dairying, poultry, pigs and so on.  It is absolutely essential to have a sufficient number of qualified people who are able to work on the land and who understand what this is all about. For this reason I mentioned this on the 7th May on the Agricultural Workers Holidays Amendment Bill.  That is why I mentioned it on the Employment Premium Bill on Second Stage.  I do not know if I was the only one who mentioned it but certainly I dealt with it at great length on that occasion as well.</P>

      <P>This extension is heartily welcomed by everybody in the agricultural community.  I think full details of this amendment should be sent to every county committee of agriculture throughout the country.  I am sure each one of them will be deeply interested in this extension and will all want full details in regard to the manner in which this Bill works.</P>
      <P>It is especially welcome that the Minister for Labour should be bringing in this matter because I believe it is good to see all our Government Departments being involved in agriculture. The Bill is certainly to be welcomed. Many different incentives are coming from it, incentives to create employment and maintain employment.  The economy can only benefit from it.  The benefits that will be derived in regard to social welfare stamps, income tax and so on are important.  The Minister is to be congratulated in bringing in this extension.  It shows great initiative on his part and I whole-heartedly support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With the other Members of this Party who have already spoken, I would agree that it is rather unfortunate that such an important Bill as this should be rushed through the House in the manner in which it was pushed through.  It is nonsense to suggest that extra time was offered.  We know that there were many very important and technical <Col N="999" /> financial Bills before the House which had to be discussed and we were in a guillotine situation and, therefore it was not open to us to continue the debate on this Bill.  I say it was unfortunate that it had to be rushed through the House because I am convinced that we had sufficient time to discuss it, many changes would have been made in the Bill which would have improved it very considerably.  The fact that we are now dealing with amendments from the Seanad proves that if the Minister had sufficient time to consider the various matters which we put forward&mdash;and many more which we would have put forward had we had the opportunity to do so&mdash;and if he had the time or the opportunity to hear the various points put forward from this side and possibily from his own side, many other worthwhile changes would have been made in the Bill.</P>
      <P>We are pleased with the fact that the Minister has made this particular change in relation to agriculture.  As Deputy Fitzgerald said, this was an amendment which was originally put forward by him and which was not accepted by the Ceann Comhairle because of the rules of the House. Nevertheless, we are pleased that it has now been accepted.  I regret that the Minister did not find it possible to include the other matters which were referred to by Deputy Fitzgerald, the building industry in particular.  We are all aware of the fact that no industry would respond so quickly to assistance as would the building industry in relation to employment.  We have no other lead industries in this country and there is no doubt that were a worthwhile incentive to be offered in the building industry the number employed in that industry would have increased and increased relatively rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the fact that what he was mostly concerned with was manufacturing industry and particularly those industries which were hard-pressed, the footwear industry, the textile industry and the engineering industry.  I know these industries are under very severe pressure <Col N="1000" /> at present because in the constituency I represent we have what would be termed the headquarters of the footwear industry: we have many textile industries and we have engineering industries, all of which, as the Minister says, are under pressure and we are pleased that this money has been made available to help them.</P>
    <P>I spoke on a number of occasions in this House about the building industry but I would like to draw attention to the fact that the fall in the number of those employed in the industry over the past year is equal to the total number employed in the footwear industry, for example.  In fact, it is greater than the total number employed in the footwear industry. This shows the seriousness of the situation in the building industry. In April, 1974, there were 13,298 building workers unemployed and in April, 1975, this number had increased to 19,857, which was an increase of almost 50 per cent.  To that figure must be added the number of those who lost their employment in ancillary industries.  It would have been a worthwhile gesture on the part of the Minister if he were to accept that it was necessary to involve the building industry as well as the other industries covered by this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply may say that money was made available in the budget to help the building industry, but I would point out to him that of the £10½ million which was made available, £9 million was for loans and £1½ million was for grants.  These sums are not going to give the fillip to the industry which is very necessary at the present time.  The £9 million which is being made available for loans under the SDA loan scheme is to a very considerable extent committed and, in fact, much of it is already spent.  The £1½ million for grants simply brings the amount of money allotted for this year to the same level as the money made available for grants last year.  It does not take into consideration the fact that in the building and construction industry there has been an increase in the inflation rate of 32 per cent over that period.  It will be accepted that this particular money will not bring <Col N="1001" /> the results which we all desire.  The money to be made available through the banks has yet to be tried out.  We do not know how that particular scheme is going to operate.</P>
    <P>We suggested to the Minister for Local Government and to the House the way in which we could ensure that there would be worthwhile development and increased employment in the building industry.  We proposed that the loan figure of £4,500 be increased to £6,000 and that the qualifying income limited be increased from £2,350 to £3,000. Rather than accept our advice on this, the Government took the opposite view, and not only did they not increase the loan but they increased the interest rate on it from 10½ per cent to 11½ per cent and they reduced the number of years from 35 years to 30 years.  The actual result of the effort by the Government in relation to the building industry in the budget is worse than negative.</P>
    <P>Again, I suggest to the Minister&mdash; as Deputy Fitzgerald has said&mdash;we would be only too glad to give him the Bill immediately on the basis that he would reconsider the position in relation to the building industry and that he would include the building industry in this scheme.  If he did this, it would give assistance to an industry which is capable not only of considerable expansion but of rapid expansion. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this proposal.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I have no doubt that had the Minister had the opportunity of thinking over the proposals made from this side, as he has quite obviously thought over the position of agriculture, he would have accepted what was contained in the amendments put forward by Deputy Fitzgerald, as he accepted part of what was contained in the amendments relating to agriculture.  In the circumstances where we are not only, in relation to this particular Bill, endeavouring to help industries which are in difficulties but also endeavouring to increase employment generally, we are putting forward a worthwhile proposal, and I ask him to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment. I pay tribute to Deputy Fitzgerald for his advocacy of it on the last occasion and for his common-sense approach to the whole matter. This may well have brought about a change of mind on the part of the Minister and it is a compliment to the efficiency of Deputy Fitzgerald.  We had an amendment down previously regarding the waiting period for re-employment. The Minister will now see a strange anomaly in the whole Bill.  Most factories are in urban areas so it would be relatively easy to have people qualifying for re-employment, but when a farmer wants to re-employ some men he may not be able to find suitable men near his own farm.  He must penalise his former employees by telling them that the law will not allow him to re-employ them in order to draw the premium.  He may have to secure a worker from a distance of 20 miles or more to work on his farm. Thus, the local man will be kept out of employment and will put the State or somebody else to the expense of transporting a farm worker from, say, 20 miles away, so that the farmer will qualify for the premium.</P>
      <P>The Minister has amended the Bill to include agriculture and horticulture. If the Bill is to be workable in a rural area, he should now accept the amendment regarding the waiting period of four weeks.  As the Bill stands, a farm labourer who wishes to return to work for his previous employer is prohibited from doing so for four weeks.  It is absurd to pay unemployment benefit to a man who is living near a farm and then pay a man from 20 miles away full wages for his work.  It shows up the inadequacy of this Bill and it is a reflection on the Government because they have clearly not given sufficient thought to it.  The Minister will be forced by various Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment proposed last week and try to make the Bill workable.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill in its entirety.  I welcome in particular the amendment which the Minister has introduced to include agricultural workers under this scheme.  Some of us have made these representations to the Minister and I am glad that the Minister has accepted them.  I believe that the agricultural community can help in the difficult circumstances this country is in and can do their bit to reduce the number of unemployed at this time.  The amendment which is <Col N="1004" /> being presented by the Minister will go a long way to reducing the number of unemployed in rural areas.  I am glad the Minister has introduced this amendment as a result of the representations which we on this side of the House have made to him.</P>

      <P>We are on Committee Stage here and we are dealing with the amendment which came back from the Seanad.  This debate does not spell out what is to be included even in agriculture.  It was restricted in its concept and introduction by the fact that the Minister said he hoped it would cater for 10,000 people although we have 102,000 unemployed.  At that early stage Deputy Fitzgerald had amendments down which were not accepted and which covered a far wider scope than agriculture.  It is very high-handed of somebody like Deputy Kavanagh to come in here and tried to claim credit for something about which he knows nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is on behalf of firms whose means of living is to work for the agricultural community putting up sheds, hay barns and silage layouts. The Minister has stated that the agricultural contractor will qualify. That in itself is very good news.  All this is going to arise at a later date when somebody will have to decide on it and there is no better person than the Minister with his advisers. Will agricultural contractors who are engaged permanently on land project schemes, that is improvement of agricultural land, qualify under this Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be quite happy if the Minister deals with my question later.  Must a person be a rated agricultural occupier to qualify?  Can a person be classified a contractor without being a rated agricultural occupier of land.  These are technical questions that will have to be answered in the Department some day.  What is the position of horse-breeders who own land?  They take on stable lads, they employ boys to look after the stud animals, the sires and the mares.  Do they all qualify if they decide to go into that line of business on a more expansive scale? What is the position of creameries and general milk processing plants? Do they come under manufacturing industries or will they come under agriculture?  I think they will have to <Col N="1006" /> qualify under either one section or another.  There is a recession in some of these firms while others are working at full capacity.  If a company such as Golden Vale, which is expanding all the time, decides to take on 100 extra men will they qualify under this?  They have an unpredictable employment situation depending on the demand for their produce and very often they take on 100 extra men.  I would like the Minister to give a decision on that.</P>
      <P>I understand from what the Minister said that a person has to be on four weeks' unemployment benefit, that it will not do to be on unemployment assistance.  There are young people growing up in rural areas who cannot get employment and they cannot come under unemployment benefit.  While they are in receipt of unemployment assistance if they are employed by somebody that person should be entitled to be paid the same as all the other people whom the Minister has mentioned on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>If a person has agricultural land but has an income from another source, how will he fare under this Bill?  Under which heading will he qualify?  If he does not qualify under the manufacturing industries and if he had land will that man be considered under this Bill? It is a good thing to subsidise so as to give employment.  There is nothing wrong with it but it does not go far enough.  I would be only too delighted to support the Minister to go further in this line of activity because it is better to have a person at work and drawing a steady income than to be relying on UA or UB.</P>

      <P>I should like, for the information of the House, to explain my understanding of the arrangement.  The Order of Business this morning said this Bill would come back from the Seanad with amendments and would occupy from 6 p.m. until 7.30 p.m.  That was subject to agreement with the Government Whips.  I had several amicable conversations with the Opposition Whips today but we have not, in fact, reached any agreement with regard to this Bill.  It is understood that any extra time this Bill takes will be so much time carved out of the Wealth Tax Bill.  That is understood by the Opposition Whips.  I hope it will be <Col N="1008" /> possible to finish this Bill without leaving anyone short of time and get back to the Wealth Tax Bill before long.  I do not want to give anyone the impression that this Bill is being artificially shortened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As days go by one gets more and more confused about what is happening.  Has it come to the stage now that we do not know whether we are finishing at 7.30 or 10.15 p.m.?  Is it because we are going into such a long drawn out Recess in a time of crisis that there is a holiday atmosphere in the Government side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Recess, the shortest amount of research by any commentator, publicist or journalist will show that the Recess announced this morning is shorter than the average Recess has been, and substantially shorter than some Recesses have been even in the best days of the former Government. Leaving that point aside in order to make things clear for Deputy Fitzgerald and his colleagues, the point is that we are obliged to make time in the ordinary evening break for the Employment Premium Bill back from the Seanad.  We allocated 1½ hours for it hoping that would be enough.  If it is not enough, the Bill is not subject either to a guillotine or to an agreement and the Government will move between now and 8.30 p.m. for a late sitting if either side of the House wishes that.  That will be done.</P>
      <P>There is no possible way anybody can shorten this Bill either by agreement or otherwise.  The Wealth Tax Bill is subject to the order of the Dáil made on 9th July and irrespective of what may happen to this Bill that will come to an end, assuming all goes well, between 10 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. this evening.  I say that in order to remove any misapprehension there may have been.  The order made this morning was subject to the Whips agreement.  I had amicable conversations with the Opposition Whip but we did not come to any agreement, merely an expression of hope that the provisions now before the Dáil would be disposed of fairly rapidly.</P>

      <P>Does that make it clear to Deputies that it lies in the power of the Deputies to discuss this Bill until 10.15 p.m. if they so wish. As far as we know that would mean that this Bill would not be finished until we meet again in October unless there is a late sitting.  What is certain is that the guillotine will come on at 10.15 p.m. on the Wealth Tax Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that the problem is arising because there was a guillotine applied to this Bill but, in the course of the discussion in the Seanad, the Minister introduced amendments to the Employment Premium Bill which completely altered the scope of the Bill and obliged this House to engage in the present discussion to which a guillotine has not been applied.  Therefore, any time taken now comes out of the Wealth Tax Bill time which is subject to a guillotine.  The only suggestion I could make would be that, perhaps, the House might like to continue with the discussion on the Employment Premium Bill temporarily and, in the meantime, the Whips on both sides might wish to consult in regard to any other arrangement that might be made on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion from the Chair is that we continue with this Bill and the Whips could discuss the matter and come to a decision that the House might or might not sit beyond 10.30 p.m.  At 8.30 p.m. we have to decide to sit beyond 10.30 p.m. tonight or to rise at that time.  If these amendments are not disposed of before 8.30 p.m. a decision could be made as to whether we would take extra time tonight to dispose of this Bill.  Otherwise, the time given for this Bill inevitably comes out of the time that could be taken for the Wealth Tax Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take the Deputy short on any argument he may put forward but we are dealing with the specific point as to whether we should take time out of the Wealth Tax Bill or to continue with this Bill because as the rules of the House ordain that is what we are inevitably doing, unless we extend the time at 8.30 p.m. to sit later than 10.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to help the Chair by saying to the Minister that we would give him this Bill now if he would agree to broaden the scope.  The Bill is very useful and has a lot of attributes.  If the Minister would broaden the scope of it now we would facilitate him with all the necessary machinery between now and when the Dáil adjourns tonight to extend it to include the building sector and the service industry. This Bill will effectively mean a saving to the Exchequer.  If the Minister can encourage the re-employment of up to 40,000 people by using this Bill as a vehicle we will have done a good night's work here.</P>
      <P>I cannot see any objection, after introducing agriculture, why the Minister cannot introduce those two important areas where employment opportunities can and may be created.  Forget about the technical and administrative difficulties if there is good will on both sides.  Good will was never so necessary as at present.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, this slice of the debate will probably appear on the Official Report under the heading of Business of the House. That is how it began but it has slipped away with the last intervention of Deputy Fitzpatrick into the Bill itself. Before I leave the House, in order to make clear the Government's point of view, I should like to say that the Chair's interpretation of the situation is correct.  In other words, there is no agreement or any order of the House, there is no guillotine or anything of that kind, in regard to this particular Bill.  I accept what Deputy Colley says about the Bill having come back from the Seanad with features about it which were not foreseen at the time <Col N="1011" /> it was before the Dáil.  That is true. Therefore, whatever time is spent this evening discussing this Bill before 10.30 p.m. will be too much time taken out of the last stages of the Wealth Tax Bill.</P>
      <P>I intend to seek the Opposition Whips now&mdash;I have been trying to do that&mdash;to try to reach some agreement about this matter but if it should be impossible to get agreement on concluding this Bill on whatever terms &mdash;I am a complete stranger to the matters at issue between Deputy Fitzgerald and the Minister&mdash;the Government will have no option but to seek an order of the House extending this evening's sitting beyond 10.30 p.m.  I leave it to Deputies to decide for themselves how willing either side of the House will be personally, as distinct from officially, to do that.</P>

      <P>The Minister's presence is always stimulating.  I will concede that.  Before we adjourned the Minister let the cat out of the bag when he spoke about producing the same revenue.  I wonder what revenue the Minister expects to get out of this Bill.  Certainly, as the Minister said, there are such broad current exemptions that the number in the ordinary employed category who will be seriously caught by the Bill may not be large.  Therefore, I am justified in drawing the conclusion that from that category there will be very little accruing to the Revenue in respect of the taxation imposed by this Bill.  On the other hand, there is the undefined area where taxation captures significant sums.  Again, in the absence of specific statements from the Minister it is impossible to estimate what we have in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I repeat what I said before, that the Minister's answer to the case put by Deputy Colley is insufficient on the grounds of incompleteness, that the suggestion that the thresholds would have to be modified by the consideration that certain valuations are to stand for three years is valid, because the case based on the three-year valuation is subject to very serious limitation or qualification.  It is subject to limitation in that it does not apply to stocks outside a number of areas, although it will apply to the valuation of certain shares.  It will not apply, I would imagine, to the market values of shares, varying from time to time on the Stock Exchange.  It will apply to the valuation of property.  It may apply to specific valuation made by the Revenue Commissioners or accepted by the Revenue Commissioners in the case of places where running market values are not accepted or determined, but if there is a changing market value I raise specifically the question: are shares to be valued for three years on where the shares stood on 5th April, 1975? Is that to stand for three years?  It is not.  Are stocks to stand on the valuation? If I am making a mistake please correct me because, as I have said, the intricacies of this legislation can lead one into pitfalls.  I fell into <Col N="1014" /> one earlier for which I hope I have made amends but I, as I see it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When I refer to them I call them shares, but when I refer to the valuation of the running stocks in the estimation of assets, that also is a factor that may change.  Therefore, the Minister's answer is incomplete. The limitation of the provision for a valuation standing for three years to only part of the property subject to the tax, and the qualification to that limitation involved in certain discretionary powers that are vested in the Revenue Commissioners, even where it does apply, means that the Minister's argument is, to say the least of it, only partially valid. Therefore the thresholds, because of the inflationary effect, are an incomplete compensation at best for the inflation as affecting the threshold values.  I think that is a fairly objective and reasonable presentation of the actual situation in response to the Minister's argument, which I take to be a perfectly serious argument.</P>
      <P>On top of this we have a point that it is utterly unfair to everyone who is above the threshold, even if the Minister's argument were valid.  I hope I have demonstrated that its validity is partial at the very best, that even if the Minister's argument were valid for those to whom the thresholds apply, for those to whom it does not apply it becomes a gross injustice because if one inflationary impact comes on them without any relief towards that at all, there is a further logical contradiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk about equality, we talk about treating all our citizens fairly. We talk about envy.  We talk about all these things, but if we leave it as it is what have we got?  We have got <Col N="1015" /> a situation where for those who are at or below the threshold, if the Minister's argument is right and I am accepting it in part, there is some compensation but there is no compensation at all for people above.  That is unfair.  I do not mind a proper scaling of things, but to provide, inadvertently I admit&mdash;I know this was not intended&mdash;for a situation where one class are to be so to speak privileged by the law in an oblique way and that others are to bear the full brunt, is to say the least of it objectionable from the point of view of the principles of equity.</P>
    <P>Let us come to the thresholds themselves. So much for the argument that the Minister himself has advanced.  Let us come to the threshold for a married family, which the Minister has pointed out as a dominant factor, although I still cannot see the logic, as I said before, of why two people have to be treated as one for property and taxation purposes.  I would be repeating a whole argument which will be out of order and I do not wish to do it. Another thought has struck me since. I was just looking at the allowance of £90,000 for a widow or a widower, and here there is another injustice to women, on thresholds.  On that basis a widow, if there was revaluation would be only valued in the Minister's reckoning at £10,000 whereas if she got the same threshold as the widower she would be valued at £50,000.  If the Minister is thinking that way he might as well go to the logical conclusion&mdash;of course I reject the Minister's thinking altogether.  The Minister is treating the woman as a kind of slave in the hands of the husband.</P>

      <P>All right, maybe I somewhat facetiously went off on a tangent.  But it is another example of the Minister's complete lack of logic. However, coming back to this amendment from which I had strayed and coming away from the Minister's argument, to which I think I have given a valid answer, let us look at the absolute values of the thresholds.  I will take £100,000.  It is a round figure. It is the one the Minister has been mesmerised on in connection with the family.  We talked about that on his earlier amendment and I am afraid I digressed on that a minute ago.  Taking that figure, at the way costs and inflation are going, property of the executive employed class, both in the public sector and the private sector, it will not be long before these thresholds are reached.  They could be reached within three years.</P>
      <P>There have been substantial changes in property values between the beginning of this decade and 1974.  There will probably be no review of this legislation in the next three years.  It is conceivable that significant changes could occur.  We are asking that this disequilibrium in values at the moment be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley had to be specific by putting in a phrase to which he is not necessarily tied.  I expressed demur in the same sense in another amendment. The consumer price index is accepted.  I understand the Minister's sensitivity to it.  I understand the Government's embarrassment at having geared things to such an index.  I understand the Taoiseach's anxiety and I understand&mdash;and to some extent I sympathise with&mdash;the Minister's argument on the sensitivity of such an index.  But do not let us lose the spirit of this amendment in focusing narrowly on that measure; do not let us lose the spirit of what Deputy Colley is trying to achieve here by being diverted into specific consideration of consumer price index.  What is fundamentally necessary is that there <Col N="1017" /> is some gearbox supplied by which adjustments can be made to the gradient of prices, to the gradient of money value, in such a way that this Bill will be a taxation on real surplus wealth, not artificial wealth.  Normally, if this had been either five or three years ago one would have been very happy indeed to have taken the principle of the approach here.</P>
    <P>There is one saver here I wish to point to, with approbation of what the Minister has done in this connection. In section 7 there is a relief which is independent of inflation.  I regret the Minister did not accept amendment 17 which would have perfected the whole Bill.  I would have given the qualification that the Seanad had put into the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  This is mainly inflation-independent relief which has great merit.</P>
    <P>With regard to thresholds, they are inflation-dependent.  It would be a merit in the Bill if the Minister could see his way to provide a provision which would at least mitigate that dependency.  The Minister has referred to precedents.  He has invoked past codes.  Amendment of tax legislation in the direction of relief is something that comes very slowly and meets great resistance before it is produced. It is seldom that tax reliefs are given.  It is only in exceptional circumstances that a Government are in a strong enough position to do it.  All the natural forces are pushing in the other direction, even the administrative forces.  It is very seldom a Government can do that.  Where the tax relief comes in mainly is in circumstances where inflation would justify the adjustment of taxes.  It is in that negative sense that the greater part of the relief has come in the past. There has been expansion&mdash;expanding incomes and expanding standards &mdash;but there has not been a corresponding expansion in taxation.  That is only possible in favourable circumstances. That is the normal way that it occurs.  It is unwise to think in terms of adjustments later.  It tends to be too little and too late.</P>
    <P>We have been reminded by the Minister throughout this debate that death duties and similar measures remained <Col N="1018" /> with us for a long time, and he laid the blame on us because we were in Government at the time. Those were the forces which were at work.  When we are dealing with the thresholds, I think that as is automatically done in section 7, some way should be found to mitigate the absolute dependence of these thresholds on inflation.  How to do it is a matter for debate.  In the last analysis, if the principle is accepted and the will is there, the Minister and his advisers will be the most competent and the best people to effect the intention. The consumer price index might conceivably not be the best measure.  Do not let us confuse the issue by hinging on the thing and trying to knock this amendment merely because it refers to the CPI.</P>
    <P>Let us look a little deeper and see what the spirit of the amendment is. The spirit of the amendment is to introduce some kind of gearbox, to find some mechanism within this Bill, a gearbox that will enable us to adjust to the gradients of money values, where we can get into the right gear for a steep inflationary rise, the right gear for a flattening-out situation. It is necessary also to have a braking mechanism&mdash;although the whole history of economic development points the other way&mdash;should the gradient sharply decline.  Indeed when the CPI was introduced as the measure for the increase in the public service and as a measure for adjusting incomes it was in the early days visualised that if there was a gearing down, if the CPI fell, there would be a corresponding fall in the income. That was clearly visualised at the time of the first adoption of this notion.  That has not worked out.  It will never fall sufficiently in that sense.  The movement has been up.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister rejected amendment No. 17.  Here is the other fundamental point: if the Minister cannot do it now, would he consider it for the Seanad and if he came back with an amendment from the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister seemed to be advancing the argument that the thresholds in this Bill are generous, which they are, as a reason for not providing against inflation.  I do not know how that seems to the Minister to make sense.  There is, of course, no connection between the two. Rather what it suggests to me is that the Minister is saying in reality, that fixing the thresholds as they are fixed in this Bill means that in the first instance you are only affecting a small number of people and they are all wealthy and it does not really matter.  Politically it is not going to have any great kick back.  But, on the other hand, if you do not provide for adjustment against inflation, then you are going to get a whole lot more people in who can be induced at the moment to lend either passive support or to adopt a neutral stance in relation to it when they would not adopt such a stance if they realised they were going to be directly affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> That is the practical effect of what the Minister is doing.  He is refusing to build in a provision against inflation. Whether the consumer price index is the best measure of that in my view is an academic question in the absence of a proposal from the Minister to deal with inflation.  There is no such proposal from the Minister. Therefore, the amendment, which would adjust the thresholds in line with movements in the consumer price index, is the best proposition we have got before the House because there is not any other, provided that one agrees with the principle that there ought to be adjustment in line with inflation.  It is, of course, clear that the Minister does not agree with that proposition.</P>
    <P>The reference to fixed values for three years is, of course, as Deputy de Valera pointed out, limited in so far as it does not apply to all property, limited in so far as the Revenue Commissioners are not precluded from reviewing or revising such an adjustment and particularly limited in so far as it does not cover the stock-in-trade of business as I have been indicating earlier.  So that impact of inflation on business in so far as the wealth tax is concerned will continue each year as inflation continues in a way that at the moment is not at all clear to many people.  It will be clear, of course, when it begins to bite on business and adds to overheads which are recovered either by increased prices or by reduction in the labour force to cut overheads in another area.  That is where it will show and when it does it will be for two reasons. Firstly, that the Minister refused to accept the proposition that wealth tax should not apply to productive assets and the other that he refuses to accept the proposition that there ought to be adjustment for inflation in the thresholds.  Because of the Minister's refusal in that regard the impact of the wealth tax can be and I believe will be quite serious.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to accept those two propositions, there would be relatively little difficulty with this whole Bill.  He has refused them, misguidedly in my opinion, but the consequences <Col N="1021" /> of his misguided approach in this regard will not be obvious for some little time.  When it becomes obvious we intend&mdash;and I am giving the Minister due notice now&mdash;to point out exactly who is responsible for these consequences.  The person primarily responsible is the Minister for Finance but he is not the only one.  The others who are almost as responsible are the <Col N="1022" /> other members of the Government. In addition, responsibility lies on the shoulders of every Deputy in the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party who votes for the Bill and against these amendments.  We intend, when these consequences become clear, to point out exactly where that responsibility lies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 17, lines 60 and 61 after &ldquo;received by him,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and, before he has been notified of any claim for tax by the Commissioners, disposed of by him to the person or persons beneficially entitled thereto&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the proviso to subsection (2) of section 14. That proviso refers to persons who are not primarily accountable but secondarily accountable in respect of wealth tax.  Those persons include a wide variety of people such as bankers, solicitors and estate agents or anybody who collects rents, for example, on behalf of an assessable person.  The proviso concerned says &ldquo;that none of those persons shall be liable for tax to an amount in excess of the market value of the property, or in excess of the income, as the case may be, vested in, collected or received by him or her to which he is beneficially entitled in possession.&rdquo; I should have said: &ldquo;collected or received by him or to which he is beneficially entitled in possession&rdquo;. That is all right as far as it goes, but I am suggesting to the Minister it does not go far enough.  We should add to that a provision to the effect that, if such a person, say an estate agent, has collected rents and paid them over he should not be liable in respect of wealth tax if he has paid over these rents in good faith.  It is a different matter if he has been notified by the Revenue Commissioners of a claim or a possible claim for wealth tax.  Then he is on notice.  As the section stands, such a person, having paid over in good faith, can then become liable for wealth tax.  I do not think this is a position that should arise.  Therefore, I am proposing this amendment which reads:</P>
      <P>To insert after &ldquo;received by him&rdquo;&ldquo;and, before he has been notified of any claim for tax by the Commissioners disposed of by him to the person or persons beneficially entitled thereto&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It seems to be reasonable that the liability of persons of this kind should be limited, not only as the proviso says, to such of the property or income as they receive but also to such of the property or income as is in their hands prior to their notification by the Revenue Commissioners of a claim. Anything over and above that is imposing a very unfair burden on such persons.</P>
      <P>There is a precedent for what I am suggesting in section 37 of the Value-Added Tax Act of 1972 where, in cases similar to this, the proviso extends to such amount as the person has collected, say the estate agent or whoever, and has not paid over in good faith prior to receiving notification from the Revenue Commissioners. I would hope the Minister would agree that the principle involved in the amendment and incorporated in the Value-Added Tax Act of 1972 is a good and fair principle and he would, therefore, find it possible to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to justify accepting this amendment.  The section with which we are dealing is that which deals with accountable persons, that is, persons who are accountable in addition to the people who are primarily liable to payment of the tax.  In other words, one might talk about people who are secondarily liable.  There is one vital difference between those primarily liable and those secondarily liable.  The liability of the person who is primarily liable is an unlimited liability.  The liability of the person secondarily liable is limited to the property or income over which he has control.  This limitation is contained in the proviso with which we are concerned.</P>
      <P>Although it is not clear that it contains these objectives, I take it the purpose of the amendment is to limit the liability of those secondarily liable to property or income received after notification to them of a claim by the Revenue Commissioners and limited also to property or income disposed of by them to the person beneficially entitled.  Clearly, the second element is unacceptable right away because it would be open to an accountable person such as a person who had, broadly speaking, control over property or income to transfer the property or income to a third party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for limiting liability to persons who have been notified of liability, this is not possible in a capital taxation if one is to ensure efficiency in the collection of tax.  It may be feasible in taxes such as income tax and value-added tax where there are ample opportunities for cross checking by the Revenue Commissioners with employers, wholesalers, manufacturers, dividend warrants and other returns and the persons involved are continuing in business.  In addition, there is no hardship or inconvenience in the provision in the Bill as all those who are accountable persons or secondarily liable are in a fiduciary and quasi-fiduciary relationship to the taxpayer who is primarily liable apart from those who may be beneficiaries or agents.  It should not be necessary in such cases to inform <Col N="1026" /> the parties concerned of their liability to tax.  Any person who accepts the office of trustee, personal representative, manager, guardian or agents assumes certain responsibilities.  Those responsibilities, as Deputy Colley knows, extend far beyond wealth tax, income tax or any taxation at all.  A person who accepts these roles accepts all the legal obligations attached to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain circumstances, yes.  Before a person accepts any of these roles he ought, in his own interest and, with practice, does in his own interest, check what legal obligations go with them.  We are not dealing with naive inexperienced people who are not acquainted with their responsibilities.  The kind of situations we are dealing with are ones which are operated by people who are well-informed or are in a position to be well-advised as to their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, let us consider other aspects.  The property of the assessable person must be vested in such person on the valuation date or the management of the property or the collection of the income thereof must take place on the valuation date or within a year thereafter.  The accountable person has a right of reimbursement both from the taxpayer, the person primarily liable, and from the property itself or from the property in question.  There can be no question of hardship if the right to recovery is established.  In fact, recovery is guaranteed by the Act and it can be exercised against both another person and against the property involved.</P>
      <P>It is pertinent to recall that a similar liability existed under the death duty code and was discharged by many personal representatives under that code. I am not aware that that responsibility created any difficulties.  I am sure Deputy Colley, as a legal practitioner, will accept it was very necessary that that liability should have attached to the personal representative under the death duty code.</P>

He knows that if he accepts the particular role that it has duties and those duties must be fulfilled by him.</P>

In the first place, in most of these cases there would probably not be a liability.  In addition to that, even in the case of solicitors and certainly in the case of banks or other agents, in very many cases they might not be able to know what the total value of their client's holding might be.  The Minister says that this is a person who has a responsibility.  If a person is employed in a semi-managerial capacity as an agent to collect rents on a commission on behalf of some individual is that person entitled to say to that individual: &ldquo;I want to know what the total of your property is; are you liable for tax?&rdquo; Certainly, in some cases the owner of the property is quite likely to turn on him and say: &ldquo;What has that got to do with you?  I am paying you so much for collecting this.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister instances the case of death duties.  Death duties is a case of once only&mdash;or was.  It is something of which people will be conscious.  The heirs, the beneficiaries and all solicitors engaged in the matter would be aware of the taxes that would be due. I would argue with the Minister that the person who is in the secondary position has not got that control other than a control over the money that is passing through.  He has not necessarily got the knowledge.  It seems to <Col N="1028" /> me that in circumstances like this, where the Commissioners would have the knowledge and the agent might not necessarily have the knowledge, it is not unreasonable for Deputy Colley to put forward the amendment that he should be notified of any claim for tax by the Commissioners.  I think that that is a reasonable proposition that the Minister ought to consider.</P>

      <P>First, in regard to the Minister's reference to the right of a person secondarily accountable to recover the money which he has to pay to the Revenue Commissioners either from the taxable person or from the property itself, the Minister knows as well as I do that the kind of person we are talking about here will only be gone after by the Revenue Commissioners if they cannot recover from the person primarily accountable. Therefore, to talk about this person having a right of recovery is all very well in theory but in practice the Minister knows that when this problem arises the man will not be able to recover the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the estate agent who collected the rent and paid it over in good faith?  Does the Minister really think that it is a reasonable proposition that an estate agent will collect his rent and pay it over in good faith with no reason, as Deputy Brugha said, to know that there is any question of liability for wealth tax, and having paid it over and the person to whom he has paid his tax having left the country then the Revenue Commissioners got after him and he is personally liable to the <Col N="1029" /> Revenue Commissioners for whatever the amount is that he has paid over in the way of rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He may not be entitled to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, and he has then, with the compliments of the Minister, the right to recover this from the fellow who has left the country and taken the property with him.  I do not think that this is a reasonable proposition and I think that it is a reasonable proposition to say that such a person should be liable if he has been notified by the Revenue Commissioners of a claim. In that case he is warned and he should not part with the money until he is cleared by the Revenue Commissioners. But where he pays it over in good faith, without any indication of a claim, I think it is a gross injustice to make a person like that personally liable out of his own pocket to pay.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister does not accept the reasonableness of this.  If the Minister said that he wanted to confine the reliefs sought here to certain categories of persons, I would understand that because I agree that in the case, say, of a personal representative or a guardian, he is likely to have fairly detailed knowledge of what the estate is, although as Deputy Brugha pointed out, we are dealing with an annual tax here unlike death duties.  The Minister did not make any such case.  In a blanket way he says: no, this cannot and should not be done.  I think that he is wrong and I think that if an estate agent of the kind I have mentioned finds himself saddled with a liability for hundreds or perhaps, thousands of pounds out of his own pocket without any real possibility of recovery, this is an injustice and that it will occur but the Minister is refusing to accept this amendment.  That is a very unfortunate situation.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 18, line 39, after &ldquo;accountable person&rdquo;, to insert <Col N="1030" />&ldquo;other than the spouse or minor child of the assessable person concerned&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with what I referred to earlier as the notorious spy clause in this Bill.  The Minister, under a great deal of pressure, introduced an amendment on Committee Stage which went part of the way to remove the worst features of this. But, as I pointed out on Committee Stage, it did not go far enough.  I noticed that the Minister brought in no amendment to deal with the problem still left.  That is why I put down this amendment myself.  The effect of it is to provide that the spouse or minor child of an accountable person will not be, as the Bill proposes, subjected to the obligation to give information to the Revenue Commissioners about a spouse or parent under pain of a penalty of £1,000 and a possible fine of £50 a day where he or she fails to give the information.</P>
    <P>To impose an obligation of this kind on the spouse to give such information in respect of his wife or, in the case of a woman, in respect of her husband or to impose such an obligation in the case of minor children in respect of their parents is objectionable and inquistorial and possibly unconstitutional.  If a person were accused of a very serious crime, including murder, the wife of such a person, if it were a man, could not be compelled&mdash;in fact would not be allowed&mdash;to give evidence which would lead to that person's conviction. But we are providing here that not alone will they be obliged to do this but they will be subjected to a very heavy penalty and there is similar provision in the case of the minor child.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to tell us that that is not the intention and that it will not be done, the answer is: accept the amendment and make sure it cannot be done.  Because, of course, under the terms of the Bill, an accountable person in possession of information relevant to the taxable wealth of an assessable person &ldquo;shall disclose to the Commissioners&rdquo;<i>et cetera.</i> An accountable person by virtue of section 14, includes the spouse or the <Col N="1031" /> minor child of the accountable person. I think that this whole subsection should never have been introduced and that the thinking behind it is objectionable and that it was amended only under considerable pressure and that there is just as much reason why it should be amended in the way I am proposing now as there was for the amendment that the Minister introduced on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am urging the Minister, whatever may be the intentions in this regard, to make it absolutely clear by acceptance of this amendment that we cannot, under this Bill, have a situation in which the spouse or minor child of an accountable person will be compellable, under pain of heavy penalty, to give information in regard to the property of the spouse or of the parent concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow Deputy Colley.  Perhaps I should preface my remarks by saying that the rules of criminal law do not apply to taxation law and they never have applied.  If they did apply would it not be open to the Revenue Commissioners to issue an assessment form to a person.  To issue an income tax assessment form the Revenue Commissioners must form the opinion without proof that the person has an income.  Criminal law does not allow the law to presume a person guilty until such a fact is proved.  The whole taxation system would collapse if the Revenue Commissioners could not assume certain things which may, in fact, throw an onus over on to the taxpayer to disprove the assumption of the Revenue Commissioners.  But there have been a number of arguments throughout the capital taxation debate for several months which assumed that taxation law is operated on the same principles as the criminal law.  It never has so operated nor could it have operated on the same basis because if we have to wait until proof is established, then tax avoidance would operate on a much larger scale than it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are obligations on taxpayers to disclose their affairs.  There is no <Col N="1032" /> obligation&mdash;except a moral obligation &mdash;on a criminal to disclose his guilt but it is not regarded as an offence if he does not.  But there is a statutory obligation on a taxpayer who is liable to pay tax to disclose the information and failure to discharge that statutory obligation leaves the person liable payment of a fine.  Let us start with that approach and be concerned with the obligation which taxpayers have to disclose their affairs in order that they may be properly assessed for their liability to tax.  If that is done, surely it is not wrong to say that a spouse or a child who is an accountable person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But would he be free from the obligation of disclosing the information merely because he passed it on to somebody else?  The obligation which would lie on the spouse or child that Deputy Colley seeks to exempt is no more than the obligation on the person primarily liable and if the person decides to arrange his affairs in such a way as to impose responsibility on another, so be it; that is his choice.  If other people accept the responsibility, that is their choice.  I cannot see that it would be right to exempt them from an obligation as they have accepted the responsibility which went with acceptance of a role.  There is no reason why they should be exempt from the responsibility any more than anybody else.  I cannot see for a moment that they should be excluded from accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley acknowledged in the previous amendment that the Revenue Commissioners would not proceed against the person unless they <Col N="1033" /> had reason to believe that the person was in a position to pay up.  That is, of course, the truth, that they would not proceed against a wife or a minor child unless they were in a position to pay.  For the life of me I simply cannot understand the reasoning behind the amendment.  If such persons were called upon to pay the tax on the wealth of the husband, say, in the case of the spouse and the father in the case of the child, they would have a right of reimbursement against the person primarily liable.</P>

      <P>I could not disagree more with the Minister.  He is adopting the attitude that because there is a relationship the person has an obligation to disclose something with which he is not connected.  The purpose behind Deputy Colley's amendment is to draw from the Minister an assurance that a wife or a child under subsection (6) of section 14 would not be obliged to provide information about a parent.  The Minister can easily resolve this by stating whether in these circumstances a wife or a minor child is an accountable person, not in relation to anything that the wife or the minor child might possess. If the Minister is prepared to say an accountable person in that context is not accountable in relation to the father or the mother's property, then the problem is solved.  Is the Minister saying that because a child is related to a person of because a woman is married to a man that therefore that person must provide information under this section?</P>

It is stated that: &ldquo;An accountable person in possession of information <Col N="1036" /> shall disclose in relation to an assessable person....&rdquo; It seems to be read in relation to &ldquo;an assessable person&rdquo;. If the Minister can say that does not include what is implied in Deputy Colley's amendment that it is all right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put this matter in very blunt terms.  I should like to refer to the principles of the case which caused the Taoiseach to walk through the other lobby on one occasion.  We have heard a lot of complaints about Iron Curtain countries getting spouses and children to spy on their parents.  If the directly accountable person is a husband or a wife then the spouse and child of that person should not be required to give information in regard to them.  There are circumstances in criminal law where compulsion exists but there are certain cases where it is protected. We have a point here coming very near to constitutional rights.  I refer particularly to the grounds on which the Supreme Court made their decision in the contraception case.</P>
      <P>It is possible to make all kinds of distinctions.  It can be said that the spouse or the child has an interest in the property.  We can develop all the niceties of the argument.  If the person is not assessable, if the assessable person is a minor, all that is covered. On the basic principle of family integrity, and the principles of which the Minister relied in another context here tonight, we shall not legislate that information be given for official and taxation purposes that might be used to make a liar of the spouse.  It might be used to bring a penalty on the spouse which is very near to bringing criminal liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am putting this in crude terms because of the time factor.  I want it placed on the record of the House. There is a little slip here that is going too far for administrative convenience, though I completely trust the judgment and the discretion and the sensitivity of the Revenue Commissioners in this.  It is very easy to get lost in the technicalities of a matter like this.  When I speak vehemently I hope the Minister will realise that it is not in an accusatory fashion that I <Col N="1037" /> do so.  It is merely to emphasise what I am saying in the short time available to me.  If the matter is looked at in that way, then some amendment of this nature is necessary.</P>

I want to tell the Minister that it is very likely if the Revenue Commissioners try to enforce this that it will end up in the courts.  It should not end up in the courts because there is an amendment here which could be easily accepted, which would not interfere in any way with the efficient operation of the tax.  It should not have been necessary, it should have been properly drafted. When the matter was brought to the Minister's attention there should have been an amendment from the Minister but there was not.  I want to make it clear that as far as this side of the House is concerned we do not accept the proposition and we are totally opposed to it.  We are not going to vote against it because if we did we could not even talk about the next amendment.

      <P>We had a release to the news media from the Government saying <Col N="1040" /> in their graciousness that this open Government were not going to impose this obligation.  They brought in an amendment which improved the situation but, as I indicated on the last amendment, it left the obligation on the spouse or minor children.  It is doing more than that.  It is leaving an obligation here on an accountable person not only for the person in respect of whom he is accountable but in respect of any assessable person. The amendment which I am moving seeks to ensure that the obligation on the accountable person will relate only to the property in respect of which he is accountable comprised in the taxable wealth of the assessable person concerned.  It could be argued that this is merely a matter of semantics, but it is a great deal more than that and the significance of it is seen if one looks at section 15 (2) which is dealing with this situation.  It says:</P>
      <P>A person who is accountable for the payment of tax by virtue of section 14 (2) shall, if he is required in writing by the Commissioners to do so, deliver to the Commissioners, within such time, not being less than 30 days, as may be specified in the requirement, on a form provided by them a return of all the property in respect of which he is accountable comprised in the taxable wealth of the assessable person concerned...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of my amendment was taken from section 15 (2).  There was care taken in the drafting of that subsection to make it quite clear as to the extent of the obligation of the accountable person.  We get to this obligation which arises out of how this was drafted originally and what was intended. We find that the obligation here is on the accountable person to furnish information relevant to the taxable wealth of an assessable person, not the assessable person concerned, not the assessable person in respect of whose wealth he is an accountable person, but just an assessable person. It is possible that the Minister could have argued that despite the fact that the subsection does not say it, this related solely to the assessable person concerned.  He might have argued that. <Col N="1041" /> He would have been wrong in my view but he could have had some kind of tenable argument but for the wording of subsection (2) of section 15.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that once a court has drawn to its attention the wording used in section 15 (2) to deal with a situation like that it must assume that when different wording was used in section 14 (6) there was a different intention.  The different intention is clear enough.  It is that in the case of section 15 (2) it is intended to confine the liability involved on an accountable person, the liability imposed on an accountable person, to a return in respect of the property in respect of which he is accountable, such property as is comprised in the taxable wealth of the assessable person concerned.  There is no doubt, no room for ambiguity, in that regard at all.  But when we look at section 14 (6) there is no such limitation. It simply is an accountable person in possession of information relevant to the taxable wealth of an assessable person shall disclose to the commissioners.</P>
    <P>If section 15 (2) did not exist the Minister might have it open to him to argue that subsection (6) does not mean what it appears to mean but the existence of the wording in subsection (2) of section 15, I suggest makes it impossible to adopt that argument.  One must assume, and I believe any court would assume, in the circumstances, that what is intended to be achieved in section 14 (6) is to make an accountable person liable to furnish information in respect of the taxable wealth of an assessable person&mdash;any assessable person.  If that were not so intended, then the clear wording taken from section 15 would be incorporated.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that, having regard to the genesis of this subsection, having regard to how it was originally drafted and the obligation it imposed in respect of anyone, then one has every right to be doubtful and suspicious about the implications of this subsection.  We can recall that an accountable person is being made liable to furnish information in respect of any assessable person and that under <Col N="1042" /> section 1 an assessable person means an individual, a discretionary trust or a private non-trading company&mdash;it can cover virtually anyone&mdash;and an accountable person includes such people as banks, accountants, solicitors, estate agents collecting rent and many other categories of persons.  They can all be accountable persons.  Any one of them under this subsection, as it is drafted without this amendment, can be made liable to furnish information in respect of the taxable wealth of an assessable person&mdash;not the assessable person in respect of whom they are accountable.  If that were so the wording of section 15 would be used.  That is clearly not the intention.  If it was the intention it is not achieved.  Therefore, without the acceptance of this amendment, this spy clause, while not as bad as it was originally, will still be thoroughly unacceptable.  As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, it is thoroughly unacceptable as it stands and, I believe, it will be thoroughly unacceptable to many people, including those who were so concerned at the original wording of this subsection and those who, as a result of their concern and their expression of it, found an amendment introduced which they thought cured it but, in fact, did not cure it.</P>

Having lost the debate and the vote on the issue of whether or not Ireland should have a wealth tax and being aware that the overwhelming majority of our people are in favour of a wealth tax because they see the justice of it, Fianna Fáil, frustrated in their efforts to prevent a wealth tax, have still a forlorn hope that the Wealth Tax Bill will be stillborn.

      <P>Deputy Colley misreads section 15 and ignores the fact that line 57, subsection (1), of that section contains the definite article and not the indefinite article before the words, &ldquo;assessable person&rdquo;.  It is the person who is primarily accountable for the payment of tax by virtue of section 14 (1) shall, within three months after every valuation date, deliver to the Commissioners on a form provided by them a return of all the property comprised in the taxable wealth of the assessable person&mdash;that is, the assessable person in respect of whom the person obliged to give the information is the accountable person. That is perfectly clear.  Though Deputy Colley may, irresponsibly, get on his spy hunt, the words of the Act are what the courts will look at, what the Revenue Commissioners will look at and what the practitioners will look at and not any of the spy hunts of Deputy Colley and his friends.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment now proposed by Deputy Colley, which is similar to the amendment tabled by him at Committee Stage, seeks to ensure that an accountable person is liable to furnish information in respect only of the taxable wealth of an assessable person in respect of whose tax he is an accountable person.  That is the intention of the section as it appears in the Bill.  It is not capable of any other honest interpretation. An accountable person, call him Mr. A, in possession of information relevant to the taxable wealth of Mr. B, is required to disclose such information as the Revenue Commissioners require for the ascertainment of liability to or for the collection of wealth tax.  In the context of wealth tax the tax on that taxable wealth can be payable only by Mr. B or by his accountable person.  It is impossible to visualise circumstances in which Mr. A could be asked to furnish information in respect of that wealth, in connection with the taxable wealth of any stranger, because the stranger would not own that property. The taxable wealth of an assessable person, and information relevant to that wealth, can be relevant only to the case of the assessable person who owns the wealth and in whose hands it is liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the information can only be sought for the purpose of ascertaining liability to or for the collection of tax.  The question of liability to tax can arise only in connection with that assessable person and no other.  I suggest, therefore, that the Deputy withdraw his amendment.  Our views in relation to this specific amendment happen to coincide whatever about the interpretation Deputy Colley put on it, with which I vigorously disagree.  The section as it now stands in the Bill achieves what <Col N="1046" /> Deputy Colley seeks to achieve, that and no more, and is not capable, with the greatest respect, of any other possible interpretation.</P>

      <P>We are in a more arguable area than on the last amendment but there are questions arising here that go into a certain area.  We have not time to make long debate and discussion out of this and it would get into some very fine parsing of law, particularly on this amendment. On the last amendment I drew attention to a fundamental aspect.  I have a suggestion to make to the Minister now.  Would he ask the President to refer this section, and the Bill as a whole, to the Supreme Court for a ruling on constitutionality?  Is that not a reasonable suggestion to the Government?</P>

      <P>The Government can always make suggestions and take the initiative in a matter of this nature.  If there is difficulty there is machinery there by which the opinion of the Supreme Court could be obtained. It would resolve whether we are right or the Minister is right.  I can appreciate as a lawyer that interpretations can be fine things in an area of this nature.  I make the positive suggestion to the Minister that it might be a wise thing to have such provisions ruled upon in advance, and it would be greatly to the convenience of the Revenue Commissioners to know where they stand.  It would obviate the costs to either them or somebody else of legal proceedings; it would bring certainty to the law and it is certainly an area, particularly in view of the points I raised on the last amendment, which seems to be eminently suitable for reference.  We have this constitutional procedure.  We have not time to debate the whole matter in the House.  Deputy Esmonde, a lawyer, is accusing people in a most <Col N="1047" /> unprofessional manner, shouting across the House &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo;, and things like that instead of giving an argument.</P>

      <P>I have and I have heard judges bring them to order. There is a constitutional way out of this.  I hope it is a constructive suggestion to the Minister in regard to this and similar provisions in this taxation code.  A number of factors come into this.  There is always the factor of considerable risk, and there the State is at a great advantage but the unfortunate citizen at a disadvantage. There is considerable risk in taking a case but when a citizen takes a case and wins it is the taxpayer who pays. These are points to be carefully weighed and considered by this House in making legislation.  In this sensitive area, having regard to the position of our Supreme Court in the Constitution and the fact that this is an area where such questions are likely to arise, the suggestion I made to the Minister is, I hope, a sober, considerate and sensible compromise on this debate.</P>
      <P>It would be illogical for me in the short time available to attempt a further legal analysis.  If Deputy Esmonde was serious and we were serious about it we would take up a lot of time in parsing words and in interpretation instead of calling one another names.</P>

Deputy Colley has tabled an amendment to tighten up the Bill so that when the average person reads the Bill he will know who &ldquo;an accountable person&rdquo; is.  That is what we are trying to do.  Deputy Colley tried to do this in the previous amendment as regards the spouse and minor child.  The Minister failed to comprehend what he was talking about.  In this section he is trying to bring some sense of rational thinking so that the average person can, without having to go to the courts, understand it.</P>
      <P>We all know that capital taxation Bills are complicated.  I am sorry the Minister cannot see the wisdom in Deputy Colley's amendment.  If there is one person in this House I should like to pay respect and gratitude to for the work he has done for democracy, both on the Capital Gains Tax Bill and this Wealth Tax Bill, it is Deputy Colley who researched for the majority of these amendments.</P>

I was pointing out the work Deputy Colley has put into these amendments to try to bring some sense of respectability to the Bill.  The Minister has rejected amendments which would have improved the Bill to some extent.  We are trying to ensure that there will be no ambiguity, good, bad or indifferent, when this Bill goes through the House; that there will be no dissention between families, as regards who is an &ldquo;assessable person&rdquo; and who should give information as regards an assessable person.  We know what happened over the years as regards the break-up of families&mdash;&mdash;</P>

For Bills like this which are let go through the House I do not blame the draftsman: it is the Minister I blame.  It has been brought to his attention that this section has a defect which could be improved considerably.  Evidently the Minister is not prepared to do anything about it.  I have lost track of the number of hours and days we have spent debating this Bill.  Each of the amendments contains the same amount of common sense but it is obvious that the Minister has failed&mdash;I can forgive him now as he is probably tired, but I cannot forgive him for having rejected earlier amendments&mdash;to realise the realities and difficulties of the country today.</P>

If I am an accountable person, the Revenue Commissioners could ask me to give information in regard to an assessable person.  That is how I read the Bill and I am entitled to make my own interpretation.  Deputy Colley's amendment is designed to tighten the whole section.  It reads:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say now, as I said before, that this is a highly technical field.  As I look around I do not see anybody but legal people. I spoke on this section before. People in the country think this section, though watered down is part of a spy Bill and that the protection in it deals with a person who could be named as a spy.  Admittedly, the Minister watered it down and went to a great deal of trouble to disclose to the public that that part of the Bill gives reliefs.  As a layman I do not think so.  What I should like to know is who this &ldquo;accountable person&rdquo; would be.  He may be a brother of the owner or a brother-in-law of the &ldquo;assessable person.&rdquo; As far as I can see, under this Bill he has to return that information within a certain period of time and if he does not do that he is open to a fine of up to £1,000.  That is what I am led to believe, as are a lot of other people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde is looking at me as if I was being led astray.  The Deputy knows that there are not too many people in the country who can be led astray on any subject.  I spoke a lot on one of the sections on the Second Stage debate and later on the amendments, and especially section 15.  I went into great detail on that.  With all due respect to the Revenue, their powers are very far-reaching.  They can sue an estate agent for income tax if the assessable person does not pay up or goes away.  That is a fact, because I have seen it happen and I have evidence to show that.  A lot of people, including estate agents, were not aware of that fact, but when they get a letter demanding that under this Bill they will soon realise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see it, the accountable person could be anybody.  It could be a relation.  As far as I can see, this Bill <Col N="1054" /> is going very far and it is going to come into every aspect of life a person is involved in.  It can have a very damaging effect because it is the people who have money who set the country going in all projects.  If this Bill goes through I can see nothing but money running out of the country, which it has been doing for the past 12 months. It has happened since the Bill was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies.  I know that estate agents and other people can be written to now for information and they will have to give that information under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  The Minister is going to ask relations of the people concerned to give information. Deputy Colley's amendment is a reasonable one.  The person who is liable for the tax is the person who should have to give the information as well as his accountant or legal adviser.  It should not be a case of a brother-in-law, a son, or a sister-in-law being required to give the information. It has been twisted around to make it look as if everything is all right.  As the Minister knows, when the Bill was introduced, the section was very open.  It alluded to &ldquo;the person&rdquo; and the Minister watered it down as a result of the debate.  Now he has twisted it around again but the position remains the same.  I do not like this accountable person being a spouse.  In many cases the affairs of a husband or wife, son, sister-in-law whatever the case may be are not disclosed to each other. I think the Minister will agree with me on that.</P>
      <P>The section as drafted exceeds Constitutional rights.  I am not a lawyer but in my view I would have a reasonable case to state in court that I did not wish that a niece, nephew, aunt, mother or father, whatever the case may be, should be required to disclose information about me.  That it what this section means.  It is a poor day when that position is brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> A person has only 30 days in which to comply with the regulation.  This would put the persons concerned in a very awkward position.</P>

      <P>In regard to this amendment, first of all lest there be any misunderstanding about this, if what I am urging on the Minister is the correct interpretation of the subsection as it is at the moment, then the position is that, contrary to the Minister's views, as expressed when he was speaking on this amendment, there could be many people affected. Let us take a bank as an example.  A bank can be an accountable person as the Minister well knows.  It can be an accountable person, let us say, in respect of Mr. X.  But a bank, of <Col N="1056" /> course, can also be in possession of a great deal of information in relation to Y and Z in respect of whom the bank is not an accountable person.  I am taking the bank just as an example.  There are solicitors and a number of other people, estate agents and so on, who can come into this category.  Therefore, if the contention I am making is correct, the accountable person such as a bank could be made under pain of substantial penalty to disclose information in respect of the taxable wealth of quite a number of people in respect of whom, say, the bank is not accountable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>an accountable person in possession of information relevant to the taxable wealth of an assessable person...</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not &ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;an&rdquo; assessable person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of this amendment is, as I said earlier, taken from subsection (2) of section 15 which leaves no room whatever for ambiguity or doubt.  The Minister referred to subsection (1) of section 15.  He did not say that I could ascertain comment on the significance of the wording in subsection (2).  But he did refer to the wording in subsection (1) and talked about the use of the definite article in subsection (1) of section 15, which refers to the taxable wealth of &ldquo;the&rdquo; assessable person.  Why that should be more relevant to section 14 subsection (6) than subsection (2) of section 15 escapes me.  But even if it is relevant, the important point to observe here is that in section 15 subsection (1) there is a reference to &ldquo;the&rdquo; assessable person.  In section 6 which we are <Col N="1057" /> seeking to amend the reference is to &ldquo;an&rdquo; assessable person, so that if there is any significance in the reference in section 15 subsection (1) the significance is that it differs from the thing that we are trying to amend. The Minister is shaking his head. Does he disagree with that?</P>

      <P>It is quite clear now that it is no accident that this subsection is drafted as it is.  It is clear that the Minister was obliged by force of public opinion to amend it.  In amending it he has left a number of very doubtful constitutional provisions in it.  We are concluding this debate on a note which is consonant with the attitude taken by the Minister throughout the debate on wealth tax.  The attitude is one of &ldquo;I could not care less for the rights of the citizens of this country.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported there was some discussion about how this amendment came to be carried through the Seanad. Deputies opposite are in agreement with the extension of this Bill to agriculture. The reason for this extension <Col N="1061" /> is the benefits that can be got from the gainful employment of more people in agriculture.  Deputies opposite also adverted to the desirability of other service industries being brought within the scope of this legislation.  I emphasise that the intent behind this Bill is to ensure that extra workers will be brought into employment by means of this measure, workers who would not be brought into employment but for the passing of this measure.  The target we have set will, in the main, be taken up by manufacturing industry. Anyone who looks at the position impartially must agree that manufacturing industry is the area of our economy which has suffered most. The Bill's provisions, therefore, are designed to bring workers back into those sectors of manufacturing industry which have been worst hit.  We have not extended it to areas where seasonality rules, where people would be brought into periodic work irrespective of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is not quite true to say that there is no cost to the State in this measure. There is a cost but it is a cost the State and this Government are very willing to carry.  We hope to take people off the live register.  We hope, within a qualifying period, to ensure that those who are unemployed can be brought into employment.</P>
      <P>The difference in the regulations between agriculture and industry is that in agriculture they will require a nine months' period.  Most Deputies will agree that there is a similarity operating in agriculture and we are anxious to see that the provisions of this Bill bring about a situation where continuity of employment is guaranteed to those brought into agriculture as a result of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been criticism of the fact that the Bill has been brought back to this House incomplete because this provision has been added to it.  I have adopted as a general principle keeping an open mind on all legislation from my Department.  If good arguments are put up, I listen to them carefully.  If I see no difficulties in accepting proposals from any <Col N="1062" /> part of the House, then I accept them and incorporate them in whatever the measure is.  That is what I have done in this legislation on its passage from one House to the other.  I was approached by members of both parties in the Government who made strong representations to me on the desirability of including agriculture.  I make this point to their credit because I understand it is the function of the Opposition to claim credit for amendments that are carried.  Deputy Fitzgerald had such an amendment here last week but, for the record, it is important to point out that I received representations from Deputies in my own party.  Deputy Kavanagh, who spoke here this evening, made strong representations to me for one constituency with a rural background. He said that agriculture should be included.  Members of the Fine Gael Party also approached me and in this House we had the amendment from Deputy Fitzgerald.  I do not mind who wishes to claim credit for it, but we are all agreed it is a desirable addition.</P>
    <P>We will find that the people who comprise this target of 10,000 extra workers will, in the main, come from manufacturing industry because this is the area most in need of this particular measure.  I have used the criterion of aid to ailing industry.  All along I have made the point that the legislation was designed to be an incentive to employers to bring back into gainful employment workers who would not be back in gainful employment but for this legislation.  This is an endeavour to bring us up to the period of general recovery which, it is generally anticipated, will occur in the spring or early summer of next year.  It is not a panacea for unemployment and no such claim was made.  What is a panacea for unemployment is an extremely complicated question indeed.  Under all Governments here we have always tolerated what would be a socially unacceptable level of unemployment by the standards of any other democratic country in Europe.  There has been an increase in unemployment, an increase added to a chronic unemployment <Col N="1063" /> figure, chronic under all Governments, chronic in the best days of the Members opposite even while this country was really participating in the general economic expansion around the world.</P>
    <P>This measure will assist and all those who spoke here admitted that it could be of benefit in bringing us through the winter months and in ensuring that industry will bring back workers they will need in the period of general expansion next year.</P>

      <P>Only a recovery in demand in the home economy and a recovery in our main export markets can bring about a real improvement in the employment figures. That alone can change unemployment. This measure will assist materially. It will help towards bringing us back to a more normal situation.  It is not claimed that this measure is a complete solution and it would be nonsense to suggest it is.  It will assist in bringing workers back in the months ahead into employment and it will ensure that the workers will be there when recovery takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was asked both here and in the other House what other measures should be taken to assist the work force.  Should we be doing anything about training?  We are, and Deputy Fitzgerald and other speakers know <Col N="1064" /> that we have the largest expansion ever in our training programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy studies the debate we have had here tonight he will see that it has been broadened to an extent that certainly did not meet with my agreement.  It was broadened to bring in the employer/labour agreement.  Such a speech was made by the Deputy's party leader and I have explained, relative to other measures, what is claimed for this measure.  It has been criticised on criteria I have not adopted.  I have said that it will be a helpful measure in bringing back into employment a certain number of people who are unemployed at present, but Deputies opposite constantly use the yardstick of the total unemployment situation.  The Bill is not designed to deal with the total unemployment situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can say that again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it must be seen as a help in assisting to solve the present unemployment problem. It will bring back a certain number of people into gainful employment.  It should bring aid to the service industries. The fact is this Government have already materially assisted the building industry.  We have made a large investment in that industry to assist its recovery because that obviously was necessary to assist in our balance of payments and we have done this.  The Minister for Local Government has given information to the House about the measures that have been taken in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make these few points on this amendment which embodies many suggestions made by members of all parties. I have heard no criticism of the amendment, except that other categories <Col N="1065" /> should be added to it.  I have explained the reasons why we have not added other industries to it and I have indicated that I am confident that the main thrust of this legislation is directed towards manufacturing industry where the greatest unemployment has occurred but agriculture also can play a part in aiding our intention of bringing back workers into employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us are there any differences in conditions as between manufacturing industry and agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the nine months' period.  By this measure we make it possible for a person to be brought back into full time working within the confines of the nine months' period and this employment can extend beyond that, as it says here, without prejudice to any conditions in the scheme which continue to apply after that date.  After the closing date for agriculture we would have discretion to permit it to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to point out to the Minister that he accused me of saying that this Bill was an aid to ailing industry.  I never said such a thing.  What I said was that he had disagreed with me on what I saw as the priority of the Bill.  I regard as the priority creating jobs and getting people back to work.  I did not expect that in one move 36,000 extra people who have become unemployed in the last year could have been put back in gainful employment by this Bill.  We would be more positive in our approach if we could look at it as being a means by which a sizeable number of people could be given the opportunity of returning to work in any industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill if used properly to create employment opportunities will result in an overall saving for the State Exchequer if it is properly guarded and controlled and if no violation of the regulations is allowed.  As I pointed out earlier the man in receipt of unemployment benefit, if he is married and has two children is <Col N="1066" /> drawing £21 per week plus pay-related benefit&mdash;a direct cost and charge on the Exchequer.  If that man can be employed under the scheme and if that scheme covers all facets of industry then the Exchequer will pay £12 to his employer.  There will be a saving initially, if we take the case of a married man with two children, of £9 plus his pay-related benefit per week.  In addition, in the case of a man or woman there will be £4.50 approximately repaid to the State by way of the social insurance stamp plus possible income tax payments.  I cannot see how this Bill can be anything other than a saving to the Exchequer.  There will be a charge against the Department of Labour on the one hand, admittedly, but against that there is a substantial saving in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Minister has no clause in the Bill to enable him to broaden the scope of it to include building industries or service industries or any other areas where people can be gainfully employed.  I take the point the Minister makes about the greater opportunities being in manufacturing industry: I hope he is right.  He said he looked on the 10,000 jobs as being a target, but when I questioned him on that figure on Committee Stage he indicated that he hoped that was only the beginning, that it would go on from 10,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>A target, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely a target is something you aim at. In my opinion the sky should be your limit as a target.  Our urgent need in this country is employment, to get people back to work.  There is an added bonus in getting people working and getting people off the live register: it is a morale boost to them and their families.  There is nothing more disheartening or degrading than being unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that he had representations from his colleagues in Government and from this side of the House.  I welcome this and I was amazed when some Deputies on the back benches asked us if we were opposing this Bill.  We have supported <Col N="1067" /> this Bill from the beginning but we are asking that it be made more effective by broadening the scope of it.  The very arguments that the Minister is using now against further broadening the scope to include building and service industries could equally apply to agriculture.  We cannot erase from our minds the fact that one-sixth of the total number unemployed over and above this time last year, 6,000 of the 36,000, are in the building industry.  That does not take into account the jobs in the ancillary industries that are dependent on the building industry, which would be significantly greater.</P>
    <P>If at any time between now and 22nd October the Minister sees the opportunity of extending the scope of the Bill and bringing in these industries, of creating further job opportunities, he may not do so under the terms of this Bill.  This is what we criticise.  The arguments used against the building industry and the service industries can equally be used against agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not mentioned in either House a target for the number of people he hopes to bring in under agriculture: I hope it is big: the greater, the better we will like it.  Of the three categories I mentioned in an amendment last week, its contribution to re-employment is probably the smallest.  I am sure the Minister will agree on that point.  For that reason, I wonder why he has brought in agriculture and kicked out the other two. I take it that a man must be reemployed by a farmer or in agricultural industries ancillary to farming for a minimum period of nine months. We have not been told if 20th of June is operative in regard to the work force level.  Is 20th June the date?  Is there any operative date?  Is there any operative work force level?  It is also significant that under the conditions of the scheme as we have been given them, amended though they were, only the unemployment benefit recipient or his employer can be qualified. I see nothing wrong with taking a man off unemployment assistance if that opportunity arises, if he gets <Col N="1068" /> employment.  In rural areas particularly it is desirable for many reasons that the work force in agriculture be gathered from the local area.  For that reason, why not extend this scheme to include those on unemployment assistance?  Any of these conditions have not been spelled out for us. Surely if we are serious about agriculture, if we are genuinely interested in making the scheme worthwhile to agriculture, there is nothing wrong with taking any man off the live register whether he be in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance, because as I explained already, it would be an overall saving on Exchequer funds.</P>
    <P>That cannot be denied.  I am disappointed to hear the Minister speaking about a target of 10,000 jobs.  The Minister said he looked forward to, and I hoped he would be, coming back to this House for more money to operate the scheme.  I hoped we were moving in a positive direction at last and that our negative approach was gone for ever.  If we are not serious in our approach to this Bill, it will not be as effective as it could be. The Minister is debarred from expanding the scope of the Bill&mdash;if he does not make this change&mdash;until the 22nd October.  We are prepared to give the Minister power to broaden its scope, enabling him any time between now and then to cover those industries I have mentioned.  It can only benefit the economy and the work force.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister spell out for us why people in receipt of unemployment assistance cannot qualify, particularly in the agricultural sector? It would appear to me to be a natural development to cover agriculture. What is the operative date? Are we discarding the work force level completely in respect of agriculture? What is the situation there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a very short time at our disposal and I want to ask the Minister would a person employed in a factory building system-built components for houses be included in the scope of the Bill.  He is working in a factory that is part of the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> Take a factory like the Ballymun factory where they make components for houses and flats.  Supposing a man working there is laid off, would he qualify for benefit under the Bill?  He is in the construction industry but he is working in a factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>He would qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, if he would qualify why not the man who is making concrete blocks for houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now going into the details of the actual scheme.  We are discussing the legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but take a man working in a joinery shop who is making staircases for houses.  We are very keen on bringing in the building industry.  The Minister has already brought in part of it, so why not extend it?  The Minister also said it was seasonal.  I know the period is nine months but one could also say agriculture is seasonal and perhaps that is where the nine-month period ends.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald said, we welcomed this Bill from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  We backed the principle of the Bill.  We find the Minister saying &ldquo;unemployment is bad but it was always bad&rdquo;.  As we pointed out, the target of 10,000 is small.  We still have over 90,000 unemployed.  As Deputy Fitzgerald again pointed out, there is no clause in the Bill to enable the Minister during the Recess to enlarge the scope of the Bill.  What we are passing is a very limited measure which will do a little good but not very much.  The Minister should, even at this late stage, give himself an escape clause somewhere in the Bill whereby, if the Bill is working well, he can extend the scope of it.  If it is not working well, he could change the wide regulations which he should give himself.  Otherwise the Bill will die almost at birth. There is a good idea behind it but it is a scandal that the Minister will not be more expansive.  He is tying himself down to a target of 10,000 which is absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> There are 5,000 people in training but some of those people might well be included in the 10,000, so that the Minister will not be taking a great number of people off the unemployment register in any case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the case of a married man who is drawing £21 a week.  The Minister will pay the employer £12 to take him back into employment.  It is crazy economics to see 20,000 building workers unemployed and thousands of people waiting for houses.  The Minister should decide to accede to our request to include the building and service industries.  After all, on the First and Second stages of the Bill, the Minister would not include agriculture and horticulture even though other Members pressed for that.  In order to make the Bill work well and create a worthwhile weapon against the scourge of unemployment, the Minister should decide to bring in the building and service industries.  Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a damp squib contributing nothing but a little more trouble to the present troubled scene of 101,000 people unemployed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be specific about this because we should get some indication in this House rather than going to the Department and having somebody there give a decision on it with no further discussion.  If the person in the Department had some guidelines <Col N="1071" /> coming from the Dáil it would be a great help.  I am not criticising the Minister on this.  Would an agricultural contractor&mdash;a person who puts up haysheds, milking-parlours and lays concrete yards&mdash;qualify?  Or the person who goes out on land project schemes, draining, laying pipes?  They work on the land completely.  They are contractors who hire men and no doubt as more people become involved in farm modernisation they will be anxious to employ extra men. I asked the Minister would it be strictly adhered to, in regard to his definition of agriculture, that a person must be a rated occupier of land.  I do not think that would be advisable because those contractors need not be rated occupiers of land: they could have beef-fattening lots, big piggeries and so on and give valuable service to the community.  Perhaps the Minister would give some guidelines to his Department on that.</P>
    <P>I mentioned horse-breeders as well, people who keep mares or stallions&mdash; do they come under that heading? Could the Minister also specify if creameries, milk-processing plants and meat-processing plants come under manufacturing industries or agriculture, or do they come under either?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They are under neither.  It is important to have another look at those.  I would like to have a long discussion on them. They are areas where there is a potential for employment.  They sometimes have a bad season and sometimes a good season.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has exhorted us to make room for the storage of beef, for the killing-out of cattle and so.  Now we have an opportunity to help them to employ people.  It would be money well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time I also asked the Minister how he was going to differentiate between two incomes.  I should like an answer to that question.  If a person has a small shop and also has <Col N="1072" /> agricultural land will he qualify?  If such a person decides to employ a man for 12 months will he qualify and get a premium?</P>
    <P>I would urge strongly on the Minister to include people who are on unemployment assistance, even if he sets the age at 22 or 23 years.  There are young people who cannot get unemployment benefit because they have not been employed and have not got a card.  They have just left school and have failed to get jobs.  There are many people with H.Dip. degrees this year who have not got employment and some of them have applied for unemployment assistance.  They want to get money from any source.  If they decide to work as a manager on a farm, is that farmer entitled to qualify for the premium?  I think he should qualify.  The Minister should not discriminate against young people in this way.  He should think more kindly of them.  It would be a good thing if we could keep those people in the rural areas.  I want to urge that point strongly on the Minister.</P>
    <P>I notice that a person must be nine months employed and section 2 states the benefit will cease to have effect on 26th June, 1976.  The stipulation regarding the nine-month period is very strict.  The Minister and his officials should know that farmers and their employees come to an agreement as a rule on 1st February each year and sometimes 1st March and the contract runs for nine, ten or 11 months. That is the general rule throughout rural Ireland.  It would be better if the Minister stipulated six months. What would be the situation if a farmer employs a man in August for six months, lets him go at Christmas and takes on another man on 1st January?  Would that farmer be paid the premium if he has two different men employed?</P>

      <P>The Minister is not recognising what is happening in rural Ireland.  In agricultural areas the working year ends on Christmas Eve and the new year begins on the 1st day of February.  The Minister knows that, he has a good rural background.  There is a movement of agricultural employees every year; they move from farm to farm and they should be so entitled. There will be representations from Deputies to the Minister on the 1st day of February regarding this matter. I think he should take a long look at the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the Minister said that the seasonal element in agricultural employment would be taken into account and that where there was an increase in employment seasonally that such employment would not qualify?  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  On the agricultural side we insist on a nine-month continuity of employment.  As I understood Deputy Meaney, he raised the question of a man leaving employment of his own free will according to custom or otherwise in the region.  If a farmer gets an alternative employee within three weeks the continuity would be preserved.  We tried to offset the seasonal element in agriculture, which is the reason we exclude certain industries, but the nine-month period should offset that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My second question deals with manufacturing industry.  I think the food processing industry is excluded.  Is that right?  In manufacturing industry where there is a seasonal element other than the ones excluded by the Minister, what type of rules does the Minister apply in such cases? What would be the position of manufacturing industries, other than food processing, where there might be a seasonal element?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have to worry about the seasonal element in the case of manufacturing industry. There is no contesting the fact that <Col N="1074" /> there is a seasonal element in certain industries and we do not wish to see the funds of this scheme used to subsidise employment which would have occurred in any case.  I repeat it is designed to bring back to employment people who would not be drawn back to employment but for the passage of this legislation.  Where the intake of an industry is definitely seasonal, obviously this legislation is not designed for that case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <P>Is the brick-making industry covered?  It is an ancillary to the building industry but it is an important business.  It is somewhat different from the case mentioned by Deputy Moore.  In this industry we are dealing with a factory where kilns are enclosed and so on.  I would be interested to know if it is included. The Bill mentions a possible exclusion if grants or loans are received from semi-State bodies. What type of discretion has the Minister under section 3 (3)?  In other words, if a factory had been granted money by Fóir Teoranta would that necessarily exclude it from benefiting under the terms of this Bill?</P>

      <P>I think that is under section 4 (3).  I do have that discretion.  The case was mentioned by Deputy Faulkner at an earlier stage of a particular industry with which Fóir Teoranta were already involved.  I indicated then, using the notional base figure on the starting date of the scheme, that even where such a firm was in receipt of State moneys, I had discretion to assist it where I was satisfied about the basis of the work force on that date.  I do have that both from the IDA and Fóir Teoranta.</P>

Jam-making, for example, is one that comes specifically to mind.  The Minister intimated that all food processing industries were subject to seasonal fluctuations.  Are food processing industries in themselves excluded, or is it because of their seasonal nature or variety of their work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill.  Deputy Colley and myself said it was a good idea when the Minister for Finance mentioned it.  This side of the House wants to make the Bill work.  When this was first mentioned I said agriculture should be included and that people on the dole should be included.  I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald. I would like to know how the Minister can say the State will lose money on it.  I could not see that happening when one considers pay-related benefit, redundancy payment and social welfare.  I think the State would make money on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that we have not a Committee State debate on this. Deputy Meaney has mentioned some very important points regarding agricultural <Col N="1076" /> contractors.  Are they included? They are the most likely people to employ men.  With regard to the limit of nine months, many people do not seem to understand that the farmers change at the end of each year.  If a subsidy were granted for six months, much work could be carried out by farmers.  If we take a man off the dole for six months, we are doing a good job.  The period should be reduced for six months.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the building industry is included because in my area only two builders have asked me about it.  Both were prepared to take on men if the subsidy were extended to them.  Our objective should be to take as many as possible off the dole. This is where it has the support of every side of the House.  I do not think we should be cheeseparing.  The problem about it, as the Bill is worded at present, is that the Minister has no option.  It is only when this Bill is starting to work that the Minister will know where it is most effective.  I have reservations about industries that are not doing well, taking on a man just for £12, where they will still have to increase his wages up to £34 or £35.  I have reservations about that type of employment but I have no reservations about the lot of the building industry.  It could be the best area. I would prefer a period of six months for the farming sector.  If we had a Committee Stage debate on this it could be discussed objectively across the floor of the House and I believe we would make a very good Bill of it. It is a pity that a Bill which I think has good potential got such a short debate so that both sides of the House could not go into it in detail.</P>
    <P>The Minister now admits that pressures were brought to bear on him from that side of the House.  I hope that it was not his attitude that he would have accepted suggestions from this side.  There are good ideas from both sides of the House.  By discussing Bills thoroughtly we can make good legislation.  I would like to see the options left open for the Minister in this case.</P>
    <P>There may be difficulty in defining what will come under agriculture.  I <Col N="1077" /> would appeal to the Minister to leave his options open so that if it is not working in one particular section he would have an option to operate it on any section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable request to put in an enabling clause.  We will come back if the Minister wants to recall the Dáil to extend this legislation but we are giving him the opportunity now to insert an enabling clause in the Bill.  If he considered the scheme is not making satisfactory progress he can go ahead on his own.</P>

I would see the sky as being the target.  Has he any estimate of how many jobs are likely to be picked up in agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear that there is no ceiling on expenditure in this area.  That has been made clear on numerous occasions in discussion on this legislation. Probably the Deputy's idea of a target may differ from my own when I mentioned the figure of 10,000.  That is the target I am aiming at but certainly our efforts will be to get as many people as possible back into the areas of manufacturing and agriculture. The Deputy asked for a figure in agriculture.  I do not have that figure.  There has been no such scheme ever before by the State in <Col N="1078" /> agriculture.  This is the first time the State has ever stepped into this whole area of agriculture with a measure of this kind.  We do not know and that is the honest answer.  I believe in being honest with this Parliament.  I think the less we have of forecasts that do not have a basis in fact the better.  As far as I can see the best thing to do is to look initially for a figure of 10,000 between manufacturing industry and agriculture.  As to the contributory numbers from both sides one cannot say.  We have attempted to get over the seasonal problem in agriculture by insisting on this nine-month period.</P>
      <P>Deputies have mentioned the desirability of certain industries being included. I have been concerned about one thing, to avoid erecting cumbersome administrative machinery in this measure.  I was concerned to see that what moneys we had went directly to the employers who would bring back the employees.  I do not want to see another army of inspectors added to an already too large inspectorate, superintending all State activities.  The fact is we will operate with our National Manpower Service and in the agricultural sector in consultation with the agricultural advisers, in particular areas they will be the operating agents throughout the country. We have manpower offices in most areas throughout the country.</P>
      <P>This question of seasonality has prevented me going into certain areas.  I am anxious to see that jobs are provided where they would not otherwise be provided.  We have had inquiries back from industries, from textiles, metal work, electrical, domestic appliances, plastics, furniture manufacturers, footwear, engineering and paper manufacturers. Some of these industries will be interested in the scheme and will quickly take up the initial target we have set ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question has been raised, in terms of rural employment, that some people are in receipt of assistance. If the person involved has taken one day's unemployment benefit in any period in 1974 he or she will <Col N="1079" /> qualify.  That would mean the person concerned could be unemployed as far back as 1973.  We are concerned with those who are unemployed in the present recession.  I have explained that we have always had an unhappy figure in terms of unemployment.  It was always at too high a level, but always tolerated.  The answer to that middle section of that permanent unemployed force here, which all Governments have tolerated, is to expand our training programme.  That is what we are doing in this period of economic slackness, we are training as many of our workers as possible to ensure that there will not be a shortage of skilled workers needed in the period of recovery.</P>
    <P>For those who are out of work in the context of this present recession we think a qualifying period is necessary.</P>

We regard as involved in agriculture those people whose incomes are derived mainly from farming.  That would be a definition that could be used here.  We do not want to go into the details of the scheme itself. Throughout this debate I have given a clear indication of the general criteria we would follow in the scheme.  We will, on passage of this legislation, ensure that there will be energetic propagation of the benefits of the scheme by the National Manpower Service.  I am confident that the target we set ourselves will be taken up.  Do Deputies wish to go on to the other amendments?</P>

      <P>A total of 17 projects in the Laois-Offaly area were the subject of applications to the EEC Commission under the 1974 scheme of FEOGA grants for the improvement of structural efficiency in agriculture and fisheries.  Three of these cases were approved for grants and a number are eligible for carry forward for consideration under the 1975 scheme.  The funds available for the scheme are limited and greatly exceeded by the total of the applications received by the Commission.  The Commission accordingly have the function of deciding which of the projects submitted are to receive grant aid.</P>

Furthermore, the direct training facilities of AnCO are being rapidly expanded and they expect to train 7,000 adults and apprentices in 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to a recent newspaper report which said that &ldquo;Liberia, Ireland and South Africa have been named among countries which have failed to give the United Nations details of ships suspected of carrying Rhodesian cargoes in violation of sanctions.&rdquo; The report by the <i>Agence France Presse</i> also suggested that Ireland had been named in connection with the transportation of Rhodesian sports equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report is erroneous and misleading.  No question has arisen <Col N="913" /> in regard to the transport of Rhodesian cargoes by Irish ships; and the United Nations Sanctions Committee did not raise any question in regard to this.</P>
    <P>The Sanctions Committee did, however, ask for our comments on a newspaper report which had come to their attention and which indicated that a &ldquo;Public Schools Wanderers&rdquo; Rugby team was to tour Rhodesia and take part in five matches there in May last.  The Committee indicated that such participation in sports events in Southern Rhodesia would, in its view, be contrary to the spirit and intent of sanctions imposed by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>This communication was not replied to before the Committee published the most recent of its periodic reports in which it was stated that it awaited a reply from the Irish Government in regard to the rugby tour.  The position of the Government on these matters is of course very well known&mdash; and it has indeed been praised by United Nations bodies in the past.  As I have explained to the Dáil on previous occasions, the position is that we regret the participation by Irish sportsmen or women in sports events organised on a discriminatory basis and of course we regret any action which would be contrary to the spirit of the sanctions imposed against Southern Rhodesia by the Security Council.  The Government have done what they can by way of public statement to discourage any actions of this kind.  Sports organisations in this country however are private bodies, and we do not consider that it would be possible or desirable to seek to use legal measures to prevent actions which are deemed to be contrary to the spirit as distinct from the explicit requirements of the sanctions resolution. A reply in these terms has now been issued to the Sanctions Committee.</P>

      <P>Policy in relation to charter flights is designed to give charter operators the maximum opportunity of participating in transatlantic traffic consistent with maintaining the viability of the scheduled services.  Authorisations for charter flights off the scheduled routes are granted freely but the first option to operate such flights on the scheduled routes is reserved for the carriers designated to operate scheduled services under the air agreements. Where a scheduled carrier is unable to accept a charter group or delays beyond a reasonable period in accepting it a non-scheduled carrier will be authorised to operate the flight. I am satisfied that these controls are the minimum necessary to prevent serious erosion of the scheduled services and do not have any significant adverse effect on tourism.</P>

      <P>Precise estimates of the social costs and benefits of CIE's individual loss-making services, for example on individual railway or bus routes, are not available.  While I would like to see the social costs and benefits of the various services provided by CIE identified, the Deputy will appreciate that the identification and quantification of such costs and benefits would be a formidable and costly task, and I have some doubts that the likely results would be of sufficient practical use to justify the expense at the present time.  However, the social costs of CIE's loss-making services can broadly be equated to the amount of the Exchequer subvention paid to the board.  In the current year the total subvention provision for CIE is £26.5 million.  This provision is in respect of services provided by rail and road, excluding road freight, the Galway/Aran service and the maintenance of the canals.  The total estimated cost in 1975 of operating these services is approximately £80 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> As indicated in my speech in the House on the Second Stage of the Transport (No. 2) Bill, 1974, a new subvention structure for CIE has been introduced with effect from 1st January, 1975 to comply with the provisions of EEC Regulations 1191/69, 1192/69 and 1107/70.  Under the new subvention arrangements compensation is being paid in accordance with the public service obligation provisions of Regulations 1191/69 and 1107/70 in respect of losses remaining on CIE's rail passenger services and road passenger services, including Dublin city bus services, after taking account of fares increases and any possible economies in operation.  Losses on rail freight services, in so far as they cannot be met by rates increases, economies, and so on, are being covered by a combination of payments under the provisions of Regulations 1192/69 and 1107/70.  The subvention also includes provision in respect of losses incurred on the maintenance of the canals and on the Galway/Aran ferry service.  No subvention is provided in respect of the board's other services.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Industrial Development <Col N="923" /> Authority that they propose to build a 20,000 sq. ft. advance factory in Carrickmacross.  The factory will be built on a 10 acre site which forms part of a larger site being acquired by the local authority under a compulsory purchase order.</P>
      <P>The authority propose to commence construction of the factory as soon as certain details regarding the purchase of the site have been finalised and planning permission has been obtained.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated previously in replies to similar questions in respect of other areas many approaches by firms to the Industrial Development Authority are tentative and do not advance to the stage where a formal application for a grant is made.</P>
      <P>I propose for the purpose of the Deputy's question therefore to define an application for grant assistance as a proposal in which a detailed submission has been made to the board of IDA or an IDA grant subcommittee. Most of such applications are approved for grant-aid and are regarded as firm commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the authority that the latest period for which they have figures available is the year ended March, 1975.  In that period 38 projects involving a job potential of 2,588 were approved in respect of the west region.  Eight of these are new projects and the locations are Clifden, Galway city, Gort, Mountbellew, Ballina and Killala. The other 30 are re-equipment and expansions of existing firms in the following locations: Ballinasloe, Galway <Col N="924" /> city, Loughrea, Moycullen, Oughterard, Tuam, Ballina, Kilconnell, Ballindine, Ballinrobe, Athenry, Ballyhaunis, Castlebar, Claremorris, Cong, Foxford, Kiltimagh, Shrule and Westport.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate, of course, that figures for one year in isolation do not reflect accurately the industrial progress in any particular region.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 84 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>Prohibition of fertiliser imports from other countries which are members of the European Communities is not permitted under the obligations assumed on accession to the Communities. Any proposal to amend our import terms for third countries would have to be put before the Commission and the other member states.  Consultation may be required and our proposal may not be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment and short-time employment in the Irish compound fertiliser manufacturing industry is not the result of imports but of a serious decline in demand on the home and export markets caused by various <Col N="925" /> other factors including major increases in the cost of raw materials during the past 18 months.  I am advised that the demand for compounds is expected to recover early next year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that only in the case of calcium ammonium nitrate imported from Portugal, which is the subject of an investigation by An Coimisiún Dumpála, is there a danger of material injury to Irish industry.  An Coimisiún Dumpála has made a recommendation to me that I should impose a provisional anti-dumping duty of £8 per metric tonne. I have accepted the recommendation and the duty is being imposed immediately.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the information available to me it would appear that imported calcium ammonium nitrate is being sold to farmers at prices below those prevailing for this commodity prior to the date of importation.</P>

      <P>With certain exceptions in the Dublin area, the responsibility for the provision and maintenance of courthouse accommodation rests by law on local authorities.</P>
      <P>The extent, type and condition of accommodation required for court purposes are matters which are the subject of continuing discussions between my Department and local authorities.  From these discussions, I have access to all the relevant information concerning court accommodation in Counties Laois and Offaly.</P>
      <P>In the matter of repairs, I am satisfied from the information I have access to that the majority of courthouses in the area are in good repair and condition.  The question of repairing and redecorating a few courthouses that need to be attended to has been taken up with the local authorities.  Work has already commenced on one such courthouse and in another case the relevant local authority is endeavouring to procure suitable alternative accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the provision of facilities for solicitors and client consultations, this is a matter which has to be considered in the light of the circumstances obtaining in relation to each court venue.  Factors such as the nature of existing accommodation, the nature and volume of court business transacted and the frequency of sittings at the venue have to be taken into consideration.  In some cases, <Col N="934" /> taking these factors into consideration, it might not be reasonable to insist on expensive adaptation of, or addition to, existing premises which would place a financial burden on the ratepayers disproportionate to the need for purpose-built consultation facilities.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy may take it that it is my policy to aim towards the provision of reasonable consultation facilities in all court premises, and that I will avail myself of every suitable opportunity of ensuring that such facilities are provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances, briefly, are that the Bar Council submitted a memorandum to me in February of this year containing proposals about the legal aid scheme which, if implemented, would require substantial changes in existing legislation and would add considerably to the cost of providing criminal legal aid.  In March, I met representatives of the Bar Council to discuss the memorandum and indicated that I would consider their proposals.  The council informed me, on 21st March, that as I had not expressed a commitment to accept their proposals, they had decided to propose a motion to a general meeting of the Bar that the Bar should withdraw from the current legal aid scheme.  The date eventually fixed for withdrawal was 28th May.  There are now only four barristers on the legal aid panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16th April I met representatives of the Incorporated Law Society to discuss the working of the legal aid scheme and they proposed the setting <Col N="935" /> up of a group representative of the interests concerned to examine points of difficulty in the working of the scheme.  I put this idea to the Bar Council on 18th April and on 27th April they replied saying that they would participate, but had already decided to withdraw from the scheme.</P>
    <P>On 18th June, I set up a committee to review the operation of the criminal legal aid scheme and to make recommendations as to the manner in which the scheme might be improved.  The Bar Council have two representatives on this committee.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, at this stage, to say exactly the extent to which the disposal of criminal business is being affected, but, already, criminal trials in the Circuit Court, the Central Criminal Court and the Special Criminal Court have had to be adjourned because of the withdrawal of barristers from the scheme.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that, like the solicitors, the Bar would work the scheme while the review was in progress&mdash; this, I would have thought normal in any dispute over working conditions. I now appeal to them, even at this stage, to return to the scheme pending completion of the review.</P>
