      <P>In relation to the time for debate next week might I ask the Minister a question without introducing debate?  We had the previous Supplementary Estimate for the Garda Síochána introduced and discussed in the House on the 29th October, six weeks ago, when the Minister explained at that stage that he had to wait until the end of September in order to have the expenditure returns for the first nine months of the year before an accurate Estimate could be framed regarding what amount of money would be required for the full year.  He said this in the House on the 29th October, Volume 285, column 547.  How does he justify coming back for a further Supplementary six weeks later when at that stage he said he had an accurate Estimate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress last night I was giving a brief account of my view on the allocation of this money to the IDA. I emphasised what I thought was important in relation to the way this money would be spent and the importance of developing industries particularly in rural Ireland.  I also said the Minister should consider seriously, giving more of this money to smaller Irish industries.  I said that many foreign industries come in here. I am for them but they should be well screened so that they do not come in here and collect huge sums of the taxpayers' money.  Those people have no commitments to the country and as soon as anything goes wrong they fold up and go.  A lot of the taxpayers' money goes down the drain in this way.  This matter needs very careful consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should make every endeavour, despite ensuring that foreign industrialists are carefully screened, to get good viable industry from outside the country.  This is of vital importance now particularly when so many of our small farmers have to get off-farm employment to have at least an income that would give them a reasonable <Col N="1435" /> standard of living.  It is very important to concentrate on small industries in small towns.  At one time we concentrated industrial estates in the larger cities but petrol was cheap then and it was easy for people to travel 30 or 40 miles to work.  In my own county we have people travelling such distances to Galway city to work.  At present, the unfortunate worker who has to have a car to go to work finds travelling very expensive.  Therefore, small industries should be located in villages and towns. If we do not succeed in expanding industry very much in future I foresee a bleak outlook for rural Ireland because the policy, as far as I can see, is to put the small farmer off the land because he will not be able to exist on it&mdash;even though we will fight this policy&mdash;and it will be essential for him to have off-farm employment.  Industrial development is, therefore, vitally important. The IDA are playing a vital role in trying to get industries established by giving grants and so on but there should be special concentration on the undeveloped regions.  Dublin, and even Galway, are expanding very rapidly and it is not good for the country to have people coming from the country in such large numbers into the cities.</P>
    <P>As far as possible the Minister should concentrate on industries that are wedded to agriculture because our greatest problem is raw material.  We do not get the very best raw material and we have to import it but there are a number of industries wedded to agriculture and they should be supported. There are some people who have private industries and I think these are entitled to support.  They are employing six or seven people each and could perhaps, expand to employing nine or ten.  I should like to see them getting more support.  Everybody seems to concentrate on getting some big firm to come in&mdash;it looks great&mdash;and employ a large number but if anything goes wrong with any of these they have no commitments to this country and do not feel obliged to try to make the enterprise a success.  If things go wrong they pull out.  We should, therefore, give as much support as possible to small industries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> The IDA have done a very good job on which I compliment them but we are in a very serious position with 108,000 unemployed.  I should like to know how the campaign to get more good, viable industries is going at present.  What type of screening is done to ascertain if these industries will be viable?  AnCO have done a very fine job in training people for industry.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister make some sort of industrial survey to find out if it is absolutely necessary to replace human beings with machines?  I have often said: &ldquo;Oh, efficiency, what crimes have been committed in thy name&rdquo;. I have known some industries and cooperatives with which I am associated where a large number of young people were employed and doing excellent work but we went over to computers and had to cut down from, perhaps, ten girls to four in the name of efficiency. I discovered that the computer answers according to how it is fed and the human element still operates.  If those feeding the computer are not efficient, the computer is no better than an inefficient clerk typist.</P>
    <P>When I see young people leaving school today with excellent qualifications and who cannot get a job of any kind I wonder where we are going in replacing human beings by machines. This is a problem that should be studied in Europe.  Is every educated young person to go on social welfare while machines do the work?  I have no objection to social welfare but it is terrible to see no employment available for young people leaving school. Even if they emigrate I do not think there is much prospect of employment for them.  This matter should be taken up in Europe: what is the world doing in the name of efficiency?  I believe that great crimes are being committed.</P>
    <P>The extra amount that the IDA are getting is just sufficient to keep up with inflation but I ask the Minister to give very serious consideration to how the money will be spent because sometimes we can be a little careless about who gets the money.  Many factories are at present closing down, factories for which a lot of money was paid out and these industries are leaving the country, which is a very serious matter <Col N="1437" /> for us.  My final advice is to concentrate as far as possible on industries wedded to agriculture where the raw material is available at home and also to consider as locations the smaller towns and villages because of the increased cost for people travelling to work in large industrial areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night in an effort to extricate Deputy Daly from a verbal confrontation with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I fear I put my two feet in it by saying that the Minister, in introducing this measure had made a long and wide-ranging speech. I was reminded by the Minister and by my own front bench spokesman that the Minister did no such thing, that his speech was very short.  In the past few days I was actively engaged in trying to keep the AnCO training centre in Wexford&mdash;I do not know if AnCO still have anything to do with it; I think they have.  I was also engaged in trying to secure an industry for Enniscorthy and possibly I could be excused for thinking that the Minister in introducing a matter of this kind and scope would have made a long, wide-ranging speech.  But it is rather typical of Ministers in this Government in introducing measures like this to make very brief speeches giving very little information and coming in at the end when everybody has spoken and speaking at rather greater length.  It should be the other way around.  Certainly, where measures involving such a huge amount of money are concerned&mdash; many millions&mdash;Ministers should give more information in introductory speeches.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that the Minister would have given us some idea of his hopes, and what he expects from the IDA in the future, some idea of the IDA's plans for the future regarding industrial development, providing new industries to give the employment that is so essential at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority have done a good job and I would be the last to deny that.  They have secured industries to provide employment for our people.  They have <Col N="1438" /> had great successes and they have had their failures.  This is to be expected in the case of any venture of this kind.  Indeed, the architect of our industrial expansion, the late Seán Lemass, often said that to secure industries here we must have failures as well as successes.  We must put in a great deal of money to secure industries and it is to be expected that some of that money will be lost.  However, it is up to the Minister, the Government, the IDA and all concerned, to ensure, so far as is humanly possible, that any industry brought in will be successful, that it will have all the ingredients necessary for success in its make-up and in its management.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I would make a plea for more financial assistance for local industries and certainly more financial assistance for the establishment of Irish industries especially small local industries.  It is equally important in the present critical economic circumstances of the country that everything humanly possible is done to keep existing industries in operation.  Quite a few of them are in financial trouble and it is essential that to weather the present economic storm they should be given sufficient assistance from the IDA.  I would strongly support the idea of giving more financial aid not alone to existing Irish industries but for the establishment of further industries.  I am afraid that very often we look to the larger industry, that our sights are set on gaining industries that will give employment to the extent of 200 or 300 people.  In many cases the industry giving employment to ten, 15 or even fewer people is as important, if not more important, and I think a number of smaller industries with greater hopes of success would be preferable to the huge industry that may not in the long run succeed.</P>
    <P>My main reason for speaking this morning is to push the claims of my own constituency for more help and more industries.  Many people are under the false impression that the area of the east coast has done very well under the IDA.  It may be true that Dublin city and its environs has done well, although with present unemployment <Col N="1439" /> figures in the capital city the need for additional industries there is also accepted.  However, I must point out that County Wexford has not done very well.  We are in a serious economic position in County Wexford at present.  It is agreed that the economic position in the country is very critical but nowhere is it more serious than in my constituency which is also the constituency of the Tánaiste.  The four major towns of Wexford need new industries very badly but in particular I would like to refer to the town of Wexford itself and to my home town of Enniscorthy. The increase in unemployment over the past three years in those two towns has been deplorable.  The increase in unemployment in Wexford town is really shattering.  That is a fact and I am not saying it for political reasons.  A major industry closed down there and was replaced by another which has not fulfilled the hopes there were for it.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious unemployment problem in Wexford town, apart altogether from the unemployment that exists among school leavers. There are a large number of school leavers there with apparently no hope of employment.  Enniscorthy is in an equally serious position.  The number of unemployed is too large for us to be happy and certainly too large for us to be doing nothing about it.  I would make a particular plea to the Minister to do his best and to impress on the IDA the very urgent need to provide additional industry in Wexford if the position is not to go from bad to worse.</P>
    <P>In former years quite a number of people crossed to England and Wales to seek employment.  They crossed over each weekend and came back the following Friday.  Unfortunately, that employment is no longer available to the people of Wexford town and other parts of that constituency. I am sure the Minister will listen to my plea but I would expect that he would at least listen to the plea of the Tánaiste.  I am sure that demand for additional industrial undertakings and employment <Col N="1440" /> in Wexford town and other areas of County Wexford has been made on numerous occasions by the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>Finally, we have, in that constituency, advance factories that need to be got off the ground.  Large areas of industrial land have been purchased by the IDA.  There is one site of some 20 acres outside the town of Enniscorthy. When that site was purchased a few years ago, we had hoped it would create worth-while employment giving industry.  I am afraid out hopes have not been realised.  The sites are there. The advance factories are there, as are all the facilities.  There is a good rail service.  There are very good ports in New Ross and Rosslare, in fact everything essential for industrialists.  Despite that we have not&mdash;and I say emphatically again, we have not&mdash;got our proper share of industry in that constituency. In view of the huge amount of unemployment now existing there, I appeal to the Minister to impress on the IDA, with the utmost urgency, the need to remedy the serious position obtaining in that constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Like other Members of my party, I welcome this Bill and the increase it contains for the IDA.  A debate on a Bill such as this is very welcome.  It seems to be the only opportunity we are afforded to at least highlight the problems facing industry at present.  Without expansion of industry and the creation of new jobs the economy of this country and its development will look very gloomy indeed.</P>
      <P>We have spent a lot of time in this House discussing other Bills and proposals. We should have devoted more time to discussing the economic situation in its broader sense in an endeavour to ascertain where our economy is heading.  I know this Bill confines us somewhat, that we cannot broaden the debate as much as we would like to do to ascertain how we can check the decline in the economy, to ascertain its causes and if proposals could be put forward to remedy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know perfectly well that the climate for economic expansion has not been very favourable over the past 12 months, indeed, perhaps, over the <Col N="1441" /> past two-and-a-half years.  There has been a steady decline in and a weakening of our economic base.  We should look beyond that and establish what brought it about.  If we cast our minds back four or five years we will remember that our factories and manufacturing units were advancing at a steady pace. There was a greater inflow of capital into industry, a larger output from manufacturing units and better profitability within companies.  Those are the criteria which give encouragement to manufacturers and that encouragement which industry needs generally.  Whether we like it or not it must be acknowledged that very few manufacturers will come to this country unless they can foresee a fair profit margin.  In the past we gave tax free reliefs and grants of various kinds.  But those reliefs given, with the help of the IDA, are of very little significance if there is no profitability within companies. The attractions of tax free profits will not appeal to foreign investors, or, indeed, to investors here if, at the end of the year, such companies find themselves in the red.</P>
    <P>I welcome the raising of this allowance from £200 million to £400 million.  The quicker this money is taken up the better.  Indeed, there has been a delay of four to six years in the granting of this increase.  We know perfectly well what impact that £200 million will have on our economy in five years' time.  We are aware of the diminishing returns to be got from any investment the way inflation is going.  While that may appear a considerable sum now, in four or five years' time, if inflation continues to rage as it did last year and the year before, the return on investment or on the employment content of those additional moneys will be negligible. Therefore, the Minister will have to create the proper economic climate in which these additional moneys will be allocated and taken up as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The associated banks themselves have indicated&mdash;indeed, it is plain for anyone to see&mdash;that their credit has not been taken up over the past 12 months. There is an obvious reason for this. <Col N="1442" /> The returns on investment over the past two to three years have been so low the majority of people are going into gilt-edge securities, national loans and so on where they get a better return.  When people find they can invest their money in paper and get a better return than taking the risk of going into industry or establishing businesses it must be recognised that that is a dangerous juncture.  I know it is not confined to this country.  Inflation is widespread throughout the world.  It is raging in western Europe but it is the duty of our Ministers and Government to try to control inflation. If we do not do so, the Bill about which we are speaking here, the expansion of industry or of the by-products of agriculture will not succeed. Unless we do something about our inflation, which, of course, will have an effect on our unit costs, very few manufacturers will expand and I am speaking for those manufacturers in industry today who should be encouraged to expand their present potentialities. Some manufacturers have explained to me the tight margins within which they are operating, their low return on capital and the large deterioration on their plants.  When one compares their profits with the replacement cost of plants, one will see that there is very little return.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority cannot expand on their own.  The Minister introducing a Bill like this will not solve our economic problems which are far more deep-rooted.  The Minister and his colleagues, especially the Minister for Finance, have not been helpful over the past 12 to 18 months in the matter of economic expansion. Any of the Bills he put through this House, irrespective of whether or not they were necessary, could have been deferred to a later date.  They did not contribute towards creating a climate conducive to industrial expansion. There was no urgency about it.  However, it is water under the bridge now and it is no good going back over it again.</P>
    <P>Our manufacturers have to compete in foreign markets but manufacturers must always have a home market as well.  If a manufacturer has not got a home market in which he <Col N="1443" /> can make the biggest proportion of his profit it is very difficult for him to compete in foreign markets.  We are reaching the stage now at which the home market is disappearing. Irish manufacturers are being priced out of retail outlets.  Many of our big retail outlets are in the hands of foreign cartels which have moved in here.  There was no need for expertise and they moved in only to make more profit.  I would not object to them if I knew they were not adversely affecting our own manufacturers.  Up to 40 or 50 per cent retail commodities come from huge supermarkets, many of which manufacture in Britain or elsewhere and can, therefore, give a preference to their own manufactured goods imported here.  This problem is growing and it is reflecting itself in our unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>I know the days of protection are over.  We are in an open economy as far as the EEC is concerned and there is little we can do except compete. Our unit costs have been rising steadily over the past four, five or six years.  That has been very obvious. Unless we get these unit costs down to a competitive level we will have very little hope of success in either the home market or foreign markets.  Four or five years ago it was stated that our unit costs were lower by 7, 8 or 9 per cent as compared with Britain and the Continent.  That situation no longer exists.  Our unit costs are now higher than those of the United Kingdom and we have lost competitiveness.  Our manufacturers are struggling to keep their markets and that struggle has been very obvious over the last 18 months.  If positive steps are not taken to help industry out of this situation there can be no expansion in manufacture. Only through industry can we hope to reduce the unemployment queue.</P>
    <P>We must develop industries based on native raw materials.  We must concentrate on industries based on agriculture.  There are factories based on agriculture but we will have to have more of these to absorb those who are leaving the land.  We have <Col N="1444" /> the highest numbers employed in agriculture as compared with Western Europe and the United States of America.  In ten years' time fewer will be employed in agriculture and we must, therefore, establish industry to absorb those who cease to be employed on the land.  We can only do this by establishing industries based on the by-products of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Fishing is an industry which has not been developed to any great extent. Here there is a vast potential which has never been properly exploited. Processing factories should be developed in the west.  Proper harbours should be provided and the necessary factories built.  Our trawlers are not really competitive by present-day standards.  I trust I am not going outside the scope of the Bill but I believe the Industrial Development Authority must spread its wings a little wider where the fishing industry is concerned.  The raw material is available in the sea.  All we have to do is harvest it.</P>

The raw material is available.  All that is required is proper development.  We have quite a number of potentials.  We have natural gas.  We have mines.  We should find out how the raw materials we have could be utilised to our advantage. Importing raw materials is a costly business.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The IDA, under difficult conditions, have done a great job and many of our major industries have been successful because of the endeavour and research carried out by that body.  There have been failures, and we will always have failures, but the IDA have done their job well. However, the IDA should see if the grant system is the best one to operate. It annoys me to see a factory closing down after three or four years of operation particularly when Government money, in some cases to the extent of £200,000, has been invested. In those cases the Government have no claim over the assets.  I suggest that instead of the grant system manufacturers should be given interest free loans.  This would suit the small manufacturer who is interested in expanding his business.  An interest free loan over a 20-year period would be more beneficial to him because he would not have to pay any high interest rate. At the same time, the Government would be holding a debenture over the assets of that company in the event of it going into liquidation.</P>
      <P>The small manufacturer finds it difficult to obtain capital necessary to expand but if he was given an interest-free loan he would not be taking as much of a gamble and he would be interested in reducing the loan as much as possible.  I should like to know if loans sanctioned by the IDA during the last 12 months have not been availed of.  I should also like to know the reasons those loans were not availed of.  Those involved in the export business must wait at least three months before they receive any payment for their goods.  However, they must pay COD for the raw material, and in the meantime, must find money to pay their staff.  Interest free loans would benefit such industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of advance factories, I should like to point out that very few were erected around Dublin. I do not believe the decision not to erect such factories in Dublin was a correct one when it was taken four or five years ago.  Such advance factories could be erected in the older parts of Dublin where urban renewal is taking <Col N="1448" /> place.  All the old factories are being pulled down and it is Dublin Corporation's intention to allocate a certain portion of the inner city to light industry. The problem is how to get manufacturers to move to this part of the city.  I have seen the corporation's plans in this respect and I wonder would the IDA consider building small advance factories for very light industry there.  They would blend with inner city housing development, roads and all the other centre city infrastructure.  I hope the IDA will consider my submissions in this respect.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the IDA giving loans for readaptation and redevelopment, I am not sure if they advanced money to one city company.  If they did it is the most beautiful situation I have ever seen.  I speak of Creation, the publishing firm, which to my way of thinking have been rendered bankrupt by the Revenue Commissioners, their chief creditors.  It does not take a great stretch of the imagination to think of the IDA pumping money in at one end by way of grants for readaptation and at the other end, the Minister for Finance, through the Revenue Commissioners, putting the firm out of business before Christmas with a loss, I understand, of 350 jobs. It is very seldom I have seen the Revenue Commissioners putting people out of business and I agree there were other creditors.  It is ludicrous if the action of the Revenue Commissioners contributed in any way to the breaking up of that business.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about regional policy and development and in these matters the IDA can do very little without the co-operation of, for instance, the Ministers for Local Government and Transport and Power.  I have had to drive to the west occasionally in the past six weeks and if any manufacturer was being taken to the west for the purpose of getting him to invest money in manufacturing industry there he would have to think twice.  The produce of such factories would be exported through the port of Dublin and any potential manufacturer would have second thoughts, having travelled <Col N="1449" /> on the road between Lucan and Leixlip.  It is in a terrible state, appalling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I agree with your ruling. It is a pity, because all this is relevant. Anyway, the Minister knows what I am talking about.  I wish to refer to the furniture trade.  A number of office blocks are being built in this city and I sincerely hope Irish furniture will be put into them, particularly those under the control of the Minister for Finance. I am not including the Board of Works because most of the furniture provided by them is made by Irish firms, but an insurance company are building massive offices in Abbey Street and the biggest part of the shareholding in that company is owned by the Minister for Finance. I understand that only a small portion of the furniture is to be supplied by Irish firms.  That is a shame.  A foreign designer was appointed.  He went to a manufacturer whom I know who supplies the Board of Works and Dublin Castle and this man told this manufacturer that his stuff was not of the quality necessary for these Irish offices, the greater part of whose <Col N="1450" /> shares are held by the Minister for Finance.  I submit that 100 per cent of the furniture going into those offices should be Irish manufacture. The Minister knows the company I am referring to and I ask him to tell the builders of those offices the type of furniture he wants in them.  The amount of money involved is fairly substantial.  It might not make any of the Irish manufacturers millionaires but it certainly would help.</P>

The amount involved is about £½ million or £¾ million for chairs and desks.  If I put down a parliamentary question I will be told that probably a certain portion, an infinitesimal portion&mdash;to cover up the charade &mdash;is Irish-made.  There are very few furniture manufacturers left in this country.  The most difficult market to stay in is the furniture market.  The company in this case is Irish Life.  I know the Minister has made recommendations. I heard that people were on to him.  Irish people will be working in these offices, I hope.  They were built by Irish labour for Irish people. The furniture in this House is of Irish manufacture and that has always been the case and rightly so.  The offices of Irish Life will be just as comfortable with chairs manufactured in this country as they can be with imported chairs or desks.  We should become more vigorous in matters of this kind.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I will deal with it in some debate on the Department of Education or when discussion of AnCO would be in order.  I would expect the Minister to get unit costs under control and to curb inflation. Trained personnel must be available. Whatever additional money is expended on the expansion of AnCO services is money well spent.  There are certain matters which a foreign industrialist will consider.  He will take into account the political situation, union regulations, exchange control, availability of qualified personnel.  Trained personnel must be available when the industrial climate improves.</P>
      <P>If the policy of robbing the private sector continues the private sector will diminish.  They are the people who carry the burden of increased taxation, direct and indirect. Incentives must be provided. The people I am talking about do not look for a 30-hour week or even a 40-hour week.  Hours do not matter to them.  The thing that matters to them is to get a return on their endeavour.  There must be a climate that will allow expansion of our economic base. Such a climate has not prevailed over the last three years.  There has been inflation and high taxation. As a result, the economy is depressed.  It is by getting the industrial arm moving that we will solve our problems.  Very few Departments create wealth.  It is the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries that create the incentive to get other Departments moving.</P>

It is difficult to see how the IDA, a highly qualified body that has a record and reputation for creating industry, working against mighty odds with the brake being applied by other Departments and all the incentives they give being nullified by the Government, can find their work in any way gratifying or satisfactory.  It would be difficult to visualise what the future holds for people like the IDA for whom we are providing extra money at this time.</P>

      <P>We are making provision for extra money which the IDA are not likely to get.  My sympathy is with the authority in times like these and especially in the wake of the announcement made last night by the Taoiseach in relation to future prospects.  We are now in a situation in which our entire policy in relation to the economy has been changed. In these circumstances it is hardly fair to expect the IDA to operate as they operated in the past in relation to attracting industry to this country. This is a mockery.  I wonder whether the IDA have access to conferences at which the economy is discussed. It is time that they had access to such bodies as the NESC and the ESRI and that through their personnel they would become an integral part of these bodies so that they might influence the creation of a suitable climate for the establishment and expansion of industry.</P>
      <P>This Government came to power at a time when we were being advised by the experts that there were serious times ahead, that action should be taken to curb inflation.  The Government ignored all the advice available to them and while they admitted that inflation was running at a very high rate they accused us of having left them with that situation and they proceeded to pursue what they called an expansionary policy in their budget which only exacerbated the already serious inflationary situation.  How can industry operate in such circumstances? How could anyone possibly be tempted to engage in industry at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are making a provision here for one of the most important bodies in <Col N="1455" /> the country, a body charged with the responsibility of expanding industry. Their task is very difficult when one considers the pressures on industrialists to continue exports.  We all know that if exports are not increased, the economy does not expand and that the rate at which we expand industry measures the progress we make.  Leaving aside the question of increased taxes and of increased prices resulting from new taxes, let us consider all the other factors mitigating against the industrialist.  For example, ESB charges have increased three- or fourfold since this Government came to office and are increasing at the rate of 15 per cent each six months.  On the eve of the Taoiseach's statement on the economy we were told that postal charges are being increased.  Industry, too, has been asked to carry the entire load in respect of increases for national insurance beneficiaries.  Rates on property have been increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I am not to be allowed to discuss the working of the IDA I shall sit down because to fail to discuss matters affecting directly that body is to render this House irrelevant.  I want to protest to the <Col N="1457" /> Minister about recent contracts which he has permitted to go to foreign companies instead of giving employment at home.  We are spending money asking people to buy Irish but State-sponsored companies give valuable contracts to foreign companies. This will cause Irishmen to be thrown out of work.  I do not know how the Minister can defend this.  I refer particularly to a contract by NET for fabricated steel.  They had a competitive tender from an Irish company which would give good employment to Irish workers.  The Minister does not raise a hand to prevent something like this happening.  Since the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will not permit me to discuss matters pertaining to the IDA I will not continue further about this. I hope there will be an opportunity during the adjournment debate to expose the absolute do-nothing attitude of Ministers in relation to matters like this.  They expect Irish firms to be competitive when they know it is impossible.  They make glowing speeches about buying Irish goods but they permit contracts to go to foreign firms.</P>
      <P>During the short time I was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I was able to ensure that an Irish company got a particular contract for which there were lower tenders from foreign companies.  That is a very active company in Ireland today employing up to 600 people.  If they had not got that contract they would not be in existence.  I brought the matter before the Government and saw that they got that contract.  This Government can do that just as well as we could during our term of office.  I can give the Minister the name of the company and the date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the work we should be engaged in rather than making provision for increasing the limit to £200 million for which the IDA may seek assistance to meet inflationary demands. When we say anything about this we are accused by the Minister of trying to upset what he is doing. We are told not to rock the boat.  We are told that anything said by this side <Col N="1458" /> of the House is for the purpose of wrecking.  We see no effort made to change the policy of the Government in relation to inflation.  The people at the bottom of the ladder are being asked to do without lots of things but no effort is made by the Government to curb inflation.  We cannot discuss this matter over the full range of the IDA operations.  We would be out of order if we did so.  However, there will be another time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody on this side of the House objects to the IDA having more money but we strenously object to the charade applied in this Bill as if bringing it into the House ensured that £200 million extra would go to the IDA.  This is a deliberate effort to try to con the people into believing that we have in charge of industry and commerce a Minister who is endeavouring to do something about our serious unemployment situation.  We know that this has nothing to do with the realities of economic life as we know it in Ireland and that the exercise we are involved in this morning will not create one extra job in the country.  If we are serious about creating employment the last speaker pinpointed what we should be doing.  We should ensure that every Government Department buy Irish, that Irish manufacturers get priority and as a result of that Irish people are kept in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One need only go into my constituency, if one wants dramatically to highlight the difference between this Government and the last one, and visit Kinsale.  When this Government took over Kinsale was a boom town but now it is a depressed town with 450 people unemployed.  How many extra jobs will this Bill create in Kinsale? How many extra jobs will it create in Dunmanway?  How many extra jobs will it give to the people in Bantry?  It will not give any extra jobs to any of the people in my constituency. We have members of the Government decrying the fact that there are actually companies that make a profit.  Profit has become a very dirty word since a few armchair socialists arrived on the scene.  We know what <Col N="1459" /> socialists are and we know what they stand for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it because that is the only respect in which I want to discuss the Bill. Representing a rural constituency, I must emphasise that the efforts of the present Government to create new industries and thereby employment in my constituency have been practically negligible.  We have had plenty of promises.  Flowery speeches were made by various Ministers who came there promising that it would all happen tomorrow but tomorrow has not come.  We see how this contrasts with the work of a man like John Mulcahy whom I would consider a modern day patriot.  He comes in because of his feeling for Ireland and creates 3,000 or 4,000 new jobs.  Yet he is belittled, maligned and derided in the left wing speeches of some of the Government's associates.  Surely that is the type of man we want.  This is why we want to reinforce the proposals put forward by our spokesman, Deputy O'Malley, that more and more of this extra money should be allocated to Irish men and the development of Irish industry because we know that when the economic climate cools the Irish men will not leave their posts.  Even if the economic climate turns to freezing, they will still endeavour to keep going, whereas a foreigner will pull out when he sees the first danger signal.  Our whole attitude will have to be geared more and more to setting up and helping Irishmen in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be first to admit that the exercise in which the IDA has been engaged up to now was necessary.  We probably had not the traditional expertise to develop our industrial arm as we would like and, therefore, we had to bring in experts.  Also, marketing is a very important part of our business and we probably need the marketing outlets that foreign businessmen coming here had already established. I think that day is now past and I should like to see allied to the IDA not only a group to attract and help industrialists to set up their own business but also to sell the products, a sort of pioneer selling force that would go to world markets and, perhaps, help small <Col N="1462" /> industrialists who would not be able themselves to send representatives abroad.</P>
    <P>I should not like to see the selling force recruited from the civil service, or any such body, because selling is a talent with which you are born, not something you develop. We should carefully consider setting up such a body staffed by top-class salesmen who would establish markets for weak or small industries here.  It is all very well to produce the goods, even producing them competitively, but if you cannot sell them you are back to square one.  Too little emphasis was placed on selling our products and too much on their production. We realise there are two very important constituents in the running of any business; the first one has been mastered but the second has not.  This is why I want to place such emphasis on the establishment of that type of selling force I have mentioned.  I do not think small industry is capable of equipping itself with forceful salesmen.</P>
    <P>It is also very important that the IDA should involve itself in different areas.  It should not be confined to industry and commerce because if we are to establish industries in rural Ireland the whole infrastructure must be right.  Our road and rail systems and our servicing of those areas must be one of the priorities of the Government so as to ensure that no disadvantages are in the way of the rural industrialist. From both the economic and social points of view we are thus ensuring that our rural workers, whether farmers or employees, will have gainful employment available on their own doorstep, instead of drifting into the cities and creating more problems there.</P>
    <P>Very few people will disagree with this theory but why is it not put into practice?  Why do we not have a greater influx of industrialists into rural Ireland?  I think there is no doubt but that in rural Ireland you get many people with aptitudes that are a tremendous advantage to any industrialist.  Young people <Col N="1463" /> coming from farms have some idea of how machinery works, how to repair a tractor or plough and surely this is an advantage to an industrialist who may be involved in either light or heavy engineering.</P>
    <P>I must keep returning to the fact that not only do we have to spend extra money on establishing industries but we must create a new climate, new confidence for the industrialist to risk investing his money.  We must get rid of the notion&mdash;and the Minister is the first person who must do it &mdash;that profit is a dirty word.  It is a vital necessity if business is to keep going.  It is all very well for socialists to say that there should be no profiteers, no speculators and so on.  These are all emotive words that have no relevance in business.  Most of the business people I know find it very hard to keep going and make a profit. If emotive terms are used against them, creating I think, a certain amount of discontent among their employees, we will negative the whole effort put into establishing industries by both the Government and the IDA.</P>
    <P>We have an economic depression here and in other countries at present but surely this is the time when we can show the world how economically viable we are by, first of all, each and every worker in the country producing that bit more, working more conscientiously and ensuring that the day's pay he is getting is well returned in productivity because there is no point in the IDA spending a massive amount in creating one job if the worker does not respond.  I am not saying it is general that the worker is not responding but I think there is a certain apathy and a certain state of mind being created in the country which is not helping the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>To me it is totally relevant but if you rule otherwise, I must bow to your ruling.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at some of the areas in my constituency.  He has had deputations from Kinsale and Kinsale is the one I keep emphasising because of its proximity to the airport and to the seaport and because of the industrial tradition in the town. I would ask him to have a look at Kinsale and try to create, through these extra funds which we hope the IDA will be getting, new jobs for the people of Kinsale.  I do not think Deputy Fitzpatrick was too far off the mark when he talked about fish processing plants in seacoast areas because the raw materials do not have to be imported.  They are available on our door step and we would not alone be creating good jobs but we would be protecting our balance of payments.</P>
      <P>Recently at a meeting of Cork County Council I suggested that we establish county committees of fisheries. If the Minister could help those committees by way of grants through the IDA for the development of piers and for the development of the processing of the fish that may be caught in those areas, then he would be doing an excellent job and I would rapidly reconsider the very poor opinion I have of him.  After all, is this not a far more practical application of the moneys of the IDA than attracting in some foreign industrialist and paying something in the region of £50,000 per job?  That is an enormous sum and I would like the Minister to say whether it is true or not but I am informed that in the case of certain chemical companies the cost of creating one job has been £50,000.  To me there is absolutely no comparison between the aiding of say, a fish processing industry and the attracting in of a large multi-national chemical company to the country.  If I were a betting man, my money would be very much on the fish processing plant to last far longer than any chemical company that may come in here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have absolutely no objection to <Col N="1465" /> this Bill.  I welcome it if it has any meaning or relevance and I welcome it whole-heartedly if it is going to create any extra employment in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion the IDA are doing a very important job and doing it very well.  I should like to express sympathy with the officials of the IDA in their efforts to create additional employment because of the confusion of the situation in recent times.  It has been clearly evident that they are working in opposition to the Government rather than in co-operation with the Government.  Let us consider, for instance, a large printing group which went out of existence recently while the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has told us that he gets some of his labels printed in England.  It is a very serious situation when one section of Government are helping to put a concern out of business by accepting an English tender. The whole question of Government responsibility must be examined. There is also the question of Irish Shipping and the £11½ million contract that was allowed by the Government to be placed in a foreign shipyard when we have a State-aided shipyard here capable of and competent to do this job with Irish labour.  In the furniture manufacturing area we have Irish workers capable of producing and competing with the best not only in Europe but the best in the world.  They were overlooked by Irish Life who placed an English contract. NET placed a substantial contract of £600,000 for steel fabrication.  I should like to quote from a speech by Deputy O'Malley&mdash;Official Report of 2nd December, 1975, Volume 286 No. 4.  At column 638 Deputy O'Malley said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... It was tendered for by an Irish firm who were looked over by Kelloggs before they were asked to tender and were found to be a firm capable of carrying out the necessary work at the necessary high standard within the time stipulated.  They duly tendered. Long negotiations took place in the course of which they were informed by a director of NET <Col N="1466" /> that they had been successful and that their tender would be accepted.  A week or so after they were informed of that they found, to their horror, that their tender had been refused and that a British sub-contractor, Farmer and Sons, was awarded this valuable sub-contract instead.  The view of Messrs Kelloggs was that Irish firms had not sufficient experience in this type of work and that there was no guarantee that they would carry it out within the time limit.</P>
    <P>This is a substantial contract allowed to pass out of the hands of an Irish firm capable of doing the job.</P>
    <P>Let me quote Deputy O'Malley again, at Column 638 of the Official Report of 2nd December, 1975, where he said:</P>
    <P>If contracts such as this, the fabricating of £600,000 worth of steel for NET, is being refused to a highly competent Irish firm in Dublin&mdash;the only Irish firm found worthy of being asked to tender and agreed by all and sundry who saw it as being absolutely competent in every way is turned down, not on the grounds of price but on grounds of inexperience, what hope have they of getting contracts worth millions, perhaps tens of millions, in the building of oil rigs which no Irish firm up to now has been able to do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>They are important quotations because they illustrate clearly the thinking behind the Government's policy, that of semi-State concerns and of Government Departments. It must be very confusing to the IDA, assigned the responsibility of creating new jobs, when the Government which expects them to carry out this operation works against them instead of in harmony with them. This whole question, as it relates to semi-State bodies, Government Departments and State-aided concerns, is a reflection on the present Government.  I hope the outlook will change, that the Government will reassess <Col N="1467" /> the situation in relation to such competent, State-aided concerns as those mentioned by Deputy O'Malley in his speech.  I hope it will no longer be necessary to import furniture for State-aided concerns.  I hope also that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will no longer siphon off printing to British firms, allowing Irish firms to go out of business.  That is not consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

      <P>These are Government decisions.  Therefore, in the area of collective responsibility each Minister must bear the same responsibility for this sabotage of Irish industry.  I accuse the Minister, collectively with his colleagues, of sabotaging Irish industry on the basis I have indicated.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise again how confused officials of the IDA must be in striving to create new jobs.  What we need now is a collective effort to ensure 150,000 jobs, not 10,000 but 150,000, at the earliest possible moment.  We see the unemployment register at present at 108,000 plus.  To a large degree Government policy and attitude are responsible for this tragic situation in the instances I have outlined. There is, for example, the £12½ million contract to the Japanese by the State-aided concern in Cork which was overlooked&mdash;a Government decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, then, the question of the postal and telephone service.  Some time ago I understand Deputy Belton questioned the production of buttons for postmen's uniforms outside the country in addition to the question of labels being printed abroad.  I hope the Government will ascertain what they can do at this <Col N="1468" /> stage to maintain people in employment, apart from the creation of new jobs.</P>
      <P>One must ask: is this a deliberate effort to sabotage the situation?  Do the Government want people on the labour exchange, because one Minister has expressed the view that this is a cure for the problem of inflation&mdash;the more people there are unemployed at present the quicker will the problem be solved.  If that is their outlook, let them say so, and not say one thing in public and another in private.  It is here we must expose the situation.  Therefore, it is necessary that such matters be put on record.</P>
      <P>There is the question also of the inflow of cheap, shoddy goods, the changing of labels and all the other devices being used to put Irish manufacturers out of business.  There has been an illegal flow of goods into this country for a considerable time now, with the labels of the countries of origin being changed on their way from the Far East or elsewhere here.  I am sure the Minister has examined the situation to some extent.</P>
      <P>There are just one or two other points I should like to mention in this dangerous economic climate and to say that whatever assistance, advice or support we can give to ensure that Irish workers get back into employment at the earliest possible opportunity will be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the depressed areas, where the IDA have diverted industries of one type or another, I would point out, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has done, that the unit cost is very important.  While production costs on the spot in such areas have been satisfactory, there are problems existing there for manufacturers, such as the transportation of goods which, of course, further increases the unit cost from the manufacturing base to the rail base or to ports, in respect of which no allowance is made by the IDA.  In such areas the question of transport is of importance even with regard to workers from outlying <Col N="1469" /> areas travelling to and from factories. I believe transportation in such circumstances should be grantaided. I have been told by a number of industrialists who would have been prepared to establish industries in remote areas, bearing in mind the available, competent work force there, that the transport costs increase the unit cost so much&mdash;particularly in the initial stages of an industry and with no allowance being granted that they have found it impossible so to do.</P>
    <P>In his promised re-examination of the broader aspects, I would ask the Minister to take this matter into consideration.  Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned those industrialists.  I am speaking of those industrialists in designated areas who experience this transportation problem and that of the three months they have to wait for the payment for commodities they have manufactured, having to pay COD on the raw material.  This is what causes the major problem in many industries.  This is where the liquidity problem occurs. That problem is overcome in other countries by the presentation of accepted invoices and by a Government Department making money available once the goods are accepted.  If that situation were in existence here the long delay and the additional interest charges which add to production costs would not occur and it is these which affect competition.  If these were removed our industries would be more competitive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the establishment of small industries within the city.  A substantial case can be made for industries on the perimeter to cater for expanded housing and development. Industrial estates should be created on the perimeter, preferably concerns with a high labour content.  Some of the buildings in some industrial estates are merely storerooms.  We have one Minister trying to build houses as quickly as possible on the outskirts of the city. I am thinking now of Jobstown on the south side.  Industries should be provided in which these people could be employed locally and, if that were done, traffic would not become snarled up in what are called the peak hours. <Col N="1470" /> Housing on the south side has almost reached the foot of the mountains and it is now industrial estates should be organised to give employment for the occupants of these houses.  I have a certain sympathy with the IDA trying to create new jobs while Ministers and semi-State bodies are working against them, siphoning off to English and foreign concerns contracts that could be filled efficiently and effectively by our own people who are just as competent as foreigners are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard Deputy Dowling say he thought the Bill had been well debated.  I should like, through the Chair, to make a suggestion and an offer.  I make the suggestion to the students of politics and the students of economics in our universities that they should take this Bill and the debate on it and analyse it very carefully.  I make the offer that I will try to provide copies of the Bill, of the IDA reports and all the other relevant information which might be of value to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, in replying on Second Stage, I would confine myself to the matter in hand and try to give Deputies the answers to some of the questions they asked and, normally, would not go beyond that but, having listened to this debate, I have to say I am profoundly shocked at its level and I would, therefore, suggest to these students, to any of them who would like to set up the sort of project I would like to see done, to make a careful analysis of the contributions this morning, first, in relation to the contents of the Bill and what it is about and, secondly, in relation to my opening speech, thirdly, in regard to the use of facts or lack of facts.  It would be an interesting exercise to check the truth of the alleged facts, of statements which purported to be facts.  Fourthly, I suggest they check the consistency between the different members of the same party and, fifthly, they check for repetition, relevance and so on. I wish profoundly to see that done because, while I know they are not very impressed with Parliament, I believe we would learn some important <Col N="1471" /> lessons about the way the Opposition is currently working.</P>
    <P>I introduced this Bill as a small one.  I want, first of all, now to deal with the point made over and over again by the Opposition that the Bill had to be expanded because they had not got opportunities of discussing the economy.  Therefore, though it was clearly one of a series of IDA Bills, and I mentioned the larger one that is coming, and asked that this be treated as a small Bill, the debate was widened and everything was discussed. Let me deal with the argument that there are no opportunities to discuss the economy.  I had a debate in December, 1974, on my Estimate and, if it is alleged I did not say enough about the economy, I was manoeuvred out of replying on that occasion by a little piece of cleverality of a rather typical kind.</P>
    <P>In July, 1975, I moved a token Estimate for £10 for my Department to facilitate a general debate.  I am not certain of the exact date but the debate did not take place because, in fact, Deputy O'Malley was not available.  I am not making a snide comment on that.  I have no doubt the reason was a good one.  I am simply saying the offer was made on our side in good faith.  I had a Supplementary Estimate debated on 11th July last year.  There have been opportunities.</P>

      <P>Check the record. Another point is that, with the expansion of Private Members' Time, for which three hours in every week are available more frequently than ever happened when the present Government were in Opposition, that time is being used extensively by the present Opposition though, indeed, not very effectively, and part of their chagrin may arise from the fact that their use of that time makes so little <Col N="1472" /> impact.  The suggestion that there are not opportunities to debate the economy is patent nonsense.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will hear me.  The Opposition ought to be trying to make serious contributions but instead they treat us to a debate of the kind we have just heard.  I should like to refer to points made by Deputies. The matters of the orders by Irish Shipping and by NET have been raised by a number of Deputies.  In regard to Irish Shipping, and the matter of Verolme Cork Dockyard, the choice was a simple one between the building of a car ferry which requires a whole series of skills and many different sorts of workers, a lot of joinery and a lot of plumbing, on the one hand, and building series-produced extremely simple floating cans, bulk carriers on the other hand.  In the case of the series-produced bulk carriers there is no possibility that any shipyard in Europe, because of the intense investment in very heavy specialist capital equipment of Japanese shipyards, can compete.  On the other hand, in labour-intensive areas with complex ships like car ferries, with our cost structure, we can compete. The irresponsible request of the Opposition amounts to asking us to force Verolme into an area of production where every ship is guaranteed to be loss-making and where one threatens the whole economic future of that shipyard, and force them out of making <Col N="1473" /> a car ferry, an area where they can be competitive and where they can guarantee their future.  That is what this mountebank piece of political prostitution in regard to Verolme would result in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision in regard to NET was a difficult one.  I went into the matter thoroughly and I should like to state emphatically that I take full responsibility for the matter.  The situation is that there is a firm in Ireland who have been doing structural steelwork very well for some time.  The firm have a good record in an area where the present economic position is very difficult.  They tendered for a piece of steelwork which is the core of the Nítrigin Éireann plant in Cork.  It is built into the central part of the plant.  The tender was for a kind of work the firm had never previously done.  The firm do not employ any qualified engineer although they have a quantity surveyor on their staff.  One has to balance a number of things against each other in this situation: firstly, the damage to Irish jobs and to the Irish economy of either a major delay which would run into millions of pounds for NET or of a blow-out <Col N="1475" /> of the product which could not sustain the design performance for the requisite period on the one hand, against the jobs of people in a Dublin steel erecting firm.  I had to take professional advice and the strong professional advice of the Irish engineers building and operating that plant was that the risk was too great.</P>

      <P>In regard to cost-per-job we have been talking about I should like to state that often Deputies misquote information which is readily available in the Library of this House. I recommend that Deputies use that Library where they will find the staff very helpful.  The information is contained in the IDA annual reports.  If people were to familiarise themselves with the readily available documents in the Library before coming in here they would not say many of the things that have been said in this debate.  For instance, Deputy Crowley gave a figure of £50,000 per job.  The average grant is less than £3,000 per job.  The great majority of all grants work out at less than £10,000, and anything of what one might call the tens of thousands is very rare indeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave a wrong, totally crazy figure.  On the other hand, I have been hearing talk about capital intensive and labour intensive industries, without quantification.  Let me try to quantify.  We do not have highly capital intensive industry except very rarely where the contribution from the IDA is tiny.  I have seen EEC documents in regard to regional development, particularly in regard to the Italian input, stating that unless you were putting in certain sorts of petro-chemical developments in the south of Italy of £150,000 per job, the possibility of real viability did not exist and one should not bother with it.  We do not have that order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have capital intensive industry.  That is simply a misunderstanding. The range of grants per job, which is readily available from IDA reports down the years, is very low. Nobody is holding out information.  I make this offer to Deputies: if things are not in IDA reports, which are very extensive and readily available, I urge people if they do not want to <Col N="1477" /> have a sort of ding-dong supplementary question about it, to use the mechanism of putting down a question for written reply.  We will be happy to provide the information if they will use that mechanism.</P>

      <P>I will talk about it later.  Let me dispose of some of the smaller points first.  Deputies spoke on behalf of particular areas, west Cork, Waterford, Wexford, Dublin and so forth.  It is only right Deputies should, but I want to say this in regard to IDA policy for particular towns, areas, regions.  There are good statistics which indicate needs.  It is possible to rank towns and areas according to their need.  Need is the criterion that determines the IDA urging people to particular action, and no amount of intervention from Deputies on this or that side of the House on behalf of their particular areas&mdash;we listen to what is being said&mdash;will distort the correct technical decision made by the IDA because in the long run that is the best, in the long run the money and the effort go to where the need is greatest, and measurement of greatest need is relatively easy to do on the basis of statistics which are easily available.  It does not matter that Deputies intervene from one side or the other, no matter which rank or from which area, because the IDA have the brief, which I will defend, of doing justice to the limit of their resources to regions in precise relation to a readily determined need. That is the guideline and nothing that is said in this House will distort that guideline in my time here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it was always the public guideline.  I believe, although I cannot prove it, that efforts were made by individuals to use pressures to distort the application of these <Col N="1478" /> guidelines in favour of particular regions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk about the matter of large industries versus small industries and in this context I would beg people not to be saying as a new thought: &ldquo;Why do we not do such and such a thing?&rdquo;, when in fact it has been going on for a long time and there is not the faintest secrecy about it.  The amounts are spelled out in detail in the documents published by the IDA, and anybody who would pay the IDA or the Dáil the compliment of familiarising himself with available documents would know that.  I should like Deputies to compare what has been said with the contents of readily available and known material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall turn to the matter of small versus large industry.  First, it has been presented as being a choice&mdash; that you cannot have both.  That is nonsense because not alone can you have both but you must have both: one must simultaneously keep going the development of big industry, of small industry, of foreign industry, of domestic industry.  They must be kept going hand in hand, and it is possible to do so.  I will come to the matter of the origins of policy about foreign investment a little later.  Now I will deal with some of the scales of investment in recent years.  I will try to give the House a <i>précis</i> of the figures of the scale of investment. In my time in the IDA I do not think I made a serious change of direction but I made a change of emphasis: I said as a new Minister in my opening discussions with the IDA that I wanted emphasis placed on small industry and on the Irish, relatively. That is in no way to attack past policy of attracting overseas investment, which I sustain and the IDA sustain. It is a question of doing something else as well.  In the first eight months of 1974, the fixed asset investment by domestic industry was £49.6 million. In the first eight months of 1975, it was £127.3 million, two-and-a-half times as big as in the comparable <Col N="1479" /> period.  IDA grants rose from £12 million to £22 million in that period, nearly double, and the potential jobs &mdash;let us be clear about this distinction, the jobs that will be created when the projects are completed&mdash;rose from 3,700 to 5,500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the corresponding figures for foreign industries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Fixed asset investment by domestic industry&mdash;I have not the figures for eight month periods but I can give them for April-December, 1974&mdash;the total was £287.2 million; job potential, 19,818 and the IDA grant approvals, £66½ million.  That is the nearest I can get to the later period.  It is April-December rather than January-August but at least it will give the Deputy some idea of the orders of magnitude.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to make is about the effort domestically.  You do not get instant results.  This domestic effort has, in fact, been going on for two-and-a-half years.  The fact is that of the 17,000 job approvals expected this year the greater share, more than half, 9,000, will be provided by domestic industry.</P>
      <P>I have talked enough figures.  Let me affirm policy on this.  The policy is that if we can go on getting inflow of foreign industrialists on the scale we have been getting in the past, well and good but that is not a policy by itself; that is half a policy; and the other half is to stimulate indigenous entrepreneurs and to provide them with all the money that they come asking for.  In fact, the figures I have given are an indication of a change of direction of some years standing. Probably it was already changing before my time but it certainly was encouraged and strengthened in my time and the figures are evidence of its happening.  You cannot make sudden changes.  There is a lee time of 18 months.  If Deputies say let us do that, my answer is, yes, let us go on doing it.  We have been doing it and it is correct that we should be doing it.  So, there really should not be major argument about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> I want to turn now to some of the points raised, not today but on the first day.  Deputy O'Malley said in his interjection a little while ago that it was not normal for me to be fair.  I want to try to document that that observation is true but it is true about him and not about me.  I want to use figures from his Second Reading speech on this Bill because Deputy O'Malley gave a quotation in regard to export performance which in my view was selective to the point of unfairness and to the point of the misuse of statistics.  His statistic was accurate but it was used in a distorted way.  I am quoting from Deputy O'Malley on 2nd December this year as column 623 of the Official Report where he said:</P>
    <P>The industrial side of the economy particularly was never more static than it is today...Our exports of manufactured goods classified by material&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is the nub of it&mdash;and then he gave the figures for export of manufactured goods classified by material and he said that there had been in fact very little change in the value.  That is true but if he looked up in the export statistics, which I have no doubt he did, the different headings he would find industrial exports comprised four different headings: chemicals, he did not quote; machinery and transport equipment, he did not quote; manufactured goods not exactly specified, he did not quote.  What he did quote was manufactured goods classified by material.  Normal export figures for manufactured goods comprise those four headings, Nos. 5 to 8, in fact, in the export tables.  The one he did give over the five years had an infinitesimal change from £165 million to £166 million but the ones he did not give: machinery and transport equipment, went from £95 million odd to £129 million odd; chemicals went from £78 million odd to £88 million odd; manufactured goods not exactly specified went from £99 million odd to £116 million odd.  The three the Deputy left out all showed substantial gains and the one he was happy to read on to the record for the unsuspecting people, under the heading of export of manufactured <Col N="1481" /> goods classified by material, was the one that stood still.  If you take the four figures today the headings 5 to 8 rose from £439 million odd to £500 million odd, which was an increase of £61 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, less than 20 per cent increase in value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who wants can read the Deputy's speech of 2nd December.  Then I say to the students who I hope will carry out the project: &ldquo;Look at the export statistics and say is that honest or is that tendentious?  Is that a carrect use of statistics or the deliberate use of statistics to mislead? Is that, in fact, the sort of whining that is designed to pull down the general industrial and economic atmosphere in difficult times or is it an accurate reflection of the performance of our export industry?&rdquo; I leave that judgment to other people but let Deputy O'Malley not talk about being fair with a performance like that on the record of the House.  It was a pitiful, tendentious misuse of statistics.</P>

      <P>I could go on at great length but I want simply to make one other reference to Deputy O'Malley's speech.  There are countries which earn a great deal of amusement around the world by falsifying history.  Serious people laugh at them when they disgrace themselves.  It is a bit sad when that sort of falsification of history, and, indeed, of very recent history, finds its way on to the record of this House.  It is sad in the same sense of inadequate opposition that I referred to at the beginning of my speech because there are so many people around who know that when people say idiotic things as Deputy O'Malley said idiotic things in his potted history of Irish economic development which we heard on 2nd December, all that happens&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the version of Irish economic history given by Deputy O'Malley and I would beg students of politics and of economic history to read the Deputy's speech as an example of the rewriting of history.  The only aspect of it that I want to touch on is the aspect where he talked about a major change in policy from 1958 onwards. That is setting the major change of direction which occurred in the fifties much too late and there are many documents and records of speeches to verify that.</P>
      <P>The foreign investment campaign was launched by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1955, the late Mr. William Norton, who happened also to be Leader of the Labour Party.  What I found so ludicrous in the Deputy's account of history was his inference that all innovation, all change of policy came from those now in Opposition, that they were the only source of initiative or ideas. However, if Deputy O'Malley reads the history of the IDA or the history of the greatest single piece of weaponry in their whole armoury&mdash;the export tax relief&mdash;he will find that what he says is ignorant fiction.  I shall not say any more about it other than to comment that it is pitiful and that I commend it as an example of the falsification of history for party political reasons to those who take a wry pleasure in the perusal of such material.  I commend it to students because they ought to know the extent to which the propaganda machine of Fianna Fáil, quite cavalier about facts, has been trying systematically, to rewrite Irish economic history and other sorts of history also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a small one and part of a series, not of voting money, but of raising the limit.  In relation to Irish industrial promotion I would refer to a very interesting paper by Ciarán Kennedy which I read first in the spring when it was produced as a house paper for his institute and published subsequently in a review of the Central Bank.  Mr. Kennedy is saying in that paper that the Danes were successful in the field of industrial promotion without bodies such as the <Col N="1484" /> IDA, the CTT and without the whole battery of support that we possess. Despite the praise accorded to Mr. Kennedy for his views we hear nothing from the Opposition but demands for more of the IDA and CTT type of promotion.  This is an example of the inconsistency of Fianna Fáil.  We are clear as to what we are doing.</P>
    <P>We are carrying forward and expanding the policy of the IDA to a higher level of activity than has ever been the case previously.  The only source of embarrassment to the IDA that I have found is the sort of despair, the lack of understanding on the part of the Opposition regarding anything the Authority are trying to do.  While it is not probable in the near future it is thinkable that at some stage again the Opposition may find themselves on this side of the House so it is important that they help to sustain the IDA.  It is important, too, that the xenophobia which was in many speeches from the other side but which was not the practice of that party while in Government should not continue because some foreign industrialists have said to me that while they thought they were welcome to set up here, they wondered whether this is the case in view of some of the talk they have heard.  This line should not be continued by Fianna Fáil particularly in the light of recent events concerning &ldquo;republicans&rdquo;. What is important is reassurance in so far as these industrialists are concerned.</P>
    <P>The IDA are the main plank of the Government's industrial promotion policy.  The Authority are functioning with a larger budget and on a larger scale than ever has been the case previously.  They are the envy of many countries.  To those people who say that there should be closer scrutiny of the use of IDA funds let me say that their failure rate is regarded as being one of the lowest in the world for such a body and that they are the envy of people in many countries, that their morale is very high, that people engaged in their work of promotion are operating to the limits of human strength in doing a difficult job in difficult times but doing it very well. I do not say that to have inherited this body and to merely let it continue as <Col N="1485" /> it is is enough.  We have changed the direction of the IDA towards small industries and towards Irish industry. That evolution of policy will not stop. We have now the special project identification initiative as well as some other initiatives.  I have mentioned an upcoming IDA Bill that will be ready in the near future but I am convinced that what we must do in regard to our industrial policy now is not to have dramatic lurches of change of direction in the middle of a recession but to make work as effectively as possible all the constituent elements of the Authority and to add new elements where there is a sign of weakness.  And there is weakness, though less than there was, in regard to small industries and to Irish industries.  In part, these have been repaired and will be repaired to a greater degree.  These weaknesses were inherited by us but my initiative began within months of my assuming office.</P>
    <P>At a time when we are happy to have every job possible, whether labour-intensive, capital-intensive, foreign or Irish, the last thing we need is a dramatic initiative.  Rather, we need a strengthening of existing policies and of any weak spots there may be.  That is the policy being pursued vigorously and with a steady hand by this Government.  I am not saying that what exists is complete but what is there is good.  I had thought that we might have developed a national debate about the other aspects and have got a national consensus so that the enacting of further developments of basic industrial policy would have been made easier but we did not have a serious debate on this Bill.  I say that with regret.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, even in Opposition, the paucity of ideas in regard to industrial development is as great on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party as when they were on this side of the House. I greatly regret that a subject, which I thought would be narrow and brief originally, turned out to be widened. I say, with regret, that it was widened without being deepened.  It is a serious subject at a serious time in the country's economy.  If the Opposition, with their understanding of procedures <Col N="1486" /> in the House, have contributions to make let them take a little longer and prepare them a little better than they prepared themselves for this debate.  Will they please go away and do the thinking first and even know the source of some of the ideas they read into the record&mdash;which evidently Deputy O'Malley did not on 2nd December, or the date on which those ideas were put forward, which he did not know either&mdash; and then use the procedures of the House which give them ample opportunity to debate in full industrial development in general and the policy of the IDA and my Department in particular?  The next time will they try to do that seriously?</P>

      <P>Section 20 provides that if the benefit of the gift or inheritance <Col N="1489" /> taken by a person is to cease on the happening of a contingency, the contingency itself is to be ignored when computing tax.  If the contingency happens, the tax will be adjusted as if the person took a limited interest for the actual period during which he enjoyed the property. The tax, however, will be payable in respect of any property substituted for the gift or inheritance which was given up.</P>

      <P>This section lays down the rules for ascertaining the date on which property, taken as a gift or inheritance, is to be valued. In respect of gifts, the donee is normally entitled from the date of the gift and this date is the usual valuation date.  For inheritances, the valuation date is normally the date of ascertainment of the residue or other benefit and of its retainer for the benefit of the successor.  The valuation date so ascertained will be the date on which the market value of the property comprised in the gift or inheritance is ascertained in arriving at the taxable value under section 18. It will be, in general, the date on which the tax is due and payable and in relation to which interest is payable.</P>

      <P>In regard to subsection (4), could the Minister indicate the difference between (a) and (b)?  (a) refers to the earliest date on which a personal representative or trustee is entitled to retain the property: (b) refers to the date on which the property is so retained.  The overall requirement is whichever date is the <Col N="1490" /> earlier.  In practice, what is the difference between those two?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The earliest date at which the successor's inheritance may be lawfully retained for him, that is, set aside for him or given to him: for example, in the case of a specific legacy, once the grant of probate has issued the executor would, if it was clear that the estate was solvent, be in a position to pay over the specific legacy.  In respect of subparagraph (b) the date of the actual retainer for him can be best illustrated by this example: the son to whom lands are devised might enter on the lands and retain them for his own benefit on the date of the death of his father.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I might put the question another way: is it possible for anybody to retain the subject matter of the inheritance earlier than the earliest date on which he is entitled to do it?  If not, is (b) not tautology? Or (a) is a tautology&mdash;I think it is (b) that is the tautology which is the date on which it is retained.  Surely with (a), (b) is not necessary.  If you take the earliest date on which you are entitled to retain the property, there cannot be an earlier date?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will accept that there is, or could be, a difference between the date on which property would pass from entitlement following the issue of the grant of probate and actual occupation or retention of property which could occur even if a grant of probate were not issued simply by a person going in and taking possession.  Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between the different possibilities and not to allow a person to avoid liability just because the legalities of the operation had not been completed.</P>

      <P>Certainly, an entry that would not be blessed with the grant of probate, I would agree, but <Col N="1491" /> yet it is quite a common practice for people to enter into full enjoyment and use of property before the grant of probate is issued.  That would be the effective date from which the benefit would accrue.  There might be liabilities to be discharged out of such enjoyment.  Much would depend on whether or not there were other assets in the estate out of which liabilities could be met.</P>

      <P>Subsection (5) deals with advances out of an inheritance and treats each payment in advance, or part payment, as being retained on the date of the actual payment as if it were a separate inheritance.  If a successor was entitled to a residuary bequest and receives certain shares <Col N="1492" /> worth £X on 1st January, 1976, cash amounting to £Y on 1st April, 1976, and the balance on the 1st August, 1976, the valuation dates on which the property would be valued and from which interest would normally run on the tax will, respectively, be related to the dates of part payment, 1st January, 1st April and 1st August, for the three separate parts of the inheritance. This follows the same basic rule that the tax be payable from the date on which benefit is received.</P>

      <P>This is the exception referred to in subsection (1) in the case of a gift.  It deals with a taxable inheritance in respect of which the valuation date has not arrived, for example, a share of residue still unascertained and, therefore, merely a chose in action, where the successor disposes of his interest or his interest ceases and a taxable gift of such chose in action is taken by a donee.  It would be unfair and difficult to tax the donee on the date of the gift since what he is to receive will not be clear until the residue is ascertained.  Accordingly, the valuation date of the original inheritance would be taken to be also the valuation date in respect of the gift.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no retrospection because the only inheritance which could be taxed would be that which arose from the moment at which the benefit is retained by the donee, and that, of course, could happen in relation to some disposition that was occasioned by a death which occurred before the commencement of the Act.

      <P>Section 23 provides for a situation where a donee or successor disposes of future interests in property (the remainder, reversion or future life interest), whether for full consideration or not.  Where the interests fall into the possession of the person to whom it was transferred, tax will be charged as if the donee or successor had come into possession of so much of the property as was transferred, so that his relationship to the disponer, and the rate of tax applicable to him, will determine the amount of tax payable on the property.  Notwithstanding this, however, to the extent of the benefit taken by the transferee, the latter will be liable to deliver the necessary return and to pay the tax.

      <P>... the remainderman had become beneficially entitled in possession to the full extent of the benefit limited to him under the disposition,</P>

      <P>I will give an illustration. Property is settled on A for life and on A's death it is to go to B absolutely.  While A is still alive B assigns his future interest to C.  On the death of the life tenant, section 23 makes the tax payable as if the original remainderman took, as if B took and not C, so that the rate of tax would be that appropriate to the relationship of B to A and not the relationship of C to A.  The person actually entitled which, of course, is C, who took B's interest, is the person made liable to deliver a return and pay the tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But in the normal way &mdash;if we did not have the special complication envisaged in this section&mdash; C would be accountable, not just primarily accountable, because he is the person receiving the property. Here he is made primarily accountable only which means, I think, he has to make the return but not necessarily to pay the tax.  In other words, if he is only primarily accountable and, for some reason&mdash;let us assume he makes a return but does not pay the tax&mdash;there would appear to be a right of recovery of the tax then. From the example the Minister gave I am not quite sure who it would be, if it would be another party who did not receive the property and who was not a trustee, in which case that would seem to be unacceptable.</P>

A releases his life interest so that B becomes entitled while A is still alive.  The section provides that tax will be payable as if A had died instead of releasing his interest.

While B is still alive C settles his interest on himself, C, for life and, on C's death, to D absolutely.  When B dies the person becoming entitled in possession is C but he takes under his own disposition.

      <P>That is fair enough.  Quite obviously C could or could not have made that settlement as an independent transaction of the settlement under which B took the life interest and C took absolutely in remainder, but his remainder later was a new transaction.  So much for the logic of that.  Now, I know the rule of perpetuities comes in here, but that is a legal rule.  I know what the difficulties could be, but that may be sufficient to rely on.  However, is there any way a settlement could be made to A for life, thereafter to B for life and a succession of limited interests which could enable what the Minister wishes to prevent occurring?  Is the Minister's provision sufficient?  It depends essentially on the independence. What the Minister is legislating depends on the assumption of the two settlements the Minister gave in his example, namely, the settlement under which B and C took their interests in the first instance and then a totally new and independent transaction under which C operate a new settlement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 22, before section 26, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;26.&mdash;(1) Where a person, having a limited interest in possession in property (in this section referred to as the first-mentioned interest), takes a further interest (in this section referred to as the second-mentioned interest) in the same property, as a taxable gift or a taxable inheritance, in consequence of which he becomes the absolute owner of the property, the taxable value of the taxable gift or taxable inheritance of the second-mentioned interest at the valuation date shall be reduced by the value at that date of the first-mentioned interest, taking such value to be the value, ascertained in accordance with the Rules contained in the First Schedule, of a limited interest which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is a limited interest in a capital sum equal to the value of the property;</P>
      <P>(b)  commences on that date; and</P>
      <P>(c)  is to continue for the unexpired balance of the term of the first-mentioned interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of subsection (1) (a), `value' means such amount <Col N="1501" /> as would be the encumbrance-free value, within the meaning of section 18 (1), if the limited interest were taken, at the date referred to in subsection (1), as a taxable gift or taxable inheritance.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The section, as initiated, gave rise to some difficulty of interpretation. The amendment is designed to simplify the lay-out of the section in order to clarify its meaning and, at the same time, to effect a change in the relief given by relating the relief more closely to the actual value of the respective interests of the two persons involved, the life tenant and the remainderman.</P>
    <P>The section provides that, where a limited life interest is enlarged to an absolute interest because the owner of the limited interest takes another gift or inheritance&mdash;for example, the life tenant acquires the remainder interest as a gift from the remainderman&mdash;the tax to be charged on that gift or inheritance will be based on a taxable value equal to the difference between (a) the value of the property taken by the life tenant, namely, the entire property which now vests in him, and (b) the actuarial value of the interest already owned by him at that date based on the Tables in the First Schedule.  No doubt an example would help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the object is to relate the tax to the value of what the enlargement gives the life tenant.  That is the object of the exercise, is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  To give an example: in 1975, X settles a house worth £20,000 on A for life, with remainder to B absolutely.  A is a lady aged 36 and the value of her limited interest under Table A is .9005 x £20,000 or £18,010.  Ten years later, when the house is worth £30,000, B makes a gift to A of his interest in expectancy, so that she becomes absolute owner.  There is a claim for tax under X's disposition on B's inheritance&mdash; section 24 applies because A's life interest has ceased on the merger of the two interests.  This claim is <Col N="1502" /> not affected by section 26.  The claim to which section 26 refers is the claim for tax on the taking by A from B of the remainder interest disposed of by B.  Under the scheme of the Act one looks at what A takes: in this case A takes a benefit from B and, under section 5 (2), she takes a gift which consists of the whole of the property in which she takes the benefit. Were it not for this section, the taxable value would be £30,000, the present value of the house. Equity demands, however, that her existing interest in the house, the present value of her life interest, be taken into account.</P>
      <P>There is also the factor to be considered that, while the disponer, who is the remainderman, provided the property, he himself had not at that time a disposable interest in the full value of the property but merely a future right to have the entire property when the life tenant died. Accordingly, there is to be a deduction from the £30,000 of a sum representing the present value of the life tenant's interest.  This sum will be arrived at as if A, who is now aged 46, took a life interest in property worth £30,000: from Table A, this will be .8192x£30,000, namely, £24,576.  The taxable value of the gift taken by A from B will thus be £30,000&mdash;£24,576, or £5,424.</P>

      <P>Under the original method as set out in the Bill where the deduction to be made was based on the original taxable value at the time when the life tenant acquired her life interest&mdash;in the example which I quoted this would be £18,010, instead of £24,576, giving a new taxable value of £11,990.  The normal inflation of values would mean that, in most cases, the new method gives a lower taxable value, even though, the life tenant being older, the value of the life interest would normally be decreasing from year to year.  In addition, it is logical to recognise the true value of what the life tenant actually receives from the remainder man, that is the value of the remainder man's interest at the time of the remainder man's disposition.</P>

Where, however, he has a special power of appointment, on the exercise of, failure to exercise or release of, that power, the creator of the power is treated as the disponer.</P>

In such circumstances the exercise of that special power or the failure to exercise it at a particular date that becomes relevant after the death of the creator of the power would have the effect under this section of deeming the creator, who is now dead, to be the disponer of the property.  Is the Minister satisfied that this can be followed through without undue complication?

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that where a donee or successor has been deprived of the use, enjoyment or income of property, tax will be payable by the person benefiting when that deprivation ends.  These liabilities are allowed as a deduction in calculating the taxable value of a taxable gift or taxable inheritance&mdash;section 18 (9).  What is liable to tax is the whole or the &ldquo;appropriate part&rdquo; of the property released from the liability or, where the liability is not charged on or secured by any property, a national fund yielding the same annual value as the liability.</P>
      <P>To illustrate: When property is given to A, subject to an annuity of £X to B for his life, A's acquisition is subject to a liability, and it is provided by section 18 (8) that there may be deducted, in calculating the taxable value of A's acquisition, the slice, or as we call it, the appropriate part, of the property required to produce B's annuity of £X per annum. If the total property taken by A is valued at £100,000 which produces income of £12,000 per annum and B's annuity was £3,000 per annum, there would be deducted from the £100,000&mdash;in valuing A's acquisition &mdash;the slice, which would be £25,000.</P>
      <P>The purpose of section 28 is to provide that when B dies and his annuity ceases, A will be taxed on the benefit accuring to him by reason of the cesser of the annuity, and this benefit will be valued in the same way as the corresponding deduction was calculated in working out the taxable value of A's original acquisition.  In other words, the £25,000, which escaped tax on the occasion of the original acquisition, pays tax when the annuity ceases.</P>

Will it be valued when the gift takes place originally and then on the cesser of it will it be valued on a different basis?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be valued in the same manner as in the previous sections we were discussing, as of the date when the benefit would accrue, and the benefit would only accrue to A when B's annuity had ceased&mdash;that is, the date from which we would have to measure the value of the assets which gave the income to B.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Land Commission have an area of 61 acres on hands at Killoscully but the formulation of proposals for its allotment has been deferred pending the outcome of proceedings which are at present in progress for the acquisition of adjoining lands containing 114 acres.  The intention would be to divide all the lands together. I understand that a further property in the area is the subject of preliminary enquiries by the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have no lands on hands in the Toomevara area and there are no proceedings for the acquisition of any lands there.  I am informed, however, that within the past 18 months a total of 438 acres was allotted in the district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I assume that what the Deputy has in mind are cases where consent to sell was refused because acquisition proceedings had been or were being instituted by the Land Commission or an inspection notice had been served. <Col N="1509" /> Such consent is of course a matter for the Land Commission and not the Minister for Lands.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the period from 1st January, 1974 to 30th November, 1975, consent to sell in such circumstances was refused by the Land Commission in five cases in County Longford.  There were no cases in County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the fact that the Land Commission have refused to sanction the transfer of holdings which have been sold on the open market is deemed to be a grave injustice not merely to the seller but to the buyer, and will the Minister take steps to regularise the position and avoid this competition arising between the Land Commission and smallholders?  In most if not all of the five cases the people who have bought the holdings would be eligible for allocations of land if it were available, and therefore it is difficult to see the ground for the Minister's move.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am sure the Deputy knows that the consent of the Land Commission, not of the Minister, is required to a sale only in a limited number of cases: one, where the Land Commission initiate proceedings by the service of notice of acquisition; two, where subdivision is involved; and three, where the purchaser is a non-national or a company.  If the Land Commission were not to have the authority to serve notices and to investigate land, it would become impossible for them to get on with their business.  My reply shows that sales are infrequently interfered with.  I covered the period January, 1974 to November, 1975, nearly two years, and in that period there were only five cases in Longford and none in Westmeath.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> With all due respect to the Deputy, I am of the opinion that the most painless time to acquire land is when it is being offered for sale by the owner, because the owner has said he does not want the land and that he is selling it.  That is the time the Land Commission should investigate to see if the land is suitable for the relief of congestion.  If the Land Commission were to do what Deputy Carter suggests they would be leaving the small economic farmers of the country wide open to the world.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As I have stated already in the House I am in favour of long-term leasing of land.  I have given practical and compelling encouragement to this type of land leasing by providing in the farmers' retirement scheme a special premium of twice the lease rent subject to a maximum of £3,000 to those outgoers who lease their land for 12 years or more to potential developing farmers.  I am also on record as stating that the Land Commission will readily give their consent to long-term leasing proposals that do not cut across land structural operations. <Col N="1514" /> But I do not favour State intervention at this stage either by statutory regulation or by legislation&mdash;in my view this course would be counter-productive and would simply deter people from leasing.  I am satisfied that the terms and conditions of leases can best be left for settlement to the common sense of the participants&mdash; lessor and lessee&mdash;as circumstances will vary with the people involved and from district to district.  A forceful and sustained public relations exercise is first necessary to popularise long-term leasing in this country, and I am convinced that this should come from the farming organisations if effective results are to be achieved.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> That may be, but that is something that will have to work itself in, and I believe that it should be done on a voluntary basis, and any movement by the Department of Lands or the Land Commission to involve itself in leasing and to provide what is commonly called a master lease will only frighten people away from leasing. It has been suggested to me in some journals and newspapers that a <Col N="1515" /> master lease should be introduced here on the lines of the Dutch scheme.  I find that the Dutch lease which I am referred to provides for the fixing of the rent by the Land Commission.  It also provides that before a person can lease his land he must put the land in good condition and if there is any defect in the land which the purchaser does not know about when he is taking it the purchaser will have the right to pursue the owner for any loss he has sustained in putting the land into such condition.  If I accepted the Dutch master plan the lessor would be expected to drain his land, presumably, and to put up fences and gates and all the rest of it.  It would simply not be on, because most people who are giving a lease do so because they are unable to work the land.  There is an emotive campaign going on at the moment in favour of a master lease.  I honestly believe that if the Land Commission were to get into this thing and to say &ldquo;In order to let your land you will have to adopt a lease prepared by the Land Commission&rdquo;, you would frighten them off.  They would think there was a snag in it. The Land Commission are prepared to offer any advice that is sought. Solicitors' offices in Ireland are full of precedents on leases that can easily be adapted to all these cases.</P>

It is suggested that the Land Commission should lease land rather than allot it, that that would leave land less costly but since the rent would have to be as high, perhaps, as the annuities, there would not be much point in pursuing such a policy.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The statutory provisions for the division of commonages are contained in section 24, Land Act, 1939; section 25, Land Act, 1950; section 23, Land Act, 1953; section 41, Land Act, 1965.</P>
      <P>Under these provisions it is open to the shareholders in commonages to submit partition schemes to the Land Commission for approval and applications of this nature are received from time to time.</P>
      <P>In the case of potentially productive commonages associated with nonviable holdings the Land Commission will consider dealing with them under their rearrangement procedure and, if necessary, carry out fencing and improvement works.  Applications in this context are dealt with as quickly as possible having regard to the many demands of the land settlement programme.</P>
      <P>The applications are not recorded centrally and to ascertain the number at present outstanding it would be necessary to make inquiries from the local Land Commission offices.  This would take some time but if the Deputy requires the information or is interested in any particular case, I shall arrange to have the information supplied to him.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I know there are cases being processed in the west of Ireland, particularly in <Col N="1518" /> Mayo and Galway.  Indeed, very considerable progress has been made in the division of commonages in Mayo during the past couple of years.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The contrary to what the Deputy says is the case.  Up to the time I became Minister, strange as it may appear, there was very little division of commonage in Mayo.  Practically none had been divided for a long number of years but at the request of Deputies from the area I went to Belmullet and walked the commonages there.  In late 1973-74 and up to date, about 3,000 acres of commonage have been divided in the Belmullet, Achill and Louisburg areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs why, alone amongst the ambassadors of the EEC Member nations, the Irish Ambassador was not withdrawn over the recent issue of the execution of five Basque nationalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I take it, is referring to executions which took place in Spain on 27th September, 1975, when two members of the Basque ETA organisation were executed in Burgos and three members of the FRAP, a Maoist group, were executed in Barcelona.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> On 9th September, the Irish Ambassador in Madrid, on my instructions, made representations to the Spanish Government asking them, on humanitarian grounds, not to proceed with the executions.  Ireland, as one of the Nine, was also associated with representations in a similar sense which Italy, as the country holding the Presidency, made on 25th September on behalf of the member States of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these representations, the Spanish Government carried out the executions on 27th September and over the following days a number of European countries, including six of our partners in the EEC, recalled their ambassadors from Madrid to their capitals for consultations. The member States of the EEC informed each other of their decisions in this regard but the decision in each case was an individual one by the Government concerned and there was no proposal at any stage for concerted action by the Nine as such.</P>
    <P>In this situation, the Government, having considered the position, decided not to withdraw the Irish Ambassador. They took this decision.  in the first place, because they considered that consultation with the ambassador in person was not necessary since he had been in Dublin a short time previously; and in the second place, because they considered that his recall, as a symbolic gesture, would not have been the most appropriate or useful response, in the current situation in Spain.</P>
    <P>I think it should be clear from the appeals for clemency which Ireland has made earlier and from the fact that we joined with our EEC partners in further representations before the executions that this decision of the Government did not indicate any lack of concern on our part.  In considering what it was right for us to do after the executions, the Government had in mind rather the strong possibility that recall of the Ambassadors as a symbolic gesture might not only be ineffective but could indeed be counter-productive since it would arouse resentment in Spain and could help to consolidate support within the <Col N="1527" /> country for a more hardline attitude during this transitional period.</P>
    <P>A further consideration was that an ambassador, once recalled, must either be retained indefinitely at headquarters for consultations or returned to his post within a short time.  To retain an ambassador at headquarters indefinitely for consultations is regarded, in diplomatic practice, as an indication of a major breach in relations and in this instance would have deprived us of contacts in Spain during a crucial transitional period; on the other hand to return an ambassador within a short time of his withdrawal could be taken as an expression of approval of developments in the country concerned.  The view of the Government is that neither of these courses would have been justified in the situation which obtained in Spain in late September and the period immediately following the executions.</P>

It was discussed on the Supplementary Estimate but I thought it proper that the House should have a full reply.  On the other point raised by the Deputy, the ambassadors returned very shortly afterwards.  I think the representatives <Col N="1528" /> of the United Kingdom and Germany returned on 8th October, Denmark and Belgium on 10th October, the Dutch representative on 11th October and the French on 13th October.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>By the words &ldquo;reported criticism&rdquo; I presume the Deputy is referring to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of October 10th, 1975, which carried the somewhat misleading heading &ldquo;FitzGerald attacks US on France&rdquo;.  The fact is that at a press conference in Washington on October 9th, I expressed my concern about the possible danger that the timing of the renegotiation of the agreement on military bases between the US and Spain could be seen in Spain, and elsewhere, as support for the regime then in existence in Spain and might, therefore, prejudice future American-Spanish relations.</P>

      <P>I was asked a question at the Press conference and <Col N="1530" /> I replied to it.  My concern was the fact that by a coincidence of timing the renewal of the base agreements between Spain and the US coincided with the period of the executions when there was strong European feeling on the subject.  This coincidence could create a harmful situation, where the United States action in signing the agreements&mdash;although forced on them by the time scale&mdash; might have had the effect of giving a wrong impression of American attitudes and it might be unhelpful to relations between the US Government and a future Spanish regime.  In reply to a question I indicated my concern because the importance of good relations between the United States and European countries is evident to all of us.</P>

      <P>On the afternoon of 18th October, according to my information, a number of British soldiers entered the State near Longfield, County Monaghan in pursuit of some man whom they wished to question. They took possession of two privately-owned vehicles within the State and travelled to a depth of two <Col N="1531" /> miles inside the State before returning across the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigation indicated to me that the incident began accidentally but it is not clear what happened afterwards.  The fact is that the British troops landed from a helicopter in a field beside the Border. They saw a man disappearing northwards and, because of their unfamiliarity with the geography they say they moved northwards after him thinking that the road was into Northern Ireland.  It happened that it <Col N="1532" /> was into the Republic.  However, that does not excuse or adequately explain the subsequent incident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the nature of things I do not think it is possible to get a guarantee that something will never happen again.  The British authorities are very much aware that when something happens which may have been accidental&mdash;if it was accidental&mdash;and which is followed by the events that subsequently occurred it must be a matter of grave concern to us that such incidences could occur in our State.  They are incidences which we could reasonably deplore taking place on the other side of the Border if they had happened there.</P>

      <P>I have seen the report to which the Deputy refers, which is a progress report of an <i>ad hoc</i> working group of the Commission on Human Rights.  A final report is to be submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its next session to be held in Geneva in February, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present report covers not only torture but a wide range of human rights issues.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the working group which prepared the report had been promised complete freedom of movement in Chile by the government of Chile in order to carry out its work, but at a late stage&mdash;six days before it was due to arrive&mdash;the group was refused permission to enter Chile.  Nevertheless, the situtation disclosed in the interim report is one which gives grounds for deep concern.  In particular, I should like to express my concern at the findings <Col N="1535" /> of the report in regard to torture in Chile.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in my speech in the general debate at the United Nations General Assembly on 26th September last, I expressed concern at the extent to which torture is accepted in the world today; and I described it as a source of shame to all of us that a body such as Amnesty International... &ldquo;should have to report that in the territories of 100 members of the organisation breaches of human rights occur and that one member State, Chile, is currently refusing admission to a United Nations Human Rights Group&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The present report of the <i>ad hoc</i> working group has been debated in the third committee of the United Nations General Assembly during the current session.  The Irish delegation was actively involved in the drafting and co-sponsorship of a resolution deploring the refusal of the Chilean authorities to admit the <i>ad hoc</i> working group, calling upon the Chilean authorities to restore full human rights and fundamental freedoms in Chile, and recommending that the group continue its work.  The Irish third committee delegate made a statement explaining Ireland's support for the resolution and our deep concern about the situation in Chile.  The draft resolution was subsequently adopted by the third committee by 88 votes to 11 with 20 abstentions.</P>

This agreement provides that the Commission shall be informed by the member States of proposed legislative, regulatory or administrative measures or international initiatives relating to the environment which could affect the functioning of the common market or are relevant to the Communities' environment action programme.  In accordance with the agreement, Ireland has notified proposed legislation, the Wildlife Bill, 1975, to the Commission.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the value of imported fruits which have been canned in South Africa; if the free import of these canned goods is in conflict with the United Nations decision with regard to countries which practise apartheid; and, if so, if he will take steps to ensure that South African imports will not be sold in stores and supermarkets in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The value of canned fruits imported into Ireland from the Republic of South Africa in 1973 was £660,000 and in 1974 £834,000.  A precise breakdown in respect of the present year is not as yet available.  However, if the Deputy wishes, I can give him an approximate figure for the period January/August, 1975.</P>
      <P>The import of South African canned fruit into Ireland is not in conflict with a decision of the United Nations.  Under the Charter of the United Nations, the authority to impose sanctions, including the interruption of economic or other relations with a member State, is vested in the Security Council and, whereas the Security Council has imposed an embargo on the sale or shipment of arms to South Africa, it has not decided on any other sanctions against that state.</P>
      <P>Resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly have contained calls for the severance of trade links with South Africa.  However, General Assembly resolutions have the force of recommendations, not of binding decisions and are, therefore, different from the mandatory provisions of Security Council resolutions which, of course, all member States are legally obliged to implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1538" /> The Security Council does apply a comprehensive system of sanctions against Southern Rhodesia which Ireland fully implements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

There is no decision of the UN on this matter.  I do not feel that we should in those circumstances, seek to interfere with trade or to deprive people here of a source of canned fruit which presumably, if this quantity comes in, must be more economic or of a particular quality the people here wish to have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of capital punishment has been under continuing study in the United Nations since 1959 when the General Assembly adopted its first resolution on the subject.  Since that time, through the efforts of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, the United Nations has sought to encourage a progressive restriction of the number of capital offences and the introduction of legal safeguards for those under sentence of death with a view to the ultimate abolition of the death penalty.  The United Nations Secretary-General has also produced periodic reports aimed at stimulating a greater national and international awareness of the issues involved.</P>
      <P>The most recent report of the Secretary-General suggests that a majority of member States have moved over the years towards a position favouring the eventual abolition of the death penalty.  However, given the differing juridical traditions of the member States, it may be expected that the goal of universal abolition will take a long time to achieve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's question relates to a recent interview with Colonel Khaddafi in the Italian newspaper <i>II Tempo</i> a report of which was carried in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 10th November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the accompanying news agency story, Colonel Khaddafi, in reply to a question from the interviewer, said that Libya backs the IRA. Colonel Khaddafi did not say this explicity and I am not sure that the actual text of his reply, which was also carried in translation by <i>The Irish Times,</i><Col N="1542" /> and which I have since had checked, bears quite the interpretation given to it by the news agency.</P>
    <P>The opposition of the Irish Government to support for illegal organisations is well known to the Government of Libya from representations which have already been made to them on this subject.  I would also recall that, as the Deputy will be aware, a delegation of members of the Oireachtas visited Libya in April of this year.  During their visit the delegation availed of the opportunity to stress to the Libyan authorities the opposition of the Government and of all parties represented in Dáil Éireann to any recourse to violence in relation to the Northern Ireland problem.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that there is, apparently, a public feeling that Colonel Khaddafi has in fact been expressing continuing support for the IRA&mdash;there may be that area of doubt the Minister has referred to &mdash;does the Minister not think it would be worth while and important that he should reiterate whatever it is this parliamentary representation may have done?

From the full text of the interview the position taken up by Colonel Khaddafi certainly seems different from and more moderate than previous expressions.  I am not sure that, at this moment, further representations would necessarily be helpful.  I think that Colonel Khaddafi, is aware of our views, not merely from our representations but from those of other friendly States which have tried to explain the position to him.  There is some evidence on this occasion perhaps from the tone of his reply, that these representations have had some effect.</P>

A buffer zone would mean that British troops could operate within portion of the Twenty-six Counties which would, in fact, mean an extension of the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will state the Government's proposals for direct elections to the European Parliament; and if he will ensure that these proposals will be brought before the Dáil for ratification at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the Government's policy in relation to the proposals for the election of members to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage which in recent months have been under examination by the Council of the Communities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this matter was considered by the European Council meeting in Rome on 1-2 December and that the European Council agreed that elections to the European Parliament should take place on a single date in May or June, 1978 with the proviso that any country which at that date is unable to hold direct elections should be allowed to appoint its representatives from amongst the elected members of its national Parliament.  Britain has not yet adopted a final position regarding the date fixed, while certain conditions for direct elections have been set by Denmark.  The European Council instructed the Council of Ministers to continue examination of the problems encountered and to submit a report to enable the text of a Convention on Elections to the European Parliament to be finalised at the next European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, of course, fully support the commitment to hold direct elections in 1978 which arises from the Taoiseach's proposal at the <Col N="1545" /> European Summit of December, 1974. They are also in general agreement with the various proposals under consideration by the Council including a proposal, which originated in the Parliament, to the effect that, during an initial period, pending the introduction of a uniform procedure, the electoral system in each member State should be governed by national provisions.  The Government also share the majority view that, during the initial period, simultaneous membership in the European and national Parliaments should be left to the choice of individual member States.</P>
    <P>The Government are, however, seriously concerned that, under a proposal submited to the Council by the European Parliament, Ireland's proportionate level of representation in an enlarged Parliament would fall from slightly over 5 per cent to about 3.7 per cent.  To ensure adequate Irish representation in the directly-elected European Parliament and to enable this country to contribute as fully as possible to the work of the Parliament, Government policy is aimed at maintaining as far as possible Ireland's proportionate level of representation.</P>
    <P>On the assumption that all outstanding problems can be solved, the text of a Convention on Elections to the European Parliament should be finalised at or before the next European Council in a few months time. Such a convention would, in accordance with normal practice, be required to be signed and subsequently ratified by all the member States including Ireland.  Until the terms of the convention are agreed, it would be premature to try and anticipate the nature and content of the legislative proposals required to implement the convention's provisions.</P>

      <P>The Minister will understand when I say the phrase <Col N="1548" />&ldquo;Box and Cox&rdquo; springs to mind in relation to his role in regard to capital acquisitions tax measures.  We are on the amendment and, just before Questions, I suggested I should like to think about this while Questions were in progress.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, as amended, the first point I want to raise with the Minister is contained in subsection (1).  It is the definition of property as not including &ldquo;any property to which a donee or successor became beneficially entitled in possession prior to the 28th day of February, 1969&rdquo;.  By implication, by even more than implication, property to which a done or successor became beneficially entitled subsequent to 28th February, 1969, is being taken into account.  It seems to me that what is being sought to be done here, while the section of itself is acceptable, is to extend the section retrospectively to transactions which took place in 1969, 1970 and subsequent years.  I do not think that is a justifiable approach and I would like to hear the Minister's approach and to be told why he thinks this is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not accept that there is any retrospection involved here.  I am absolutely clear in my own mind that there is no retrospection.  We are discussing property which passed before the coming into operation of the tax. We are not taxing that property but We are taxing the increase in value of that property occasioned by the second transaction, the transaction subsequent to the coming into operation of the Act.  It is the increase in value that is being taxed and that increase in value is brought about by something that happened since this Act came into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as there is an increase in value from, we would <Col N="1549" /> say, 1970 on, does that not affect the amount of tax payable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> But the increase in value is brought about by the second transaction and the second transaction occurs subsequent to the coming into operation of the Act.  There is, therefore, clearly no retrospection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it another way: why is provision in subsection (1)  there at all?  Why does the Minister have to have regard to property coming into possession on or after 28th February, 1969?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Simply because we are ignoring any property that came into the possession of the donee before 28th February, 1969, and we are taking the same period as the period taken in the earlier section for aggregation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, that period, in our view, and I doubt if the Minister can effectively dispute this proposition, taking into account the earlier section, is, in fact, involving retrospection, because it is determining the rate of tax payable by reference to events occurring prior to the issue of the Government's White Paper.  It seems to me that the Minister has just confirmed that the same approach is now being adopted in this section and what is involved, for the purpose of determining the tax and the rate of tax, are events which occurred and transactions which took place a number of years ago when this legislation was not in contemplation at all.  If events and transactions of that kind can affect the amount of tax or the rate of tax, I suggest it is mere semantics to say there is no retrospection involved because the tax is charged in relation to a transaction occurring after the relevant date under this Bill.  If, in fact, the amount of tax or the rate of tax is affected by what happened five years ago, then there is no way in real terms that the Minister can deny that it is proposed under subsection (1) to introduce retrospection.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I honestly cannot accept that there is any retrospection in this.  I am quite satisfied in my own mind that there is no retrospection.  Suppose A gets a house in 1970 and he gets another house in 1976, which increases the value of the first house, it is the act which is done in 1976 that increases the value of the first house and there is no retrospection about that.  If the 1976 transaction did not take place and the house passed to someone other than the owner of the first house, there would be no question of tax at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The object was to provide a basis for the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why that basis?  Surely this is an attempt to substitute for the death duty provision.  On a previous similar section I indicated that, as far as this side of the House is concerned, if the object of the exercise was to ensure that persons who would have been caught under the death duties provision were still to be caught, we would not object to a similar law being imposed on them, but introducing this is, in fact, retrospection because the rate of tax or the amount of tax is being affected by things which occurred when this Bill was not in contemplation.  On the other hand, to apply the death duty five-year provision to transactions which took place during the previous five years is to apply it in a way that <Col N="1551" /> was contemplated when such transactions took place.  This is quite justifiable because the parties were aware of what the situation was. Effectively what is being done here is to affect the rate of tax by having regard to transactions which occurred when the parties to the transactions had no reason to contemplate this kind of provision.</P>
      <P>I do not want to drag this matter out unduly because we made our position clear on the previous section. However, I do not wish to allow this section to pass without placing on record our view that how ever one tries to gloss over it, this is retrospective taxation and, secondly, it is reprehensible.  One cannot approve of retrospective taxation such as is proposed in the section.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not wish to go into the previous argument about the aggregation period of five years.  On that occasion I demonstrated that the alternatives suggested by the Deputy to extend it to people who would otherwise have been caught by death duties would be to impose on many estates which were exempt from death duties, death duties, in other words, to impose death duties on the estates of people who made gifts in 1972 and 1973 and died on or after 1st April, 1975.</P>

If a person gave a gift away in 1972 and did not give any further gift he would not be taxed under this Bill but Deputy Colley's suggestion would mean that he would be liable for tax. We are taxing the transaction which takes place subsequent to the passing of this Bill and that transaction only. I do not accept that there is any element of retrospection in that.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is what I am coming to.  It would be crazy, in certain cases, for a person to split up his property and sell it separately.  It would be more in that person's interest to sell it as a unit because it would be more attractive to a developer.  In the case of shares, where a person in a company sells 30 per cent of the shares to A today and some time afterwards sells another 25 per cent, the effect of that 25 per cent sale is to increase the value of the whole lot; it would add enormously to the value.

Surely if a man had these two houses and he wanted to sell to the best advantage, what he would do is sell them to the same man, at the same time, perhaps reserving the occupation of one for a limited time.  Before the question of tax arises, the Revenue Commissioners would have to be satisfied that the acquisition of the second item of property enhances the value of the first.  Otherwise no question of tax would arise.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I thought it was to cover such a situation that a capital gains tax was brought in.  I can see situations in Dublin and in various parts of the country where this situation would arise.  There would be two properties, one complementary to the other as regards potential development, but not at one particular time. A person would sell both but would not be in a position to sell one of them at a certain time because he intends to keep it at that time.  Then after three or four years, perhaps family circumstances would decide for him that he should sell the grocery part in the house next to the other which is a public house. Naturally, the man in the best position to buy it would be A, the person to whom he had sold the first house, now a licensed premises, and how that transaction can be treated as a gift and not as a purely commercial transaction, I do not know.  I can see how a person could be subject to capital gains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming that A bought the first property for £10,000 and five years later he bought the second property for £4,000.  The second property, if fully developed, might be worth £15,000 but I do not see how that could be deemed as a gift.  It would be unfair to B so to treat it because it would depress the value of his property in a later sale and he will have to take that into consideration when purchasing the property.  He will say he intends to develop it and buy the property at market value from B who, if he has any sense, will put the property up at public auction because he <Col N="1556" /> will know that A next door will be the main interested party.</P>
    <P>But C could come in and buy the property at any price and there would be no gift tax attached to it.  I do not think that is good law because, although it would have no effect on purchaser C, it will depress the market value as far as B is concerned because A will have to take into consideration that, when he develops it complementary to his licensed premises, it will enhance its value in the eyes of the Revenue Commissioners who will be entitled to say the property is worth £25,000 to £30,000 and they can tax him on the difference between that and the purchase price.  Therefore, the man selling the property will lose something in the region of £20,000 in the value of his property.  If a third party wishes to come in he can buy it for 25 or 30 per cent less than A was prepared to pay and will pay no gift tax.  If A purchases it because of the potential he sees in it, he will have to pay gift tax. There is bad business practice in that.</P>

I want to make it clear that there is no proposal here to tax an increase in value due to development. The proposal here is to tax the difference between the price they would fetch when sold separately and the price they would fetch if sold together. If there is no difference in value there, then there will be no tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main object of the section is to deal with collusive transactions.  If this section were not here it would be impossible to operate the tax.  I have given the example of the shares.  I will come back to that again.  At least, it is understood. As I have said, before the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to tax they will have to show that the acquisition <Col N="1557" /> of the second portion of the property added to the value of the first portion.  Deputy Fitzpatrick says that the effect of this might be to deprive the owner of the best price for his house.  As a matter of fact, you could have a situation where the second bit of the property would not be of any value or of interest to anybody except the person who had bought the first portion.  That quite frequently happens.</P>

I want to emphasise this and drive it home: before the question of tax arises the acquisition of the second item of property will have to have increased the value of the first.  I wonder how often does it genuinely happen that a person splits up his property of this sort which is obviously more valuable in one lot than in two pieces and sells it separately to the same person?  I say it does not often arise.  If a man is well advised, it will not happen.  If a person was getting on in years and wanted to keep a portion of the property for his day, as we say, the sensible thing would be to sell the whole property at the one time but to reserve a life interest or limited interest in the remainder.</P>

      <P>If we could leave out donor or donee, where clearly there is a case&mdash;we are not disputing that&mdash; the case we are concerned with is where there is purchase at full value for a consideration in each case.  The Minister could consider a case of that kind.  The purchaser, say, of the two houses we have been talking about having paid full market value for the first and then full market value for the second house some years later now has two houses which taken together are worth more than the sum of what he paid for the two separately. At some time, either when he disposes of it, develops it or dies, that increased value will be brought into some form of tax.  It will become liable either to capital gains tax or to inheritance tax.  This seems to be a new concept that is involved in this section of applying a gift tax to the increase in the value that is deemed to come about by reason of this.  If, in fact, there is an increase in value, will it not be caught in the normal way under capital gains tax and, if so, why complicate it by introducing it here?  In regard to the other question that arises, if it is going to be subject to capital gains tax, why should it be subject to capital gains tax plus gift tax, which appears to be what is happening under the section?</P>

      <P>I trust the Chair will allow me to refer simultaneously to some extent to both sections.  Section 30 says that a person shall be deemed not to be beneficially entitled in possession to the benefit unless and until the power of revocation is released by the disponer or otherwise ceases to be exercisable.  That appears to be granting certain relief but in the next section we read that a person shall be deemed to take a gift in each relevant period when he is allowed the use, occupation or enjoyment of any property otherwise than for full consideration in money or money's worth. In other words, he is deemed to take a gift.  Am I right in understanding section 30 to say that if the disponer reserves to himself the power to revoke the benefit the person entitled beneficially shall not be deemed to be so entitled unless and until the power of revocation is released?  Let us take a case that could apply to both sections. If, say, I lend the use of my property for example, a summer residence, to a friend for a couple of months in the summer, according to this section that case would be included and I would be preserved from the consequences of gift tax.  However, the situation seems to be captured in the next section.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> He would not be taxed on the value of the property because one would not value it for stamp duty purposes.  If you transfer a property worth £20,000, subject to a power of revocation, you will stamp it with £1 because it is regarded as valueless.  The Revenue Commissioners cannot value it.  They do not treat it as being of value because it could be revoked the next day. And that is why we cannot tax it there.  On the other hand, we tax the benefit that the transferee takes under section 31.</P>

      <P>The matter would have been simplified if this had been all one section because I can see the logic of what the Minister is doing. Having it appear as two separate sections is slightly confusing and one asks the reasons.  The court, too, would ask the reason.  From what the Minister says I am beginning to see the light.  I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will bear with me if I have to refer to the subsequent section because the two are interlinked.</P>
      <P>The Minister rightly visualises the case where a gift duty could be evaded by the simple device of a disponer presenting the property to be enjoyed in possession to another person and by the mere legal formality of retaining a power of revocation.  I should imagine that if such an evasion were attempted the Revenue Commissioners would require evidence.  It is clear that what people are thinking of is a formal transaction in which, like some of the evasive transactions which were availed of before this system was brought in, there would be a document with the power of revocation which could be adjudicated upon as such.  In so far as that goes I have no quarrel with the section.  But the section as couched here is wide enough to read that if the power of revoking the gift remains in me, whether evidenced by a formal legal transaction or merely by the operation of law, then the section will operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apply that consideration in the specific case where there is no formal arrangement&mdash;which can happen very simply and which raises a somewhat serious problem on the next section. I will take the same example but the difference between its application on the two sections will be merely a question of a period of time.  If it is convenient for me, who owns a property, to make an arrangement with somebody else to occupy it as a caretaker, that friend enjoys the full beneficial ownership of my property, other than the title, and it is a voluntary gift for no consideration, and I am legally entitled to recover at the end of any period reasonably within the limitation period.  The Minister's 20 years is clear and his point about formal evasive tactics is also clear. <Col N="1564" /> In this incidental case the period is so limited as to make it fairly certain that the power of revocation lies in me and the arrangement is in the nature of a mutual convenience.  Does the Minister intend to catch that case?</P>

If we assume that the power to revoke is released four years after the original transaction and, therefore, the question of his being deemed to be in beneficial ownership in possession arises, what valuation of the property comes into play?  Is it the one at the time of the original transaction or the one at the date four years later when the power of revocation is released?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 24, subsection (4), line 52, after &ldquo;period&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or, if earlier, immediately prior to the time when the use, occupation or enjoyment referred to in subsection (1) comes to an end&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is required to take account of the possibility of a use, enjoyment or occupation ending before the end of a relevant period, especially by the death of the deemed donee. For example, an object of a discretionary trust is allowed the free use of a house, the letting value of which is £1,000 per annum.  He is taxed each year as receiving on 31st December a gift of £1,000.  If he ceases to occupy the house on 1st July, 1977, the gift tax due in respect of the six months occupation&mdash;value £500&mdash;would not be due until the date of the gift&mdash;the valuation date under section 21&mdash;that is, six months later on 31st December, 1977.  Similarly, if he died on 1st July, 1977, the valuation date would be six months after his death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While &ldquo;gifts&rdquo; may be taken after the donee's death&mdash;for example, where property is given to A for five years, then to B absolutely, and B dies within the five years&mdash;it is more realistic in the present section to relate the valuation date to the cesser of the use: the enjoyment thereof <Col N="1568" /> had taken place prior to that date and the purpose of the &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo;&mdash;normally one year&mdash;is merely to avoid a multiplicity of returns for a continuing use, enjoyment or benefit. When the use has ended, the relevant return will thus be due within three months of the cesser&mdash;section 36 (5) &mdash;where the donee is living; if he is dead, an assessment may be made on his personal representative&mdash;section 39 &mdash;who is accountable under section 35 (6).</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 31, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that section 53 exempts small transactions but one can visualise occupations that may be for a longer period.  The section seems to raise a technical point so far as phraseology is concerned.  Section 31 provides:</P>
      <P>That a person shall be deemed to take a gift in each relevant period during the whole or part of which, not being beneficially entitled in possession thereto, he is allowed to have the use, occupation or enjoyment of any property otherwise than for full consideration in money or money's worth.</P>
      <P>The words used are &ldquo;....  not being beneficially entitled in possession thereto ....&rdquo; but section 30 refers to &ldquo;....  becomes beneficially entitled in possession to any benefit ...&rdquo;.  Is there not a danger of creating a loophole in that section 30 operates where a person is in the legal sense beneficially entitled to possession while it is specifically excluded in section 31?</P>
      <P>I have not looked up the details and my memory of it may not be quite reliable but it seems to me that there could be a distinction, as is made in the section, between &ldquo;beneficially entitled in possesion thereto&rdquo; and &ldquo;the use, occupation or enjoyment&rdquo;. Clearly there is a contrast made between the two phrases in section 31 (1).  The same phrase:</P>
      <P>beneficially entitled in possession to any benefit</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> appears in section 30.  If the Minister's interpretation of section 30 is correct, I am a little confused as to the net operation of both sections in a conceivable case.</P>

He could sue for trespass.  However, principally because it would be legally impossible to value such property, we would deem him not to be in beneficial occupation but we catch him under section 31 as a person not being in beneficial occupation of the property but having the use of it.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 31 provides that where a person, who is not beneficially entitled in possession to property, is allowed to use the property he will be taxed on the basis that he takes a gift in each year of the value of the use of the property for that year.  The section will apply, for example, to persons who are objects of discretionary trusts and to a person occupying property under a disposition which may be revoked.  If a person who is not entitled to property in possession is allowed to have the use of it, section 31 proposes to tax him on the benefit of having the use of it.  In each year the net value the use had in that year is deemed to be a gift or inheritance received at the end of the year.  The purpose of subsection (5) is to treat appropriate cases as inheritances rather than as gifts.  Subsection (3) creates a notional sum for taxation purposes and subsection (6) provides that it shall not be taxed where the disponer and the disposition are both foreign.  Examples of cases of this type are (1) the property held on a discretionary trust includes a dwelling house or a farm.  The <Col N="1570" /> trustees allow one of the objects of the trust the use of the house or farm.  (2) A gives B a farm as a gift but reserves the power to revoke the gift.  Under section 30 B does not take a taxable gift until the power of revocation is released or lapses.  B has the use of the farm in the meantime. (3) A father gives his son a loan of money free of interest.</P>

      <P>A person becomes beneficially entitled in possession to any benefit and under the terms of the disposition the disponer reserves to himself the power to revoke the benefit.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> If I understand correctly, the Deputy inquires whether tax is payable on a gift given subject to a power of revocation until the power of revocation ceases and my answer to that is that no tax is payable until the power of revocation ceases but powers of revocation, of their nature, are given for a limited time or are exercisable during the life-time of the person who gives them or during some other person's life <Col N="1572" /> time.  As long as the power of revocation is effective no tax is payable on the capital value of the gift but the person is taxed on the application of section 31.  A person who gets a gift subject to a power of revocation is not liable to tax by virtue of section 30 as long as the power of revocation lasts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so under section 30, then section 31 expressly excludes a case with the words:</P>
      <P>not being beneficially entitled in possession thereto</P>
      <P>It, therefore, I suggest only covers user and occupation in cases where there is no entitlement to possession.  My point is that there may be entitlement to legal possession, plus user and occupation, nevertheless escaping under section 30 and the net result of the two would be a loophole.  I hope I have made the point clear because it is a matter for the Minister's legal advisers to consider if there is any substance in it.</P>
