      <P>Can the Taoiseach say, why, although the Parliamentary Secretary called to my office at 10.20 last evening and told Deputy Browne that the Wealth Tax Bill was being taken today at our request because, as he said, we had been pressing for it all day, there has been an overnight change?</P>

      <P>I wish to know why I was told yesterday at lunchtime that we could not have the fisheries motion because such arrangement would not suit the Government, whereas now we are informed that this motion is to be taken today.  I want to know, too, why at the same time I was told that we could not have the Industry and Commerce Estimate, whereas now this is to be taken today.  Why were we told at 10.20 last evening that we could have the Wealth Tax Bill today when, this morning, that arrangement has been changed?  There is a deliberate effort being made by the Government to deceive the House in the same way as they have been deceiving the country for the past two-and-a-half years.</P>

Like drunken sailors spending money, the Opposition squandered the time of the House during the past three months.  They have had plenty of time to concern themselves about giving time to the Wealth Tax Bill.  They were warned by me several times that a crunch was coming but now they are whinging.  This Government will do their business one way or another.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, may I direct the Chair's attention to the provision of Standing Order No. 139 (1) which reads:</P>
      <P>Any Standing Order or Orders of the Dáil may be suspended or modified in effect for the day's sitting, and for a particular purpose, upon motion made after notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> On Wednesday last there was passed in this House a motion which purports to modify or amend many of the Standing Orders during a period of about three weeks.  The procedure for the modification or suspension of Standing Orders is set out clearly in the paragraph I have read.  It can be done each day for that day for a particular purpose.  The reason for Standing Order 139 (1) is to prevent precisely what happened this week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say something about it.  I am pointing out that the reason for this Standing Order is to prevent the changing of Standing Orders, their suspension or modification, during a lengthy period by the Government using their majority for their own purpose.  This Standing Order is there to protect the rights of individual Deputies and of the House as a whole.  If the Government wish to modify or suspend Standing Orders, as appears to be the case, for a lengthy period, they must move each day in respect of that day and will have to state the particular purpose of any such change.  You will agree that the wording of this Standing Order is perfectly clear and would take precedence over whatever motion was passed here on Wednesday and that, therefore, the timetable set out in the guillotine motion could not apply today.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="International Energy Programme" RHead="Agreement: Motion (Resumed)">
    <Title>International Energy Programme Agreement: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the agreement establishing an International Energy Programme.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Transport and Power.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Government have not changed their minds on this matter although in the month that has passed since I moved the adjournment of this debate they had an opportunity to do so.  The Government made a mistake entering into this agreement and they only reacted to a situation when it had occurred.  They made no attempt to influence that situation with regard to our oil resources.  I am confident that our best ploy would be to cooperate with the oil-producing countries as well as to ally ourselves to the oil-consuming nations.</P>
      <P>In the course of this debate it was pointed out that Arab oil was reasonably cheap but after we buy it we tax it.  Last year we added a severe tax of 15p per gallon.  That was a mistake and what has occurred since has proved that it was.  It is only fair that oil-producing nations should ask themselves why they should sell their oil at a cheap rate so that other countries can obtain money for their Exchequers through tax, more than they can obtain for the product.  If we were selling our beef to any nation and that nation, in turn, obtained a substantial profit from the beef before it got to the consumer we would think twice about selling the beef to that country again.  We would look for a realistic price we could sell the product at, as the oil-producing countries have done in relation to oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers have expressed the view that it was a mistake to ally ourselves with the United States whose attitude at one stage towards <Col N="1529" /> the oil-producing countries was not likely to gain friends for their allies. When we ally ourselves on the side of the United States we appear to be on the same side as the multi-national oil companies.  Why is it that the United States who have the potential to produce their own oil requirements find it handier not to produce the oil they need but to buy oil from other countries?  I am not anti-American in my outlook and I appreciate what they have done.  If I were asked to categorise the different peoples, the United States would be very much on the right side but in this economic situation we must be realistic.  The Minister should have another look at this agreement.  It is refreshing to think that the Government can change their minds in the course of 12 hours and I hope this Minister will change his mind about this agreement.</P>
    <P>We accepted the minimum voting strength; it is practically nothing and only comparable to Luxembourg.  We have tied ourselves for at least four years, probably ten years, to this agreement.  The intention is that those who sign it will enter into the agreement for ten years.  A nation must be in for three years before it can give one year's notice of its intention to leave. In view of the potential of our natural resources&mdash;it is being continually referred to as the only solution to our economic problems and the saviour that the Government offer to our economic ills&mdash;is it wise that we should tie ourselves to a group such as this?  The Government are confident, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce has expressed the opinion, that we will be rolling in money in time when our natural gas and oil is tapped.  It appears that we will have enough energy to satisfy our own demands and, possibly, some to spare.  The Minister is conscious of his role as a European but it is not his duty to be a good European before he has proved himself to be a good Irishman.  The Minister's motto should be: &ldquo;Let us christen our own child first and get the best possible bargain for Ireland.&rdquo;  It is possible to do that and still be a member of any European association.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> We should have a look at the question of turf.  Some time ago when oil was available at a relatively cheap rate many people felt it would be uneconomic to exploit our turf resources. However, the recent significant increase in oil prices has changed our views in regard to that. It is now felt that many of the bogs which were considered uneconomic up to now are worth developing.  I appeal to the Minister to make an earnest effort to develop these resources. In my constituency there are unproductive virgin bogs but they are unproductive for the want of capital outlay.  If money was expended on these bogs a long term return would accrue to the country. It appears that for want of money, or want of interest, the Government have made no allocation towards the development of bog roads this year. Because of an answer given to a question put by Deputy McEllistrim some time ago I believe this Minister did not apply to FEOGA for a grant for the improvement of bog roads.  This is a dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>In my county we have areas such as Allenwood where the best of turf would be available but for want of proper roads and drainage.  The drainage problem could be got over by simple schemes.  In the past before Christmas all counties adopted schemes for the cleaning of drains but these were dropped.  If these schemes were reintroduced and an effort made to clear these drains, much of this bogland would be available for turf production and for local people to win their own fuel.  If this work is carried out, private firms might go into turf production.  I know of a German firm near Edenderry who have done great work in this direction and they provide plots of turf cut for people at a reasonable rate.  Many people in my own area and in the area of Kildare adjoining Offaly avail of this facility.  The roadways and the drainage there leave a lot to be desired.  Government action in this direction is necessary, particularly now when we are talking about conserving energy and resources and making the best possible use of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> I have a theory that most of the boglands are in areas that are depressed from an employment and investment point of view.  Job opportunities are not good in these areas. We should spend money and provide employment in these areas on works such as drainage and roadmaking which have a very high labour content and are very suitable to the unemployment situation we have today.  We would be saving money in the long run, as we would be developing a resource that has been neglected, and if we look even further ahead, we would be providing large tracts of cutaway bog which could be useful later on for vegetable growing and other agricultural work.  This would, in turn, ensure that in areas where Bord na Móna give a great deal of employment at the moment and other depressed areas like that there will be alternative employment in canning and other ancillary industries which will take the place of Bord na Móna and the other industries that are there, that provide continuity of employment and a renewal of life in those areas.</P>
    <P>If we were asked to point out what was lacking most in the country at the moment I think we would say confidence, that is, lack of confidence in the Irish economy and in the country in general.  As a result of that money is very scarce.  Our oil bill for the year is in the region of £200 million, and this agreement binds us to increase our storage facilities from 60 days to 90 days.  If we store 60 days' supply of oil, as it is necessary to do now, we tie up £33 million.  If we store another 30 days' supply of oil to bring us up to 90 days, we tie up £50 million, an extra £17 million or so.</P>
    <P>In the present economic climate it is realistic to ask: are we in a position to do this?  Have we the money to spare?  There are matters to which I would give equal priority with our petrol pool, matters such as the need for remedial teachers, improvement of the pupil-teacher ratio, the question of the stopping of amenity grants and insufficient money being injected <Col N="1532" /> into the building industry.  These are all suffering from lack of capital investment. Indeed, in regard to remedial teachers and the pupil-teacher ratio, it would appear that a decision was taken at Cabinet level to cut back. We had at our disposal trained and untrained teachers, and it was decided to dispense with the untrained teachers on the last day of June, and three years' teaching has been lost to teachers who will no longer get an extension when they reach 65.  We could have utilised this expertise which we are now discarding, possibly for financial reasons.  It would appear to me that a country that cannot ensure the education of its young people, that cannot give to slow learners the chance which they can only get now and which cannot be given to them again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in mentioning these matters, a Cheann Comhairle, is to illustrate how bereft of money our country must be when we victimise the future of our children for want of money, and at the same time propose that we spend an extra £17 million in storing petrol and oil for three months rather than two months.  That appears to me to be an item which could be brought into this debate.  If the Minister cannot see the sense of it, all I can say is that there are none so blind as those who will not see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the 1st May deadline which has been mentioned in this debate, was that not supposed to be the last day for signing the agreement? I should like to know what has happened in this regard or what has changed that.  I should also like an explanation as to the difficulties in <Col N="1533" /> the provision of this extra storage and if it has been decided who is to pay for these facilities.  That has not been cleared up.  None of the Government speakers I have heard or whose contributions to the debate I have read has alluded to this important matter.  We have not the financial resources available to us at the moment to provide these storage facilities and, perhaps, the best arrangement would be that those who are selling the oil should provide their own means of storing it.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister also tell us what has happened to the conservation programme?  We were continually seeing pound notes being burned on television in an advertisement and being advised to burn energy wisely. What has been the result of that exercise? We have heard talk galore but we have not seen any real action.  I hope the Minister will tell us&mdash;in the length of time at his disposal&mdash;because it has now been decided that this discussion must be limited and that the time that it merits cannot be given to it&mdash;one good thing that this conservation programme has done.</P>
    <P>I mentioned turf as an alternative source of energy.  There is also water power.  It would appear&mdash;and I have respect for the ESB in these matters &mdash;that when they decided to use the Turlough Hill project and the upper and lower lake idea, the water power that was available to us in the country would no longer merit being harnessed in the same fashion as in the Shannon and other schemes. However, the increase in the price of oil may have changed that.  I wonder if we have examined all the possibilities available to us in regard to the different sources of energy, and what information has the Minister on the utilisation of solar energy in the heating of houses.  I am happy to say that a firm in my town has made an effort to utilise solar energy in this regard.  I hope every help will be given by the Government Departments concerned in the matter of utilising a source of energy that is available to us for many months of the year and which we have not to import.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> Perhaps the Minister would be in a position to tell us how we have improved our chances of getting oil. Does this agreement help us to get oil at a price we can afford?  The agreement shows that we are still tied to the multi-national oil companies, perhaps more tied now than we were before.  Many people looking at the agreement will come to the conclusion that we are spancelled on this occasion.  We have agreed that we must buy oil at a minimum price.</P>
    <P>Since the agreement was first mooted, there has been a complete reversal of policy in the United States with regard to the purchase of oil. They no longer appear to want to buy oil at the cheapest price.  The policy would now seem to be to pay a minimum price for it and not to go below the floor price.  They have their own good reasons for that.</P>
    <P>One would not need to be an economic expert to realise that having to pay £200 million a year for oil, this country should try to buy that oil at the cheapest possible rate, particularly when we need the money so badly.  Perhaps I should not refer to that.  It appears to be a very touchy subject.</P>
    <P>When talking about saving money I must again refer the Minister to the suggestion made by Deputy Barrett since he became spokesman on this matter that we should set up another oil refinery, that we should buy crude oil where we can buy it cheaply and where we have not tankers to bring it in, charter them. This makes good sense.  It would be a pity if just because Deputy Barrett is on this side of the House the Minister would not listen to the suggestion and would allow time to elapse without putting that suggestion into operation.  We can see the effect of the ignoring of suggestions from this side of the House as to what should have been done in the first budget of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>If the suggestions put forward by Deputy Colley at that time had been adopted, there might have <Col N="1535" /> been no need to have had a second budget.  I would hope that the Minister would take a leaf out of the book of the Minister for Finance and examine suggestions put forward by Deputy Barrett and act on them.  Since Deputy Barrett made these suggestions, 18 months have been lost.  Even if the Minister were to decide now to erect an oil refinery, it would be three years before the refinery would be in operation.  The Minister should charter tankers, refine the oil in Europe if necessary, and use it here.  There are no statistics produced to show that Deputy Barrett is wrong in saying that £20 million could be saved in this way.  We could do with that £20 million.</P>
      <P>It would appear from this agreement that not alone are we tied to the USA and to their Government's attitudes and are likely to be swayed by their Government's change of policies but are also tied to people who have proved very ruthless in the past, companies that have made huge profits that have been stolen from the public at will, at regular intervals.  It would appear that we have been powerless to stop the big powerful concerns that have gone their own merry way and did what they liked.  They are not people the Minister should go camping with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may ignore what we are telling him.  He may be wishing that I would stop speaking and let him in to conclude the debate.  The suggestions I am making are genuine suggestions, possibly not very palatable to the Minister but they are worthy of attention.  Perhaps the Minister will decide to act on them or at least examine them or show this side of the House why he is not acting on them, extend to us that courtesy at least.  We are entitled to know why the Minister is not prepared to act on the suggestions we make.  He should tell us who will pay the storage cost for the 90 days.  Is it the people or the oil companies?  If we start to build an oil refinery now, it will be 1979 before it is in operation. It is estimated that we will have our own oil in the 1980s.  It surely is necessary to go ahead with the building <Col N="1536" /> of an oil refinery now.</P>
    <P>On 17th April&mdash;Volume 279, column 1928 of the Official Report, Deputy Barrett said:</P>
    <P>... Our economy is virtually controlled by these multi-nationals who are pretty ruthless.  We should take steps to get from under the umbrella of these multi-national concerns. There is no evidence of effective action having been taken in this regard and we are as subject to the whims of the boards of these companies as we were in October, 1973...</P>
    <P>The Minister has not indicated what plans he has for refining oil.  It would appear that at some time in the 1980s we will have our own oil supplies. This should be of benefit to the economy.  We are hoping to become self-sufficient and should plan ahead now for the day when we will need a second refinery.  There would be ancillary industries as a spin-off from the refinery.  Our policy should be to buy oil as cheaply as possible.  The very terms of the agreement and the floor price that has been laid down will prevent us from doing that.  We should go to the oil-producing countries and see what terms we can get rather than hope to get preferential treatment when we are in the same pool as Japan.</P>
    <P>It is my belief, sincerely held, that we should cut adrift from this agreement. There is an indication that there is not much interest in this matter on the Government side of the House, any more than there was on the last occasion that I contributed to a debate on this subject.  Perhaps it is an indication of how boring my contribution is.  There is no-one on the Government side prepared to speak.  It would appear that Government Deputies are not very interested They will be led by the nose and will do whatever they have been advised to do, whether ill-advised or not.  If Government Deputies have not time to come into the House, they should read the debates and compare the Minister's speech with Deputy Barrett's speech and ask themselves who is sincere and who is thinking about the problem and who shows any independent line of action.  The Minister's policy shows <Col N="1537" /> lack of initiative and slavish following of the herd.</P>
    <P>I can only say that if the mentality now shown by the National Coalition Government, as exemplified in this motion, had its way in the first quarter of this century we would not even have enjoyed the limited amount of political freedom we enjoy at the moment.  If this attitude the Government have adopted is allowed to continue I fear we will lose the limited amount of economic freedom we have in the last quarter of this century.</P>
    <P>We should look to the day when we have our own oil and gas and plan ahead.  Even if the Government realise they will not be the Government of the day when that happens it would be wrong of them to tie our hands to the extent they are now doing with this motion.  The agreement is a very lengthy one and a little bit hazy.  It needs a lot of explanation. Unfortunately there will be no Committee Stage in this debate to explain it line by line.  The Minister promised that he will explain all the outstanding matters and matters which were not clear to our limited intelligence when he is winding up.  I think &ldquo;winding up&rdquo; is a very good expression in this case.  It is an expression which a person uses when he says he is winding up an alarm clock to get him to rise in time.  It is possibly a good expression with regard to the guillotine motion when we are winding up the business of this House.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that all the loose ends and the matters which are not completely clear to us have to be tied up without a very minute explanation.  We would like to have that.  This side of the House does not approve of Ireland's participation in this international energy programme agreement.  I am more confident in asking the Minister to change his attitude in relation to this seeing that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach was able to change his attitude within the course of 12 hours.  I hope, seeing that the Government's minds are never really made up about any particular matter that their minds are not made up about this matter and that the Minister might change.  I would like him to have another look at this, not for <Col N="1538" /> our sake, not for the sake of the Coalition but for the sake of the country.</P>

      <P>My intervention will be surprisingly short.  I intervene merely to say that I offered the Opposition extra time on this motion if they wished it, either today or by agreement on some other occasion. That offer was refused with contempt. If complaints are hereafter made that there is not a chance given to the Opposition to discuss this matter fully it ought to be borne in mind that if there is not they have only themselves to thank for it.</P>
      <P>It is true that the order made by the House on Wednesday allots two hours for this motion and for the one that follows.  I offered to the Opposition that the Government would agree to vary that order by extending the time for any of the items offered for today, either so that it would occupy the remaining time left over today or perhaps even extend it to next week.  If anyone on the Opposition side feels he is being left short of time or if by any chance the intention is not to allow the Minister to reply it should be borne in mind that the Government closure, so far as this motion is concerned, was the subject yesterday of an offer by me to agree to vary the order by extending the time somewhat, provided it was by agreement.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a fairly brief and, I hope, concise contribution to the motion.  There is one feature of it which appears to have escaped a deep analysis, that is the speech of the Minister for Transport and Power on 16th June, 1975 to a Fine Gael meeting in Cork.  The report of that meeting said: &ldquo;Speaking at a Fine Gael meeting in Cork on Monday, 16th June, 1975 Mr. Peter Barry, TD, Minister for Transport and Power, strongly defended the Government's proposal to participate in the newly formed International Energy Agency&rdquo;.  I can appreciate the Minister making that speech at a Fine Gael meeting because in relation to a policy on international energy he would need to have a passive, captive audience. It is understandable and reasonable that the Minister should address this appalling analysis of the international energy agreement to a quiet, reserved, decent group of Fine Gael people who would not dream of interrupting him during the course of that speech which he made at some length.</P>

      <P>The Minister created this opportunity outside the Dáil to present what is supposed to be the Government's answer to the objections we made to the agreement.  I presume the decision was made before 16th June to apply the guillotine proving once more the Government's mismanagement in the handling of our energy affairs.  This agreement has been relentlessly and vigorously opposed by every Fianna Fáil speaker inside and outside the House.</P>
      <P>We have put an unanswerable case for the non-involvement of this country in this sorry mess of an agency, and sorry mess of an agency it is.  We have proved that here in our contribution, in the contributions of Deputy Sylvester Barrett, Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Wilson, Deputy Power and others but, more particularly, in the contribution of Deputy Sylvester Barrett.  His objection can be simply stated.  We should have no truck with power politics which involve Governments whose actions in the fulfilment of their own policies affect others to a greater extent than the consequences of their action can affect themselves. Producer country embargoes can be safely ignored by this country for as long as we have to wait for the availability of our own oil supplies provided we avoid the possibility of being dragged into the arena of controversy and politics, which Deputy Barrett, our spokesman for Transport and Power, has so ably articulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> Participation in this agency brings us into the arena of controversy and the record proves how the Government displayed deplorable ignorance in the entire management of our energy affairs since October, 1973, and we say the Government are forcing this measure through Dáil Éireann at their own peril.  It would be satisfactory enough if it were only at the peril of the Government.  We do not want the Government.  We want the Government out and when we say &ldquo;at their own peril&rdquo; we hope the Government are in peril.  What we are concerned about is the peril to the country.  It is the community that suffers as a result of Government policy in this respect.  It is the country that suffers.  This measure is being forced through Dáil Éireann at the peril of the country.  We do not give a damn about the Government.  If at any time between now and the moment of our self-sufficiency in domestic oil production the people are called upon to pay the cost of the Government's folly we should ensure that this, together with all the other monuments to their mismanagement, will never be forgotten by a suffering electorate.  It is not a question merely of this energy motion.  We have other monuments to the tragic consequences of Government policy, this awful Government.  Some people are speculating about a general election in September though Fine Gael Deputies who have speculated to me about an election in September have not said whether it will be September, 1975, 1976 or 1977.</P>

      <P>Notes on the agreement circulated to Dáil Éireann were prepared and issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs but here we have the Minister for Transport and <Col N="1544" /> Power piloting the matter through Dáil Éireann.  Some time ago the Minister for foreign Affairs said it was unlikely the agreement would ever be brought into operation.  He did not have very much else to say about it.  Here we have the Minister for Transport and Power standing over the agreement to the bitter end. He has at least a little bit of courage. He is not funking it.  In the light of what I have said the question arises as to who is in charge of energy policy.</P>
      <P>To return to the Minister's infamous speech in Cork, I assume the Minister prepared the speech himself and realised the consequences would be very far-reaching.  I presume he also realised much of what he said could only be described as false.  He said that our objections and the objections of well-informed Dáil commentators are based on misinformation. We know he is referring to Deputies who criticised his policy. &ldquo;Well-informed Dáil commentators&rdquo;&mdash;is that type of remark to be left hanging?  Let me make it quite clear to the Parliamentary Secretary and the absent members of his Government that our objections are based on our own assessment of the details of the agreement circulated to us. There have been comprehensive meetings of the back-up group on Transport and Power in relation to this agreement.  On numerous occasions at party meetings what had been offered by the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Foreign Affairs was discussed at length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were many contributions presided over by the spokesman on Transport and Power, Deputy Barrett. The information available to us and our diagnosis and prognosis of the agreement and its future effects on the country would appear to be better than the actual information and advice and guidance the Government have available to them.  The people who advise us know what they are talking about.  The people who are advising the Government are good people no doubt and their information and judgment are <i>bona fide</i>.  We say that <Col N="1545" /> one for one our advice is better than theirs.  I expect that is what arguments are all about.</P>
    <P>In the speech the Minister made in Cork on 16th June he said:</P>
    <P>The events of 1973 must surely convince any intelligent observer of the need for constructive international arrangements to provide protection against further embargoes.</P>
    <P>We say the first thing an intelligent observer observes is that the embargoes of 1973 were directed primarily against one country, namely, the United States of America.  The Minister knows that.  This was one of a series of moves on a complicated chessboard on which Ireland was standing as an innocent pawn.  One of the consequences was that we were a beneficiary of imported international inflation, and we now have a legacy of 103,000 unemployed.  That is one of the sorry consequences of the Minister's handling of the situation on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>We were a favoured nation because we were in the multi-international pattern of distribution.  Our oil bill rose from £40 million to £230 million per annum.  Our inflation rate rose to 24 per cent.  Our budgetary deficit will probably rise to £300 million in 1975. These things happened to us although there was no embargo against us.  Our judgment as to what was happening to us when it was happening motivated our calls to the Government quickly to initiate a policy of independence in crude oil procurement and self-sufficiency in refining capacity.  The record of what the Opposition have been saying since October, 1973, proves how correct our assessment was.</P>
    <P>If we are seen to be independent we have nothing to fear from the oilproducing countries in the Middle East.  That is our judgment and we hope, to use the Minister's own words, that any intelligent observer will see the logic and realism of our judgment. The Minister said we were illogical and unrealistic.  When the Minister uses words like misinformation, illogical and unrealistic, he leaves them hanging.  He does not develop why he <Col N="1546" /> suggests we are acting on misinformation, or why we were speaking from a position of illogicality or unrealism. He just throws away the words without developing the reason for his statement.  We should examine where the failings in logic and realism occur. We are fortunate to have a concise résumé of illogical reasoning in the hand-out by the Minister for Transport and Power which is now, I hope, under critical examination by myself and others who may follow on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us the agency has been established to implement a programme for the development of energy oil reserves and the sharing of oil in a supply crisis.  In addition it establishes a system for the investigation of international oil markets and a formula for long-term co-operation in conserving energy and developing alternative energy supplies.  We say the agency has been established to confront Arab oil producers with a consumer cartel which, once set up, cannot change its objectives or direction without the clear agreement of the United States of America.  Any intelligent observer reading this agreement must come to no other conclusion. One can come to no other conclusion. It is an irrefutable statement and all the talking in the world and all the verbal juxtaposition by the Minister cannot change that situation.  That is the real crunch point of our argument as to why we should reject this international energy agreement.</P>
    <P>In his speech in Cork the Minister went to great lengths to prove how we misread the agreement by quoting the percentage votes to change any article.  With respect to the Minister, it is he who misread our argument. He said:</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the opposition to the international energy agency membership has been the belief that the agreement establishing the agency was entirely a United States conception and that US delegations with the support of one or two members could effectively determine the policy to be pursued.  In fact, the voting system has been intentionally devised in such a way that no single bloc of interests can <Col N="1547" /> determine policy.  For any obligations or commitments not already envisaged in the agreement, there must be unanimity of voting which effectively provides even the smallest member with a veto.  Decisions on the management of the programme are taken by majority voting.  The voting weights are so balanced that even the most trivial decision requires the support of at least half the voting members irrespective of their size.</P>
    <P>This is a lengthy and interesting quotation with one defect.  It is wrong in its concept.  The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>In other cases the requirement is for the support of three-quarters or more of the members and there is no way in which a small group of countries can secure decisions against the interests of others.  Indeed, the entire voting system is such that proposals require a very wide measure of consensus in order to secure approval.  The position in this regard is very clearly set out in the agreement which has been available to all those interested for many months.  I find great difficulty in understanding how such misinformation has been put about.</P>
    <P>Article 2 subsection (ii) of the agreement on an international energy programme provides that the governing body shall, acting by special majority &mdash;and no doubt the Minister will understand what that means&mdash;not later than July 1st, 1975, decide the date from which the emergency reserve commitment of each participating country shall, for the purpose of calculating its supply right referred to in article 7 be deemed to be raised to a level of 90 days.  That proportion seems to be reasonable, this matter of a special majority which the Minister questioned us about on the voting weights.  The US require seven more votes to block even the most sensible request for change.  That is an irrefutable fact, and that is the basis of our argument.</P>
    <P>We do not like the agreement.  The USA have the voting weight to ensure that even 90 per cent of the participants <Col N="1548" /> cannot succeed, and as we understand it it would not be possible to marshal the required 60 per cent of the votes.  If the Minister turns to page 80 of the International Energy Agreement which I have been citing, he will find that according to the terms set out our point of view is the correct one.  The Minister need not think these quotations are from the top of my head.  We have given the Minister the various references.</P>

      <P>To the Minister's Cork speech.  The Minister might refer to Deputy Barrett who during the past two years has been dealing very clearly with this.  In this connection I should like to pay a welldeserved tribute to Deputy Barrett. Perhaps the Minister would look at article 62 and the US predominance in this.  There is one other matter to which I might refer.</P>

        <i>Notice taken that</i> 20 <i>Members were</i><i>not present; House counted and</i> 20 <i>Members being present,</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of my arguments from the draft agreement <Col N="1550" /> on the International Energy Agency Agreement, it is as well to come back to the Minister's speech in Cork. Page 4 of the Minister's handout says: &ldquo;Our commitments to IEAA membership does not extend beyond three years, at which stage members are free to withdraw at 12 months' notice.&rdquo;  In simple language, that means that we are in for four years. It only took a four months' notice embargo to cause the present economic chaos in the country, and we are not supposed to be involved in the embargo.  The very day the Minister for Transport and Power was telling us not to count ourselves as producers, his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce was laying odds that we would have proven oil deposits within three years.  The ceremony of contract signing between Marathon and the Gas Board recently put us into the clubs as producers of oil products and of petroleum products generally.  It is conclusively proved by the various arguments that this agreement is not the best for us, and the Government should have the honesty to admit it by withdrawing from the Agency or at least answering our objections.  It is no substitute for the energy policies which this country demands.</P>
      <P>On the matter of an oil refinery, a lot has been made about oil refineries and the lack of preparation by the Government, if we do have proven oil deposits and, hopefully, if they prove to be as rich as we anticipate they might be.  I know that every time I stand up I irritate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, and he always prefaces his remarks by saying that if during the course of his contribution, he hurt anybody, he wanted to apologise, but I do not think it is my function to offer apologies in the context of my short contribution to the Parliamentary Secretary; but there is the matter of the Dublin Bay oil refinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unusual for an opposing politician to pay tribute to another politician, but there is one man who does deserve the tributes of the Dáil in an all-party sense for a commitment to an ideal which at the time <Col N="1551" /> nobody thought was achievable but which was and did become achievable. That person is Seán Loftus.  He is a corporator of Dublin Corporation who took upon himself, much to the chagrin or the sneers of some of his opponents, the title &ldquo;Dublin Bay&rdquo;, interposing the &ldquo;Dublin Bay&rdquo; between &ldquo;Seán&rdquo; and &ldquo;Loftus&rdquo;.  I think he changed his name legally by deed poll, but if there is one monument to him and others who have supported him such as the maritime Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party in the context of this situation along the east coast of Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put on the maritime cap?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to pay tribute to Councillor Loftus in this respect, as long as the campaign continues, the campaign in which he led, I think he will be doing a good job for this country and make no mistake about it &mdash;let us not fall into this argument about the numbers of people who would be in employment in whatever refinery might or might not be built in the Dublin Bay area industrial complex.  We all know that in the course of the building of any factory or complex quite a number of people are employed but it is a temporary form of employment.  Technology now puts us in the position that we are living in a push-button industrial era, and, particularly when dealing with oil giants they have the best technology available to them, but we do not want an oil refinery in the Dublin Bay area and for my part I will continue to speak as often as possible against it.  The rumour has it indeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment the Minister and his officials on the obvious amount of work they have done and on the contribution they have made over the past year to this oil agreement.  The significant thing about the motion is that it is the outcome of an oil crisis that started about the end of 1973 resulting in a scarcity of supply plus an increase in price to the consuming countries, which upset greatly the industrial balance throughout the free world.  It is significant that so many countries were able to come together and tackle the problems thus created, problems that were created almost overnight for so many of the industrialised countries.  I do not agree with the views expressed by the last speaker.  The Washington Energy Conference which was held early in 1974 agreed on a formula for international co-operation in the energy sphere and established an energy coordinating group.  This group produced the agreement which so many countries signed in Paris last year.  These included the EEC countries, with one exception, Australia, Canada, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and, of course, the US.  Norway signed later.  It is wrong for anybody <Col N="1553" /> to suggest that we, as a sovereign state, should not have participated in that agreement.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Ministers concerned and their officials for the contribution they made to the successful signing of that agreement.  As a small independent nation with no obvious vested interest, with no pretentions as a world power, we were able to play a role in relation to that agreement that was out of proportion to what the size of our economy would warrant. This is a great tribute to the Ministers and to the civil servants who did such a splendid job throughout the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The agreement must be considered as a very satisfactory outcome in the field of international co-operation, international co-operation that was achieved under pressure.  The one regret is that the EEC were not represented with one voice at these negotiations.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would let us know how we as a nation are responding to the Government's request that we cut back on our oil imports. The campaign in this regard was designed in a way that should have caught the imagination of most of our people.  I should like to hear from the Minister, too, what progress we have achieved in relation to discovering alternative sources of energy, especially in relation to offshore finds.</P>
      <P>I regret that Deputy Andrews saw fit to expound the old policies of the thirties.  An interesting feature of the Opposition's performance this week is that they have decided that this country should not be represented at international forums, at least not for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>In conclusion I might express the hope that our own national energy policy be reviewed.  Perhaps the Minister for Local Government, in regard to applications for the building of high-rise dwellings, would take into account the energy question because such dwellings require more energy than others for heating, cooling, the use of elevators, and so on.  As we have plenty of land for building we should not concentrate on these high-rise dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers from this side of the House who have condemned the effort being made to have this agreement signed formally on behalf of the Government. I have been endeavouring to ascertain whether, in the contribution of the Ministers for Transport and Power and Foreign Affairs, there has been any reference to the situation that affects us at present.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has admitted that he cannot establish the claims he makes in relation to the amount of oil reserves off our shores, although he has stated confidently that the reserves are such as to put us in the position in the near future of being a major international oil supplier. It is in that context that I wish <Col N="1555" /> to develop my remarks on this agreement.</P>
      <P>As has been stressed by Deputy Barrett and others, it is significant that France deliberately opted out of this international agreement.  It appears that this opting out was not done without a great deal of thought.</P>
      <P>A number of my colleagues have referred to our relationship with the US.  We have never had anything but good relations with the US and I hope that nothing said during the course of this debate would interfere with that.  However, the fact remains that the instincts of the Minister for Industry and Commerce are that we are going to be a major oil supplier. I am not always in agreement with the instincts of that Minister but I hope this instinct proves correct.  None of his instincts so far have been correct.  However, I admire the gambler in him to the extent that once in 20 times he may be a winner. Nationally, I am hoping that on this occasion he is a winner.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that despite the amount of time spent on this motion, a motion which the Government through the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, have thrown in as fodder into the Friday business, the Minister for Industry and Commerce who ought to have a major interest in this matter has never contributed.  He has never put into the record of this House the views he is so liberal with when he meets the media, goes on radio, television and attends at Press conferences.  We never got any justification for believing any portion of statements made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He has told us that there is an insufficiency of expertise in the survey section of his Department and because of that he has not been able to get it worked out in a euclid-like fashion.  He is satisfied that the off-shore area of this country is waiting to be properly tapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that he is going through the mechanism of allocating the licences to the responsible people who are going to produce our oil requirements and the requirements of many other industrial <Col N="1556" /> countries.  He hopes this will be done in the near future.  This arises from his study of the stars or his study of the crystal ball.  He is not without support in that regard because there is a growing volume of opinion arising from the North Sea oil discovery, that the Celtic Sea is a tremendous source of oil.  Exploration has been carried on for a period by the Marathon Oil Company in conjunction with Esso. They made certain tappings off the south coast.  All those people led us to believe that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce is correct this Parliament would be voting no confidence in him if we were to endorse this agreement.</P>
    <P>I understand the agreement has been initialled but not signed and that it cannot be signed until it has been approved by this Parliament.  I submit to the Ministers for Transport and Power and Foreign Affairs that it is wrong to ask Parliament to endorse this vote of no confidence in the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to our future oil supply. In the course of his contribution to this debate on 17th April last, as reported at column 1997 of the Official Report, the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated:</P>
    <P>Given that the agreement does, for the first time, make provision to ensure the sharing of information, without which it is impossible to begin to consider what action might need to be taken in respect of these companies;</P>
    <P>How can the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or the Minister for Transport and Power be so determined to embarrass the Irish nation by signing an agreement promising to ensure the sharing of information when the Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us that there are oceans of oil off our shores but he cannot establish it as yet due to the fact that his predecessor did not leave a sufficiency of expertise in the Department?  Obviously, it is also due to the fact that he cannot get the money, because it is not there, to engage that expertise.</P>
    <P>Since this Government took office we had examples of a number of our Ministers apologising at meetings in <Col N="1557" /> Europe for the fact that we were a bit backward.  They did so to such an extent that when we had the privilege and honour of presiding over the affairs of the EEC in the last six months we bent over backwards in ecstasy because there were not major hitches.  This is a wrong approach.  We were led into Europe by a Fianna Fáil Government because Fianna Fáil were conscious that we could take our place with our neighbours in Europe, that we could stand shoulder to shoulder with them.  We are now privy to an agreement that is designed to suit nations other than ours and must, if the beliefs of the Minister for Industry and Commerce are justified, put us at a major disadvantage over the next ten years.  Further down in that speech the Minister for Foreign Affairs, at column 997, in criticising the Opposition's contribution to the debate, said:</P>
    <P>What has not emerged at all from the Opposition speeches is that the agreement is designed to cope with the situation that can arise if there is either a general boycott and reduction in supplies or a discriminatory boycott against particular countries because producer countries dislike their politics.</P>
    <P>In that event there is a necessity for those countries to get together and defend themselves.  I accept that if there was not a scintilla of hope of our being able to develop our own oil resources there would be justification for signing that agreement, and I would personally castigate the Government for not jumping on that bandwagon.  However, that cannot be the situation, unless his colleagues have no confidence at all in the hunches, in the beliefs, in the calculated study made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in upswings and in downturns, unless they want to castigate them as the majority of the people are castigating him at present.  Surely his colleagues should have a little more respect for a man who has not yet been asked to resign by the Taoiseach for his incompetence. Further on in that same speech by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy FitzGerald, made this fascinating point:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1558" /> The merit of this agreement may very well prove to be not that it is brought successfully into play from time to time but that it is never brought into play.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister for Foreign Affairs is hoping that in the event of the dice being thrown by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and turning up constant sevens, there will not be any need for it to be brought into play, but it is taking a very calculated risk in view of the extremely carefully worked-out calculations of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He has obviously put two-and-a-half years of research into this aspect because there is no evidence of his having done anything else.  Therefore we assume that is on reliable information &mdash;there is no doubt that the Geological Survey Office must have information in connection with certain borings and strikes, confidential information which is available to the Minister&mdash; that he makes the confident pronouncement he recently has made. Basing my argument upon the confidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for helping to get me publicity.  There is a point I want to put on record while the Minister for Transport and Power is here.  I have some little knowledge of the use of energy in this country.  Deputy Power and other Deputies have spoken about the use of peat in the generation of energy.  I was for a short while allocated functions in the Department of Transport and Power under the then Minister for Transport and Power, the late President Childers.  At that time my functions included responsibility for the ESB and Bord na Móna.  I have a pronounced interest in Bord na Móna because there is a great deal of Bord na Móna activity in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the crisis which brought about, as the Government see it, the necessity for this International Energy Agreement we were not left stranded. We had the peat powered station from which we were able to generate electricity.  I was intrigued when the board of the ESB clapped itself on the back and were clapped on the back for their foresight for having and maintaining this peat powered station. I say quite categorically from my experience in the Department of Transport and Power that were it not for the persistence of the board of Bord na Móna, with the assistance of the political powers in the Department of Transport and Power, we would not have had a peat powered <Col N="1562" /> station.  Year in, year out the ESB were saying how costly it was becoming to have a peat powered station. I, as Parliamentary Secretary, had a great deal of trouble and eventually had to go to my Minister and to the Government in order to force the situation so that sanction would be given to the second station in Shannonbridge.</P>
    <P>It is only right that credit should go to where credit properly belongs, that is, to the board and officers of Bord na Móna who had to fight, with their heels in the ground, a dogged battle in order that the country should have light in early 1974. Otherwise the country would not have had light because if the ESB had had their way there would not have been an ESB peat powered station anywhere in the country.  I have no hesitation in putting that on record.  I do not see why the ESB should take credit for something that they were trying to kill over a period.</P>
    <P>Now the situation is quite different. Eventually we will have to decide how much our own oil will cost delivered on our shores.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs endeavours to sell to this House the idea that the Oireachtas should approve of this energy motion.  Why? Because he has been associated with the drafting of it.  He does not want to be let down.  He endeavours to inveigle us into agreeing to the motion and agreeing to sign the agreement on the grounds that it may very well prove, not that it is brought successfully into play from time to time, but that it may never be brought into play.  That statement is from the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has made many hasty statements in his time but who is always given credit for having put a great deal of thought into his statements.  This was a statement made in this House after due consideration.  The best he could say on this motion is: &ldquo;For goodness sake, lads, there is no fear.&rdquo;  It would be wrong to put words into his mouth that he did not say but he thought the best selling point for this agreement at that stage was that it may very well prove to be, not that it is <Col N="1563" /> brought successfully into play from time to time but that it is never brought into play: it may very well be that the great success of the agreement and one that will make it prove to be found worth while is the fact that it becomes in a sense a dead letter, that it may never be needed.</P>
    <P>There is an international agreement being solemnly proposed to be signed by our Minister for Foreign Affairs with the Agreement of the Minister for Transport and Power who is responsible for energy and it is being justified on the grounds that it may never have to be brought into play.  That is the way in which this agreement is being sold to us by people who regularly over a period of 16 years described the Fianna Fáil Government as a gambler's Government.</P>
    <P>We are in the unfortunate situation that the Minister for Finance is going with his battered bag around the Middle East and the only security that he can offer to hock is publicity circulated by the Government Information Service on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the effect that having studied the upswings and downswings, the upturns and downturns, there is a good chance that we will strike oil.</P>

At 10.20 p.m. yesterday he told me that we would have the Wealth Tax Bill.  I presume we could get more time if I said that I would let the Minister in to make his contribution.  I am saving the Government the embarrassment of the Minister for Transport and Power coming in to remake the mess he made in his June speech.  There is enough on the record.  I am sparing the Minister the further embarrassment of publicising that he has not read page 80 or page 67 of the agreement that has been initialled on his behalf but that we are trying to prevent him from signing so that this country will not be sold out. I, for one, am willing to put my money <Col N="1564" /> on the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Maybe, for once, he may be right.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the draft of the Elections of Conservators (Postponement) Order, 1975, which was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 16th of June, 1975.</P>
      <P>Under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, as amended by the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1962, elections to boards of conservators are scheduled to be held every five years but the elections due to take place in October, 1974 were, in accordance with the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1974, postponed to 1975 or such later year as may be fixed by order.  I now propose to make an order postponing these elections to 1976.</P>
      <P>I had hoped, when introducing the Fisheries Amendment Bill last year, that by now fresh legislation would have been enacted to improve the constitution of boards of conservators and the system of election of members. I decided, however, that before introducing amending legislation I should await the final report of the Inland Fisheries Commission which has been examining all facets of inland fisheries so that, if the commission had additional proposals in regard to boards of conservators and any such proposals were found to be desirable, the proposed legislation could be enlarged to provide for all the changes that were required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main objection to the existing arrangement under which elections to boards of conservators are held centres around the constitution of the boards and the voting system by which members are elected.  It was envisaged that the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission would have been received sufficiently early to enable the amending legislation to <Col N="1566" /> be enacted so that the elections due to take place in October, 1975 could be held under the revised system. This objective was not achieved but I am pleased to say that the report has just reached me.  It is a very exhaustive report and will require very careful study over the next few months.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the chairman and the members of the commission for the hard work they have put into the task assigned to them.  I should also like to record appreciation for the work in the conservation and protection of our fisheries which has been accomplished by the boards of conservators over the years and the service which has been provided by the members of the boards on a completely voluntary basis.  I am confident the members of the boards will be prepared to continue to do so for a further year.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend to the House that a resolution be passed approving of the draft order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year my party accepted the postponement of the election of members to the various boards of conservators.  We expressed disappointment that the Minister found it necessary to bring in the order at that time.  We are very disappointed that he finds it necessary to ask us again to extend the order for a further period.</P>
      <P>I agree that the boards of conservators in their limited way have contributed a great deal to the conservation of stocks but it is necessary to have some urgent thinking and planning in relation to the question of boards of conservators and our waters throughout the country.  Many Deputies who spoke last year expressed this opinion.  It can be said more forcibly this year that it is necessary to have some very positive thinking in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers of the boards of conservators relate to fish but they are very limited.  They work with very limited staff and they are badly paid. The finance of the boards in general is not geared to doing a job which is very necessary from many points of view.  When one considers the way <Col N="1567" /> water is being used at the present time, it is necessary to introduce some Bill which will govern the use of water and also deal with conservation.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that in England a river authority covers all aspects of the use of water.  In my county we have had the experience in the last year of a textile company setting up a large industry necessitating the use of millions of gallons of water from one of the best trout lakes in the country.</P>
    <P>We have also the situation where it is proposed to have two regional water schemes for two of our biggest towns based on Lough Mask which is, perhaps, the best trout lake in the country.  In matters like this it is essential to have an overall plan to ensure that various interests are catered for and, at the same time, tha stocks of fish will be maintained at the highest possible level.  There is an inclination to use our rivers and lakes as amenities for local people apart from their importance from the point of view of tourism.  From every point of view there is a certain urgency about setting up an overall authority to handle the question of the proper use of our waters.  This is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>The powers of the conservators are limited.  Pollution is a problem and this could be dealt with if we had some kind of authority to handle such matters.  In Britain the boards are representative of a variety of interests.  Industrialists and developers have to have sanction if they are using any quantity of water or building in close proximity to water.  All steps are taken to safeguard stocks of fish.  I hope the Minister and his Department will move quickly to ensure practical steps of this kind are taken here.</P>
    <P>The report of the Inland Fisheries Commission covers many aspects and I hope that report will not be left on the shelf, so to speak.  I trust that worth-while suggestions will be acted on.  I had experience of the working of this Commission and I can honestly say it would be hard to find a more <Col N="1568" /> dedicated body of people who worked on the compilation of this report.</P>
    <P>We accept this order though we are not altogether happy about it.  This year has been rather unfortunate from the point of view of salmon. Because of the drought all the fish are not getting up the river.  Professional poachers are cashing in on this unfortunate situation and valuable stocks are in danger.  We need legislation and personnel to act against poachers.</P>
    <P>We also have the unhappy situation in which certain people claim rights to certain stretches of water.  The rivers should be there for the benefit of the people generally.  We should get away from the old system that has operated for so many years.  Indeed, these people fish in a manner which I would describe as illegal. They use traps and nets.  There is shameful destruction of stocks.  This should not be allowed to continue. A great deal of noise is made about drift net fishermen.  These men fish in open sea and it is well known that salmon do not mesh except during certain hours of darkness.  Drift net fishermen have about four hours in which to catch fish.  The season from 8th June to the end of July is the time when the ordinary run takes place.  The men are not allowed to fish over weekends.  One can easily see that they have in all about 20 nights during which to fish.  The experience is that salmon mesh better on a night when there is a bit of a breeze and the sea is choppy.  Whether or not the men should go out on a night like that is debatable.</P>
    <P>It is time the heat was taken off the drift net fishermen and the emphasis placed where it should be on the slaughter taking place in the rivers.  I believe the biggest culprits very often are the rod and line men. There is a tradition that salmon go up river in pairs, that male and female go up the river together and spawn at a certain time.  It can be argued that a rod-and-line man breaks up a partnership when he catches a salmon.  It can also be argued that <Col N="1569" /> with a rod and line more male than female fish can be taken out of a river.  That upsets the mating pattern by reducing the number of fish spawning in the river.  It is time we took the heat off the drift net fishermen and laid the emphasis where the real damage is done to salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>We have a wonderful potential here.  A great deal of money and planning are needed to develop the industry. We must have an overall plan. The present system of having a small board of conservators doing a job based on an Act passed about 100 years ago is not relevant to what we have to face today.  For that reason I would urge the Minister to ask his Department to produce a plan speedily for the development of our fisheries and of our rivers and lakes as amenities for our people.  This would be worth while.  We have mountain streams and rivers which could be developed and stocked with trout and other fish.  This would provide employment and reduce the need to some extent to bring in foreign industrialists.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but he will appreciate the measure before the House is very limited in scope.  It deals with the postponement of the election of conservators.  The Deputy is embarking on a very wide ranging debate on fisheries as a whole.  I have given him some latitude, but I should like him to relate his remarks to the Elections of Conservators (Postponement) Order, 1975.</P>

      <P>I may have gone a little off course but I think what I had been saying is related to conservation and to the matter before us.  I hope this is the last time we will be asked to renew this order.  We will expect from the Minister and the Department in the near future some new planning and thinking on the development of our rivers and lakes and the conservation of our fishing stocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary introduced the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1974, I expressed reservations about the provision in the <Col N="1570" /> Bill whereby he could bring in an order again postponing the election of conservators for a further period.  I am disappointed that since last year he has done absolutely nothing in relation to inland fisheries.  He did not bring forward legislation to deal with this very important subject.  I am disappointed that the elections are again being postponed.  Do we assume that this time next year he will bring in another order extending the period for a further year to 1977 or is it definite that the elections will be held in 1976?</P>
      <P>I can understand the Parliamentary Secretary's difficulty in not having available to him the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission but I understand the Minister has now got the report.  I do not think it has been published.  The Government cannot shuffle off their responsibility for inland fisheries on to a commission or anybody else.  They are responsible for introducing legislation dealing with fisheries.</P>
      <P>There are very good boards of conservators and some of them are very big.  The Limerick fishery board covers the whole area from Carrickon-Shannon to Loop Head and touches about 13 of the 26 counties. They have been severely restricted under the Conservation Act in dealing with the problems which arise. When rivers are polluted the board have no power to sue for compensation for damage done to fisheries. This is a serious fault in the Consolidation Act.  Overnight immense damage can be done and thousands of salmon and trout can be destroyed and the board have no power to sue the people responsible.  The Parliamentary Secretary should look into this very closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The boards of conservators have been working fairly well and fairly effectively over the past few years under very stringent financial control. When they send their estimates to the Department they are cut back severely and therefore they are severely restricted in the job they are elected to do.  The Parliamentary Secretary should introduce legislation which will provide proper financial <Col N="1571" /> support for whatever boards are elected.  These boards are doing a magnificent job under strict financial control.  They would do a much better job if a proper financial commitment were made by the Government to them.  The senior executives of the boards are elected on a yearly basis. There is no superannuation scheme in operation.  They have no pension rights.  They receive no gratuity of any kind.  All along the line, from executive officers of boards of conservators, through senior inspectors, down to waterkeepers, there is no security of employment.  Executive officers work on a year-to-year basis and waterkeepers are employed weekly.  In this day and age surely there should be some security for people who work so hard and so dedicatedly.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to bring in legislation as soon as possible to regularise the situation of the inland fisheries and to ensure that there will be some security for employees of boards.  Such legislation, I can assure him, will have the full support of every Member of the House.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary thinks about the present system of voting, which is carried out by licensed fishermen. Outside of nominations, there are <i>ex officio</i> officers.  I do not think there is very much wrong with the present system but I suggest that more elected representatives be appointed to boards of conservators.  I am disappointed that the Department are not tackling this problem in a more constructive way.  They seem to be satisfied to shove off the problems attached to inland fisheries to a fishery commission and to everybody else.  Deputy Gallagher has very aptly described the situation, and I will not go over the same ground.  I hope that in the next 12 months the Department will get down to tackling all the problems in relation to inland fisheries and have legislation presented to the House which will have the full support of every Member, instead of having these year-to-year orders postponing the elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Daly.  I served in the Dublin area as a conservator and I am disappointed at this further postponement of the elections which exemplifies our whole attitude to our inland fisheries.  There is an air of despondency and doom about inland fisheries, and this further postponement of the elections does nothing to dispel that attitude.</P>
      <P>Time is running out for us in the matter of conservation of our salmon fisheries.  We must deal swiftly with this matter.  As Deputy Daly said in regard to the manner in which conservators are elected, I think the system deserves to be studied very carefully to ensure that the new boards will have public representatives elected to them.  We do not so much require experts on these boards as thoroughly dedicated representatives such as we have had in many of the existing boards.</P>
      <P>One reads in the newspapers of people who are violating every fishery law in existence.  We need something new and revolutionary to preserve our fish stocks.  This is the only capital city in Europe&mdash;I exclude Galway, of course&mdash;which has a salmon-bearing river going through its centre, with tributaries such as the Dodder, and we should do everything possible, by every means, to ensure that salmon stocks are preserved in it. Because of action taken by the local authorities in Dublin, we are ensuring that the waters of the Liffey and its tributaries will be much cleaner. Deputy Gallagher mentioned our prodigality in the use of water&mdash;every Dublin citizen uses 50 gallons per day for his personal use.  Perhaps we are either very clean or very wasteful. There may be an intermediate explanation, and one must pay tribute to the co-operation of Dublin city and county people during the recent water shortage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that in the preparation of legislation the Minister will look very hard at private fisheries.  I will not use any of the clichés about nationalisation and all that, but this is a big question which must be given the utmost consideration.  We must ensure that private fisheries will conform <Col N="1573" /> to our regulations on conservation of fish stocks and not engage, as some of them have been doing, in taking as many fish as possible from the water.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher asked the Minister to take the heat off the netmen. They have been criticised in the past for their prodigality in catching salmon and in their general attitude towards conservation of stocks.  There are two forms of damage being done, one by people who are not fishermen and who catch salmon by illegal means, and the other by pollution. For all those reasons, I hope Deputy Daly is incorrect when he forecasts that the Minister will not come in soon with legislation to cover all these matters.  We all hope that the elections will not be postponed further. Time is running out if we are to conserve our fisheries.  The importance of our salmon exports, in particular, cannot be over-stressed when we read the latest figures the effect of which is that the levy on salmon exports was more than £13,000.  It shows the contribution our salmon fisheries make to our economy.</P>
    <P>Dublin salmon fisheries go back to the time of Henry II of England.  One can read that when Henry VIII was short of money he did not put on a tax as we would.  He never heard of VAT.  He used to tax salmon exports from this country, putting a tax on each salmon exported, and did quite well from it.  I mention that as an historical aspect.  It would be frightful if we were to preside over the liquidation of our salmon fisheries which have gone on that we know of for at least 800 years on a fairly organised basis.  The Minister should be very careful indeed to ensure that the legislation is not merely going to elect boards of conservators but that the legislation promised will ensure that our inland fisheries are protected and developed in the interests of the people generally and that we will not allow by our inaction the decay to any further degree of this great national asset.  When the Minister brings forward his legislation, he can be sure that we on this side will give <Col N="1574" /> every possible help to the provision of legislative machinery to ensure that not alone will our inland fisheries be protected but they will be developed and conserved.</P>
    <P>If we let Conservation Year go by without making any great contribution to the cleanliness and purity of our rivers, let us make up for it now before time has taken its toll.  I hope the Minister will urge everybody concerned to avoid any further loss of time in giving us this Bill which we look forward to having and which we hope we will have before we have seen the last salmon go up or down the Liffey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise for the absence of the Parliamentary Secretary, who is fulfilling an important engagement today and could not be here.  I think he was looking forward to being here because his knowledge of the fishing industry is much more up to date than mine and much more intimate.  That is not to say that I am completely in the dark about the subject, because for some years when I was spokesman on fisheries on the Opposition benches I had to become familiar with the industry generally, and I still continue to take an interest in it.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who have spoken for their appreciation of the reason why we are asking for a further postponement of these elections.  While disappointment has been expressed by all Deputies that this was necessary, I think they fully appreciate and accept that it was the right decision.  Deputies who have spoken have all in their own ways spoken with special knowledge and one might say, inside knowledge&mdash; Deputy Gallagher who was a member of the commission, Deputy Healy who as far as I know is a member of one of the boards and Deputy Moore who has had his own experience.  In this way I can appreciate what they know about it and how they are so reasonable about the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that as the law stands at the moment the life of the boards cannot be continued beyond another <Col N="1575" /> year.  We could of course bring in legislation to change that position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but that is the present position, and I would not like to feel that it was our intention to bring in such legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher particularly will know that the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission has been delivered only in the last week.  It is a very sizeable report.  I can claim to have read only about half of it but I hope to be able to finish it this weekend. I must say that what I have read of it is extremely interesting.  It is obviously a very comprehensive report and there is no disagreement between us as to what should be our approach to the further development of the inland fisheries in the future.</P>
      <P>My own inclinations are exactly those proposed and spoken of by the members who have dealt with the matter.  I think there is an enormous potential here and we have only tapped it.  There are so many things that can be done and should be done which I agree with and can see, but it would be very foolish for us at this stage when we have this very comprehensive report to be making decisions now.  Deputy Gallagher said that urgent thinking and planning were needed.  There is an urgency about it, I have no doubt, but it would be quite impossible within a year to provide for the extremely comprehensive reorganisation that is required and have that all built into one piece of legislation and to put all the people into the places they should be in.  I see the urgency, and we have the blueprint and should be able to condense this and know what our intentions in the future are, and then we should do the most urgent matters as quickly as it is possible to to do them, and I would say that within a year we should take urgent action but we should have a phased sort of development in mind.  If we are going to rush this and try to get it all in in the first effort, we are going to disimprove rather than improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> There seemed to be an attitude expressed by Deputy Daly that there was a concern on the part of the Government to shuffle off, as he said, their responsibility to a Fisheries Commission.  Deputy Daly knows that it was the previous Fianna Fáil Government who set up the commission. I think they did the right thing.  There was a very big job to be done here, and the very fact that it has taken so long to do indicates that there was a big job.  All the interests were represented on this, and because of its size, among other things, it was difficult to reach agreement.  This is a good reason for waiting for the report and for postponing the election and that I think is accepted by all concerned. I do not know whether it is right or proper to widen the scope of this debate, but I think that in the way it was dealt with we have not over-widened it.  There was concern expressed about the limited scope and powers of the existing boards, and when looking at re-organisation we should have regard to these limitations and ensure that when the new boards are set up we will not be confronted with the same limitations.  I am not sure that it is proper for me to go into the various matters raised because I think the Chair rather objected to the distance Deputy Gallagher went in his description of how damage is done.  He is very anxious obviously to absolve the drift netters, so to speak, for any of this damage.</P>
    <P>The only thing I say in relation to that is that one of the figures I remember from glancing at the report is that the drift netters take 72 per cent of the total catch of salmon, and in taking that 72 per cent there is an enormous scope for damaging stocks. Much more damage will be done if, when salmon are &ldquo;running&rdquo; and mating on their way up river, a rod fisherman takes one of the partners. There is much damage done in the rivers but it would be wrong to say that drift netting plays no part in this, to say that it is sufficient that there are limitations of four hours and 20 nights in respect of drift-net fishing because those limitations, unfortunately, <Col N="1577" /> are not being observed.  It is well known that there is day-time fishing.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the conditions under which the staffs of the boards are employed are unacceptable.  In this regard I can tell the Deputy that there is legislation in train for the purpose of improving those conditions. Among the improvements will be the provision of a pension scheme. When we get down to the general re-organisation of the situation, I trust it will be very much improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,332,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce including certain services administered by that Office, and for <Col N="1578" /> payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary mainly to enable payment to be made of the subsidies on bread and also on flour and wheatenmeal which the Minister for Finance announced in his financial statement on 26th June, 1975.  I am also availing of this opportunity to include the provision of additional funds for some services under my Department's Vote&mdash;for the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, for science and technology, for the shipbuilding subsidy payable to Verolme Cork Dockyard Limited and for post office services, the excess expenditure on which it would not have been possible to have foreseen when the original estimates were in the course of preparation.</P>
    <P>The amount needed under the heading of Post Office services is small&mdash;£12,000.  The need for this increase arises because of increased telephone postal charges since the Estimate was prepared but apart from the price increases <i>per se</i> there was also an extension of service in relation to the priceline mechanism whereby offices were set up in a number of parts of the country as well as in Dublin where people could obtain immediate information in regard to the whole area of prices and in regard to the courses of action open to them.</P>
    <P>Regarding the shipbuilding subsidy, the original Estimate was for £50,000 but there is an increase sought of £20,000.  This is a subsidy which is payable to the Verolme Cork Dockyard. The reason for this increase is that there had been a contract at fixed charge but because of rapidly escalating costs there was a loss on this contract.  The object of the subsidy is to reduce that loss.  In this instance the loss on the vessel in question was greater than the subsidy but the excess of loss is being carried by the company.</P>
    <P>Under subhead P, the original Estimate was £40,000, whereas the revised estimate is £100,000 so that an additional sum of £60,000 is required. This relates to the funding of the National Development Association in <Col N="1579" /> connection with the cost of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  The continuing decline in the share of the Irish market which is being accounted for by Irishmade goods during the past few years has been of considerable concern to the Government.  If we recall the CIO Report of 1961, we will note that it was anticipated that as we moved out of an era of protection and into an era of free trade there would be a severe threat to the share of the home market which was enjoyed by certain industries in circumstances of protection. In 1972 the COIP Report indicated that in the ensuing time there were already the beginnings of the effects of the EFTA agreement and, consequently, that there was this threat to our home market.  I do not think that the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign is more than a small contribution to the solution of the whole problem but it is, nonetheless, a useful one.  We are buying too large a percentage of goods emanating from outside this economy in substitution for goods which could be produced at home.  I am not suggesting that the reasons for this are simple, and I do not propose to analyse them now, but it is a trend which has increased in recent years.  It is a trend which is important for some of our more traditional and labour intensive industries.</P>
    <P>The present difficult economic circumstances indicate that the largest possible share of total consumption should be met from indigenous production. Where Irish goods are available in many sectors and where jobs are at risk from competing imports it is important that we, as the slogan says: &ldquo;Put our money where our jobs are.&rdquo;  It is important that we purchase the largest possible percentage of Irish goods.  We have had a number of campaigns in the past, some of them more successful than others&mdash;I am not criticising past efforts&mdash;but none of them have had a sustained success.  It is important that we get a new campaign going which would genuinely look in depth not just at consumer outlets but at other purchasing sectors and at fundamental social attitudes.  It was to <Col N="1580" /> get that message across to our society that I decided to set up the working group for the promotion and sale of Irish goods.</P>
    <P>I recently accepted the recommendations of that working group.  Of the number of recommendations the specific symbol to identify Irish quality goods is perhaps one of the more immediate and obvious ones. The promotion of information seminars and information communication of all kinds by lectures, the use of the media and the monitoring of market trends are also recommended.  This trade and consumer service is useful. It is at present being operated at a scale by the National Development Association and it is proposed to extend that.  There are other lines of activity about which I will not take up the time of the House by dealing with them now.  The amount provided for the National Development Association for 1975 is £40,000.  It is proposed to increase this amount by a further £60,000 to cover the new and intensified activities now being promoted by the working group.</P>
    <P>In the matter of science and technology&mdash;subhead U&mdash;the increase is from £300,000 to £400,000.  This has recently become the responsibility of my Department.  In addition there is an extra £100,000 which has the function of maintaining the momentum of the university research grants and also the University Industry Co-operation Schemes.  I attach particular importance to the latter.  It is also to initiate co-ordinated programmes in the areas of marine science, energy, environment, scientific and technological information and biology health protection.  If the House wishes I can give more information on this matter. In a time of difficulty it is a limited extra expenditure in the area of science and technology; I wish it was more.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the matter of subsidies.  A subsidy will be payable on bread which is controlled in price at the equivalent of 5½p per 800 gm loaf.  It will absorb an increase of 1½p per 800 gm loaf which had been applied for by the bakers some time ago and was recently approved <Col N="1581" /> by me.  The overall result will be a reduction of 4p in the current retail cost of the standard 800 gm loaf, with <i>pro rata</i> adjustments on the other loaf sizes.  The subsidy on flour will permit a reduction of 4½p per kilo at retail level in the price of flour and wheaten meal intended for domestic use.</P>
    <P>The decision to limit the subsidy to bread which is subject to control under Maximum Prices Order, and to flour and wheaten meal for domestic use, was made in the interests of getting the maximum possible benefit to the consumer and to help to ensure that none of the funds being provided under this are diverted away from the prime intention for the subsidisation of either non-essential or luxury products.  It is hoped to have both of these subsidies in operation and to have the price of bread and flour for domestic use reduced in about two weeks' time.  Those subsidies, bread and wheaten meal, are under separate subheads, subheads W1 and W2.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the increased expenditure is £6,442,000 but there is an offset of savings of £110,000 made up as follows: £80,000 in subhead I2 &mdash;Industrial Development Authority &mdash;Capital Expenditure; £20,000 in subhead J2&mdash;Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited grants to industrialists and £10,000 on subhead I1&mdash;administrative and general expenses for the Industrial Development Authority.  When that £110,000 is deducted the net Supplementary Estimate runs out at £6,332,000.  I commend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to most if not all of the proposed increased expenditure in this Supplementary Estimate.  However, the Chair will notice that there are two Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Industry and Commerce on the Order Paper and there is no differentiation between them.  I understand that one of them is a £10 token estimate and the other is that which is under discussion.  I take it that it is not open to us to discuss the £10 token estimate at present and that is <Col N="1582" /> unfortunate because the projects on which this additional money is being spent are limited in scope.  At this time there are matters of tremendous importance taking place in relation to the whole sphere of industry and commerce.  The development of natural resources is an obvious one, but there is also the important development yesterday in Brussels about which no official announcement was made.  A decision was made at 5 p.m. yesterday, under the written procedure, by the Commission to give Ireland certain rights under Article 135 of the Accession Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that although I have not seen the statement.  These are matters of tremendous importance, much more so than the somewhat subsidiary matters which are dealt with in this limited supplementary estimate.  The bulk of the estimate is devoted to bread and flour subsidies.  It is worth recalling, as I did during the debate on the budget, the views of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and of his Parliamentary Secretary in relation to subsidies when these were suggested by members of my party some six months ago on a number of motions as a possible method of dealing with the appalling price increase situation which we have now and have had for some time past.</P>
      <P>The suggestions in relation to subsidies were pooh-poohed by the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary. I quoted what they said in the course of my speech on the budget debate and I do not think it is necessary to quote them again, but they are there in the December debate on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that in general the principle of subsidies was wrong because the taxpayer would have to pay for them in the long run.  We have here&mdash;and these are only two items &mdash;subsidies that amount to something in excess of £6 million on bread and flour alone.  One might well ask the Minister now: is the taxpayer paying <Col N="1583" /> for this?  Apparently the answer is that he is not; this subsidy is being paid for by simply adding approximately £6 million to the deficit on the current budget.  I would have thought arguments which the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary themselves put up in relation to subsidies some months ago would, if they were valid then, be equally valid now.  Perhaps the Minister feels that the arguments against subsidies were valid six months ago when they were suggested from this side of the House, but for some reason there has been a change in the intervening time and subsidies are valid today.</P>
    <P>I am not to be taken from this as criticising the fact of the subsidy because, as everyone is aware, they were suggested by this party in 1974, but it is a bit disturbing to find the actual position in relation to the prices of the various commodities which are now being subsidised.  To take the one we are principally concerned with here, bread, the subsidy, we are told, would allow a reduction of 5½p in the price of a standard loaf of bread.  On the very day, or possibly the day after that subsidy was announced, an increase of 1½p in the price of bread was approved by the Minister and that increase, I think, was one of those in the May report of the National Prices Commission, which was just published a day or two ago and which contained 19 pages of price increases, which, of course, are no longer published and the great majority of the public do not know what they are.  The last 19 pages consisting of price increases authorised by the Minister included, for example, one in hospital charges which in some instances amount to 329 per cent.  Therefore, before a subsidy has come into operation at all perhaps 30 per cent of it is eaten up in a price increase.</P>
    <P>There is in this Prices Commission report a survey of the bakery industry which I read last night with some interest.  It is not very hopeful about the future of that industry.  It does not regard the industry as being a very well organised one.  The figures <Col N="1584" /> it gives in relation to losses incurred by bakeries are disturbing, almost staggering.  I wonder, in fact, that bakeries have been able to continue in existence over the past six months or so in the light of the figures disclosed here in the National Prices Commission report.  I think it is fair to draw the conclusion from the report that the bakery industry is in very serious financial difficulty and the likelihood is that there will be further increases in the price of bread in order to try to keep these firms in existence.  The subsidy of 5½p, of which we have already lost 1½p, will be completely eaten up, perhaps as soon as the end of this year, and the public will very quickly begin to forget that the subsidy was ever introduced.</P>
    <P>We have had an example also in relation to the price of milk.  There was a subsidy of 2p per pint announced with a fanfare of trumpets in the budget debate at the end of June, and we were told the price of milk would immediately be reduced from 8p to 6p per pint, and on 1st July a ministerial order was made listing the price of milk for the month of July at 8p per pint.  I do not know whether the price would have been 10p if the subsidy had not been introduced, but certainly anybody who believed that there would be a reduction of 2p in the price of the pint of milk as a result of the budget announcement was very seriously misled. We fear that the same may be true not just in relation to bread and flour but in relation to various other commodities mentioned in the budget as being due for price reductions.  One example of that was the proposal to take VAT off fuel, that is 6.75 per cent.  Of course, on the very day it was taken off, 1st July, there was an increase of about 18 per cent in the price of turf briquettes.</P>

      <P>We are confined, Sir, in more than one way, unfortunately, these days.  We are confined in time, scope and everything else.  It is almost a privilege, I suppose, for an elected Member of this House to be able to stand up and speak on any topic that is given to him nowadays, that he is not guillotined out of existence.  We have £6,500,000 additional public money being spent here. We are graciously given an hour-anda-half in which to discuss it apart from whatever time the Minister would use up in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the supplementary amount of £60,000 that is being given to the National Development Association for a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, I want to congratulate the Minister on the complete change of view and attitude he has now achieved in relation to this, because I recall, in particular, last year on an Estimate for this Department, Deputy Lalor making a very strong plea for a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign that would have meaning and teeth.  He was fobbed off at the time and told by the Minister that at the end of November they were bringing in a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign which was well thought-out, well documented, well plotted and planned.  What happened in the month of December so far as the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign was concerned was only a bit of a joke.  It lasted in a very half-hearted fashion for about ten days and came to an abrupt end.  It never really existed as a campaign.  Apparently it was given no money to carry out its functions and it had no option but to fold up.  I think it is fair to say it did more harm than good in the way it was forced to collapse at such an early stage.  I think the Minister at the time indicated his view that it was doubtful if the EEC would be keen on one country promoting its own goods at the expense of others.  I do not know whether that is the view of the EEC but, if it is, it is not a view they are entitled to hold, because this <Col N="1586" /> country most certainly should be entitled to promote its own goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy give me a reference to my believing that?  I do not accept that I said that. I said they were certainly things that you would have to look out for in a country trying to promote its own goods, but not all in the blanket way in which the Deputy has said it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House find it impossible to understand why at a time when Irish industry was probably going through the most difficult period ever known since this country achieved its independence no effort should have been made by the Government until today to promote a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign of any real value or worth at all. An enormous contribution could have been made to maintaining employment in this country if over the past few years when we needed it as never before there had been a genuine &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  One of the reasons for the problems of the Irish footwear industry at the present time is that the proportion of the domestic market which is being supplied by imports is growing very rapidly each year.  The footwear industry would not at all be in the terrible predicament it is in at the present moment if a campaign had been mounted over the past year or so, a genuine, serious campaign, to try to encourage people to buy Irish rather than imported products.</P>
      <P>The figures are there to show the proportion of the home market being met by domestic production falling each year and falling most seriously in the last two years in particular. Unfortunately, nothing was done in regard to that or in regard to many forms of textile and clothing which are produced here but where the import figures continue to rise at a very serious and, indeed, alarming rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We get no details, unfortunately, in the speech of the Minister today about the form that this new &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign will take, but I hope that on this occasion, unlike the last occasion, it will be well planned, that <Col N="1587" /> it will be adequately financed and that it will be seen through over a reasonable period and not forced to collapse as it was after about 10 days or so on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>It is worth while recalling and I quote, in fact, his reference in the House during the debate of last December, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce told the House that the December, 1974 campaign was well planned and well thought out and was going to be effective.  In fact, it turned out to be a complete flop and a joke, as everyone knows.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister and to the Working Group of the NDA who are involved in this that they might well consider endeavouring to promote this campaign this time on a regional rather than a national basis. To direct a campaign such as this simply from Dublin by one committee does not give it the local community impact which it should have and which it will need to have if it is to be successful.  At least one full-time officer should be employed in each of the IDA regions, of which there are eight in the country, to promote at local level in co-operation with local businessmen and people who have a stake in the local community in each region a serious effort to persuade the public to buy Irish and to persuade the retail and wholesale outlets to push Irish products as a matter of national loyalty as much as anything else.  Because, so serious has our economic situation become, with mounting imports of goods that can be and are being produced here but are not being purchased here, that it is becoming important for our very national survival that we make a serious conscious effort&mdash;all of us&mdash;to purchase Irish goods on every possible occasion that it is open to us to do it.</P>
    <P>The Government should regard the purchase of domestically produced goods in lieu of imported goods as being on a par with exports, in fact, because in practice that is what the avoidance of imports by the purchase of Irish-made goods amounts to. Some scheme or system might well be worked out whereby some form of encouragement on the lines of the <Col N="1588" /> encouragement given to exporters will be given to those who would or could produce goods here that would otherwise have had to be imported.</P>
    <P>I know that our home market is very small.  Nonetheless, for a long time it was able to support a lot of industries in various sectors and to keep tens of thousands of people in employment many of whom in the last year or two either have lost their employment or are on short time or are in danger of losing their employment or are feeling insecure in their employment at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is an additional figure of £100,000 made available for science and technology, and the Minister has stated that it would be used to initiate co-ordinated programmes in the areas of marine science, energy, environment, scientific and technological information and Biology Health Protection. This opens up a very important field of activity, in one of which I am afraid we have lagged behind to some extent over the past couple of years when it became evident that we have considerable national resources in our off-shore areas which hopefully we will be able to develop and exploit in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his announcement of the grant of exclusive prospecting and exploitation licences to a number of consortia in relation to off-shore oil and gas made it, and very properly so, a condition of the issue of some of these licences that funds would be made available for the training of Irish people in the various new sciences and technologies that are associated with the development of off-shore resources.  It was not clear from the Minister's statement whether the training of Irish residents in these new sciences and technologies would take place in Irish universities or similar institutions or would take place abroad.  I suppose in the very short term it will be necessary to send people abroad, but the Minister should use the sort of money mentioned here and the money that will become available from the various consortia to whom licences have been granted to endow various chairs in Irish universities and in institutes <Col N="1589" /> of higher technology in this country to make available the necessary training to the large number of Irish people who hopefully will be in a position to benefit from the developments of our off-shore resources.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to emphasise that this will have to be done very quickly, because we see now in various parts of the country, particularly in the Cork area, the beginnings of developments associated with off-shore development, the provision of services in and around Cork harbour for the developments that are taking place there and, hopefully, shortly there will be developments in other parts of the country in relation to this.</P>
    <P>I would recommend very strongly to the Minister that he and the Government would ensure that the various supporting developments in relation to our off-shore resources which will have to be set up over the next few years will not be allowed to congregate, as it were, in one area. At the moment the indications are that Cork may well be the principal if not almost the sole place where all these developments seem to be taking place.  That would be wrong for a variety of reasons, not the least of which would be the interests of Cork and the citizens of Cork city and county.  In other countries there has been too much development in one place to the detriment of others.  The Norwegians have endeavoured to spread this sort of development along their coasts and have tried to force companies to provide various on-shore facilities in parts of their country that are well north of where the great bulk of the population lives. Britain realised this rather later in the day than the Norwegians did, but efforts are now being made by them to prevent the congregation in one or two areas of all the development which is associated with off-shore exploration and exploitation of oil and gas.</P>
    <P>I have in mind, in particular, several of the blocks which are being designated by the Minister in the licences given to some of the consortia recently, particularly blocks <Col N="1590" /> around the area of what is known as the Porcupine Bank, which is due west of Slyne Head.  It is important that counties like Galway and Mayo should be in a position to provide the necessary on-shore facilities that will be needed when exploration and exploitation takes place in the area of those designated blocks.</P>
    <P>So far as the ship building subsidy is concerned the amount is small and I am not aware of what contract it applies to.  I certainly have no objection to it, because the Verolme dockyard in Cork has proved to be a very valuable industry in the Cork area. As I said, at the outset of my remarks, I regard it as unfortunate that the House is not allowed to discuss the matters of great importance which should be taking place at the moment in relation to the whole sphere of industry and commerce, in particular the efforts of the EEC to protect in some small way Irish industry and the most important thing of all, from the point of view of this country, the general development of our off-shore natural resources.</P>
    <P>I hoped we would have had the opportunity to have a general debate on Industry and Commerce but unhappily that does not seem to be possible.  The imposition of a guillotine at any time, as has so often been said, is a very serious matter, but to impose it in such a way that the discussion of such matters of tremendous national importance for us is either very much curtailed or else totally ruled out is highly unsatisfactory.  At this time the sort of things we should be talking about, so far as Industry and Commerce are concerned, is what we will do in relation to oil and gas off-shore resources.  We should be talking about the provision of infrastructure and training in relation to those matters, the social effects they will have on certain parts of the country, and what the long-term strategy should be in relation to the exploitation of these resources.</P>
    <P>These are matters I would like to hear the Minister speaking on at some length.  I would like to consider his remarks and make my own remarks. Unfortunately, we find that none of <Col N="1591" /> that is allowed.  The time, available is a derisory period of one-and-a-half hours for this Supplementary Estimate, and because several more Deputies want to speak I will conclude my remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I welcome the additional money allocated for a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. It is necessary and desirable, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, to get people to buy Irish goods.  It is the same as controlling our imports.  It is sad to think that we have to promote such a campaign.  People should have enough pride in what is produced in the country without the Government having to spend large sums of money in promoting the purchase of Irish goods.  This is probably a throw-back to the time when we had highly protected industries and some of them produced shoddy goods.  People lost respect for the type of articles produced and this had a detrimental effect on Irish manufactured goods.</P>
      <P>The sooner we get this campaign off the ground the better because of the position of unemployment.  There are many ways in which to do this, but I believe in the long term we will have to highlight to our people that what is produced in the country is the best, that shoddy goods are not produced, and that Irish goods will stand up in competition with any we import.  Irish people will then accept that what is produced in the country is first class.  The more Irish goods we buy the more we can produce goods for export abroad.  If there is a decline in the home market it is difficult to get into the export market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to examine the type of goods we are good at producing. We should then highlight the goods we have for sale and put a stamp on them so that they can stand up in comparison with imported goods.  A highly organised and advertised &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign could have an effect on export markets because it is not a one-way situation.  The Minister will have to look very carefully at this.  If we organise a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, our competitors and our export markets might decide to operate a <Col N="1592" /> similar campaign, so that our campaign might prove in the long run to be unproductive.  The soft approach in relation to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign might produce better results.  If people buy more Irish goods and we lose our export markets the position for Irish industries will not have improved.  The Minister should ensure that the campaign engaged in will not lead to our being regarded as a protectionist market.  It might be more effective, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, if it was done regionally rather than nationally.</P>
    <P>We will have to ensure that the Irish are not a race of people who are not proud of the goods produced in the country.  We will have to see what is the motivating factor of people who go in to buy goods and are annoyed when they find only Irish goods instead of ones with a Parisian, an English or some other tag on them. We should find out what is the motivating factor which makes them reject quality Irish produce against imported goods because they have continental or English tags on them.  In the long term we have got to look at why Irish people select imported goods against quality Irish goods.  In the short term we should get people to realise that if they do not buy Irish goods the jobs of everybody will be in jeopardy and their standard of living will also be in jeopardy.  It is highly desirable, when we go shopping, that we look for Irish goods.</P>
    <P>We often find that big cartels and supermarkets buy in at special prices and advertise foreign produced goods. In the confectionery line they push products from outside.  There is not a lot we can do about this.  If we take a walk around supermarkets we will find that these type of sales promotion schemes operate to the detriment of jobs in Ireland.  I welcome a move towards the purchase of Irish goods but we should be careful that this has not the effect of losing export markets for us.</P>
    <P>There is an additional sum of £100,000 provided for science and technology.  This has been neglected over the years.  We always have to look for outside help and outside <Col N="1593" /> agencies to promote geology and exploration. Is the sum provided enough?  I feel it is only scratching the surface.  We want to train people, equip them and give them expertise. If it means sending them out of the country we should do that quickly, because I believe we can do a better job if we have well-trained Irish engineers, Irish geologists and expertise in all spheres.  It would be a more wholly Irish situation and we would be less in the hands of international cartels.  We would emerge with our own expertise and companies competent to deal with any new finds of oil or gas.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the amount of work he has put into ensuring we get the best deal possible in the exploitation of our natural resources in the short period in which he has been in office.  We are an emerging industrial nation but we have not got either the capital or the expertise to develop industry.  We must accept this and, if we do not, we are indulging in very woolly thinking indeed.</P>
    <P>The environment will, of course, have to be monitored at all times to ensure that, as an emerging industrial nation, we plan well ahead and develop the right type of environment.</P>
    <P>By and large, I am not in favour of subsidies because everybody benefits to the same extent.  However, in the light of wage agreements certain incentives have to be given and subsidies are one of the ways of reducing the consumer price index.  The are a positive way of bringing down prices.  The subsidy on bread, the staple diet of many people, will prove a meaningful saving for them.  Negotiating a new wages agreement will be another day's work.</P>
    <P>With regard to the shipbuilding industry, the subsidy is a small one. It is desirable that we should encourage and develop this industry.  An excellent job has been and is being done in Cork.  Any help required should be forthcoming from the Government because of the employment content.  If we can build our own ships, that will mean keeping money <Col N="1594" /> in the country instead of sending it out of the country.</P>
    <P>This money is being well spent.  I hope, in the next 12 months, we will see a slowing down in the inflationary rate.  The money spent on the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign will have the effect of creating more jobs and more job opportunities and I do not think anybody can quibble with the amount being asked for in this Supplementary Estimate.  I compliment the Minister. I would like to have had an opportunity of speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce but, no doubt, we will have another opportunity.  In the field of exploration and mineral development the Minister has done an excellent job.  In years to come it will be seen he was the best Minister for Industry and Commerce we have had because he is a man of vision and of great national feeling.  I am proud to serve behind him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the small reference the Minister made to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  The Minister said that the working group will sponsor a specific identification symbol for good quality Irish goods. That is not new.  About 60 years ago we had the symbol &ldquo;Déanta in Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder will this be? I am sure the intentions are good and the working group will do their best but I suggest the Minister is going the wrong way about it.  What is selling foreign goods here is very trendy television advertising.  The people who supply British-made goods have the advantage of at least two television cameras beaming in very attractive advertisements.  They are not always in the best of taste, but they sell the goods.  There is nothing we can do about that.  If other television channels are beamed into the one-channel area Irish goods will have to face much greater competition because of television advertising of foreign made goods, particularly British-made goods and, if television becomes so powerful <Col N="1595" /> in the future that continental stations can be beamed in here, then Irish-made goods will face even greater competition.</P>
      <P>The working group would do well to try to interest the housewife in buying Irish goods.  We men are a dead loss at this type of thing.  When we have sufficient courage to insist on being sold Irish made goods the odds are against us.  The shop assistant says the goods were made in Ireland and, when you ask where is the mark, the answer is: &ldquo;It is not there but there is no foreign mark either.&rdquo;  Women are much more persevering in their search for Irish-made goods.  We should try to get the women, the trade unions and the people who work in factories to realise they have a duty to buy Irish.</P>
      <P>I am told that the suppliers of foreign-made goods allow a greater profit margin than the profit margin on the Irish article.  The profit margin allowed on one imported beverage is greater and traders are inclined to push it to the detriment of the homeproduced beverage.  I do not know whether it was a feeling of nationalism which in the past prevailed on us to buy home-made goods but it is now a matter of economic survival that our people should buy goods manufactured here.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, the home market is very small but buying Irish would mean thousands of jobs saved for people who are now losing their jobs or in danger of losing them.  I wish the Minister well in this drive though, from what he said in his statement, I do not think it has much hope of success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister is deciding on price increase applications does he examine the profit margins?  The method of fixing price controls at the moment may be very unfair to some firms.  A good firm which is struggling may be allowed only a certain amount of an increase, whereas another firm, because more expert or long established, may be able to make do with a smaller increase.  I am not against profit.  I believe in private enterprise but some firms may be treated unfairly <Col N="1596" /> because they are not as sophisticated as other firms.  If an increase is refused the particular firm may have to close while some of the multi-nationals can carry on with a lower price index.</P>
    <P>Could we have a certain period of time in which there would be no increase in the price of basics like food and clothing?  The Minister should say: &ldquo;For X months there will be no increase.&rdquo;  This would stop the perpetual increases day after day.  I want to be fair.  I know price control is very difficult.  The other day I heard on a British radio programme that in one day the price of an article increased twice.  I do not know whether that happens here, but at times it appears as if it does.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister's price control system be a success, but I am afraid it is not being tackled in the best possible way and I am doubtful about its equity.  Some home firms who might not be able to survive without a price increase are being penalised side by side with multinational firms who can afford to carry on.</P>
    <P>I wish to support Deputy O'Malley's plea in regard to our gas and oil finds.  I urge on the Minister to disperse around our coasts the spin-off services for these finds.  I also suggest that we take Norway for our model instead of our nearer neighbours. They should be our project lesson.  They have handled their finds in the best possible way and I suggest we follow their example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I support our spokesman's approval for the suggestions in the Minister's opening remarks in regard to IDA efforts for the promotion of Irish goods.  We <Col N="1597" /> have got to a stage in our society when we have seen the gradual elimination of certain Irish industries not alone in the country but in Dublin.  A contributing factor is lack of leadership and positive promotional action by the Government.  We have seen unemployment increasing week by week up to 103,000 and the projection is that it will increase to 130,000 in a couple of months.  It seems to me the Government's efforts are belated when they suggest we should concentrate our efforts on buying Irish goods among the queues of thousands at our labour exchanges.</P>
      <P>In the constituency I represent a number of industries were set up, many of them designed to attract female labour.  With the living conditions that obtain today&mdash;domestic commitments and all that&mdash;many women had to go out to work parttime. They now find themselves out of work and in Dublin North-East there are many who find themselves with completely inadequate incomes. They were employed in Irish industries which served the home markets.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister serious in suggesting that he will give only £60,000 more this year than he gave last year for promotional activities?  In this document of his he said the National Development Association subvention of £75,000 is to be increased by £60,000.  That is a completely inadequate sum in the present serious situation, which affects so many people.</P>

      <P>There is a frightening decline in old established industries in this city and throughout the country and the Government have stood by to see it happen.  More positive and determined measures are needed to try to contain unemployment in our cities and towns.  Increased efforts are needed in our endeavours to curtail the imports of shoddy materials in the form of clothes, shoes and other articles which are being sold in our shops.  If a man seeks a box of matches, unless he specifies that he requires an Irish box of matches usually he finds himself lighting his cigarette with matches <Col N="1598" /> imported from Czechoslovakia.  It is incumbent on the Government to generate conscience in regard to these matters.  I hope the Minister will comment on that when he is replying.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that after two-and-a-half years of price spiralling the Government have finally sought to honour in some way their famous 14-point programme before the last election.  The subsidies announced by the Minister for Finance on various items are very welcome, especially by those on social welfare benefits.  Today the Minister referred to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. Possibly this is the best thing the Minister said in his speech because in this city at the moment there are a number of large sales in progress.  I, with a number of my colleagues, went around a very big store not too far away from this House and we concluded that approximately 80 per cent of the goods on offer in that store were foreign-made, particularly in the clothing and shoe end.  I tried in vain to get a suit which was made in Ireland, to get a shoe made in Ireland, except some that were not up to standard, to get socks which were made in Ireland.  I came along to a rack and on that rack there were something like 200 suits all marked, maybe not with the identification symbol which the Minister mentioned but with a label &ldquo;Quality Irish&rdquo;, and inside there was an English firm's name.</P>

    <P>Frankly, I was disgusted.  I do not mind having an English article offered but I hate that type of deception and taking advantage of people who want to help the Minister's &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  Some of the Minister's inspectors should pay a visit to some of these stores in the city which are holding sales and ask the owners to have the decency not to try to deceive the public.  The Minister has asked us all to buy Irish and he refers to the fact that a lot of foreign goods are being imported but I think he should switch the emphasis of his campaign slightly to the owners and store buyers and the people who have the real power and ask them to be a little more patriotic in the circumstances <Col N="1599" /> in which we find ourselves and to desist from buying such large quantities of foreign-made goods.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister has included admittedly a very small sum as an additional subsidy to the Verolme Dockyard which arises as a result of a loss on a contract.  I hope that the Irish shipbuilding industry, small as it is, does not follow the pattern of its big English brother industry which finds itself for very many reasons in a very bad state, and that the payment of the subsidy is not encouraged, that the shipyard will learn, except in exceptional circumstances, if not to make a profit, at least to break even on its contracts.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very hard and onerous task.  He has the good wishes of everyone on this side, despite the banter that comes and goes, because we know that if he is not successful in keeping down prices, the continuing upsurge in unemployment will eventually lead to the breakdown of this State as we know it.  He has the good wishes of everybody on this side in his efforts.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the provision of an extra sum of £100,000 for science and technology and I notice that one of the areas for which that has been provided is the environment, something which is affecting and causing worry to many people.  While it may not be the Minister's immediate concern, he should impress on the Taoiseach the very urgent necessity of putting the environment and the care of it under one specific head and let that person, whoever he or she may be, delegate responsibility for certain things to other Departments, because it is very important that the environment be considered and placed under the control of one Minister, with responsibility resting on him and on him solely.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the clothing industry. I suppose that those of us in areas not really affected by closures do not really understand the heartbreak which these closures cause, but some two months ago it was brought home to me very clearly when what appeared to be a thriving industry <Col N="1600" /> suddenly ground to a halt.  I suggest that the Minister push the idea of finding another industry somewhat similar so that the 70 girls now unemployed as a result of the closure of Leisure Wear in Ballina may be re-employed.  I understand the individuals have made representations to the IDA and have had some contacts with them and I hope these contacts will be quickly followed up so that some work can go ahead.</P>

This is the question of allowing this firm exemption whereby they can continue to bake a loaf of 600 grammes as they have been doing for some considerable time and in respect of which they have expended a considerable amount of money.  If the Department insist on a change either to the 400 or the 800-gramme loaf, it is likely that some redundancies will follow.  The firm have produced a loaf in the 800-gramme size but for some strange reason people were not prepared to buy it.  The loaf represents approximately 20 per cent of the firm's production but if the Department insist on a change the company will be at a considerable loss in terms of equipment in respect of both tins and packaging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Fourth Report is one of the items for discussion today. I should like to discuss chapter 19 of this report which deals with energy and, in particular, with the agreement of the International Energy Programme and the establishment of the International Energy Agency.</P>
      <P>As the report points out, there is specific allowance in the International Energy Programme for accession to the agreement by the EEC.  Unfortunately, however, one of the Nine has decided not to accede to the agreement. Consequently, the Community as a whole cannot sign the agreement. As the report points out also, Ireland signed the agreement on November 18th last and this should have been ratified by Dáil Éireann before May 1st this year but because it had not gone through Dáil Éireann at that stage&mdash;not only Dáil Éireann were in this position because the agreement had not been ratified by the Parliaments of a number of other countries at that date&mdash;there was a general putting forward of the signing of the agreement until September 1st next when, I hope, we will become full members of the IEA.  There has been some criticism of this International Energy Agency from many sources in different countries but, by and large, anybody who considers the situation brought about by the energy crisis during the past 18 months should realise that it is essential that the consumer countries of the world should not find themselves in the position again in which they were in October, 1973&mdash;unprepared totally for the embargo on oil supplies imposed by the oil-producing countries. Having experienced that situation, we would be criminally negligent if we did not make some arrangement to deal with the eventuality of another such emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the Washington Conference of February, 1974, it was decided that countries inside the OECD&mdash;the OECD had already started to formulate an energy policy for dealing with emergencies&mdash;would be at least rash if they did not realise the effects of an oil embargo and if they did not <Col N="1602" /> take some steps to avoid a recurrence of those effects.</P>
    <P>The effects vary from country to country.  As a country which imports more than 70 per cent of our energy needs in the form of oil, we were hit hard.  In fairness to the producing countries it can be said that we, like other countries in the West, built our economies in the fifties and sixties on oil that we bought at cheap prices, at below value.  However, it would have been expecting too much of human nature for any of us to have told the producers that they were not charging enough for their products.  We took advantage of the situation and advanced our economies on this cheap energy.  However, the producing countries decided then to put an embargo on products and they quadrupled the price of oil within ten weeks.  This had a profound effect on our economy.  However, the underdeveloped countries were hit much harder than were the developing or developed countries.  It was against that background that it was decided at Washington that some form of co-operation should be devised whereby we could develop methods or strategies to deal with another emergency.  It was decided also that there should be some type of long-term co-operation in regard to the research and development of alternative sources of energy because the amount of oil in the world is limited.  Figures quoted in newspapers and journals differ in this regard so that nobody can be sure of what are the world's oil reserves but we know they are limited.  That, in itself, is enough to warrant the development of long-term co-operation in respect of the research and development of alternative sources of energy.</P>
    <P>The very important point of the agency is its relations with the producing countries, not in a spirit of confrontation but of co-operation.  It is essential if the world is not to go into conflict again over energy and oil.</P>
    <P>The fourth objective of the agreement is to induce some sort of transparence into the oil market.  The international <Col N="1603" /> oil companies are big and wealthy.  They are powerful in a lot of countries and they transcend ordinary political boundaries of countries.  To have every country looking at them in isolation would not give a true picture of their activities. One of the most important functions of the agency is that they should come to understand how the oil market operates.  By gathering information collected from the 18 countries who signed the agreement they would come to understand and control, better, if it is necessary to control, the multi-national oil companies. I would not like to prejudge that though it is natural for people to shout at multi-national oil companies and say that they are robbing the countries of the world.  I would not like to prejudge what the findings of this co-ordinating group of the International Energy Agency will be on this matter but it is necessary that Governments, in co-operation with one another, should have as much information as possible.  If it is necessary to control multi-national companies they should have this information.</P>
    <P>For any one country to say that, with the limited amount of information at their disposal, they could control the multi-national companies is ridiculous because the fact that they are multi-national means that there must be a multi-national approach to controlling them.  There must be an approach amongst Governments to control them.  The four objectives of the agency are in conformity with the Government's attitude towards an energy policy.  There has been a lot of criticism about the composition of this agency.  There was criticism because some countries joined and others did not and because of the alleged domination by other countries. It is true that one of the partners of the EEC.  France, did not join the agency.  That is regrettable and I should like to see the EEC joining as a bloc.  Their combined weight of voting within the agency would exceed that of the US, a country a lot of members fear.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> Members prefaced their remarks about the US by saying that they thought the Americans were a marvellous people, that they were all for them but we should not associate with them.  This is contradictory.  Of all the great nations of the world the United States have been the most generous in their attitude towards other countries.  The fact that France did not join is a matter for the French Government but when people say that we should not join the agency because France did not join they should remember that Germany, Italy, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark and the United Kingdom joined.  In all eight of the nine members of the community joined the agency.  I am convinced our decision to join the agency was the correct one.</P>
    <P>The Norwegian Government decided against full membership because they could not agree to the oil-sharing programme but the other three objectives of the agency have been confirmed by that Government.  It is interesting to note when accession to the agency was being debated in the Norwegian Parliament it was carried by 102 votes to 18.  Among the 102 who voted in favour was an opposition party who criticised the Government for not becoming full members. Norway at present export oil but yet their Parliament thought they should become full members of this agency.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency to look upon this agency as having been set up deliberately to confront the producing nations but that is not true. Obviously, the interests of the consuming nations are different from those of the producing nations.  In this agency the consumers have drawn up a programme for a discussion with the producing nations.  This is feasible and has a good chance, in spite of the fact that the Paris meeting in April did not produce the results we hoped for.  I hope that meeting will be reconvened before the end of this year and that at that meeting there will be agreement among the producers and consumers on oil prices, the future of the oil industry and on other raw materials which some of the producing nations are <Col N="1605" /> anxious to have discussed.  I believe this will come about.</P>
    <P>When people criticise the international agency they remark that there will be oil off our shores in a few years.  For that reason they believe we should join the producers.  People who make those remarks are ignorant of what the letters OPEC stand for. I have heard responsible people say that we should not join the IEA but that we should join OPEC.  The latter organisation is one for petroleum exporting countries.  We have not got any oil but yet it is suggested that we should join an organisation of petroleum exporting countries.  Those people also show a great ignorance of the composition of that organisation. If a nation wishes to join OPEC that nation must have the support of 75 per cent of the existing membership, a similar economic outlook to the other members and must be accepted by the five original members of that organisation.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, we will discover oil off our coast but that is another story. Drilling is in progress and the licences have been issued.  I hope oil in significant quantities will be discovered off the coast.  It should be remembered that we are not married for all time to this agreement and if that day comes we could consider joining OPEC.  However, we must deal with the situation as it is now and not what we hope it will be in the future.  This kind of comment on this agreement shows a shallow appreciation of what the IEA is about or what the world oil market is about.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of criticism of the agency because of the voting system within it.  The allegation has been made that this is dominated by the United States and that they will shove their opinion down the throats of every other nation.  This is not true because the voting has been carefully weighted to ensure that no one country can dominate the agency. The agreement cannot be changed without the agreement of every signatory to it.  That means that the United States have a veto on the changing of that agreement but we also have a veto on the changing of it.  We can <Col N="1606" /> veto any effort made, even by all of the other 17 members, to change that agreement.</P>
    <P>The majority voting in the agency is very carefully blended so that no country can heedlessly hold up progress, nor can any country or group of countries put their point of view against the consensus of the wishes of the participating countries.</P>
    <P>It has been said from time to time that, say, the United States, Holland and Japan could by combining their votes bring about, for example, the introduction of a rationing system for oil.  This is not true, because there is the unanimous vote that can change the agreement, and there are two other types of votes.  There is the majority vote which deals really with the management of the whole agency, and it needs 60 per cent of the votes to carry any proposition under that, and not just 60 per cent of the combined votes.  As I say, there are two types of votes.  Each participating country has what are called general votes and then there are votes according to the consumption of the participating countries.  Under oil consumption we have no vote, but neither have three other countries&mdash;Luxembourg, New Zealand and Norway&mdash;because our consumption is less than 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Under the agreement the United States have 48 votes plus three participating votes, making a total of 51. However, the eight countries who have joined the agency from the European Communities have between them almost as many as the United States and, if France had become a member of the European Communities, they could outvote the United States in the agency.  Therefore, to infer that this is an agency dominated by America for selfish reasons is misleading. I think the whole history of the United States would show that they have not been selfish for the lifetime of anybody in this House or, indeed, for hundreds of years, in their attitude to the rest of the world.  I am sure it is not their intention to use this to have their own way in the energy field in the world today.</P>
    <P>It is totally untrue to say that the <Col N="1607" /> United States, Holland and Japan or, as in the other example given, the United States, Germany and Japan, could by coming together force their will on the rest of the eight.  It is untrue even according to the figures in the printed agreement, because between these three countries they have nine general votes and between them they have 71 oil consumption votes which gives them a combined voting strength of 80.  However, two-thirds of the 60 per cent that is necessary for a change is 93 votes.  These countries between them have only 80 votes, but even if they had 94 votes which would give them the 60 per cent, they could not do anything unless they had the support of a further six countries because the voting is designed in such a way in the agency that for a majority vote there must be 60 per cent of the combined votes plus nine countries in approval of the measure.  Of course, it is true to say that three countries could block anything the others proposed, but that is the kind of negative thing I cannot see ever arising.  What we want is an assurance or a method that would allow us to stop the agreement going further than we would like it to go.</P>
    <P>The other example given was the United States, Holland and Japan, but in that case they have only 74 votes.  Therefore, the people who trot out these figures have not read the agreement, or if they have they have not understood it or have not made any effort to see that what they are saying conforms with what is in the agreement.  This agreement was read by a number of people very casually. Without having read the small print of the balances that are there, they have trotted out these figures in public to bolster up what was in the agreement.</P>
    <P>This country made a major contribution to the devising of the system of votes, particularly in relation to the devising of the oil consumption and the general votes.  This indicates that even the smallest country can have a significant say in future policy agreements under the International Energy Agency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> One of the co-ordinating groups in the IEA is Research and Development, and this we consider to be very significant and important, because a country that is 70 per cent dependent for its energy on imported oil must, as far as possible, diminish that dependence internally, if that is possible, but certainly, if that is not possible, it should try to diversify its supplies of oil from outside sources. The Government, recognising the necessity to pursue this vigorously, have agreed to the third development programme of Bord na Móna.  Tributes have been paid in this House on a number of occasions to Bord na Móna, and I would like to join in those tributes.  Twenty-four per cent of the electricity generated in this country is being provided by turf. Within the next few weeks I shall be bringing a Bill before the House to allow them to go ahead with the third programme under which the amount of electricity being generated from peat will be increased, but not necessarily by 24 per cent because we shall hopefully get back on to a growth margin there again.</P>
    <P>Then there are the expected finds off the coast.  I should say here that there is no danger, as has been inferred, of anybody getting their hands on our oil off the south coast.  That is our property, and what we are agreeing to share in this agency is the stocks of oil it is necessary under the agency and, indeed, under the EEC, to maintain.  The levels of stock holding for both are exactly the same, 90 days.  It has been said that this will cost us a fortune, but this is based on the assumption that this 90 days is additional to the 90 days we have to provide under EEC regulations. Of course, it is the same 90 days, so even if we never joined this agency we would have to provide 90 days storage for oil anyway.  As I say, it is not true that membership of this agency will allow people to get hold of the oil or gas we hope to have on the south coast.  All we are being asked to do in the event of an emergency in another country is to share our 90 days' supply to the proposed level below that, depending on the level of shortage in other countries <Col N="1609" /> or indeed, in all the countries combined.</P>
    <P>We have joined this agency for 10 years.  The whole agency will be reviewed after five years.  Our initial period is three years and then we can give one month's notice if we desire to pull out of the agency.  Therefore, after four years we could be totally out of the agency again.  Maybe the picture will have changed by then, we may have oil and we may want to pull out.  At the moment we have no oil and we would be very lax and indifferent to the needs of our people if we did not see that, in the event of another oil emergency, there was some oil-sharing system in which we could participate.</P>
    <P>If we have more than our requirements of oil in future and if we pull out of this agency in another four to ten years' time, if a country finds itself in an economic recession because of an embargo imposed by a supplier of oil, if I am Minister I would hope to influence the decision that we would not adopt an isolationist selfish policy, that even if we had no international binding commitment to share oil, we would supply it to a neighbour or any other country.  That would apply to any Government in this country at any time, that if that should happen we would recognise our moral if not our legal obligation to help a neighbour in trouble.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the floor price for oil and about the price of oil being too high and the suggestion is made that we are proposing to increase it.  That is not what is intended, as is quite obvious.</P>
    <P>Up to 1973 the price of oil was a dollar a barrel and is now about ten dollars a barrel.  The thinking behind the floor price for oil is that the price should not be allowed to drop to one dollar a barrel again.  This is intended to ensure that there will be sufficient people interested in producing oil and that the price will be sufficiently rewarding to encourage people to get oil in places where the cost of production is very high.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce within the last three weeks issued licences for <Col N="1610" /> the exploration of the Celtic Sea for oil and gas and there was a queue outside his door for those licences. If the price of oil was a dollar a barrel and if it was available in unlimited quantities from the Middle East countries, nobody would be looking for a licence because it would be impossible to get oil out of the Celtic Sea at a dollar a barrel.  It must be profitable and commercially viable to explore for oil.  The producers must be assured of a return in the long term on their huge investment.  If Governments do not agree to a level below which the price will not be allowed to drop, interest in the Celtic Sea will be nil.  People will not put their money into that type of exploration and exploitation which does not offer a reward or even a possibility of getting their investment back.</P>
    <P>When we talk of a floor price or a minimum price for oil, we are talking about a price that makes it feasible for exploration to take place.  That applies also to the production of other forms of energy&mdash;solar, fusion, fission, nuclear.  Production must be made attractive to investors.  We are not talking about putting the price of oil up beyond its present level.  We are talking about giving a reasonable guarantee to people who invest money in exploration where the operation is very expensive.  The cost of the drilling now taking place off the south coast of Ireland is running into millions of pounds and that is not the most expensive place at which to get oil.  The place at which gas has been found off the south coast is only 30 miles out and is in relatively shallow water.  The further out one has to go and the deeper the water, the greater the cost.  If the oil that is brought ashore is double the price at which oil is available on shore, there is no inducement to invest in exploitation. We must be realistic.</P>
    <P>It is in our interests to get as much control as possible of our energy supply and to get it as near our shores as possible.  We will not get that if the price falls to a level at which nobody is interested in exploitation. In that case we will remain dependent as to 70 per cent of our requirements <Col N="1611" /> on imported oil from the Middle East and vulnerable to the same embargoes that have done so much damage to the economy in the last 18 months. We must avoid that possibility.  We must ensure, in co-operation with the EEC or the IEA that we will be protected in the event of another emergency and that funds and encouragement will be provided for the exploration and development of other forms of energy.  The International Energy Agency allows us to do that. The decision by Ireland to join that agency was a correct one.  We would have been negligent in our duty if we had done otherwise.  The price of oil may rise marginally this year.  I just do not know.  Increases of up to 20 per cent have been quoted in relation to the OPEC countries on 1st October next.</P>
    <P>If we were to allow another five or six years to elapse without taking action and were to allow ourselves to slide back into dependence on imported oil, even though it benefited us in the immediate future to have cheap oil for industry and the country generally, we would be rightly accused of negligence.  We are talking at a time when there is no certainty about there being oil off the south coast but if we do get it we do not want it for the purposes of trade, unless we get it in huge quantities.  We want oil as a source of energy on which to build our economy.  The more control we have over that energy within our own shores, the more control we have over the economy and the less danger there is of being affected by decisions taken thousands of miles away that are totally outside our control and are taken regardless of the effect they will have on our economy.  I do not blame producing countries for taking decisions without regard to what they do to us.  They have their own business and their own countries to run.  They have this valuable product which they have been selling at too low a price. We failed to face up to that fact for 20 years.  We failed to allow the price to move up gradually.  Therefore, we took the full brunt of 20 years' increase in two months, with <Col N="1612" /> the resultant inflationary effect on so many countries.</P>

      <P>I want to repeat, in reference to this paragraph, this chapter in the Fourth Report, that I consider the decision of the Irish Government to join this International Energy Agency to be the correct one. I regret that the European Community have not been able to join as a community.  I hope in the future that the French Government may change their minds or that we may find some other way of accommodating them. Even though the French Government have not joined the agency, before every meeting of the agency a co-ordinating group of the nine countries meets to ensure that the attitude put forward by the eight countries in the agency is acceptable to the French Government.  A conscious effort is made to accommodate the views of the Community within the agency.  I believe this agency is the correct place for this country to be at this time.  I do not know what our attitude may be in five years' time.  It may have changed but at the moment the correct decision has been taken by this country to join the International Energy Agency.</P>

      <P>During the Minister's speech on chapter 19 of the report he spoke about the price of oil.  We all know from statistics we have seen that oil will cost about twice as much to take from the sea bed as it costs to take it out of the desert.  The cost price of oil at the well head is about 10p per barrel in the Arab countries but I presume it will cost more than twice that when it is drilled from the sea.</P>
      <P>We do not want to tell people that we will have cheaper oil or cheaper petrol.  Some months ago, when I asked the Minister for Finance a question about the tax on oil and petrol, as far as I remember he told me that the tax on a gallon of petrol was 42p. There is no point in saying that the cost of petrol is solely the responsibility of the Arabs or where it has to be drilled.  The real problem where petrol is concerned is the high rate of tax.  I was glad the Minister spoke about energy and how important it is both in relation to this country and to the world.  The reason why I called for a House was that there are 19 chapters in this report on development in the European Communities and the only Minister to speak on the two reports was the Minister for Transport and Power and he did not refer to very important chapters in this report. He did not refer to the common agricultural policy, to the regional policy, or to the social policy.</P>
      <P>When we are debating the European Economic Community I should like each Minister to tell the House and the public exactly how Europe is affecting his particular Department. The Minister for Transport and Power dealt only with his own Department. Will the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries come in and tell us about the common agricultural policy?</P>

      <P>We will check it out. If each Minister would spend even half-an-hour dealing with his particular Department and telling us exactly how the Community affects his Department and what benefits have accrued, that would be a good thing.  The last time we debated this was on 13th March and big changes have since taken place in Europe. We have had the result of the British referendum in which 73 per cent decided Britain should stay in Europe. I know that, irrespective of what Britain did, the Government had decided we would remain in Europe.  In that decision they had the full support of the Opposition.  We now have to face Britain's remaining in the Community as a reality.  We must now get down to a realisation of the fact that when we joined, 88 per cent of the people having voted in favour of joining, that was only the beginning and not the end, as some seemed to think.  Ministers and their officials will have to fight very hard for what we demand from and expect of Europe. The common agricultural policy is the keystone because it is the only really definite policy we have in Europe and it had a very big influence in rural areas on the decision of the farming community.  What has happened in the two-and-a-half years since?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the two-and-a-half years we have been members what developments have taken place in agriculture?  None.  We have had the green £ but that was because the £ was floating.  There were no new policies.  One thing farmers have been howling for in the same period is a common agricultural policy on sheep. Our members have demanded this in both Strasbourg and Luxembourg. We have tabled several parliamentary questions.  On the last occasion M. Lardinois said in reply that he would have proposals for a common agricultural policy on sheep before the April adjournment.  The Parliament adjourned today and there have been no proposals for a common agricultural policy on sheep.  At the last meeting in Strasbourg about three weeks ago I was speaking to M. Lardinois and he told me there was no hope of having any proposals on a common agricultural policy on sheep before the end of November.  As a parliamentarian, I know that when one is told there will be no proposals before the end of November, that will be coming up to Christmas and Parliament will adjourn once more, this time for the Christmas recess, that simply means there will be no common agricultural policy for sheep until 1976.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs was President of the Council of Ministers for the last six months and pressure must be put on the Commission to bring forward proposals.  If the Council demand it the Commission must present them.  This is the situation. Even M. Lardinois in cross talk said: &ldquo;If you want a common agricultural policy on sheep you will have to fight for it.&rdquo;  We can fight in the Parliament, but the Minister has the bigger stick and he can hit harder. He must fight for it.  That is one aspect, but it is a very important aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Herbert has worked very hard on the regional policy as rapporteur and as a member of the <Col N="1616" /> regional policy commission.  The Irish delegates were very much involved in the regional policy and its development. The whole of Ireland qualifies for development funds.  The amount allocated is somewhere in the region of £35 million over the next three years.  This is very small.  People are very worried because the Minister for Finance made statements which could mean this money disappearing into the total capital budget.  No one will be satisfied until the Minister clearly defines, if it is his job, what plans he has for this regional fund and where the money will be spent.  The criteria laid down by the Commission were related in principle to infrastructure. Millions could be used on the development of the telephone service, on roads, on harbours, on rural water and sewerage schemes, on industrial estates.  All these would qualify for aid from the regional fund.  These are the things we want.  I am sure every Member is as anxious as I am to have the position clearly defined.  We do not want to see these moneys swallowed up in the capital budget and used for the purposes for which the capital budget is used.  I sincerely hope we will get from the Minister for Finance detailed plans as to how this regional fund will be used.  This is very, very important.</P>
    <P>I come now to the farm modernisation scheme.  Every rural Deputy is only too well aware that in February of last year the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries decided that farmers applying for grants to improve their farms would have to be classified either as development farmers or transitional farmers and, until such time as they were classified, they would not qualify.  Farmers were in no way geared for the farm modernisation scheme.  One of the essentials would be a farm accounting system and our farm structure was not geared to that.  The result was thousands of farmers could not get grants.  The agricultural committee adviser got bogged down.  The applications piled in.  The land project officials who deal with classification were snowed under with paper.  I asked the Minister by way of parliamentary question to postpone the introduction of the <Col N="1617" /> scheme until such time as the farmers were classified and would qualify for grants.  That was not done.  A very serious situation developed.  The service industries in agriculture, light engineering and so on, were adversely affected.  There were redundancies.  If a farmer did not get a grant he could not buy a manure distributor, erect a hay shed, carry out land reclamation and so on.  The small service industries&mdash;there are quite a few in my constituency&mdash;began to feel the pinch. Workers became redundant.  Even at this moment we are still not ready to implement this scheme.  We have the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The farmers in these areas according to the outline plan the Minister has will not qualify for benefits similar to those of their French counterparts&mdash;we will be able to go into this in greater detail on the Estimate&mdash;because farmers in France and other countries will qualify for higher benefits than the Irish farmer will.  There are certain differences.</P>
    <P>I come now to this fearful word &ldquo;inflation&rdquo;.  As a famous Member of this House once asked: &ldquo;What is inflation?&rdquo;  It is everything that is bad. As a member of the European Community we are in trouble because of the rate of inflation which is somewhere around 27 per cent.  If I am a baker producing bread, and it is costing me 20 per cent more to produce bread than my competitors, I will be out of business in a few weeks because I cannot compete.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce in a television interview admitted this.</P>
    <P>If the cost of our goods for export continues to rise, and the rate of inflation compared with the average for other European countries is higher, we might as well close our doors because we will be out of business.  This is not a European problem.  If we were not in the European Community today our cost of living would be higher according to the statistics available.  If we do not control inflation, and if we allow the cost of our goods for export to rise, we will be in trouble.  The recent budget did not do enough to grapple with inflation. It has already been said here that an <Col N="1618" /> attempt was made to reduce the cost of living by the introduction of subsidies and by removing value-added tax. Even before the value-added tax was taken off briquettes had gone up in price.  I read in a Press report yesterday that bread will increase in price. We will not control inflation that way.</P>

      <P>We know about the green £ and the 11 per cent devaluation. I saw a statement by a prominent person&mdash;he is not a Member of this House so I cannot mention his name&mdash;that the Irish £ as compared with the unit of account, which is the European system, is of higher value.  Last week I saw in a European document that the Irish £ is .003 less than the £ sterling, as far as comparison with the unit of account is concerned.  Granted, the reason for that may be that they are sent back to the banks here.  I thought it wrong that a prominent member of the Government party should make the statement that the Irish £ was stronger on the international market than the £ sterling.  It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be clear on this.  We have one prominent member of the Government party saying we should break the link with sterling while the Minister for Finance says we should not.  The person who says we should break the link with sterling should point out what we will link the £ with.  Will we link it with the dollar? What will happen to our cost of living? Will the £ have to be devalued? That is a field in which I would have to do a great deal of research and learn a lot about because that is high finance.  I am sure there are very few people in this House capable of talking about that.  The Minister for Finance should be the Government <Col N="1619" /> spokesman on financial affairs, and not prominent members of any other party.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael and Labour seem to differ on several important matters.  The only person we can believe is the Minister.  The Taoiseach speaking at the last Fine Gael ardfheis clearly and distinctly stated that part of our inflation was of our own making.  I am sure the Minister for <Col N="1620" /> Foreign Affairs will agree.  Yet, other Ministers on television and in this House say that the oil crisis caused all the problems.  The person I believe in this case is the Taoiseach.  Our inflation problems will not be solved by Europe, or by the USA or by the Arabs.  We will have to solve them ourselves.</P>
      <P>Before the Minister for Foreign Affairs came into this House the Minister for Transport and Power spoke on chapter 19 of the report on energy.  I understand the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries spoke about it also.  When debates on developments in the European Community take place in this House it is important that each Minister should come into this House for a half-an-hour and explain to the Irish people how these developments affect their lives.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Nolan and I who are members of the European Parliament have this opportunity to speak about the Community. Neverthless, the circumstances that allow us to be here today to debate this motion are a little bizarre.  We have one very important item which has been under discussion in the EEC for some time.  It is the dual mandate proposal.  It affects those of us who happen to be Members of both Parliaments.  It reached its most bizarre circumstances this week for those of us endeavouring to put this country's point of view in Europe at the plenary session which is occurring at the moment.  They are discussing the wine market or something like that, but there was a debate this week which had great relevance to the Irish situation but the Irish voice was prevented from being heard over there because of the silly pairing arrangement which has broken down in this House.  We were prevented from being heard in Europe.</P>

      <P>During this week the debate in the European Parliament was dealing with the social action problems in the Community, European union and matters pertaining to agriculture and the like, but the Irish voice had to be put forward by only one Member of this House. All Deputies who would have been out in Europe would have had something to say on these very important matters.  I would have dealt with them on behalf of the Socialist group but, because of the problems here I was not able to do that business.  At short notice, somebody else was called in the European Parliament to make the contribution I would have been making, which I would have done with particular relevance to the Irish situation. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has told me I cannot speak on this particular matter.  I express the hope that sanity will prevail in the next couple of weeks so that the Irish voice can be heard in Europe.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nolan spoke about the agricultural policy and said that in the last two years no new agricultural policies had been adopted here at home.  I would have thought that the entire complicated agricultural policy in Europe, its acceptance and the working and the operating of it during the last two-and-a-half years&mdash; the introduction of the various directives and proposals dealing with agriculture&mdash;posed a great deal of problems for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, for the farming community and for all the various industries.  We have been getting the best from the various regulations and in doing this we have been adapting ourselves very well and very quickly to the European situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said is that we have been overloaded with work.  Our organisations have been doing excellently but they have been overloaded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the policy area many of the schemes and directives are very extensive and new and they could not in effect be regarded as policy at all.  The main problem is to co-ordinate our agricultural policy with that of Europe and from that <Col N="1622" /> point of view I would say that the two-and-a-half years have been very well spent by those connected with agriculture here.  We have got by far the biggest bonus for this country from the various Community funds.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nolan mentioned one matter in which I am particularly interested, the sheep market.  I think I was the first Member of the European Parliament to put down a question about the introduction of a sheep market to the agricultural Commissioner back in April, 1974.  He could not see any hope at that time but later on we pursued the question.  An oral question by one of the English Members was debated in the Parliament and on that occasion we saw the first signs of a proposal to bring in a sheep market.  The various problems, like the energy crisis, that have been besetting the Community as well as ourselves have put a brake on many of the new policies.  As a result of a debate about a month ago we now find that the possibility of a sheep market is being postponed.  This matter is very important to many areas, particularly my constituency of Wicklow, where the operation of that market would be of great benefit to the sheep men.  We look forward to the implementation of this either by the end of the year or early next year.  The promise has been made.  Whatever we may feel about the agricultural Commissioner, I believe he has endeavoured to bring this in; but because of the lack of finance, he has had to postpone its introduction, like many other schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one reference to what Deputy Nolan said about Senator Halligan and his remarks about the sterling link.  He was allowed to make these remarks.  It is only fair to say that any Member of this House or of the Seanad can put forward his ideas on any aspect of economic policy when he prefaces what he says with the remark that he is making it off his own bat, that they are his own ideas, and in that way perhaps stimulate a debate on this very important problem.  I think there is some merit in what Senator Halligan said about linking sterling <Col N="1623" /> with some other currency or group of currencies.  Our concern over the past year or two has been with the decline in the £ sterling against the major currencies of the world.  It is continuing to decline and has declined rapidly over the last few weeks and months.  It must be an item of concern to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to see this continuing drift in sterling.</P>
    <P>It was estimated recently on British television that the £ would possibly drop as much as 30 per cent against the 1971 level.  This will represent a very considerable devaluation of the £.  It will also mean a devaluation of our own money over which we have no control.  It is only right that a discussion should be stimulated to see how best the Irish economy can be safeguarded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

      <P>The Deputy has been allowed to speak as he has spoken because references were made to it previously, but it is a standing rule of the House that Members of the other House should not be introduced in the House by name and the views of Senators are not relevant to discussions in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir, but I felt it was only right that I should underline the fact that Senator Halligan spoke as he did as an individual and not as a member of the Government or the spokesman on economics for the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation under the regional fund for Ireland has been mentioned by several speakers from all sides. There is a feeling among many people that Ireland's share was not as large as it should have been.  Nevertheless what should be appreciated about the fund is the fact that it has been set <Col N="1624" /> up.  This was by far the most important decision made during 1974, and its delay for 12 months, when the clock was stopped for a year, caused problems for us here in not having this fund to draw on.  The fact that it has been set up has given us the opportunity to put forward our schemes and prepare them adequately so that we can immediately make use of the fund that is there.  I do not think that anybody can suggest that the fund is adequate or inadequate until we find out whether we are getting the benefits to the full extent of the applications we are making to this fund.</P>
    <P>It is my information and my impression from what has been said lately that new budgetary allocations for the coming year in the Community will be larger and the regional fund will have the benefit of a larger allocation. This is particularly so because of the many problems which have beset the western countries during 1974.  This is one area where help and assistance can be given to the less well-off sections of the Community. This fund was set up and devised to bring up the standards of living in the less well-off areas and Ireland as a whole was accepted as one of those areas.  I must say as one of those who hails from the eastern part of the country, which is regarded as somewhat better off, I am not in favour of the lobby that seems to get under way and which says that all the regional fund money should be spent in a certain area.  I could send anybody from the west, the south-west or north-west into parts of Wicklow where the fund could be used with just as much benefit and where it certainly would raise the standard of living in the area equally with other parts of the west.  Not all the poor areas can be found in the west.  The hill farmers and the small industries in the mountains of Wicklow and in the west and south-west of Wicklow would benefit just as greatly from the fund as anywhere else in the country, and it is wrong that anybody in this Parliament or elsewhere should start a bandwagon to have the money spent in any particular area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> It is a pity, now that the full allocation of members to the European Parliament has been made since the British Labour Party decided to send its members, that there are now no representatives from the northern part of Ireland in the European Parliament. This is one of the areas of the Community that needs a spokesman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  It just shows how the British treat that part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has been a big blot on the British that they have not put forward the names of one or two people from that area.  I do not know what the alignment of the various Unionist parties is at present with the British Conservatives.  I do not know if there is any attachment there, but in the former years there was a link between the Unionist parties and the Conservative Party; but they have 11 out of 12 members up there and it would seem to me that one of those could have been allowed representation in the European Parliament.  The only voice that the minority have in the British Parliament is that of the SDLP member from Belfast.  I expect that his duties are onerous.  Because of the electoral system in that part of the country, the SDLP instead of having four or five members at Westminister, have only one.  Therefore, he would not have enough time perhaps to take on the added duties of Europe.  If the Convention develops into some sort of Parliament I trust that that part of Ireland will be represented in the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of the Social Affairs and Employment Committee of the Parliament and consequently I have a profound interest in this area.  It had been my hope to speak this week on some of the problems in this regard. Since 1974 the Community, together with all other western countries, has experienced a worsening economic and social crisis.  In our case it is probably the worst situation we have ever faced.  There are three major elements to be considered in regard to the social situation in the Community. <Col N="1626" /> First, there is the inflation-unemployment situation.  There is the social action programme being undertaken by the Community and there is the institutional development in the social policy area.</P>
    <P>The unemployment-inflation situation dominated all the considerations of social development in 1974 and also during this year.  It is reckoned that within the Community there are between 6,500,000 and 7,000,000 people out of work or on short time. The impact of the depressed markets continues to hit all the member States and it is expected that there will be little or no growth in production this year.  This problem must be tackled not only by the Community as a whole but by national Governments.  The proposals in this regard that were put forward by the Minister for Finance and accepted in this House will go a considerable way towards tackling the inflation-unemployment problem. Therefore we can point out to our fellow members that our Government are pursuing a very active policy to curb the worst excesses of inflation.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, all aspects of Community policy are concentrated on these central issues.  There is a grave danger of increasing social problems in the Community countries.  This situation would result in a loss of credibility and of confidence in the institutions of the Community.  Therefore the social action programme, which is particularly relevant to countries like ours, must be put into effect immediately so as to avoid any loss of this confidence and credibility. We know that already in this country some of those who advocated entry to the EEC are saying that, perhaps, many of our problems result from our membership.  However, it would not be accurate to blame the EEC for the recession that has occurred.  But unless the Community indicate a willingness to tackle these problems many people will believe that our membership of the Community is responsible for our trouble.</P>

      <P>While we can offer opinions, we cannot instruct.  Perhaps the Opposition would like to let us know their opinion.  The social action programme can be described as being the first real attempt to develop a social policy covering a wide range of subjects.  While initially the programme is limited in scope, it provides a basis for concrete achievement and for the opening of doors in a number of areas.  In this regard tribute must be paid to Commissioner Hillery for the development of this programme. Perhaps in putting forward this programme he has in mind many of the problems that we are experiencing. However the funds available to him in this sphere are totally inadequate and I trust that in the allocations for the coming year these funds will be greatly increased so as to allow for the full development of the programme.</P>
      <P>In regard to unemployment the Commissioner has told us that he can deal with the problem only in very limited areas.  For instance he is not allowed give direct grants from the social fund towards the unemployment situation.  He must devote the money to pilot schemes, to education, to training schemes and so on.  On several occasions we have asked him to endeavour to do something for that section which is hit badly at the moment, the school-leavers.  Many of these young people are not included in the unemployment figures in any of the Community countries.  As a first step the Commissioner has been asked to initiate a study in the Community which will determine a figure for the number of school-leavers seeking jobs.  We have asked too, that financial support be given from the fund to those people, be they young or old, who are not included in the social welfare benefits of the national countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an area which is neglected in all the national programmes.  Something <Col N="1628" /> must be done to relieve the problem of unemployment for school-leavers and also for those who, by virtue of their entitlement to benefit having expired, are not in receipt of any social welfare payments.  It is an area in which the Community could help with the Social Fund.</P>
    <P>The programme of pilot schemes and studies to combat poverty is the first Community social action programme outside the field of employment and it represents a beginning of the task of creating a comprehensive and effective policy for the alleviation and eventual elimination of poverty and deprivation in the member states. A major priority must now be the commencement of work on the preparation of social policy proposals for the period after 1976.  The work of preparation must be a consultative and flexible exercise which will ensure responsiveness to the real needs of the people.  The social policy must be given a broader scope to cover all social problems whether or not they are in the field of unemployment.  This is one of the actions I hope the Commissioner will be taking note of.  Certain advances have been made in the institutional aspects of the Community social policy.  The reactivation of the standing committee on employment is to be welcomed in this regard.  It provides an effective forum for discussion between governments and between the Commission and the social partners.</P>
    <P>Utilisation of its budgetary powers by the European Parliament to facilitate the development of a social policy was also an important step forward. It was regretted by the Minister for Labour during the Irish Presidency that his attempts to bring the Labour and Finance Ministers of the Community together to deal with the problems of unemployment in the Community did not meet with a ready response from many of the well-off Governments of the Community.  It is to be hoped that the work he put into this during his term will bear fruit in the coming months under the Italian Presidency.  It is the greatest initiative that could take place to answer many of the problems of unemployment existing in the Community. <Col N="1629" /> I should like to state that those points would have been better aired in the European Parliament this week.  It is right that I should mention how well the Irish Presidency of the Community was accepted and how highly it was praised by all European Parliamentarians.  The dynamism of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in pursuance of the Presidency changed a lot of old inbuilt ideas about the Irish throughout Europe, particularly in Britain.  There the advent of the Irish Presidency was looked upon as a possible disaster for the EEC but, at the end, those ideas were changed 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>The highlight of our presidency was the signing of the Lomé Agreement which allowed the EEC to help the less well off countries of Africa.  Those involved in that Lomé Agreement owe a debt of gratitude to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for pursuing that convention to a successful conclusion. However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was as successful in pursuing other areas of policy in the Middle East and the United States.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs carried out his work with great vigour.  This country got its greatest boost by being able to produce a Government Minister who had the ability and the stamina to cover so much ground and be involved in discussions on so many policies in that six months.  I hope that in the next few months sanity will return to this Parliament to allow us to continue the work we have been doing in the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>During the course of his contribution to this debate the Minister for Transport and Power referred to the fact that Members on this side of the House had not read the energy agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>On two occasions today the Minister made that incorrect accusation.  I read the agreement and I am aware that my colleagues read it. The Minister also stated in Cork on 6th June that Members on this side had not read the agreement.  All reports of the debates on the agreement <Col N="1630" /> will show that Members from this side considered it in detail.  We are convinced that that agreement was not for the benefit of this nation.  I am not going to repeat the reasons we have given for this because they are already on the record.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power today said we had suggested that this country should join OPEC. Nobody from this side suggested that we should join OPEC.  I take it the Minister was referring to Deputy O'Malley, who said that we should be exploring the possibilities OPEC could hold for us in the light of, hopefully, our becoming a producer nation.  It is right that we should be exploring that possibility because we seem to be on the threshold of becoming a producer nation, despite the fact that the Minister for Transport and Power said today that we have no evidence of oil in commercial quantities off our coast.  We hope it is more than a possibility that we will have oil in commercially viable quantities.  For that reason we should explore the prospects of a link with OPEC.</P>
      <P>Some people wrongly feel that only Arab countries can be members of OPEC.  Venezuela is a member of OPEC and I do not think one could say the economy of that country has much in common with the Arab countries.  However Venezuela sees her future lying in being a member of OPEC rather than joining the consumer group of nations.  As I have explained, we did not say we should join OPEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also said we contended that the USA, Japan and Holland could exercise enough voting strength, more than 40 per cent, for a majority decision.  Nobody on this side of the House said that.  What we said was&mdash;and I was one of those who said it&mdash;that the USA, Canada and Holland jointly could exercise sufficient voting strength in excess of 40 per cent; and the reason we singled out these three countries was that, as everybody who knows anything about oil companies knows, these are the home countries of the multi-national oil companies&mdash;the USA, Canada, <Col N="1631" /> and Holland because of Royal Dutch Shell.</P>
    <P>The Opposition were also accused by the Minister of criticising the USA.  The Official Report will show that we did not criticise the USA but that we criticised the multi-national oil companies, and it just so happens that some of them are to be found in the USA.  We all know the power these companies can wield even in world politics.  There was an instance of that away back in 1956 at the time of the Suez crisis.  The crunch came when Britain and France went into Suez, and the big question mark was: should the United States go in?  It is a well-known fact that the then Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, favoured going in, but the power behind the scenes in the multi-national oil companies succeeded in changing his mind.  Hence the other two nations had to pull out of Suez.  I am not saying they should not have done so, but I am just exemplifying the power exercised by these companies on their governments, in this instance, the USA.  Therefore I refute the suggestion that we were criticising the United States; our criticism was aimed at the multi-national oil companies.</P>
    <P>Another point we made was that this agency created a confrontation between the consumer countries and the producer countries.  The Minister for Transport and Power denied this. As far as I know, there have been two efforts to bring the producer countries and the members of this agency together in Paris, and both of these meetings broke up in disarray. That is confrontation, and the oil producing countries see it as confrontation, in the main, by consumers, with one or two exceptions in the case of importers.</P>
    <P>Again in regard to voting, we would ask why, when the system of voting was being decided, was it decided on the basis of oil imports rather than oil consumption?  If it was based on imports instead of consumption, the United States and Canada would not have the voting strength they now enjoy within this agency, because the United States <Col N="1632" /> import only 20 per cent of their oil needs and produce the other 80 per cent.  They could be completely self-sufficient, but, like the good businessmen they are, they tend to spare their own resources as far as they can.  Canada is self-sufficient in oil.  If the voting strength were based on oil imports rather than oil consumption, that would be much fairer to countries like ours who, as yet, have no oil resources at all.</P>
    <P>France has been mentioned as not joining the agency and we can only guess the reason why.  However, since the other members of the EEC have joined and France is a major partner in the Community, they must believe, as we on this side of the House believe that even if we never find oil, it is possible to procure your own sources of oil.  The difference between France and ourselves is that they have full refining capacity; we have only 50 per cent. I must repeat what has been so often said already: that since the oil and energy crisis, which has increased our oil bill from £30 million to over £200 million, we have taken no visible steps to meet a similar crisis in the future.  If there was a repetition of the October, 1973 crisis&mdash;and there is no reason to believe it could not happen&mdash;we would be caught with our trousers down around our ankles.</P>
    <P>As we have been saying since 1973, our first aim should be to be self-sufficient in refining capacity.  We still have the same capacity, 50 per cent. It takes three years from the time you turn the first sod, to build an oil refinery. Apart from what we read in the newspapers&mdash;and there is only one proposal in the news at the moment &mdash;there is no evidence of the construction of an oil refinery in the near future.  There were three definite proposals for oil refineries as we were leaving Government.  I do not know if the three proposals are still there. One of them was in some difficulty recently about land options down at Shannon.  It seems these proposals have not been taken any further.  We are in the same position as we were in 1973.  This energy agency can be of no benefit to us.</P>

      <P>Before the House rises I wish to refer to next week's sittings.  The intention next week is that the Dáil should not sit until 3 o'clock&mdash;that is, the ordinary time according to Standing Orders&mdash; next Tuesday.  That will be a change from our normal procedure or what unfortunately has become normal over the last three or four weeks of sitting at 10.30 on Tuesday mornings, and it will represent a loss in solid debating time for the Wealth Tax Bill of three hours.  However, the Government intend to make up the lost three hours by sitting until midnight on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.  I am not asking the House to order that at <Col N="1634" /> the moment; there is no need to make an order because Standing Orders provide that, in default of any other arrangement, the House will meet at 3 o'clock.  I merely say it for the information of the House and others whose working depends on the arrangements of the House.</P>
