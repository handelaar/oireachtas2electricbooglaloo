      <P>A remark which I made last night concerning Deputy O'Malley was described by the Chair as being a political charge and I said I did not intend to cast any reflection on Deputy O'Malley.  Unfortunately notwithstanding that, Deputy O'Malley and his colleagues have asked for the withdrawal of the comment I made and in the circumstances, as a contribution towards reasonable discussion, I am disposed to withdraw the remark.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I spoke of the welcome move to provide more accommodation for the National Library.  While I am not completely satisfied with the complete plan and would like to see a composite building on the one site comprising the complete library, until that can be done we must accept the action of the Department to provide much-needed extra space.</P>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us if the Government have decided on the adoption of any part of the Devlin Report.  If this report were adopted it would have a considerable effect on the Office of Public Works.  The planning involved here may be hindered by uncertainty and, consequently, it would be in the national interest if the Government decided on their attitude to that part of the Devlin Report which deals with the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>With regard to the National Library in Kildare Street, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that ramps are erected at the entrance to the building in order to facilitate people who use invalid chairs or those who are not 100 per cent mobile.  The Office of Public Works should ensure that this work is carried out at every public building.</P>
      <P>There is much in the Estimate to be welcomed and praised.  I mentioned previously that the State purchased 57 acres of land at Tara and this is a welcome move.  Perhaps this historical area might be structured as part of a national park.  By this I mean there should not be any buildings on the 57 acres and, if it is possible, it should be extended so that the ancient site at Tara is preserved and is not despoiled by any buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred <Col N="1993" /> to the concert hall at the Aula Maxima at UCD.  We are disappointed that we will not get the new concert hall that was planned many years ago for the site at Haddington Road.  That site is being developed piecemeal.  A new post office exchange and a new office for the Geological Survey Office have been erected but there does not appear to be an overall development plan for the site.  The gardens at the site at Haddington Road have a most unkempt appearance and if a few men were employed to mow the grass and plant some flowers and trees it would change the appearance totally.  The State is acting as a despoiler of sites in that area.  I accept that it is necessary to spend money on office accommodation but I am objecting to the fact that there is no overall plan for this site.</P>
    <P>The site has historical attachments and the Board of Works should come forward with a bold development plan.  It has been finally decided by the Government that they will not proceed with the memorial hall to the late President John F. Kennedy there. The site is a very valuable one.  It could be developed into office accommodation and private housing.  A start has been made in private housing in the houses that were purchased to make way for the proposed memorial hall and old people are now living in these.  Mixed development would be the ideal.  There are some derelict sites adjacent and Dublin Corporation should be allowed to develop these for the provision of more old people's flats.</P>
    <P>The concert hall in Earlsfort Terrace will not meet full requirements but, in times of financial stringency, I suppose the converted Great Hall is better than nothing.  Trinity College purchased the disused St. Mark's Church and thereby prevented the site being used for a factory, perhaps, or warehouses.  The college authorities are to be commended on setting this example; it is one the Office of Public Works could follow in regard to Beggar's Bush.  A great deal can be done with old buildings and derelict sites.</P>
    <P>We have a progress report on the <Col N="1994" /> Royal Hospital at Kilmainham. Restoration was very costly but it was well worth doing.  I do not know if the public have access to the building. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us what the position is when he is replying.</P>
    <P>The decision to provide a new Garda headquarters in the Phoenix Park is welcome.  We should look at the various barracks not alone in the city but throughout the country.  I believe these barracks should really be community centres where people could go for advice and guidance.  The gardaí should not be looked on as enemies of the people but as their protectors. There is need for a change of outlook.  The barracks in Irishtown is badly in need of replacement.  It is a most forbidding building.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary in conjunction with the Department of Justice to proceed with all haste to provide a new station there.  The Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice could well evolve a totally new concept of Garda barracks.  We have a tradition of being critical of our police force, but I think that is now changing.  The title could well be changed from &ldquo;barracks&rdquo; to &ldquo;community centre&rdquo;.  Old people who are being maltreated by thugs are looking more and more to the gardaí for protection.  This should be encouraged and it could be encouraged by making these barracks places where people could seek guidance, help and advice.  We shall have to adopt a new attitude towards investment in these barracks.  With proper barracks I suggest we would have fewer people in prison.</P>
    <P>I am glad reconstruction work is going ahead in Dublin Castle.  The new building is almost completed.  It stands out in sharp contrast to the medieval structures still there.  I thought there would be a public outcry about this but there has not been. The design is 20th century and in years to come people here, discussing Dublin Castle, will be able to contrast the old with the development in the 1970s and judge whether or not progress was made.  Today's architects have provided something their predecessors <Col N="1995" /> could not provide, namely, plate glass windows.  While these may perhaps be criticised the personnel working in the offices are very pleased with them.  The Office of Public Works is to be congratulated on its perseverance in redeveloping the Dublin Castle area.</P>
    <P>I am glad further progress has been made on Scoil Eanna.  This is a place to which people can go to find that history is almost tangible.  There is a small but very beautiful park.  I commend the work done and I suggest the Office of Public Works should press ahead more speedily on what remains to be done.</P>
    <P>I understand the OPW still owns part of the site of the ancient fort at the Pigeon House.  It may have been the spot at which Cromwell landed, though there is nothing to substantiate that.  It is being developed as a huge ESB complex; one of the biggest stations in the country is going up there.  It has historic connotations.  The remains of the old fort are still there. Within living memory it was occupied by the British Army and by our own troops on the foundation of the State. It is full of history.  Wolfe Tone tells how he spent his holidays close to it. The Office of Public Works should examine the area; such an examination would be well worth while.  I believe the OPW would be very pleased to carry out an investigation.</P>
    <P>The restoration work being carried out on the Casino, Marino, is very laudable.  This is a most beautiful building and while I do not suggest we turn it into a casino or gambling place I should like to state that none of us would begrudge money being spent on it.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking the Office of Public Works has set a high standard in the preservation of ancient monuments and buildings and we should record our appreciation of that work. Such buildings as Dublin Castle and the Royal Hospital have been well preserved. I should like to see these activities extended because, with the passage of time, our historic buildings will be ruined if we are careless about them.  We should ensure that our generation <Col N="1996" /> passes on to future generations in a good condition historical monuments that date back many centuries.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I referred to the archaeological preservation work being carried out at Wood Quay in Dublin.  In this connection I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education say that the Government were satisfied with the excavation work being carried out there.  This is a most historical part of Dublin dating back to the Vikings and Normans.  Dublin Corporation have recovered a lot of items used by those people.  I agree that the work is being carried out correctly but I feel the Government should make a gesture by providing extra money for the work involved.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Garda Band I should like to point out that the new image of this band is welcomed by our citizens.  At a recent football match the conductor of that band gave an object lesson in public relations. There is no doubt but that this conductor rates as the most popular garda in the Force.  He has interpreted the spirit of the age with regard to music magnificently.  Our citizens showed their appreciation of his ability at that football match.  They warmly applauded the band also.  If that band requires any new equipment or additional members they should be given it without delay.</P>
    <P>As Dublin City expands it is good to know that plans were drawn up many years ago for the decentralisation of Government Departments.  The moving of such Departments to provincial towns would be a great boost to those areas.  It would also result in better working conditions being provided for our civil servants.  We experienced some trouble recently over bad conditions but I believe that the decentralisation policy, if pressed ahead, will mean better working conditions for the staff involved.  It may be costly but it will be worth while.</P>
    <P>The Botanic Gardens continue to be kept at a high standard.  However, I would be obliged if the Parliamentary Secretary could do something about cleaning the River Tolka; it should be <Col N="1997" /> cleaned and deodorised.  Those who visit the gardens, and the people living in the vicinity, complain continuously about the unpleasant odour from the river.  Any money spent in the upkeep of those gardens is a good investment. They are regarded as a botanical university by students of botany and horticulture. Schoolchildren also find them very educational.</P>
    <P>With the expansion of our diplomatic consular service abroad we should avail of the opportunity afforded by establishing more embassies to display products produced here.  The Office of Public Works, in conjunction with the IDA, should investigate this matter.  We are not wealthy enough to maintain an embassy simply as a residence for an ambassador, and in an unobstrusive way we should display products produced at home.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not devote very much of his Estimate speech to the canals.  We have been promised that these will be taken over by the Office of Public Works but so far there is no evidence of that.  Canals can be made into things of beauty. I should like to compliment those who cleaned part of the Royal Canal last weekend.  Members of this House were involved in the cleaning of part of the Grand Canal.  I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to that portion of the canal at Ringsend Basin.  In the past this huge expanse of waterway was used to take ships carrying coal and malt on the canal system but this trade has ceased. The canal is now used to take yachts to the River Shannon.  That area could be developed into a pleasure land for the people of that part of the city.  The Parliamentary Secretary should ensure that Ringsend Basin is not neglected and, if possible, have it developed as an amenity for the area.</P>
    <P>While we may have some decentralisation of civil service staff we have to face the fact that in the near future a million people will be living in the greater Dublin area.  Therefore, we must ensure that we retain every possible open space and develop it as an amenity for the people.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, <Col N="1998" /> can tell us when the canals will be taken over and also let us know if there are any innovations planned for the improvement of the canals and their preservation.  It is very essential that this work be undertaken.  Any Deputy who has visited Strasbourg has seen how the French have preserved their canals and how they are used for pleasure as well as for carrying merchandise. I believe we can make our canals as beautiful as those in Strasbourg. This will take money but it will be money well spent.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary can tell us when the canals will be taken over by OPW and what future plans they have for them.  There was an announcement the other day that Lough Allen canal on the Shannon has been improved.  This was a very welcome statement but it shows that we have not got an overall plan for the development and preservation of our inland waterways.  This work is being done piecemeal.</P>
    <P>We should have a white paper from the Department of Finance on the development of our inland waterways. Much has been published mostly by private concerns, people who are naturally anxious to preserve our canals, but the Government should produce a policy on the future of the Royal and Grand canals in this city.  The city part of the Royal Canal has deteriorated, although the people on the north side of the city a few weeks ago started to clean up that canal.  This shows people are willing to back the Government in making those waterways into something of beauty and perhaps utility also.  Our partners in the EEC will not be very thankful to us if we neglect our waterways.  We have seen the fine examples of what most of them have done in the preservation and development of their waterways.</P>
    <P>As far as I know the Office of Public Works are in charge of some of the statues in the principal streets of the city.  Perhaps they would, in consultation with Dublin Corporation, have a look at the sites of those statues and see if they could be improved. The O'Connell statue is a very <Col N="1999" /> fine one but it could be given a better setting.  I would not like to see it removed from its present site but some foliage should be planted around it to cool down the harshness of all the stonework in O'Connell Street and the statue itself.  Some of the statues in O'Connell Street, other than the O'Connell statue and the Parnell statue might need to be removed.  The OPW and Dublin Corporation should get together and see if some of these statues could be resited in order to improve the scenic aspect.  I look forward to the Parliamentary Secretary's reply on the few points I have raised especially on the future of the canals. Many people throughout the country would welcome a statement.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could tell us if the Devlin Report in respect of the Office of Public Works is to be implemented and, if so, when.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary and his staff on the manner in which this Estimate was introduced and the amount of information made available to Deputies.  I want to refer, in particular, to the work carried out by the Office of Public Works under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, as I am not satisfied with the progress made in recent years.  More money should be allocated for this purpose. We have a high inflation rate and the cost of machinery under the arterial drainage heading must be increasing by a large percentage monthly.  Up to 15 per cent of the money provided under this heading should be devoted to minor drainage schemes to be carried out by local authorities.  They should be empowered to carry out those schemes even if it is necessary to bring in an amendment to the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  If money was given to county councils and local authorities for minor drainage schemes it would help many land owners as well as provide a fair amount of employment in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial investment in drainage work is urgently required.  Thousands of acres of land in many parts of rural Ireland are badly in need of drainage. Landowners in some areas can utilise <Col N="2000" /> only portion of their land for a limited period every year.  It is in the interests of everybody that minor drainage schemes are carried out by county councils acting as agents for the Office of Public Works.  Schemes should be devised on the same lines as the local improvement grant schemes, which are operated at the moment by county councils under the Department of Local Government.  Money so spent would be a sound national investment.</P>
    <P>More money should be provided for the Office of Public Works for various schemes, particularly having regard to the high rate of unemployment.  There is no other State Department which could utilise money to the same effect. For instance, increased sums should be provided for the repair and improvement of piers, harbours, primary schools, Garda stations, post offices and the development of national parks.  Expenditure on such works would alleviate the unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>A survey should be carried out immediately of Garda stations and primary schools and there should be a five-year programme of reconstruction in order to bring these premises up to proper standard, and they should be suitably equipped and furnished to provide maximum comfort for those who have to spend a good deal of time in them.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a good deal of duplication as between the Department of Education, the Department of Justice and the Office of Public Works. This involves a good deal of time being spent, even daily, in consultation.  Inspectors and managers must consult with the Office of Public Works before work can commence.  A considerable amount of time is spent by officials of both Departments in consultations relating to the same matter, such as the building of a primary school, examination of plans for the construction or improvement of Garda stations or other public institutions.  One Department should have responsibility for the work, either the Department of Education or the Department of Justice in respect of work under their control, or alternatively the Office of Public Works should have sole responsibility for the work once they receive instructions from the Department to proceed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2001" /> I could never understand why expenditure in respect of maintenance of drainage schemes should be recoverable from local authorities.  The State bears 100 per cent of the cost of the work but the maintenance is a charge on the local authority.  The State should bear the full cost of maintenance.  Local authorities should not be forced to meet this charge particularly when they have no say in regard to the system of maintenance or any aspect of it.  The time has come when the State should bear the full cost of maintenance of drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>The cost is a county at large charge whereas a scheme may benefit only a few parishes.  Now that there appears to be a swing away from the colleclection of money from rates and to State subsidies the Parliamentary Secretary should make representations to the Government to have this charge removed from local authorities and transferred to the Exchequer.  The Parliamentary Secretary could put up a good case for doing this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be advocating legislation, which would not be in order on an Estimate.  I have given him some latitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Numerous schemes for coast protection work have been submitted to the Office of Public Works.  Only limited action has been taken in respect of them.  It would be physically and financially impossible to have all the schemes carried out simultaneously but greater progress should be made in carrying out work on these schemes.  From my own personal experience I know that valuable amenities not alone to counties but to the nation are being eroded and destroyed by the sea.  The sea is a mighty force and can at times do untold damage.  The Office of Public Works should tackle this problem with a greater sense of urgency. Again, should extra money be made available for this purpose it would greatly alleviate unemployment in the maritime counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2002" /> should ensure that the best advice in the world is made available to his office for the carrying out of coast protection schemes.  Many systems are available and different methods must be used in different areas according as the nature of the amenity to be protected dictates.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the various public offices for which the Office of Public Works are responsible and where I believe improvements could be made. There appears to be more than duplication all over the country in many provincial towns.  We have pension offices, Department of Social Welfare offices, labour exchanges, land project offices, Department of Agriculture offices, and customs and excise offices. In many of these towns each of these offices is situated in a different area. A survey should be carried out straightaway with a view to bringing all these offices into the one building in some part of the town.  I would not be worried as to whether the Government purchased or leased a building or constructed a suitable premises for this purpose.  It would certainly be in the public interest as well as in the interest of efficiency to do so, and in the long-term a vast amount of money could be saved.</P>
    <P>A list of national monuments should be complied by the Office of Public Works county by county and published in booklet form.  It would not cost that much to provide the booklet or to erect a plaque on each national monument with about six to eight lines stating for the benefit of visitors its age and what it stands for and why it was declared a national monument.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have a great responsibility for the protection of our architectural heritage, and there is no other office or Department suited to undertake such a task.  They have the expertise and the proper administrative structure to cope adequately with the protection of our architectural heritage.  I realise that the only problem is, perhaps, finance, but again money spent in this direction would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works should also get educational programmes under way to encourage our young <Col N="2003" /> people to take an interest in our heritage. We have a greater opportunity than any other country in western Europe to launch such educational programmes, particularly when we bear in mind that over 31 per cent of our population, practically one out of every three, is under the age of 14 years.  This should prove conclusively that it is vitally necessary to launch educational programmes in this regard and in many other fields also.</P>
    <P>I was glad to learn that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Office of Public Works decided to allocate money for the improvement of sanitary services at Muckross House in Killarney.  This has been long overdue; personally, I was often worried in case of a fire occurring there.  It is well to know now that a reservoir will be constructed there.  I am and I have been particularly concerned about the untreated sewage flowing into Muckross Lake adjacent to the National Park in Killarney.  I am glad a start has been made on alleviating these problems. There is a definite sense of urgency about them.  The Parliamentary Secretary should try to carry out all the works within the next year instead of within the next two years as is envisaged.  It would not cost so much extra.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to see that a tertiary treatment plant is being constructed. There seems to be a conflict of view between the Department of Local Government and other State Departments as to suitable treatment works for sewage.  I believe that the Office of Public Works are taking no chances in providing the tertiary treatment plant in Killarney.  The local UDC provided a treatment unit recently and it is now the subject of great debate whether tertiary or third stage should be used.  I believe the Office of Public Works have made the right decision in deciding to provide full treatment in the one stage.</P>
    <P>Great work is being done in the Bourn-Vincent Park in Killarney.  Improvements were commenced there about seven years ago and the new facilities can be seen to be used to great advantage daily.  These improvement <Col N="2004" /> works which are being carried out are substantial.  The Office of Public Works should also commence substantial improvement works in the Kenmare Estate which was acquired about three or four years ago by the State.  This estate is nearer the town than the Muckross National Park and if it were developed more rapidly it would be used more extensively by the public and by visitors.  The Parliamentary Secretary should arrange that a programme of works be designed and implemented as soon as possible in respect of the Kenmare Estate.</P>
    <P>The State should make some practical use of the residence on that estate, which I hope will not be left vacant for as long as Muckross House was left vacant.  This residence could be put to numerous uses.</P>
    <P>Facilities for youth should be provided in the National Park in Killarney.  I raised this matter recently here with the Parliamentary Secretary. I can see the difficulties and problems, but there is a demand by the National Youth Council of Ireland for camping facilities for youth in the National Park as well as a demand by local youth organisations, particularly by local youth administrators who look after the youth coming to Killarney.  These people are convinced that camping facilities should be provided there.  I know that at present the ancillary services for camping sites are not available in the National Park but these should be provided&mdash;toilet and water facilities.  This could well be done in the near future when the programme of works for the improvement of sanitary services in the National Park is being carried out.  I understand there is a special reference in the deed of trust under which the estate was transferred to the nation, to the effect that facilities or concessions should be made available for youth in this park.  The Parliamentary Secretary should check this because if so there is an obligation on the State to provide camping facilities and comply with the wishes of the National Youth Council of Ireland and the administrators of local youth organisations which cater for youth when they come on camping weekends to Kerry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> Now that the State owns so much land around the Lakes of Killarney they should provide more recreational facilities there.  Facilities for boating on the lakes would be a great attraction. In this regard the Office of Public Works could provide small piers and slips and also an information booklet indicating those areas of the lakes which are safe for boating and those which are dangerous.  The booklet could give details also of interesting routes in the lake area and of the history of the islands.</P>
    <P>A few years ago there was carried out a survey of the Killarney valley. So far as I know that survey was conducted under the auspices of the Office of Public Works.  In the report which was issued special mention was made as to the part that could be played by the Office of Public Works and by local authorities in the development of the lakes as a recreational amenity. Because of their expertise, their structure and their personnel, the Office of Public Works are in a position to take the initiative in this regard.</P>
    <P>It was a step in the right direction to have acquired lands at Derrynane for the purpose of the development of a national park there.  It is an area which lends itself ideally to such a facility.  I suggest that the State acquire as much land as possible in this region as it comes on the market.</P>
    <P>It is important that great care be taken in the development of national parks and also in regard to their management. In this context there is much to be learned from the Dower Report published in England some years ago. In that report, a national park was defined as, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...an extensive area of beautiful and relatively wild country in which, for the nation's benefit and by appropriate national decision and action, (a) the characteristic landscape beauty is strictly preserved, (b) access and facilities for public open-air enjoyment are amply provided (c) wildlife and buildings and places of architectural and historic interest are suitably protected, <Col N="2006" /> while, (d) established farming use is effectively maintained.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that, in the national interest, no area is designated as a national park unless it can comply with that definition.  It is vitally important that the characteristic landscape beauty of an area to be developed as a national park be preserved strictly and that no development works be carried out which would interfere with the amenities of the area.  It is important, too, that access and facilities for public open-air enjoyment are provided at all national parks.  Much work in this field has been carried out during the past ten years but much remains to be done.  We must ensure too, that wildlife and buildings of architectural or historic interest are protected suitably in our national parks.  The Office of Public Works have available the expertise and the information to ensure that this protection is afforded.</P>
    <P>It would be well worth while undertaking a study of wildlife in our national parks.  I would agree with any proposal the Parliamentary Secretary might put forward for extra funds for this purpose.</P>
    <P>It was stated in the Dower Report that established farming use should be effectively maintained in national parks.  In this regard, I emphasise the word &ldquo;established&rdquo; because I would not wish to see national parks being developed in the agricultural sense.</P>
    <P>There appears to be some conflict between the activities of the Office of Public Works and the Forestry Division in relation to some national parks. I have seen instances of the Office of Public Works developing amenity schemes while the Forestry Division engaged in planting activities which did not take these amenities into consideration. Particular note should be taken of this.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have referred to the accommodation in Leinster House.  I should like to compliment the staff for their courtesy and efficiency.  I should also like to compliment the officers of the Office of Public Works for their high standard of courtesy to Members of this House and to the public generally. <Col N="2007" /> They have been most helpful to me in my dealings with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main, if not the sole, purpose of my intervention in this debate is to refer briefly to Fota Island. I wish once more to protest at the failure of the Minister for Finance and the Government to acquire Fota estate for the people of Cork city and county and for the nation.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary referred to the Dower Report.  It cannot be denied that Fota Island with all its amenities comes within Dower's definition of a national amenity.  People are well aware of the tedious details and facts of this long, sad saga and I do not intend to delay the House by referring to them in detail.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is well aware of the facts.  He was present when the Minister for Finance received two deputations consisting of Members of the Oireachtas from Cork city and county, members of the county council, officials, engineers and other experts from the local authority.  The deputation put forward an unanswerable case for the acquisition of Fota Island by the State but despite all the arguments advanced by the lay and professional people on the deputations it was to no avail.  The Minister listened patiently on two occasions but he refused point-blank to consider the purchase of the estate. I and other members pressed him for his reason and he said that it did not constitute a national amenity, the inference being that it was only of local importance.  We asked him to state what constituted a national amenity in relation to property of this kind as against a local amenity.  He was asked what criteria were applied by his Department or by the Office of Public Works in their assessment of Fota Island but he failed to give a satisfactory answer.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that Fota Island comes within the definition of a national amenity as set out in the Dower Report.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his opening statement gave a definition of an amenity area or a public park.  He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of these parks while <Col N="2008" /> providing very attractive recreational facilities for visitors&mdash;home and foreign&mdash;will ensure that representative samples of our most important ecosystems and scenic areas will be conserved.</P>
    <P>I submit that Fota estate comes within that definition also.</P>
    <P>This matter was dealt with in detail in meetings with two deputations and it was the basis of a motion tabled by the Opposition.  The Minister was again pressed to give the reasons for his refusal to acquire the estate and he gave the same answer.  He was asked how one could assess what was a national as distinct from a local amenity but he did not give any reply. However, that is all water under the bridge.  The people of Cork will neither forget nor forgive the Minister for Finance and the Government for their failure to grasp this unique opportunity of acquiring this most valuable property for the people of Cork, for the general public, for visitors and tourists.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the latest chapter in this saga.  I am sure the Government and the Minister for Finance know now that it is the intention of University College, Cork, to purchase this estate.  They have an option on the property.  The college are interested only in the agricultural land.  The gardens, the house, the arboretum and the amenity area generally would only be a liability to the college or to any person who might acquire the property, be he a farmer or a speculator.  The main reason for my intervention here is to appeal now to the Minister for Finance to provide the money for the upkeep and maintenance of this amenity area, which includes the arboretum, the parkland, the gardens and possibly the house; the latter is of extreme archaeological and historical importance.  If the Government and the Minister were to accede to this request they would be getting very lightly off the hook.  I do not believe maintenance costs would be very high.  The Office of Public Works is the only agency with the staff, the expertise and the experience to do this kind of work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2009" /> I have this request down to the Minister for Finance in the form of a Parliamentary question and I hope his reply will be satisfactory.  I hope he will accede to this request, a request I am making on behalf of everybody in Cork, to be responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of this amenity area, if and when it is purchased, be the purchaser University College, a speculator, a group of farmers or anybody else.  The amenity area must be preserved, and the only way it can be preserved is by the provision of the requisite funds by the Minister for Finance and by the carrying out of the work necessary under the supervision of the Board of Works.  If the Minister does that he will go some small distance in making reparation to the people of Cork for the insult and injury done by suggesting that Fota was really a matter of only local importance and not a matter of national importance. This amenity would cater for the best part of half a million people, apart from visitors and tourists.</P>
    <P>It may be no harm to remind the Minister, through his Parliamentary Secretary, that this particular area is an area in which there are no amenities at all available and it is one of the most populous and prosperous areas in the whole county.  It is an area with immense potential in the near future, with the vast increase in the concentration of industry and with prospects of finding oil and gas off the coast, one might say, off Fota.  I hope I have said enough.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, now occupying the front bench on the Government side, to convey this appeal to the Minister for Finance and the Government. Every member of his party in Cork County Council and Cork Corporation was unanimous in requesting, demanding almost, that this be done.  This request was supported by An Taisce, by all the historical, archaeological and other societies interested in public amenities; it was supported by botanists, horticulturists, ecologists and so on.  I make a special appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary now to convey my appeal to the <Col N="2010" /> Minister for Finance.  This is not alone my wish; it is also the wish of the Parliamentary Secretary, his colleagues in both the corporation and the county council and indeed, in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the great delay in erecting Garda stations.  There is a Garda station in Killeagh near Youghal which is almost uninhabitable. I know a site is being sought for a new station and it is about time a site was found.</P>
    <P>With regard to courthouses, I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that recently an order was made by the High Court requiring the Minister for Justice to repair, improve or erect courthouses, to make them habitable or, I suppose, to coin a phrase &ldquo;to make them sittable in&rdquo;. The courthouse in Waterford city has been in an appalling condition for a number of years.  So has the courthouse in Cobh.  No court has sat in Cobh for at least a year.  The building is in a very dangerous condition.  The only time it is used is in the case of adjournments.  A justice has to sit and he adjourns the case to some other court in the area.</P>
    <P>A number of monuments and places of historical and architectural interest in the east Cork area where I live need financial and advisory assistance from the Office of Public Works.  How are the priorities determined in relation to national amenities, Garda stations, schools and so on?  In relation to Garda stations does it depend on the incidence of crime in the particular area or on the strength of the representations made by members of the Oireachtas?  A new Garda station should depend on the needs of the people of the area.  A number of monuments in my area are in a very bad condition. Some people do not even know of their existence.  I will bring them to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I endorse what Deputy O'Leary said about the courtesy and the co-operation of the staff of Leinster House.  I have one criticism to make.  There is what I would call an abomination in <Col N="2011" /> Leinster Lawn.  It is supposed to be a pond which is full of, as far as I could see, stagnant water which is covered by some kind of torn green net and is topped by a fountain which does not work.  That should be a feature of Leinster House instead of being an eyesore.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to enter the House by Leinster Lawn and he will see this abomination.</P>
    <P>I am not completely happy with the Board of Works.  The Parliamentary Secretary's brief is full of promises. The performance has not been so good.  It will take many years before some of the promises in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief come to fruition.  The best thing about the Board of Works is the Parliamentary Secretary.  His talents and time are wasted in that office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to talk about this Estimate as far as it affects my county and the constituency I represent. I am glad to see that the Robe and the Corrib drainage are at an advanced stage and I hope it will not be too long until this scheme is under way.  This has been a very sore problem in my constituency and that of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I believe work is to start next year.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Finance have a difficult job in providing money for various schemes for schools, garda stations, telephone exchanges, navigation and all those other works.  I am convinced that in the serious depression which the country is undergoing any completely unnecessary schemes should be cut out and money should be spent on productive purposes which would be of great benefit to the people and our economy.  I believe the people fully appreciate, no matter what political party they belong to, that the world is undergoing a serious recession and that the money allocated in this Estimate for monuments should not be spent in this difficult year.  It is quite easy to leave those things over until the economy improves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a constituency where drainage is a very serious problem. Between Ballaghaderreen to Ballinrobe, <Col N="2012" /> a distance of up to 45 miles, we have flooding every year.  We had to wait for a cost/benefit survey which takes years to prove that land should be drained.  Any sensible person with any intelligence knows that where land is drained properly it is a help to the people who are living there.  Ten acres of flooded land is very important to a person's livelihood and will help to keep him there but also that land will produce double the amount it is producing at the moment.  This is a great asset to the economy.</P>
    <P>I am not very satisfied with the way drainage is carried out at the moment or the way it has been carried out over the years.  An area of 15 miles along the Lung river is badly in need of drainage.  Roscommon County Council have to allocate money from the local improvements scheme to carry out maintenance work on the Lung River.  This is a failure on the part of the Office of Public Works; that body are not carrying out the duties they were established for in this regard.  Money was not spent wisely on the Moy and the money wasted on that scheme would have completed the drainage needed on the main arteries in Connacht.  I am not in favour of erecting bridges to connect farms at colossal expense.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary has allocated money for the improvement of Kilcummin Pier in Killala.  The improvement of this pier has been mooted by every public representative in Mayo.  It is pleasing that this work will cost the ratepayers of County Mayo very little.  The credit for this is due to the Parliamentary Secretary, and he also deserves credit for speeding up the decentralisation of the Department of Lands and the establishment of offices of that Department in Castlebar.  I am aware that this decentralisation was first mooted by a former Minister, Mr. Ó Moráin. I believe that 150 girls will be transferred from Dublin to Castlebar and I hope they all vote for the Parliamentary Secretary.  Some of these girls will be living within 20 miles of their homes.</P>
    <P>Extensions are required to many schools.  I accept that a big number <Col N="2013" /> of extensions have been carried out and, with the price of material, it is almost impossible to do work.  However, everything possible should be done to improve accommodation in rural schools.  I understand a Garda station is to be built in Kilkelly and in Kiltimagh.  The land was offered but it was probably turned down.  I would be obliged if the Parliamentary Secretary would give me the up to date position in regard to these two stations.  We have to rely on the gardaí in matters of security and they should be provided with proper accommodation.</P>
    <P>A lot of the work scheduled for this year could be postponed for a year or so.  The money allocated to the Office of Public Works should be spent on drainage, providing proper accommodation in our schools and improving Garda stations.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to expedite the drainage work on the Lung River.  We do not want to wait for the cost/benefit analysis to be completed; £30,000 should be allocated for this work.  The carrying out of this scheme would be of great benefit to the farmers of the area.  It is amazing that after they have spent money on fertiliser it should be washed away when the land is flooded by the Lung.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Brosnan was concluding he mentioned that the only person in the Office of Public Works he wished to compliment was the Parliamentary Secretary.  In my view he went a little too far in lauding to such extremes the Parliamentary Secretary.  Like most Members I cannot criticise the Parliamentary Secretary but I should like to make a comment.  He has lost his vocation; he should not be here at all.  Having watched him for the past two years I believe his disarming smile, his political acupuncture qualities, would qualify him better for the field of anaesthetist rather than politician. He has succeeded and continues to succeed in dismissing even trivial criticism and suppressing anticipated criticism with his smile, his wit and his humour.  While for the moment it is an excellent thing, in the long run it might result in Deputies <Col N="2014" /> on these benches having second thoughts about him and endeavouring to bring him down a peg from the high position which he holds on the political pedestal here and in the country.</P>
      <P>As is customary for me on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works, I shall speak in the main about the Phoenix Park.  Gach duine agus a scéal fhéin aige.  Every Deputy here expresses concern for those matters within his own area which are the responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary.  What I am about to say may sound rather revolutionary, and the proposition I put forward may seem unattainable, but I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, realising that he shares my concern for the Phoenix Park, that he should immediately consult Dublin Corporation and the Department of Local Government and all other appropriate agencies in regard to the provision of two underground passes, one east-west, the other south-north, under the Phoenix Park.  It would cost money.  Everything worthwhile costs money.  Having regard to aesthetic, functional, health and recreational considerations, it would be money well spent.  People have talked here about local parks.  The Phoenix Park is a local park, it is a national park and it is an international park. It is a unique possession as far as Dublin and the country are concerned. My concern derives from the so-called progress which inevitably must destroy the amenity of the Phoenix Park.  The tremendous and unwelcome increase in the volume of traffic in the Phoenix Park must, if it does not completely destroy it, take from it those qualities which have made it unique.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In times of increasing pressure on people, when there is pollution in city life, when large numbers of people have to seek psychiatric treatment and have to attend hospitals and clinics, the Phoenix Park is a refuge.  It is the one area in the city of Dublin where a person may retire alone or in the company of family or companion and enjoy freedom.  The tremendous increase in the number of cars has affected the Phoenix Park.  It is contrary <Col N="2015" /> to bye-laws but of late I notice commercial vehicles in the park.  The <i>raison d'etre</i> of the Phoenix Park is that people can retire there and enjoy freedom which is not available to them elsewhere in the city.  Because of the increased cost of living, people are not in the position to travel long distances from the city to quiet places.  This increases the demand on the Phoenix Park.  If I were Parliamentary Secretary I would not allow a continuation of the position that, certainly at weekends, one is afraid to cross a road in the Phoenix Park because of the continuous traffic, and in most cases drivers are not exercising the care which is required by law and which would have regard to other users of the park.  What I say may sound contradictory.  I want people to come to the park but I do not want people to be free to drive cars in all parts of the park.  I do not want the park to be used as a major highway. That is the position that is developing.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works, in consultation with Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council, should consider the anticipated development in Blanchardstown, Clonsilla, Clonee, Dunboyne and Navan.  This development will increase the volume of traffic.  It will mean that the main road in the Phoenix Park will continue to be, as it is at the moment, an arterial road.  If it is an arterial road, the park cannot be the haven of tranquility which it has been and which it must be if it is to be an asset to the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The project that I have suggested will cost money.  The unemployment figures are high.  The carrying out of the project would require expertise and the employment of skilled workers but there would be work in it for unskilled men.  I have not carried out a detailed research as to the cost.  I put forward the proposal as being the only means of preserving this wonderful asset with all its attributes.</P>
    <P>However paradoxical it may sound, the Phoenix Park will continue to be valuable as long as we preserve and maintain it as it is.  The more we yield <Col N="2016" /> to this so-called progress and development the less becomes the value of the Phoenix Park.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary can point to me and say: &ldquo;Deputy Tunney, during 1974, exhorted me to erect traffic lights at Mountjoy corner&rdquo;.  I did that because here again I was concerned, as I am now, for the safety of the people who are using it at the moment.  I was not doing that to indicate that I was in favour of the continuing development of traffic in the Phoenix Park.  However, until such time as other major arrangements are made, we must be concerned for the people in the park.</P>
    <P>I am saying this as a Deputy of a Dublin constituency many of whose constituents are using the Phoenix Park going to and returning from work.  I do not mind if they meet me in the street and say: &ldquo;Are you suggesting we should no longer have the use of the Phoenix Park travelling from, say, Navan Road to Chapelizod&rdquo;.  I shall say: &ldquo;I am not saying that as of now. While such traffic will be tolerated at the moment, I am hoping it will not be tolerated indefinitely and that you and other people who are using the Phoenix Park in that fashion will in years to come have alternative routes by which you will get to your respective employments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As regards the user of the park itself, certain areas should be set apart. People who travel up to enjoy the Phoenix Park should be obliged to leave their cars in certain parking areas.  That again is slightly in contradiction of what I said earlier on in the matter of the freedom of the person to use the park in whatever fashion he or she thinks fit.  But again there must be certain reservations in all the aims we have, and obviously if the freedom of one imposes upon the freedom of the other, it is necessary, for the proper administration and management of the park, that some impediment would be imposed.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I wish to compliment the Office of Public Works and the staff of Phoenix Park for the manner in which they are endeavouring, against big odds, to maintain the Phoenix Park as it has been.  I am disappointed that, possibly due to <Col N="2017" /> shortage of staff, there are certain areas in the park where the grasslands would seem to have merged with the roadways, where the well-kept verges of a few years ago are no longer there, where the standard of pathways seems to have disimproved.  Another small matter which disappoints me is that on the road from Ashtown gate to the Ordnance Survey where some trees were planted two or three years ago&mdash; the bark of those trees was attacked&mdash; whether it was by deer or other animals I do not know, but I am happy that it was not vandals&mdash;and the trees have failed.  They are standing there as monuments of failure at the moment.  The bark has been removed <i>in toto</i> and, from my limited knowledge of how trees grow, I do not think these trees are going to flourish and they should be removed.</P>
    <P>I would be slightly critical also of a situation which arose there last year when some motorist crashed into the Castleknock gate, and the crown of one of the pillars and the broken gate were lying there for at least six months before any repairs were carried out.  It was obvious to me and to everybody else that ultimately repairs would take place, but it would have been better if they had been done immediately rather than later.</P>
    <P>The fact that i refer to such trivial matters is an indication that I have practically no complaint as such.  As I leave the question of the Phoenix Park, I repeat that I am concerned that the officers concerned should look at the serious position arising from the tremendous increase in the volume of traffic and explore every avenue to rectify it and, irrespective of the cost, prepare plans for the underpass or subways I proposed earlier.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the building here.  I am not too sure whether I agree with what Deputy Brosnan said about the pond outside of the House.  I was happy last year that fish had been introduced to the pond and I looked upon the rather unsightly net which covers the pond as a protection, and even though it did not appeal to whatever aesthetic <Col N="2018" /> values I have, I accepted that it was performing a function which justified its being there.  My criticism of the House would refer to its appearance from the Kildare Street side.</P>

      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying give me some information as to the number of national schools that have been built since he took office in March, 1973? A number of schools have been completed and even on completion were found to be inadequate.  Is this because the surveys carried out prior to building the schools were so much backdated? Or is it that there is so much delay from the time the decision is made to build until the school is provided, that the present need is such as to render the schools inadequate? This has happened in my own knowledge to three schools.  I am conscious of the situation where architects are planning school aspects, laying out grounds and school yards and within a year it is all spoiled by the planting of mobile classrooms in the yard or adjacent to the school.  I do not think the schools to which I refer are exceptional. Before the Parliamentary Secretary took office the same thing occurred at Coolmine, Clonsilla.  That school has been built only about eight years and now it is like the trimmings of the rosary&mdash;the additions are larger than the original school.  This must involve a certain waste of resources which I think is unjustifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening about Phibsboro' Post Office?  On what I think was the one day when the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2020" /> was absent and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare answered for him, he informed me that tenders had been accepted for the new post office at Phibsboro'.  He was only confirming information I had already got, and that stage might have been reached earlier when the progressive Fianna Fáil Government were in office.  This post office is not yet ready.  In the jargon of civil servants it is &ldquo;near completion&rdquo; but it has been &ldquo;near completion&rdquo; for many months now. There is little evidence of any great effort being made to complete it.  In this area, as in all other areas in Dublin, there are many residents but it is an area where many elderly people have retired because of the proximity to churches and shopping centres.  I believe there is a greater number of elderly people in need of post office services there than in any other part of the city.  Temporary offices have been provided but in my opinion they are most inadequate and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make a special effort on behalf of those people.</P>

Additions have been made.  Perhaps the gardaí there are happy but if so, they are more easily pleased than I would be.</P>

Marlborough House, Glasnevin, is now gone and I would hope that on that site the Board would continue the small beginning <Col N="2021" /> that has been made in bringing what would be regarded as prestigious buildings to the north side of the city.  I think that plans had been made before the present Parliamentary Secretary's time to have certain Department offices established in Phibsboro' but I was always critical of the fact that some 95 per cent of the higher civil servants live on the south side.</P>

      <P>This is the OPW <i>tee-à-tete</i>, no civil servants.  Again, that is part of the Parliamentary Secretary's strategy.  Seriously, I would ask him to continue the efforts that have been made towards correcting the great imbalance that has occurred in the matter of placing buildings between the north side and the south side.  The corporation have been culpable in this respect.  All credit to the OPW, they have made an effort towards correcting this imbalance and I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to persevere in that effort notwithstanding any pressure to which he might be subjected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I would criticise are the bases of the standards of suitability.  In this regard there are many factors which must be taken into account.  When I speak of areas on the perimeter of the city I have in mind in particular the Finglas/Glasnevin <Col N="2022" /> area.  So far as I am aware all the civil servants housed in Coláiste Caoimhin are very happy in their surroundings. Initially they were apprehensive because of being moved from the centre of things, so to speak, but I doubt if they would be prepared to leave there now.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the same problem will arise when transferring personnel to Castlebar but eventually, no doubt, people will realise how fortunate they are to be moved from the city centre.  I cannot understand how it could be ordained that Fitzwilliam Square, Leeson Street or Baggot Street would be more suitable for staff than Finglas. Apart from everything else, putting staff into those area adds to the traffic problems of the city.  Admittedly, a majority of the staff would not be living in the Glasnevin, Finglas or Ballymun areas.  There might be a problem for the staff in that respect but that is the only problem I can visualise.  If we are serious about decentralisation we should begin by decentralising the city before we think too much of decentralising on a national scale.</P>
      <P>If a case is being made against locating Government offices in Finglas it follows that it would be very difficult to make a case for locating them in Athlone, Castlebar, Ballydehob or elsewhere. I am preaching to the partially converted at least because there is evidence already that the Parliamentary Secretary is putting decentralisation into effect but I am asking that the efforts in this direction be intensified and, where possible, that efforts being made to have these offices in the immediacy of the area in which we speak, be disregarded.</P>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in complimenting the entire staff of the Office of Public Works and, in particular, those associated with this House. I know that the high standard of work we witness here is reflected in all places with which the Office of Public Works are associated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I finish on the revolutionary note on which I began by asking that we be told that at least the possibility of an underpass in the Phoenix Park will be <Col N="2023" /> examined, and that the Phoenix Park be saved for present and future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>To use the Parliamentary Secretary's words, this brief covers a variety of subjects and refers to much of the work carried out by the Office of Public Works during the past 12 months as well as the proposals for the coming year.</P>
      <P>The one aspect of which I have a particular interest is the provision of school buildings.  As I have said before, the staff of the Office of Public Works should use more imagination in the design and building of new schools.  The national school is the focal point in many local communities and from this point of view and, since we are now concentrating on central schools, there should be more emphasis on the wishes of the people generally of an area.  Although school buildings have improved to some extent we see very often that, from a planning point of view, they do not fit in with the local scene.  For instance, many schools have flat roofs which do not lend themselves to the local environment.</P>
      <P>On the question of school heating, although we have moved from the traditional use of turf and coal fires, the present central heating systems are not as effective as they should be.  This is because the average classroom in a country school was not designed for this type of heating.  We usually find two storage heaters in a room, the ceiling of which may be 14 feet from the floor while the windows are old and rattling.  Therefore, while the heating is expensive, it does not do the job required of it.</P>
      <P>There should be greater emphasis placed on the selection of sites for new schools.  Account should be taken of whether a site is good and wide and suitable for various activities. One rarely finds a schoolyard in which there are any types of decent playing facilities for children.  There is no provision for gardening, for instance. In most cases there is no land available for this type of work which would be of immense benefit to the pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2024" /> We must concentrate more on athletics and on such facilities as functions rooms or, as they are described by the Department, general purposes rooms.  These should be equipped for gymnastics and swimming pools should be provided in the larger schools.  I know this will cost a good deal of money but when we consider we are planning for the future it will give a good return.  I am not thinking of anything elaborate with regard to swimming pools but it is vital that an instructor should be available to teach the children the basic rules.  In this country we are at a tremendous disadvantage with regard to swimming facilities when we consider what our friends across the water have available to them. Children from Manchester, London and Birmingham come to my area each summer.  All of them are good swimmers and they take full advantage of the sea while they are in the area but our own children just look on.  This is because they have not been taught swimming or heave not received even the most elementary instructions from swimming instructors. The Office of Public Works might consider the situation that exists here in their future planning.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the position of the school in the local community. There have been new developments with regard to school management, and it appears that in future parents will have a greater voice in the operation of the schools.  It would be worthwhile if schools were designed so as to provide rooms for meetings of local groups.  There is no hall available for such meetings in many villages and as the school is the focal point in the community it might be used for that purpose.</P>
    <P>A recent development is the erection of prefabricated structures where schools require additions.  These structures can be seen in practically every area and I think it is a disgraceful situation.  If planning were necessary most planning authorities would refuse permission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but I would point out that the Office of Public <Col N="2025" /> Works act as agents on behalf of the Department of Education in matters of this kind.  It is the Department who are responsible for drawing up the plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's advice but as agents for the Department of Education the Office of Public Works are probably responsible for matters of design and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>We design as we are told and the question of sites is one for the manager.  If the site is not big enough it is not possible to provide the amenities we all wish.  We act as agents for the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Parliamentary Secretary has said but I am convinced that if a school has to be extended or if it is necessary to provide extra facilities the Office of Public Works have some voice in the matter.  However, I have made the point, and if it is the responsibility of the Department of Education the matter can be taken up elsewhere.</P>
      <P>A serious problem that received very little mention in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement is the matter of coast erosion.  In my county this is becoming a serious problem. During the years the county council did not have any programme to deal with this matter.  The Office of Public Works and local authorities will have to consider this matter because the problem is becoming more serious each year.  Unless immediate action is taken we will reach a point where it will be essential to spend large sums of money to protect property and lands.  I realise there is always the question of whether it is wise to expend money in any particular instance, but prevention is better than cure. Unless something is done quickly in Mayo, the county council and the Office of Public Works will have to meet an enormous bill in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to harbour development, I realise that the Office of Public Works are the agents of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  We will have to consider the whole matter of harbour <Col N="2026" /> facilities.  If we want to plan for the future of the industry it will be necessary to spend vast sums of money. During the years this matter has been tackled in a piecemeal fashion and small sums of money have been spent on local harbours and on the development of existing harbours.  If we are going to expand our fishing fleet, which we shall have to do in the next decade, the whole question of harbour development will have to be examined very seriously.  In Mayo we have development taking place at Ballyglass.  This development is very welcome but it is rather difficult to explain to fishermen and local interests why it takes so long to get development of this kind off the ground.  I believe there is need for more personnel to deal with matters of this kind.  There is greater need for this harbour at Ballyglass.  Because of high fuel costs fishermen are now becoming more businesslike in their approach.  At one time fishermen took, as it were, the day as it came.  Because of investment now in large boats and other economic factors fishermen are adopting a more businesslike approach; they are calculating percentages, profit and loss, and so on.  Every item has to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I believe it will take another 12 or 18 months before we see the development at Ballyglass coming to fruition. There is no reference to it in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief but I presume it is intended to start work there pretty soon.  I understand tenders have been invited.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would let us know what the position is.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the development of the harbour at Clare Island.  It is regrettable that there has been delay here, but the delay is not the fault of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The islanders are anxious to have the harbour extended in order to give a greater depth of water.  From what the Parliamentary Secretary said the extension will not be as great as the islanders want.  Perhaps he would have another look at this and try to meet the wishes of the fishermen and those concerned.  I understand there will be only an 18-inch floatation at low tide.  This would not be adequate <Col N="2027" /> by any means.  Clare Island is fast becoming a very popular tourist area and boatmen are anxious that facilities should be provided so that they will not be entirely dependent on the tides. Roonagh is also tied up with Clare Island and has been on the mat for quite a while.  What exactly is proposed for Roonagh?  I believe it is not suitable for major development but there is room for improving existing facilities. Would the Parliamentary Secretary let us know what it is proposed to do here?</P>
    <P>In the last two years a number of small piers and harbours have been improved along the coast.  One often wonders if the Board of Works or the people who have to pay get the best return for the money spent.  I am thinking of what has happened at Killala.  Perhaps the location was not suitable for a pier but it is regrettable that thousands of pounds have gone into development there without any worthwhile result.  The position now seems to be that, in order to get over what has happened, it will be necessary to spend further sums to provide a proper harbour.  This raises the old question of contract work versus direct labour.  Had a contractor been employed the situation might possibly have been different.  In many instances the Board of Works use machines which are obsolete and do not give the best return.  However, the development of Killala is a delicate matter and perhaps it is better to say as little as possible about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finn referred to drainage. Mayo has a bigger drainage problem than most counties because of the type of terrain&mdash;we have vast areas of bog and so on&mdash;and there seems to be little hope of improving the situation over the next few years.  A very good job was done on the Moy in certain parts of the county.  The moneys available for drainage under local improvement schemes are not at all adequate. There is a need for the introduction of a scheme which would be run between the LIS and the arterial drainage schemes.  Many people in the west are disappointed that EEC money <Col N="2028" /> was not made available for this type of work.  The Regional Fund could have been used for agricultural development. If we had an agricultural development programme we could improve the lot of our farmers greatly and make our land more productive. People in the west were horrified that none of the Regional Fund will be spent there.  There is such a high rate of unemployment and emigration in the west that there is plenty of room for the spending of such money.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of the Moy which has to be carried out annually at a substantial cost is causing a great headache to the people of Mayo.  It appears that Mayo County Council have no control over the figures which are presented to them by the Office of Public Works for this annual maintenance. In a county like Mayo, where the return from a penny in the £ on the rates is lower than most counties, this creates a terrible problem.  The rate in Mayo this year was £9.80 in the £, the highest in Ireland.  This will have to be looked at because with the increase in wages the cost of the maintenance work will continue to rise.</P>
    <P>Many members have spoken about the facilities provided in this House. The examination being carried out is welcomed but it is not before its time. At this time of the year groups of schoolchildren visit the House and this is to be welcomed because they should know about the workings of the Dáil and Seanad.  These tours should be encouraged.  In this respect I should like to compliment the staff of the House for their kindness and help to teachers and pupils on the occasion of their visits.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that a handout be made available for visitors. This handout, giving the history of the House and the procedures in the Dáil and Seanad, could be given to the teachers and students.</P>
    <P>The possibility of opening up our waterways has been mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary.  That would be worth while.  Many people, including foreigners, are anxious to avail of a boating holiday on our waters.  I look forward to the day when our <Col N="2029" /> waterways and canals will open for general use by the public.</P>
    <P>It is pleasing to see that the Land Commission offices in Castlebar are nearing completion.  The moving of this staff to Castlebar will be a great benefit to the town.  However, it is essential that the urban council be made aware of the number of officials likely to be transferred from Dublin and whether they are married or single.  The council need this information in order to prepare housing plans.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to provide more offices in Dublin and throughout the country for civil servants.  In this regard it is not good business for the Government to be renting premises at high rates on an annual basis.  It would be better business for the Government to build offices for the various Departments.  With regard to buildings I disagree with.  In a town in Mayo a scheme of new houses was provided but the Office of Public Works erected a prefabricated Garda station in the midst of them.  I am at a loss to know how planning permission could be obtained for this type of building in this instance.  The conventional type of station should be erected, irrespective of cost.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made reference to national parks.  A good deal of forestry work has taken place in Mayo and, as a result, we have many scenic areas.  I should like to know if there is a possibility of liaisoning the work carried out by the Office of Public Works and the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands.  The area developed at Shramore should be opened for the general public to visit.  This should also be considered in respect of Louisburgh.</P>
    <P>I was informed recently that in the past five years in the region of £5,000 was made available for archaeological development in north Mayo but I understand this money has not been made available yet.  The Parliamentary Secretary can correct me if I am wrong.  I am relying on information passed on to me.  It is a shame that <Col N="2030" /> this sum of money has been withdrawn from a discovery made in the north Mayo area, which was recently featured on television.  This development is of great interest.  It goes back almost 3,000 years.  There is also the aspect of local employment, where approximately 12 men would be employed during the summer months. I find it hard to believe that this money has been withdrawn.</P>

      <P>£5,000.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will do his best to rectify this matter.  His brief was rather disappointing because a lot was mentioned about plans but there does not seem to be much sign of any positive work in it.  I hope, in relation to harbour development, that the Parliamentary Secretary will ensure that there is no slow down and that the works which are planned, particularly for Ballyglass and Clare Island will go ahead as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words on this Estimate and to congratulate the Office of Public Works for the magnificent work they are doing in relation to the restoration work going on in Dublin Castle.  It is a centre for visitors from the United States, Europe and also the citizens of this city.  They are very appreciative of the design and the work carried on there.  I am sorry the Office of Public Works have not got the physical responsibility for the preservation of our schools.  In my constituency, in Artane and in other parts of north-east Dublin the proliferation of these temporary structures is causing great concern to parents and pupils.  They are overheated in summer and are cold in winter.  I appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's office are only the agents for providing these structures but I would like him to use his influence with the authorities to have an end put to these prefabricated structures, which are a blot on our environment, particularly in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that it is proposed to restore the casino in Marino.  I live very close to it and have a great interest in it.  The decision of the Parliamentary Secretary to restore that unique building is welcomed.  I also welcome the announcement regarding the restoration of the Royal Hospital, <Col N="2032" /> Kilmainham.  From the contributions other Deputies have made on this matter many of them agree with me that there should be reconsideration of the setting up of a folk museum there.  I remember reading newspaper reports some years ago welcoming this suggestion.  This city should have a folk museum.  Other countries in Europe have such museums.  The North of Ireland has a magnificent folk museum centre and we have lagged behind in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Phoenix Park.  Some years ago I suggested that the park was underdeveloped, that there were huge expanses of ground there that were not being intelligently utilised.  The Parliamentary Secretary assured me that cattle grazing there would be phased out.  I do not know if that has been accomplished.  An independent study was made of the Phoenix Park by students who put forward proposals whereby that magnificent amenity could be better utilised.  The population of the city is growing and I should like to see more provision made for indoor and outdoor recreational facilities in the Phoenix Park.</P>
    <P>I would urge that the Zoological Gardens authorities should get every assistance in their programme of expansion. The Zoological Gardens provide a wonderful amenity and they are a big tourist attraction.  These considerations should weigh heavily with the responsible Government Department and they should ensure that every reasonable request made by the Zoological Gardens authorities is acceded to.</P>
    <P>An arrangement should be made whereby citizens could visit Government buildings.  Dublin Castle is open to visitors on most days of the week. Iveagh House should be open to the public on at least one day a week, Saturday or Sunday, to give people an opportunity of seeing the magnificent design and interior decor.  There are other buildings under the Government's control which should be open to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Parliamentary <Col N="2033" /> Secretary and his office for the sum allocated for the development of the Lough Allen canal leading from Carrick-on-Shannon to Acres Lake at Drumshanbo.  It is a three-year programme. I was very interested in the project as were other members of the county development team in Leitrim. On numerous occasions we made representations to the Parliamentary Secretary and the officials of the Office of Public Works that this development should be carried out.  We all realise the value that the Shannon has been as a tourist attraction.  Development was carried out there some years ago with the aid of grants from the Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte and the county council.  It was done with a view to attracting English tourists. The number of tourists visiting the place declined when the troubles started in Northern Ireland.  Last year a big number of European tourists came there.  I am glad to inform the House that every available boat was hired for the season.</P>
      <P>It is a great thing that the further development is to take place.  It is hoped and believed that the development will continue as far as the Erne so that people will be able to go by boat from Limerick, through Athlone, Carrick-on-Shannon, the Erne towards Enniskillen.  That is the long-term plan of the Office of Public Works.  A certain amount of preliminary work has to be carried out and some of it is in progress.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to have all of the ground work carried out so that the development can continue.</P>
      <P>There are some serious problems. There is a survey to be carried out. Our friends in Northern Ireland and the British Government are quite prepared to give whatever financial assistance is expected from them.  There is a difficulty in getting engineers out to survey the waterway, which is entirely due to the troubles in the North. There is some preliminary work that could be carried out at this stage by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in existence the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Drainage Board which has rather peculiar powers.  Of the people who are rated, seven, eight, <Col N="2034" /> ten or 12 are selected to be responsible for the cleaning of the canal. They have no authority to touch the bed of the canal.  Their powers are limited to taking the scraws off the canal to prevent flooding.  This board are in a position to estimate what it costs to keep the river free of obstruction and they make the necessary demand on the Leitrim and Cavan county councils who must pay what is demanded although they are not represented on the board.  The Office of Public Works should examine how this board is functioning.  I do not mean to cast any reflection whatever on the members of the board.  In fairness to them, they do a very good job at a cheap cost, but it will represent a problem when the further development of the canal begins and it is at this stage that that problem should be eliminated.  I have no crib whatsoever against the board.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's introductory statement has been referred to in the debate.  Some Deputies on the opposite benches seem to think that there are a number of promises being made but that no work is being done and that not sufficient money is provided.  Last year the estimate was for a nine-month period and the amount spent was £9,951.  This year the provision is for £18,000, which is nearly double the amount, admittedly for a period that is three months longer.  Money is not as plentiful as we would like it to be or as it has been.  Most people will admit that that is not the fault of the Government. Unemployment is running at a very high rate in this country; it is running at the very same high rate as in England, America or any other country you can think of.</P>
    <P>Going around the country one sees, particularly in my own constituency, a number of Garda barracks in a very bad state of repair and needing replacement. Something will have to be done about these barracks to bring them up to a reasonable standard for the people who have to work in them. Whatever the cause of the delay, a site for a Garda barracks is being purchased for the past seven or eight <Col N="2035" /> years in Cootehall, County Roscommon. I have made representations both to the Board of Works and to the Department of Justice but the site has not yet been purchased.  The purchase of this site should be expedited so that this building can be erected there.</P>
    <P>I do not know who is responsible for the planning of schools and their size, but it is certainly between the Department of Education and the Office of Public Works.  It is not unusual nowadays to see a national school, a secondary school or a vocational school that was erected four or five years ago having a pre-fab erected outside it within the next two or three years, or, if not, the school authorities are looking for an extension to it.  It shows a complete lack of planning.  The machinery should be available to see what the intake of pupils is likely to be for eight, ten to 15 years, and a building to accommodate that intake should be provided.  Both Deputies and the public at large are disgusted looking at prefabricated buildings outside our schools.</P>
    <P>As regards drainage, in my constituency the Shannon is now a big problem. Normally, prior to an election, the Shannon is always being drained.  If some people could suck as well as they can blow the Shannon would have been drained years ago.  I fully realise that the drainage of the Shannon is a serious problem involving a tremendous amount of money.  I believe that if a good case were put to the EEC some money might be made available for this work, because it serves a number of purposes.  It would serve boating as well as being of benefit to farmers and householders.  It is very disappointing for a farmer who, two months ago, perhaps, could not get out to put artificial manure on the land and when ultimately the weather becomes favourable and he spreads the manures, the Shannon rises and all the manures are swept into the river, and he has no production.  These people are becoming very disheartened.  The tributaries are also a problem.  There is no end of trouble from flooding of the Suck and <Col N="2036" /> many other rivers.  There is also flooding on the borders of Roscommon and Mayo from the River Lung.  On numerous occasions I have attended meetings and representations have been made to the Office of Public Works, but there is not much sign of these people getting any relief either.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the drainage of the Shannon and its tributaries and suggesting that a request be made to the EEC for money for this purpose.  It does not matter from where we get it but certainly in the next few years something will have to be done about it.</P>
      <P>As regards the transfer of the Department of Lands to Castlebar I think that is a good idea because when one comes to Dublin and one has to go into say, the new offices of the Department of Agriculture, there is no hope of parking a car.  Also, anybody who has any business in O'Connell Bridge House must either walk there or use public transport: there are no parking facilities.  When I was there one day a lady asked me if I would allow her to go before me. I said &ldquo;Certainly&rdquo;.  She said: &ldquo;My husband is driving around the block waiting for me.&rdquo;  This is a desperate situation.  We are obliged to provide some parking space.  If there is no space available in Dublin city there is plenty of it in the remainder of the country.  Therefore, I think a number of offices should be moved out.  This would ease the congestion here.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works act as agents and, consequently, <Col N="2037" /> have no say in the design of the various buildings which are commissioned by other Government Departments.  However, might I suggest that the Office of Public Works convey to the various Departments any suggestions which might be of help in improving designs, and so on?</P>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in regard to this building.  Visitors who come here to meet Deputies are left waiting in a small box room to stare vacantly at whoever might be present. The waiting room to which one is shown on entering the building from Kildare Street leaves much to be desired.  An effort should be made to make it more comfortable for visitors.  It would not do justice to a waiting room at a little-used railway station.  It would help if a supply of reading material were made available there.  Perhaps, too, some light background music might be laid on.</P>

      <P>I had been referring to the provision of facilities for visitors to this House who find it necessary to wait until the Deputies concerned are available to speak with them.  It can be a demoralising experience to spend some time in the waiting room.  The provision of background music might take away from the tension involved for those who must wait there.  A visit to this place to see a Deputy is more like a visit to a prison than to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Other speakers have adverted to the fact that no literature concerning the building is made available to visitors. We should have some sort of booklet giving details of the history of the building.  I have seen Members hand out to schoolchildren a page of headed notepaper.  This is meant to serve as a memento of a visit to the House.  The Houses of the Oireachtas should be held in greater esteem.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, too, a plaque could be provided at some point within the grounds on which would be outlined the history and the development of these buildings.  Much interest is shown by visitors in the flag of the Irish Brigade which was presented by the late, much lamented President Kennedy in 1963. A plaque by the flag sets out the history and involvement of Irish people and it would be fitting if there was a plaque setting out the history of the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, the Office of Public Works, in their capacity as agent for the Department of Foreign Affairs, have the task of furnishing embassies abroad.  I hope that when the embassies are furnished they reflect this country and that the fittings which are supplied by the Office of Public Works are Irish-made and of Irish design.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will verify this when he is replying.  Our embassies abroad should reflect Ireland, our historical past, our culture and our present. They could do much to promote our industries and help our exports.  The Parliamentary Secretary is nodding his head in confirmation of the fact that Irish equipment and furnishings <Col N="2039" /> are used in our embassies abroad.  I should like him to elaborate further on this matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the Commissioners of Public Works and their staff for their efforts in coping with the many demands placed on them because of EEC meetings in Dublin this year.  When attending conferences we take for granted the arrangements made.  Therefore, it was nice to read that cognisance has been taken by visiting diplomats and others of the work done.  Much responsibility has been placed on the shoulders of the staff and it is good to know they rose to the occasion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Glendalough area, the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the wishes of the local people to have an extension to their cemetery and he has met at least one deputation to discuss the matter.  The local people consider that they have a legitimate claim to burial in Glendalough.  The difficulty arises because a preservation order has been placed on the area but despite that it must be possible to obtain space for at least one line of graves.  I had hoped that the Parliamentary Secretary would have told us in his statement that the area was being surveyed and examined from the archaeological point of view.  I realise that it is important to retain intact as far as possible our national monuments and the surrounding areas, but we must strike a balance.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to make some move so that the justifiable request of the local people may be met.  It is not sufficient to express an awareness of the concern of people.  Action must be seen to be under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to enlighten Deputy Esmonde with regard to Glendalough because he is familiar with the problem there.  Possibly it would be a matter for the county council in some way to supply an area for a burial ground.  In this <Col N="2040" /> case the burial ground is almost full but it is an historic area and the local people practically believe it is their passport to heaven to be buried there. Deputy Timmins was involved in the deputation that met the Parliamentary Secretary and he will verify my remarks. There is a preservation order in operation and it rests with the Parliamentary Secretary and the Office of Public Works to provide extra space for Glendalough.  If Deputy Esmonde is in the House when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying he will find the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to elaborate on this matter and be more concise than I have been.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the little chapel at Bray Head.  It is called Raheenachluig.  The only indication given of this chapel is a notice saying the property is in the care of the Office of Public Works and that people should not interfere with it.  I know that this procedure is adopted with regard to many other monuments throughout the country.  Could we not have a small, historical plaque erected at those places?  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would ask his Department to negotiate with Bray Urban District Council who own some land in the immediate vicinity of the little chapel with a view to some kind of development of the area.  I would point out to the Deputies opposite that I will not delay the House too long.  Personally I should like to hear a Government speaker.  I have heard one so far today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If negotiations were entered into with the Bray UDC with a view to developing the site and the little church, it would open up a very scenic area for the local people and visitors.  Not alone could the beauty of the area itself be developed but an exquisite vista would be available right from Bray head to <Col N="2041" /> Killiney and out to Howth across Dublin Bay.  It would be a virtual panorama. Not a great deal of expense would be involved.  Possibly the Tourist Board, eastern region, could also be involved in this development.  Gardens could be laid out and maintained. There are numerous possibilities.</P>

I imagine the Parliamentary Secretary would get a fovourable reception from the authority.  This development would boost tourism in what used to be an important tourist area and which is now going through a transition period.  This would be a good injection and not a great deal of expense would be involved.</P>
      <P>At Killincarrig near Greystones there are the ruins of an old castle.  I understand the Office of Public Works own the adjoining area.  The castle is inaccessible because of briars and undergrowth.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would interest himself in this.  There has been very little mention of it over the years.</P>
      <P>With regard to coast erosion, has anything useful come as a result of contact made with Woodbrook Golf Club which is suffering a good deal from coast erosion?  It is quite some time since I made representations about this.  I am not sure if the club decided to go ahead but in a letter the Parliamentary Secretary told me he would welcome contact with the club in regard to the matter.  I should like to pay tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary for his courtesy and his helpfulness.</P>

    <P>I do not know whether the promenade <Col N="2042" /> in Bray is the responsibility of the UDC or the Office of Public Works.  It is deteriorating very badly.

    <P>The Garda station at Enniskerry has been restored.  The workmanship is first-class and the building blends in beautifully with its surroundings. Some extra cost must have been involved in keeping the facade.  It looks very well in that picturesque village.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred in passing to the destruction of Powerscourt House.  This seems to have been the only reference in his brief to Wicklow.  I have not with me a list of the works under subhead E and possibly Wicklow is mentioned under that subhead, though I do not think so.</P>

I am happy to be able to tell those who do not know, that the gardens are open to visitors, who are most welcome.  People should visit the gardens to see their beauty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has drawn our attention to fire hazards and the difficulty of ensuring that our famous buildings are preserved and safeguarded.  Are the Office of Public Works rewiring those old public buildings, which are under their care? A lot of the wiring in them must be very old and in a dangerous condition. Have the Office of Public <Col N="2044" /> Works undertaken a survey of all the building under their care to prevent a possible outbreak of fire, which might cause their destruction?  It is important that such work be undertaken and that we do our best to prevent disasters like some of those we have had in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that we have lost such a fine building as Powerscourt House but the armoury remains and the gardens are still open to the public.  It is on these occasions that we must give more than a passing thought to the dangers and hazards of fire.</P>
    <P>I was in communication with the Parliamentary Secretary recently relating to arterial works that should be carried out on two small rivers in County Wicklow.  The reply to my query, which I received on 29th May, was not very promising.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by expressing a view widely held by Deputies and Senators relating to accommodation in this House.  The accommodation for Deputies and Senators is far from adequate.  The facilities for Deputies to do intensive work without disturbance are practically nonexistent. <Col N="2045" /> It has often struck me that if there was a more careful use of the accommodation between the Members of both Houses and the staff some advantage might be gained.  I believe there are members of the staff whose presence in the precincts of the House is not necessary and they could be accommodated in the office building in Kildare Street.  We must be the only Parliament in Europe where a Member does not have a private room to work in.  Another matter I should like to mention to the Parliamentary Secretary, and this could be provided for a small amount of money, relates to the business ordered for the Dáil and Seanad.  As the work of the Dáil becomes more complex with meetings of committees of the House being held on a day when either of the two House meets, it is not always easy for Deputies or Senators to know precisely what is going on on any particular day.  I would ask him to consider the provision of a notice board in the hall where the day's programme would be set out.  This would be a great advantage and it could be provided very cheaply indeed.  It will not upset the balance of the Office of Public Works to provide such a notice board.  It is a facility that most people would welcome.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde and I with others are members of the Joint Committee on EEC Legislation and several times, although I was in the House when this committee was meeting and I had notice of the meeting, because of other preoccupations I did not attend meetings that I ought to have attended.  If the time and place of meetings were displayed on a notice board in the hall it would be of great help.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine the ventilation of Leinster House.  Commonly, it is not a question of the air in Leinster House being too warm but there seems to be something wrong with it.  There is not enough oxygen in it.  The atmosphere in this House, possibly due to the activities and fulminations of so many Deputies and Senators, but for whatever reason, is very poor and should be improved.</P>

      <P>I want to talk to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Commissioners about certain national monuments and certain problems that arise in that field.  I should like to associate myself, first of all, with the praise that has been given to the Parliamentary Secretary's office for the excellent work they have done in this and other fields but particularly in the field of parks and monuments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years the State took over Kilkenny Castle and part of the grounds of that castle.  Those parts of the grounds that have been taken over by the Office of Public Works have been laid out in very excellent style and they are now an area of very high amenity indeed in the city of Kilkenny. At long last, after several years of inaction&mdash;and I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary for this&mdash; some work is being carried out on the Long Gallery of Kilkenny Castle, towards its restoration.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to visit Kilkenny and to see what the Kilkenny people have in mind in the restoration of the Long Gallery.  I think he will agree that the project is eminently worthwhile.  What was envisaged by the committee, of which I happen to be chairman, which bought the castle originally from the Marquis of Ormonde was that the Long Gallery be restored first, of course, as well as the rest of the castle and be used when put in fit condition to house some of the pictures and other works of art from the National Gallery.  It is true to say that the Irish people have countless millions of pounds worth of fabulous works of art stored, in safe keeping admittedly, in the gallery in Merrion Square, but the people of the countryside rarely have a chance to see these works.  It would be a great new departure and a new access to very valuable floorspace for the gallery in Kilkenny Castle to be used for the display of such pictures. It was envisaged that exhibitions be held from time to time and changed from time to time, as is common enough practice on the Continent of <Col N="2047" /> Europe, in places such as Kilkenny Castle will be when the present works have been completed.  I commend this project very strongly to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I pay tribute to the Office of Public Works for the really remarkable work they have done so far.</P>
    <P>In the acquisition of the property from the Ormonde Estate quite a large tract of land, I would imagine about ten acres or so, was withheld from the land given to Kilkenny Corporation by the Marquis of Ormonde and the land, nominally at any rate, bought by the Castle Restoration Committee.  There is another strip without which Kilkenny National Park will not be complete.  It is the open parkland that is divided by a rather ugly fence.  Excluded by that fence are a big number of very beautiful trees.  The trees in Kilkenny Castle park are very special indeed.  It is rather like an arboretum.  It is a collection of trees of various species that were planted over 200 years ago. Some of that collection of trees has been cut off.  The Ormonde Estate should be approached in order to find out whether the whole park could not be reintegrated and made one.  If that were so the sense of its being cut off and divided and, in a sense, mutilated would be removed.  This is a project that could be examined.  The best thing that the Parliamentary Secretary could do would be to go to Kilkenny.</P>

    <P>I know the framework as far as national monuments are concerned in which the Parliamentary Secretary must work.  We must begin now to think of national monuments in a different way.  The traditional approach <Col N="2048" /> to national monuments had a rather mawkish outlook on the buildings. They appeared to be dealing in ruined buildings and the emphasis was on preservation and the restraining of vandalism and wanton demolition of the valuable part of our national heritage. It was very good as far as it went but there are constraints on the Parliamentary Secretary that are becoming increasingly intolerable for those who are concerned about our remarkable architectural heritage.  In a sense we are merely the custodians of this heritage for the people who will come after us.</P>
    <P>Since I am talking about one of the very fine examples of national park-cum-national monument that Kilkenny has, across the street from that castle and park are the stables of the castle which have been converted into the Kilkenny Design Workshops, another very interesting building of a different kind being preserved tastefully and well and put to a very effective use indeed.  If you go through the present premises of the Kilkenny Design Centre, you find yourself in the garden of Butler House, which is a third from of house about which we must concern ourselves.  Fortunately for Kilkenny and for Ireland, the Kilkenny Design Centre have taken over Butler House and are restoring it for modern use.  I concede that it would not all, possibly, be quite within the bailiwick of the Parliamentary Secretary; the Department of Local Government would probably come into it as well, and I would hope in the future a Minister for the Environment. However, we have not got these, and so far as the architectural heritage of this country is concerned the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is the country's chief custodian of these things.</P>
    <P>Deputies tend to talk about their own areas: Is teann gach madra ar a urlár féin, and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider certain buildings.  Kilkenny, because of its history and its position, happens to be remarkably well endowed with very fine examples of Gothic church buildings and buildings of other kinds: Merchant's House from the <Col N="2049" /> early 17th century in Parliament Street, the Road House, the Shee Alms House which is somewhat earlier, houses with different functions. What I am concerned about is that the people who preserve these ancient and beautiful buildings like the Dominican Abbey in Kilkenny, the Black Abbey, which this year is celebrating its 750th anniversary, or like St. Canice's Cathedral on the hill, which is the Church of Ireland cathedral and beautifully preserved&mdash; should be assisted, these people, whoever they are, who act as the custodians of these parts of the national heritage, because that is precisely what they are.</P>
    <P>There are other special houses throughout the country.  I mentioned one myself&mdash;the Shee Alms House in Rose Ann Street.  It is private property, but it is important for the State that this building and a thousand buildings like it be, at least, preserved and, most desirably, put into a more useful new life.  I suppose there is hardly a town that has not some interesting buildings.  Some towns and cities are better endowed than others.</P>
    <P>In certain parts of Leinster and Munster there is a type of small castle &mdash;I would call them keeps or fortified houses&mdash;and in many cases they are attached to farmhouses and in others they are in a ruinous condition.  They are part of the living historical record of that part of the country.  They are commonly in the grazing part of the country because they had to do with cattle farming at one time.  The farmers on whose land these buildings are should have certain responsibilities attached to their possession, and in return they should be assisted to maintain these buildings and prevent them from being damaged or destroyed.</P>
    <P>The signposting of national monuments and the access ways to them are not adequate.  The Office of Public Works have worked very valiantly in this area, which is only on the fringe of their responsibility.  There are a great many people who would be almost totally unaware of the existence of these buildings of very high value and interest in their own home localities <Col N="2050" /> because of the poorness of the documentation and the poorness of the signposting which would enable people to go, say on a Sunday afternoon, to visit places like this.</P>
    <P>It is too difficult to see some of these monuments.  I remember bringing some foreign visitors to the Rock of Cashel within the last six months. When we called in the morning&mdash;it was rather early, I admit&mdash;it was not possible to get in, nor was there any indication that I could see when access could be had to the place.  I do not say this in criticism of the people whose business it is to look after the Rock of Cashel.  I know how difficult their job is, but a national monument of such prime importance as the Rock should be easily accessible at all reasonable times.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the constant battle people in the parks and monuments section of the Office of Public Works have against the ever-present operations of vandals.  I saw vandalism in Cashel and Kilcooley and elsewhere, I do not think it is in the present capacity of the Office of Public Works to contain this.  Recently there was a great deal of publicity given to vandalism carried out in the Athenry area and extending further from Clare right up through the province of Connacht.  I have myself seen figures in Cashel smeared with paint and colouring matter.  I have actually seen vandals in action some time ago in Kilcooley.  In areas where there are buildings of very high value such as these there would need to be almost constant supervision, which would cost money, but the alternative is too terrible to contemplate, that the Irish nation would be deprived of these things or have them further mutilated for them by the work of a few thoughtless, selfish people who cannot do anything except demolish things they cannot appreciate or understand.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the development of the national parks side of the parks and monuments branch appears to be thriving especially with the establishment of a national park in Donegal.  I was concerned in recent months, during the oil spillage in Bantry, about what is happening <Col N="2051" /> about that unique little national park, Garnish.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say whether the damage caused by the Bantry Bay spillage will affect Garnish Island park and, if so, in what way.</P>
    <P>When we talked about setting up the national parks and monuments branch it was envisaged that a national park would be the nucleus of a larger area.  When it began to be called a national park area, naturally enough it was mooted that such an area be designated with Kilkenny national park as its nucleus and that it would embrace the Nore and Barrow valleys almost down to Slieve Caoilte, south of Ross, which is a Department of Lands park&mdash;a different kind of park.  I do not believe that the definition of the boundary between the Forestry Division and the Board of Works has yet been resolved.  It should be resolved.  As far as I can see, up to now the function of the Forestry Division has been to grow black pine, Norway spruce, Sitka spruce, larch, contorta pine&mdash; manufacturing timber for the paper and box trade.  It was a cultivation operation.  A national park is quite a a different matter.  I do not mean in any way to denigrate the operations of the Forestry Division but the function of the National Parks and Monuments Branch, in my opinion, would be to preserve first and to develop and expand areas of special amenity value&mdash;that is the current cliché, meaning particularly nice places that we would want to develop.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged in the national parks scheme that the assistance of local authorities would be enlisted and that the building of houses or other structures would be rather more carefully controlled in those areas than elsewhere and that the ordinary farmland would be worked and developed in the ordinary way but with a special care and concern so that areas of high amenity value would not be spoiled by ugly or badly-placed buildings.  This has happened time and again throughout the country.  I fear, from what I read in the papers in recent times, that the Department of <Col N="2052" /> Local Government have abandoned the notion of trying to preserve areas of high amenity value.  What influences were at work in these cases where controversy arose I cannot say, but it appears that some of the loveliest parts of County Wicklow are being interfered with by the exercise by the Minister for Local Government of his powers in the matter of granting or withholding planning permission.</P>
    <P>There are other areas I would wish the Parliamentary Secretary to consider when the present crisis passes and we can apply ourselves seriously again to the preservation of our heritage.</P>

      <P>I am sure he will understand what I mean.  If we get back, we will do it our way as we built up the Parks and Monuments Branch.  I have indicated to some extent our concern about it and it would be far better if this party were in charge of things.  Whoever is in charge should begin to think about areas like the Burren in Clare.  I am not sufficiently equipped scientifically to assess the unique qualities of the Burren but I am persuaded by people who are that this is a very special area and should be treated in a very special way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would think so but I strongly share the opinion of those who did suggest it that we would be guilty of a most terrible and damnable crime if we allowed a special area of this kind to be injured or have a species of flora there destroyed forever by any one of a hundred agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds spoke about the <Col N="2053" /> Shannon as a tourist amenity.  I often think that when we talk about our own country as a place to be developed for other people we have the pig by the wrong ear: we should think of areas of special value such as the Shannon valley not so much for the sake of tourists from abroad but for the sake of the Irish.  If we develop them for the Irish, the tourists will say: &ldquo;The Irish have something very nice; let us have a look at it&rdquo;.  Some people's thinking is upside down to some extent.  It is not abnoxiously selfish to say this: the concern of the Irish should not be so much with tourists from abroad, in order to extract their dollars or Deutschemarks or whatever it may be, but with a serious appreciation of the beauty of their own country and with preserving it for themselves and their successors. The priorities are important.</P>
    <P>If you go to Clonmel, there is a very special place also between Gandon's Main Guard at one end and the West Gate at the other, about which the Ceann Comhairle himself argued from these benches when I was in the Parliamentary Secretary's saddle, and if you go to Clogheen and turn up the Vee, I think you are in an area of very special amenity.  If you turn in the town of Clonmel itself and head for the Nire, the same applies.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle will be very familiar with these parts of Waterford and south Tipperary.  It may well be that because of carelessness or sloppiness these places will be damaged.  I understand that a chemical factory is to be built in the Suir Valley between Clonmel and Carrick.  The effluent from that factory will be dumped into the River Suir.  While I support strongly the provision of employment for your neighbours and mine in South Tipperary, Kilkenny and Waterford, we must bear in mind that this is one of the most beautiful parts in the south. We must preserve the waters of the Suir from pollution and the air that people breathe from being polluted by smoke or dirt.  We must preserve, too, the optical integrity of the area. I am speaking of the Kilsheelan to Carrick part of the Suir Valley.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2054" /> I am talking merely of some few areas known to you and me but I am aware that this country, although poor in so many ways, is richly endowed by way of natural amenities.  We have some unique facilities which we must preserve not only for ourselves but for the European Community also.  Some people are only barely conscious of all this.  The Boyne Valley, too, comes to mind in this context and there are many other beautiful areas.  Deputy Reynolds referred to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  I regret to remind the Deputy that this is a case of cross-Border co-operation.  Our group in the European Parliament raised this question and, hopefully, we sought the support of Fine Gael Deputies in endeavouring to get European support for cross-Border co-operation in a project of this kind to link the Bann and the Shannon.  However, no such support was forthcoming. Neither did we have the co-operation of the British although Deputy Reynolds was under the impression that they would co-operate.  But we should not be deterred by this because the problem in the North of Ireland will be solved one way or another sooner or later and then the Irish, both North and South, will have to start co-operating on projects such as this.  This would be to the mutual advantage of the people in both parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the question of arterial drainage.  In 1969 when I was leaving the beautiful room that is the Office of the Parliamentary Secretary there was a scheme for the drainage of the Suir that was ready to be put into operation.  This scheme had involved four years of designing, four years of surveying.  I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government for the delay in implementing it.  In our time the Department of Finance said they must have what they called, puckishly, a cost-benefit analysis.  That was another way of saying that they were discontinuing new projects of arterial drainage for a couple of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no rural outlook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2055" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>When was there ever a rural outlook in the Department? The survey of the Nore, a project in which I have more than the ordinary interest, had begun.  There were a couple of engineers engaged on surveying work but they were taken off this work and nothing has happened since.  There are 1,000,000 acres in County Tipperary in the catchment of the Suir.  This scheme is the most worthwhile one in Ireland because the land involved is the best in the country.  It is a scheme that should be begun and should be followed closely by a scheme involving the River Nore.</P>
      <P>I spoke earlier of the preservation of buildings that are in use and I may have mentioned Graiguenamanagh. A small part of the old abbey buildings are in use as a parish church and certain works are being carried out there at present.  This is part of the bigger problem I was talking of earlier.  A classic case in my area is St. Canice's Cathedral which is in excellent shape and very well preserved. The situation in respect of Graiguenamanagh is different.  This is a remnant of a very large monastic foundation.  We shall have to change our straitjacket approach to projects of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is against regulations to advocate legislation on an Estimate. I am not doing that but am advocating that the Parliamentary Secretary think about these matters.  In my city there is a building of very great antiquity and beauty.  I refer to St. Francis's Abbey&mdash;a ruined building. Strewn in the whole area of this building is what is perhaps the biggest ale brewery in the country.  This brewery was built within the past ten years but I do not think it should have been built there because it gives an ugly appearance to the whole surroundings of the abbey.  I suppose that nowadays people would object to any proposition to build in such close proximity to a national monument.  In this case great damage has been done to the very heart of the city of Kilkenny by the erection of this brewery in this place.  Like everybody else in Kilkenny, I was anxious for the <Col N="2056" /> employment that arose from the establishment of the brewery, but if we had thought more carefully we would have insisted that it be established outside the city.  Because of the location of the brewery big articulated trucks go rumbling through the little streets of Kilkenny, streets that were old a thousand years ago.  These trucks are doing untold damage, not only to St. Francis's Abbey which is looked after carefully in so far as is possible by the workers at the brewery as well as by the officers of the Board of Works, but to the surroundings and the environment of the abbey.  Perhaps I am crying here about spilt milk but there is a lesson for the rest of the country to be learned from our experience.</P>
    <P>I want to put these few thoughts before the Parliamentary Secretary. I am glad he has visited Kilkenny.  I would be glad to meet him there at any time in the future.  If he does come I hope he will be good enough to let me know and possibly I could explain in greater depth what I have been talking about.</P>
    <P>I should like to associate myself with what was said in connection with the staff of the Office of Public Works and their work in Dublin Castle since Ireland assumed Presidency of the EEC last January.  They did a most remarkable job and people in the European Parliament have commented very favourably to me on this matter. It was impressive and it should be publicly recognised.  I am very glad to associate myself with the praise that has justly been given to these officers. I should like to commend the work of the Parliamentary Secretary.  As I said before he has a style which makes it very difficult for the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and his staff.  When I last spoke on the Estimate for this Department I was obliged to comment unfavourably regarding a two-teacher school in my locality.  There were no facilities in the school at that time but the matter has been rectified and all the necessary services have been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2057" /> I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the work done in this instance.</P>
    <P>Water had to be provided in the area by means of a well.  There are only five houses adjacent to the school and there is an ample supply of water in the well to supply them.  The people in the area would be prepared to form a group scheme but the expense of sinking a well would be too much.  I am told that there are obstacles in the way of providing an extension of the water supply to the people but I do not know what they are.  The Parliamentary Secretary might consider this matter and see if the five houses concerned might be served.  The school is called Churchtown school in Athy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I would inform the Deputy that it is a matter for the school manager.  If the villagers approach him and get permission that is all that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the information. There is a famous old castle in Athy known as Woodstock Castle which is in a bad state of repair.  It is on the banks of the Barrow and the surrounding land is owned by the county council.  The land is adjacent to a large housing area and it is the intention of the council to use the land as an amenity area for the housing scheme.  Woodstock Castle is the property of the Office of Public Works.  It is quite unsafe and the council intend fencing it off to prevent children from playing there.  It is a pity it is in such a state of repair and perhaps something might be done to make it safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that when major drainage is done the catchment area of a river is drained and serviced.  The drainage of a certain part of the River Barrow was one of the first projects undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  Work was carried out from the source of the river to Athy and there it stopped.  It is navigable to that point by means of locks.  A canal joins the Barrow and extends as far as the Shannon.  I understand <Col N="2058" /> that work on the remaining portion of the Barrow is No. 7 on the priority list which means it will not be done for many years.  The original work on part of the river was carried out in 1926 or 1927 and, while it did some good for certain parts of the country, other lands were flooded to an even greater extent.</P>
    <P>The same situation will apply to the sister river, the Nore, which I understand is No. 3 on the priority list.  It is ridiculous to drain one river and not the other.  When the job is started it must be completed. These two rivers must be tackled simultaneously. It is ridiculous to have one seventh and the other third on the list when it is imperative that the two should be done at one and the same time.</P>
    <P>I believe the Parliamentary Secretary is doing a wonderful job.  My town is on the list for a new barracks. Sites are available now in the centre of the town and it is in the centre of the town the police station should be located.  The station was moved outside the town some years ago.  This is a disadvantage.  I trust that whatever site is available will be taken and a barracks provided in the centre of the town.  If this is done the gardaí will be in a better position to carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>I support what has been said by many speakers about certain drawbacks in this building.  I do not know what the trouble is with regard to heating but, as Deputy Gibbons said, there seems to be a lack of oxygen in the air; the atmosphere is most oppressive.  The facilities for Deputies are not what one would expect in a Parliament.  I do not say this is an urgent matter, but every Deputy should have a room in which he could interview people or work in a quiet atmosphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes, like now.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for the expeditious manner in which the school I mentioned earlier was dealt with.  He is doing a <Col N="2059" /> good job, and so are the staff in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the very fine contribution we have just had from Deputy Gibbons.  He dealt with some of the higher things in life.  We are in a state of economic crisis, unemployment and other ills, which is affecting the whole country.  The Office of Public Works could help to solve some of the problems. There is an arterial drainage priority list.  I know the Government are short of funds and large funds are essential for this kind of operation.  I also know that in the western counties there are many small rivers which could not be classified under arterial drainage or even as intermediate catchment areas.  The Parliamentary Secretary, with the financial assistance of the Minister for Finance, who now has four media before the House whereby funds may become available, should introduce a new category to help farmers in the western counties to drain their own lands.  This drainage would provide employment.  It is the kind of drainage that cannot be done by big machines.  The small rivers do a considerable amount of damage to a fair number of small farms.  If these were drained a certain amount of employment would be provided, a certain amount of land would be brought into production, and increased production is very necessary at the moment both for home consumption and for export; from Donegal we export large quantities of potatoes and other crops. We would be killing two or three birds with one stone.  The money spent would be well spent and it would help in eliminating one of the problems confronting the Government and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same argument can be applied to roads.  The Board of Works some years ago got rid of rural improvement scheme roads and bog roads. They were handed over to the local authorities together with the wherewithal to do the roads.  There is a limitation because I think the bog road part was not handed over.  The only part of the scheme now in existence <Col N="2060" /> as a result of that transaction is those roads which cater for a number of houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Bog roads are included. There is a certain criteria for accommodation roads and bog roads from the point of view of the number of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum total of negotiations Donegal County Council has had&mdash;I am sure other county councils are in the same boat &mdash;is that, if the county council want to reconstruct bog roads or make new roads, they must find the money necessary from moneys provided for county and other roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The LIS does not cater for those roads.  The hard fact of life is that not enough money is provided through the LIS, or any other road schemes for which county councils get money from central funds, for these roads.  Up to now no money at all was allocated for bog roads.  Towards the end of 1973 and during 1974 while the oil crisis was with us I advocated, and I was supported by Donegal County Council and Deputies from western areas, that the existing bog roads be reconstructed and that new roads be made into undeveloped turbary areas.  This should have been done so that those who wished to save their own turf&mdash; there are many unemployed people in the western areas who are anxious to save turf to meet their fuel requirements&mdash;could do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last war when we experienced a fuel crisis a very effective drive was made to enable our people to produce their own fuel requirements from our bogs but the roads provided then have fallen into disrepair. Money spent improving them would be worth while.  I accept that it is too late to ask that a special provision be made this year for the improvement of these roads but I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to endeavour to have money provided in next year's budget for this work. <Col N="2061" /> Every bog available in these areas is being cut; every turf bank is being used and there is a waiting list for people anxious to save their own turf. The Parliamentary Secretary should ensure that proper access is provided to our bogs.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of garda stations and the accommodation available in them, especially those sited along the Border. Many extra gardaí have been drafted into stations along the Border since the start of the Northern Ireland troubles.  These men do an excellent job under difficult circumstances and conditions and they deserve great credit.  They are far removed from their homes and families and must carry out patrol duties in all kinds of weather.  They are stationed in towns and villages where the accommodation is not available for them in the local stations.  Up to the time these extra gardaí were drafted in we had but a sergeant and garda in our local station but now we have five sergeants and 35 gardaí.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That number could not live in the same station; they must be only stationed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot all stand in the station at the one time unless they stand on each other's heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that the members of the force are deserving of our highest commendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Even though these gardaí may get the best of accommodation in local hotels and guesthouses they work under terrible conditions.  No effort has been made to improve the accommodation for these gardaí.  We all know that the problems in Northern Ireland will not be a permanent feature of Irish life, but while these men are stationed along the Border they should be provided with proper accommodation. They should be provided with adequate accommodation to enable them to prepare their reports, make telephone <Col N="2062" /> calls and, if necessary, to play a game of cards when off duty.</P>
      <P>The question of whether they are paid a sufficient allowance to enable them to stay in the local hotels is another matter and for another Department, but the Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to improve accommodation.  The Parliamentary Secretary is responsible for the provision of Garda barracks and he should consult with the Department of Justice about their condition.  Some of the new schools being built may mean a redundancy of prefabricated classrooms, which were in use up to this.  I am sure that surplus accommodation can be transferred at very little expense to the garda barracks I am talking about.  The same would apply in relation to the Army although I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary has any responsibility for Army barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy privately give me a list of garda barracks in that district?  This is an aspect nobody realises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

As Parliamentary Secretary I dealt with planning appeals in the Department of Local Government for three years and during that time I did not have a parliamentary question asked on any decision.  I quarrel with many of the decisions which are now being given on appeal.  I see no justification for them.  I know they contravene the development plans in many counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have decided to intervene in the debate on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works for the first time since I left the exalted position of Parliamentary Secretary.  I want to make a few remarks which I hope will be effective in getting the Parliamentary Secretary to do things which have not as yet been done by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>First, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to put a case to the Government for the complete overhaul and modernisation of the Office of Public Works and that it should be given a completely new role in the context of modern affairs.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of talk now about the environment and people have been advocating that there should be a ministry for the environment. I thought the Department of Lands could take on that role at one stage&mdash;they have not much to do&mdash; but the Office of Public Works would be more competent to take on such a ministry and to co-ordinate its plans in relation to work for which the Office are responsible and are held to be carrying out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt a certain amount of frustration in the Office of Public Works when I was there in that work was carried out piecemeal without proper co-ordination.  I found myself building schools that would soon become vacant and derelict.  This was due to lack of co-operation with the Department of Education and lack of co-ordination of Government plans. There should be advance programming. I do not want to have a swipe at the Government now; they have trouble enough; but in view of the absence of a programme at present it would be difficult to have the type of thing I am advocating, <Col N="2067" /> namely, co-ordination of Government schemes for which the Office of Public Works would be responsible. That is a policy which I would hope would be adopted one day and that the Office of Public Works will be brought into the confidence of the Government in relation to Government plans and Government policy so that the office will know the direction in which they should move, the preparation they should make and the preliminary work which must be carried out.</P>
    <P>I referred to the frustration that I felt in regard to school buildings in my time in order to illustrate the importance of co-operation with all Government Departments.  The Office of Public Works should know what plans the Department of Education have at any given time, whether it is intended to have community schools, larger schools, fewer schools or more schools.  The Office of Public Works in that case would not build schools in places where amalgamation would shortly take place which would render the new schools redundant and derelict in a short time while other buildings would have to be erected or additions made to existing schools.  The same applies in regard to building carried out for other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>I do not like to hark back to the period of the war but it is good to remind ourselves of the short sightedness and misdirected propaganda from which a Government sometimes suffers.  In the early days of the war we foresaw a post-war period when there might be a good deal of unemployment. The late Seán Lemass urged that a programme be prepared of works that would absorb any slack that might occur when hostilities would cease and an effort would be made to return to normality.  A very ambitious programme was drawn up in which the Office of Public Works were involved.  The projects included a dual carriageway to Bray, the building of Parliament Buildings in the Phoenix Park and other important works, all of which were derided and laughed at by the then Opposition and <Col N="2068" /> pointed to in the 1948 election as an example of the squandermania of the Fianna Fáil Government.  In fact, it was good forward planning, the necessity for which has since been recognised and there is regret that the works were not carried out.  I listened to the proposed dual carriageway being described from platforms as autobahns for plutocrats.  The Opposition have the right to question Government plans but this was a case where we can see in retrospect how wise the plans where.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that in support of the suggestion that the Government should consult the Office of public Works, which is the construction Department for the Government.  It is essential that the Office of Public Works should know what the Government programme is in relation to building.  As Deputy Cunningham advocated, there should be liaison between the planning authorities and the Office of Public Works. There is not enough liaison.  Very often planning offends against some of the monuments and works generally that the Office of Public Works are trying to preserve or restore. There is a definite need for more liaison between these two.  Indeed one might advocate that the new planning authority to be established should work in complete co-operation with the Office of Public Works.  If the Office of Public Works had the engineering and architectural staff&mdash;I know they have not&mdash;they would be the people competent to advise any planning authority as to the acceptability of certain types of planning which is becoming a farce at present.  I advocate this, so that the Office of Public Works would not be pushed hither and and thither because of pressure from one direction or another, doing things today that are out of date tomorrow, that are not required or are rendered obsolete as a result of change in policy and programme, which was one of the most frustrating things I found when I was in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works never had enough money or autonomy. They are an excellent Office.  I do not <Col N="2069" /> say that for the sake of praising them. Everybody has been contributing a little bit of praise.  They were a much-maligned body with not sufficient personnel to carry out works sufficiently fast.  For that reason they got a reputation for being slow, and there were many jokes told about them. There was the story about the parish priest who came looking for the architect about his school.  He was told the architect was at home, and he was very annoyed.  He said: &ldquo;How can I get my school built when the man responsible is not even in the office?&rdquo; The answer was: &ldquo;He is having a child christened today&rdquo;.  The parish priest said: &ldquo;That is not sufficient reason for his being away from his office when there is important work like building my school to be done&rdquo;. They said: &ldquo;It is not quite a normal case.  He is married for 12 years and this is his first child,&rdquo; to which the parish priest replied: &ldquo;That is a typical Board of Works' job&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When we went to functions someone always told jokes like that.  It used to annoy me because the number of architects or engineers on the staff were dealing with more work at any given time than five times the personnel numbers could possibly deal with.  If work is to be done expeditiously by the Office of Public Works, if plans are to be prepared and brought to the operational stage in the time that people would wish, then the professional personnel in the architectural and engineering sections would need to be trebled.</P>
    <P>I have deviated from what I was setting out to say, that the Office of Public Works should be given more money and greater autonomy to carry out themselves what they know to be the essential works.  They should not have to await sanction for all the minor works they do.  They have authority to carry out certain maintenance work as a continuing operation, but there are many works for which they must await sanction by the Department and sometimes pressure from the public before they can carry them out. In the area of national monuments <Col N="2070" /> alone the Office of Public Works could absorb three times the amount voted to them in any year.  This country has a wealth of national monuments, many of them disappearing for all time.  I could name hundreds of them myself.  We have visitors coming particularly from America and, in recent times, from the Continent.  They have been reading about monuments and when they come these monuments cannot be traced.  There are old graveyards that are being obliterated.  What immediately comes to my mind is the old graveyard on Inishkeel Island where St. Conall had a monastery.  The cattle are just grazing over it without even a preservation order on it.  The county council are supposed to have responsibility for certain derelict graveyards, but there is a divided allegiance here and what is a number of people's business is nobody's business.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would do something now really worthwhile about the preservation and resoration of national monuments, he would be doing a great job for posterity and would be automatically creating a monument by which he would be remembered for all time.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of seeing Bunratty Castle restored in my time.  We had moved into a few other places where restoration work was being carried out. It was such a perfect job that it made everybody want to see the castle in his own locality restored in the same way. But unfortunately we had not many Lord Gorts or any finance coming from an outside source, and the amount of money available from Departments for the work was negligible and could not enable a fraction of this most interesting and nationally important work to be carried out.</P>
    <P>In the Office of Public Works there is compiled a huge list of monuments and many of these are now almost obliterated.  However, there is yet time to retrieve some of these that have gone underground, that have become practically invisible, and there is time to restore some of those that have not crumbled to a serious extent.  Preservation Orders should be put on all of them and the local police notified that <Col N="2071" /> anybody who interferes with the preservation order placed on the monument will be subject to the full rigours of the law.  I would be ruthless in this, because another generation would blame us very much for allowing these objects of antiquity and of our great ancestry and civilisation and, indeed, our pre-civilisation period, to go into complete ruins and be obliterated.</P>
    <P>Other matters for which the Office of Public Works are responsible give an opportunity to Deputies to be slightly parochial.  I would like to mention, without being accused of being too parochial, that the Parliamentary Secretary did not please me as much as he seemed to please others in the way he handled the proposed improvements in the Finn River in Donegal. We sought some assistance from the Office of Public Works in support of local community effort to do a job that would save many houses, that would not be at all up to the standard the Board of Works would require on that river but would be sufficient to save a lot of personal property, many residences as well as land and woods.  It would do an important holding job until one day the Office of Public Works could proceed with works under the Arterial Drainage Act.  It is very far down on the list, unfortunately, but we had got an undertaking from the Office of Public Works to provide at a nominal fee machines they had which were lying idle.  We had procured necessary moneys locally from voluntary effort and from the Donegal County Council, but I think it is fair to say that the Office of Public Works, and the Parliamentary Secretary in particular, ratted on us. The Government changed in the meantime, and the co-operation that was anticipated at the time we first made the arrangements was not fully honoured.  This was a pity because it would have done a very important job.  This is an ongoing problem, still being dealt with by the local community. If the Parliamentary Secretary would provide the necessary co-operation even at this stage they will do more work than would be done in any other way because those carrying it <Col N="2072" /> out are seriously interested in getting a good job done.</P>
    <P>Regarding arterial drainage, time must have shown the Parliamentary Secretary that one thing is necessary. Arterial drainage moves slowly, requires much expertise and a good deal of money.  It is very easy to apply the brake of scarcity of money; men can spend weeks on preliminary surveys and cost benefit analyses and the necessary preliminaries preceding official openings such as I had the pleasure of seeing in the case of a few important schemes in my time in the Office of Public Works.  We are moving too slowly in regard to arterial drainage.  I introduced the intermediate scheme to deal with rivers lying in the area between agricultural responsibility under the grants scheme and arterial drainage under the 1945 Act.  A few such schemes, all around the £50,000 mark were carried out.  I believe this scheme, which was excellent, is now discontinued; I hear of no activity under it at present.</P>
    <P>Pending taking on all the rivers on the priority list for arterial drainage, would the Parliamentary Secretary, instead of appointing maintenance men after a scheme has been completed, put maintenance men on all the rivers held to be suitable for arterial drainage?  This would be in keeping with our environmental proposals. They could be given the task of keeping the river banks clear.  It is very difficult for a couple of maintenance men such as are employed when the job is done to maintain a river up to the high standard to which it has been brought by the Office of Public Works.  They do perfect drainage; my only criticism is that the standards are too high, if anything.  I advocate maintenance even before drainage is carried out.  Power saws could be provided to enable the men to keep the river banks clear of trees that jut out over the water blocking the farmers' hay floating down and causing silting and flooding.  Much of the trouble could be eased and the flooding relieved or avoided by putting maintenance men on every river due for arterial drainage at some future date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2073" /> As maintenance men look after the roads these men could look after the rivers that tend to flood.  In most cases it is torrential flooding that is involved and engineers will agree that a river subject to torrential flooding can never be guaranteed to be free from flooding no matter what drainage work is carried out on it.  This type of river could be greatly relieved and much property saved if certain minor works were carried out, the banks kept clear&mdash;a suitable job for anglers&mdash;and much of the river bank growth that causes silting removed. The ultimate drainage could then be more easily carried out.  One of the requirements of the 1945 Act is that when work is carried out it must be properly maintained afterwards and this means appointing maintenance men.</P>

      <P>This office are charged with carrying out construction work for all Government Departments.  With the proliferation of offices and with Parkinson's Law applying in many directions and with the advent of EEC, I regret that when it was proposed that the Office of Public Works would build offices for the entire Government complex this idea was not adopted.  We could now have had all our own offices instead of paying an almost prohibitive rate per foot for rented accommodation.  At one time beautiful sites could have been bought for very little money and buildings raised very cheaply.  That should encourage the Parliamentary Secretary to plan for the future: it demonstrates the need for foresight and planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That applies even to this building.  I went to the Government one day with the plans for the extension of Leinster House with an engineer who has since passed away.  We presented the plans and, in the interests of economy, three storeys were knocked off the proposal.  All of these are needed today. We should have had a workman's <Col N="2075" /> lift also.  We have only two lifts that work very slowly&mdash;one would think they were made for the Seanad rather than the Dáil.  When the bells ring, if the workman has the lift in use down in the cellar with a load of waste paper, Deputies have to use the stairs. This is not in keeping with the requirements of what should be a fast-moving Parliament at a time when everything is being geared to go faster and show real expedition.  The whole approach is too low-key and too <Col N="2076" /> slow.  I mention this only to highlight the need for foresight.  I work in a room with two ex-Minister colleagues and we have only two desks for the three of us.  We have not even a third filing cabinet.</P>
