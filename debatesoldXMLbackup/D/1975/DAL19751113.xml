      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of electricity for those householders who, because of the capital contributions involved, were unable to accept connection during the final phase of the rural electrification scheme has been under review in my Department in consultation with the ESB.  This review has now been completed and I will shortly be making proposals in the matter which will involve new legislation.</P>
      <P>The form and content of the proposed legislation will, of course, be a matter for the Government but I may say at this stage that the proposals do not envisage a rebate of capital contributions already paid by householders towards cost of connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in taking it from the Minister's reply that he will introduce legislation? Questions Nos. 1 and 2 are in my name and I have given details and names regarding the cost with Question No. 2.  Recently I met a man who got grants from the county council and the Department and the full amount of £920 was being charged for an electricity supply.  Am I to take it that the Minister proposes legislation that will give a subsidy to the ESB and thus help people to instal electricity in their new houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may take it that I shall be introducing legislation to cater for those people in closed areas who, because of the high capital cost, were unable to accept connection before the areas were closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say it will not be retrospective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be retrospective in the sense that it will cater for people in closed areas who, because of the high connection cost, were unable to accept a supply before the areas were closed.  However, it will not cater for people in new houses in other areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, not where the connection has been made already.  We will have to draw the line somewhere; otherwise we could go back to 1927 when the subsidy regarding rural electrification started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so but what about the case where a person is charged £1,600?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>On a recent radio programme I heard the Minister say that in Ireland the rural electrification scheme has now only two portions of the country for development &mdash;one part in County Mayo and the Minister mentioned an area in Galway in the Woodford district.  This area is at the side of the Slieve Aughty mountain range.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy please ask a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other side of the Slieve Aughty range there is Slieve on Óir in County Clare and the ESB say this area will be developed from Limerick.  Is the Minister aware that people living in this mountain area have been asked for £1,800 and one man was asked for £4,000?  Slieve an Óir means the mountain of gold&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is imparting information.  He is not asking a question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though it means the mountain of gold, I do not think it should be taken literally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all very informative but I would remind the Deputy that this is Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>The man concerned should not be asked to pay £4,000 for electrical installation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to have notice about specific areas.  Generally the category of people I have mentioned would include people in Woodford, in Ballyfoyle in Mayo and the Black Valley in Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Woodford borders Slieve an Óir.  I am talking about the Slieve Aughty range of mountains between Clare and Galway.  The ESB will supply from Limerick to the Clare area.  I would not take too literally that Slieve an Óir is the mountain of gold.  The people concerned certainly cannot pay £4,000 for installing electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed at the Minister's reply.  I took it for granted that anyone who applied for rural electrification from now on and who was charged a prohibitive amount would get a subsidy, irrespective of whether he was in the area when the subsidy was originally paid.  From what the Minister said it appears that only those people who were unable to take supply when the subsidy was available will be catered for.  Am I correct in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  They will be covered by the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that that is unfair?  There are many people throughout the country who were not in the areas in question when the scheme was subsidised. These people should be included in the legislation also.  It is discrimination not to include all houses that are charged an excessive rate.  I am not asking for retrospection but if the Minister is introducing legislation he should cater for everyone who has to pay an excessive amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1131" />
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is talking about new houses in closed areas.  I know some of the charges appear very high but there is an element of discretion about sites. The ESB are considering their total connection scheme for all parts of the country and when they come up with their findings I will look at the situation again.  The current legislation envisaged by me is for people in closed areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be anticipating legislation on a limited scale.  Will he keep in mind houses built for old people that the ESB are not anxious to connect? Very often they charge prohibitive rates for connection of what are known as demountable houses or old people's homes, built by local authorities. Would the Minister look at these as a special category?  In many cases they are completely deprived of current because they cannot afford the £600 or £700 which is being asked from people who could not have a house if the county councils had not built them for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will give me particulars I will inquire into this.  At the moment I do not know about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would again ask the Minister to consider seriously any rural house where the charge is excessive whether it was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has already raised that matter. Question No. 6, please.</P>

    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will arrange to have the terms of electricity supply to a person (name supplied) in County Offaly reduced, as the amount requested is prohibitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the person in question did not accept supply at the subsidised terms offered by the board in 1973 when the rural area in which his premises are situated was being developed under the final phase of the rural electrification scheme.  In <Col N="1132" /> March, 1975, unsubsidised terms, which included the payment of a capital contribution, were quoted to him but no reply was received by the board to the quotation.</P>
      <P>The capital contribution is based on the present cost of making supply available which necessitates the erection of 900 metres of high tension line, a 5 KVA transformer, together with a service, meter and other works.</P>
      <P>If supply is now required an up-to-date quotation, which will involve the payment of a capital contribution, will be issued by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not say that this is a case where the person concerned, as he said in reply to the other question, could not afford to take the supply?  Will his legislation cover this type of person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the legislation will cover people who could not afford to pay the capital cost at the time.  In this case, I understand, in the terms quoted in March, 1972, no capital contribution was required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The fixed charge fixed at that time was arising from a capital consideration.  It was what was being put in that time as a long-term capital charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That would still apply.  All I am concerned with is to cater for the people who are asked for lump sums which they could not meet at that time.  This man was not asked for a lump sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that the Minister is bluffing in these other cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I think the scheme where we have told people about it has been very widely welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It has, but we have not seen it yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he has received any suggestions to establish a technologically competent centre for evaluating energy options, independent of the ESB; if he has made any decision on them; and, if not, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that suggestions on the lines mentioned in the question were contained in a memorandum prepared under the auspices of a group known as &ldquo;Conserve&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Technological advice on energy matters is already available to me from a number of sources.  In the nuclear sphere, the Nuclear Energy Board have been established under statute as an independent expert body to provide advice to me and to the Government on all aspects of nuclear energy.  There are in addition a number of existing agencies with the necessary scientific and economic skills to undertake the investigation of possible new sources of energy, the development of more efficient methods of energy conversion and utilisation and the evaluation of different energy options.</P>
      <P>I do not consider in the circumstances that there is a need at present for the setting up of any new institutions.</P>

Work on the erection of poles in Gurteenfluigh and Illauninagh is at present in progress and similar work will commence in Curraby in about two months time.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the work necessary to bring supply to these areas will then be carried out and the applicants' premises will be connected. It is expected that all work will be completed in six to nine months.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if at any time during the past ten years any departmental or interdepartmental committee investigated the possibility of establishing a major shipping port in the north-west of the country; if any report was made to his Department or to the Government; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. A port is only one link in the chain in getting goods from a factory to the consumers and in getting raw material to the factory.  Generally, the people concerned choose the cheapest possible route.  If port charges were too high they would tend to go to a cheaper port and use a land bridge connection.  However, I shall be glad to have another look at the matter, but it seems at present that there is no commercial demand for such a port.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

The fares charged by these private companies while subject to price legislation vary from place to place according to the economics of their service areas.  I do not propose to alter these arrangements.  I am of course aware that CIE have been able to reduce their fares by virtue of the special subsidy provided for this purpose in the June, 1975 budget.  No such subsidy was provided for private bus companies and, in this connection, I would refer the Deputies to the replies by the Minister for Finance to questions on this subject on 29th October, 1975, and to my reply to a similar question on 6th November, 1975.</P>
      <P>Freight services in County Donegal are provided as in the rest of the country by CIE and private operators and I am not aware of serious discrepancies in the freight rates in County Donegal compared with the rest of the country.  CIE have informed me that they do not discriminate against County Donegal in their freight charging structure.  CIE have always been conscious of the needs of areas such as Donegal and have consistently sought to ensure adequacy of services at the lowest possible cost. For instance, rail freight traffic which is carried by CIE between Dublin and Derry for County Donegal is afforded the most favourable rates possible. The concessionary charging arrangements for sundries traffic to Dublin which were introduced by CIE in February, 1973, afforded particular benefits to the more remote areas, including County Donegal.</P>

      <P>One of the most needed incentives in the west of Ireland is subsidised transport due to the fact that transport lines are so extended. <Col N="1137" /> The Minister admitted that the Lough Swilly Railway Company do not enjoy a subsidy as does CIE and this leaves that part of Donegal in a most disadvantaged position.  I am surprised that the Minister is not prepared to take any action and I would ask him in relation to his answer to Question No. 10&mdash;on which I did not wish to anticipate his answer to this question&mdash;would he not consider it now as a matter of some urgency that an alternative means of transport be examined which would provide an outlet from Donegal, namely, the development of one or other of the excellent sea ports such as Killybegs or Rathmullen which have not the necessary transit sheds and other facilities which would encourage their use for shipping?</P>

Therefore, the further CIE have to carry anything the more advantage <Col N="1138" /> it is to the people at the other end.

    <P>I understand that the firm referred to by the Deputy is undertaking shortly a major rationalisation programme which it expects will result in the loss of employment for 400 workers, other than seasonal workers, in various locations in Counties Cork, Clare and Limerick.  About onequarter of the workers concerned are employed at the factory in County Cork.  An additional 660 people had, however, been recently employed in the County Cork factory following a major expansion of the processing facilities there.  Discussions are in progress between the management and trade unions about the proposed redundancies. I am naturally very concerned at the prospect of such job losses and have asked the Industrial <Col N="1142" /> Development Authority and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited to maintain close contact with the firm, so that everything possible will be done to alleviate the difficulties and to assist in finding alternative employment for the workers affected.</P>
    <P>As regards the new factory in County Cork, I am informed that its employment potential is 50 workers by mid-1976, most of whom are expected to be recruited locally.  The promoters intend to transfer a number of key skilled personnel to the new factory but details have not yet been finalised.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if an old-established craft industry (details supplied) in County Donegal is to be allowed to close down for want of State assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the firm, to which the Deputy refers, has recently sought assistance from both the Industrial Development Authority and from Fóir Teoranta.</P>
      <P>I understand that whilst it was not found possible for the board of Fóir Teoranta to accede to the company's request for loan assistance, the IDA are at present considering the company's application for a training grant.  It must be appreciated, however, that the extent to which the State agencies can provide assistance towards maintaining the firm in business is dependent on whether it can be demonstrated that the undertaking is capable of paying its way in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that this is an unusually prestigious industry.  Originally I named the industry in my question and I cannot understand why it was not mentioned.  I am referring of course to Donegal Carpets.  This industry has been established for over a century and has earned a very high reputation. Would the Minister not consider that because of the specialised nature of this craft that special consideration should be given?  This is a traditional industry in this area where workers are specially trained. A training grant is not most important in this case; working capital is needed to enable the industry to overcome a period of recession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will, I think, agree with me that we would not wish to say anything from either side of the house which would in any <Col N="1147" /> way damage the prospects of this firm.  I share his opinion that there is a special tradition and prestige attached to this firm and I would very much deplore its going out of production.  The Deputy knows that State agencies are bound by law.  He knows also the decision of the board of Fóir Teoranta, which I have indicated. I have made it clear, and I understand that the attitude of the board of Fóir Teoranta and the IDA is as sympathetic as they can be within the proper statutory limitations set on them by their establishing Acts.  I would reiterate here that it is our wish that this firm should continue in production but we cannot bend beyond a certain point the ordinary rules of commercial viability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this industry is liable to close down and that it will be looked on as a serious blow to our export potential and to our export efforts generally?  This is one industry which has been supplying carpets to practically every worth-while establishment in the world, including many of the royal palaces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce when the IDA expect to have suitable industries for their factories at Edenderry, Birr and Tullamore, County Offaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Industrial Development Authority that they are at present in negotiation with industrialists for the location of projects in both the Birr and Tullamore advance factories but that there is no firm indication at present as to when these projects might proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authority are making every effort to secure a suitable project for the factory at Edenderry which became vacant recently when the company <Col N="1148" /> which occupied it ceased production. A firm alternative project has not yet emerged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that there is a certain amount of criticism because the factories have been built for two years or more and there had been great hopes.  Now, all of a sudden, everything goes by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that in one instance, in the case of Edenderry, there was a project secured but it was unable to succeed. In the case of the other two, as I have said there are negotiations under way for industries.  People should realise that in the circumstances of very serious world depression, while we have had only a certain number of cancellations we have had a number of deferments, people saying: &ldquo;We are not cancelling the project but we will not take a definitive decision to proceed in present circumstances.&rdquo;  I am happy to confirm our commitment to find industries for these three factories. There is recognition of the extra claim for these.  It should not be taken as so alarming or depressing that we cannot find industries as quickly as we would wish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy wishes, and I hope he does not, to criticise the record of the IDA. I have said to them that if they were to be certain about everything they would have had far more failures.  I <Col N="1149" /> am pleased with their record, which is very good.  In regard to this undertaking, there were expensive modifications at the behest of a firm which failed to go on with the project.  I regret that.  If we were to give guidelines to the IDA to prevent such things happening, we would not have half the number of factories in operation. I gave my commitment to the Tullamore project, it did not work out but it is a risk we have had to take.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he forward planning of the IDA for the establishment of industries will be affected by the fact that there will be no census held in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The main forward planning activity being undertaken by the Industrial Development Authority in conjunction with my Department is the formulation of updated regional industrial proposals for the period to 1980.</P>
      <P>These proposals are expected to be finalised within the coming year and could not have incorporated results from a 1976 census since the first results from such a census would not be available until 1977 at the earliest. IDA have available to them a great deal of relevant planning information from their own sources and particularly from their own annual survey of manufacturing employment and the authority's forward planning can, therefore, proceed on an acceptable basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say 1980?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the main forward planning activity is the formulation <Col N="1150" /> of updated proposals for the period to 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that the non-availability of census returns at the appropriate date on which they should have become available must interfere with the forward planning of the IDA at a time when that planning should be put into operation on the basis of census returns? Can the Minister give any indication of what the IDA propose to do in that regard in the absence of this information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that there will be a disadvantage to be overcome because of the lack of information from a 1976 census which would become available in 1977-78, but I think the saving that comes from that is compensation for the lack of the information.  In regard to the particular IDA task, they have their own annual surveys.  They have a great deal of statistical information and statistical skills within their staff. It would be possible to extrapolate from current information and data available from their own sources which will mean that the difference between having details from a census and the details available to them from their own sources will be very small indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not inferring that the IDA have an industrial census of their own?  Is not the only information available that being provided by the Manpower Service from surveys such as that carried out in particular areas such as Galway, Limerick and Waterford in my time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>They have an annual survey in manufacturing employment and they have all the statistical information of the State which can be taken as being very extensive.  It is true that the details of the 1977-78 census returns will not be available. That is something I regret but I think it was a correct decision from the point of view of making economies and I am not at all sure it will damage forward planning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the major areas of concern for the IDA in the longer term would be the number of the population within the country and to a lesser degree the extent of the availability of skills?  Whatever about availability of skills, would the Minister not agree that accurate information on the movement and projected movement of population is unlikely to be available to the IDA on the basis of the surveys available to them within their own resources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree.  It is a question of precision&mdash;the same precision which in the normal way would be available every five years and 18 months to two years in arrears but which will not be available.  However, I am satisfied that from all the current sources of information which are available continuously, decisions of a planning kind can be made.  The data are precise enough for the task involved.  This data might not be sufficient for other tasks but for the forward planning activity of the IDA, it is adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to a statement to the effect that a startling and extremely confused situation surrounds mineral ownership and acquisition procedures in this country; if he agrees with this statement; and if he will make a statement on the position and indicate if he intends to take any measures to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to a statement in a pamphlet published last July.  I consider that this statement exaggerates greatly any difficulties that exist in this complex area.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply on 24th April, 1975 to a question by Deputy O'Malley on this subject. My examination of the question of mineral ownership and acquisition procedures with a view to devising the most suitable legislation to meet the situation is proceeding.</P>
      <P>The mining interests concerned are to present me in the near future with their proposals for dealing with the problem, in answer to a request which I put to them quite some time ago.  I should make it clear, however, that the interests of other parties vitally concerned will have to be borne in mind in considering this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any record, first, of the amount of minerals owned by the State and by individuals and, secondly, of minerals that do not seem to be owned by anybody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Deputy to put that down as a separate question.  While I would endeavour to give him as much information as we possess, it is the sort of hard factual information that I should hate to give off the cuff.  However, if the Deputy puts down a question I shall answer it as fully as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming from what the Minister has said that there are considerable legal and, possibly, constitutional difficulties involved in the problem that he is trying to resolve but he will appreciate that similar kinds of problems have arisen in connection with building land.  May we take it that there will be greater expedition in the Minister's dealing of the problem referred to here than there has been in dealing with the Kenny Report on building land, a report which seems to have sunk without trace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has indicated in his supplementary, he is aware of the range and complexity of this question.  As one who has had extensive ministerial responsibility he will be aware that these considerations, very properly, go far beyond departmental boundaries.  I affirm that the situation is not satisfactory and I should like to see the matter resolved quickly.  To the extent that I can exert pressure on the people who are responsible to me, I shall do so and I <Col N="1157" /> have done so, but the Deputy understands the functioning of the whole State structure well enough to know that there are many different agencies as well as the legal profession and other people involved.  I would be misleading the House if I were to suggest that the matter is one which could be resolved in months.  I have asked the industry to put forward their recommendations. Investigations are being pursued vigorously but the matter is very complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, we are talking in terms of years rather than months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>If this is a matter which does not need a revision of the Constitution, why must we wait years for it to be dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an aspect on which I have not yet got clear advice. It may or may not be a question of constitutional revision but I have not as yet got a clear answer from people wiser than I in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Minister has given thought to the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he intends to introduce legislation to amend company law to ensure that, in future, when companies are registered the names of all those who have an <i>ante hoc</i> or <i>post hoc</i> interest in the company will be disclosed to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain aspects of company law, including the disclosure of interests, which need reconsideration. I am referring to the Law Reform Commission for examination various matters related to companies legislation and when they report to me I will consider what amendments of the existing law generally may be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say <Col N="1158" /> whether the matters he proposes to refer to the Law Reform Commission include the matter raised in this question? In other words, is the question of the disclosure of interests a specific matter that is being referred to the commission?</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaints on behalf of these operators <Col N="1159" /> under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, have been referred to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices for investigation.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate how long the investigation will take and when the examiner's report will be made available to me.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, aware of the urgency of this matter.  While there are no statutory powers available to my Department or to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices to require the company to restore supplies to the petrol station operators concerned, the company, in response to a request by my Department, offered last August to restore supplies on a temporary basis but the proposed terms of supply were not accepted by the operators. I understand that the examiner has been in touch recently with the company about the temporary restoration of supplies, that supplies have been restored to three of the licensees and that the fourth licensee is still in discussion with the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the background to this dispute is abominable from the point of view of the treatment of licensees or tenants, as one might call them?  Would he not feel it incumbent on him to step in and insist the petrol company would operate a scheme which would qualify under the Landlord and Tenant Act, a scheme under which the Department of Social Welfare could look after the operators of petrol filling stations?  It does look as if these people are getting abominable treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I share the feelings of the Deputy.  I do not think the situation is satisfactory.  The Deputy may be aware that there is a case before the High Court and a decision is pending in regard to invoking the Landlord and Tenant Act in this case.  As I indicated in my original reply, I have made it clear that I want supplies made available pending the results of the investigation by the examiner.  If that can be done, then we will get a &ldquo;without <Col N="1160" /> prejudice&rdquo; situation which can await proper mechanisms functioning.  I shall certainly take whatever action comes to light as appropriate as a result of the examination.  There would be inevitable delay in seeking new legal powers.  The best way out for the moment&mdash;I am not suggesting it is a long-term solution&mdash;is for supplies to be resumed without prejudice and, when we get the report from the examiner of restrictive practices, I hope that report will both clarify the situation and recommend appropriate action.  I am anxious that the mechanism should work and I do not want to anticipate the proper functioning or organisation of mechanism specifically set up to deal with a situation of this kind.</P>

That would appear to constitute a further flouting of ministerial intervention. Could the Minister arrange for the examiner of restrictive practices to expedite his report and recommendations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I was summarising the variables which affect tourism.  According to the report issued by Bord Fáilte, 1974 was a reasonably good year and tourism is apparently on the upturn.  One is glad to learn this.  In 1974 many countries suffered a setback from the point of view of tourism.  Any forward move is to be welcomed.  Tourism is an excellent business from the point of view of the general welfare of the country.  More people should interest themselves in tourism as a service. More people should enter the catering end of tourism.  We could extend our tourist year at both ends with a little effort.  We could extend it to the month of March and lengthen it into the autumn.  Happily we have the attractions necessary to win this type of tourist.</P>
      <P>We must have regard to the threat to our lakes from pollution of one kind or another.  We are not sufficiently aware of the threat of pollution and the havoc it may cause later in our rivers and lakes.  We must tackle this problem early rather than late.  We should have the necessary ground rules to deal with it.  We have not got the ground rules at the moment.  At present local authorities are not in a position to deal with this threat.  As a member of a local authority I can state that pollution starts on the public streets.  The Minister for Local Government should be empowered to take steps to deal with this matter as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> In some instances cases have been brought to court and people have been prosecuted.  That is all very well, but are we doing enough to prevent pollution? Bringing people to court is a preventive measure, but are we doing enough otherwise to make every man, woman and child aware of the threat of pollution?  If we can earn £129 million or £130 million a year from tourism, given the proper guidelines and supporting legislation we should be able to climb up the ladder and double that figure.  To harp back to the discussions the other night, it could be said that we are not all interested in the problem.</P>
    <P>It can also be said that we are not interested in presenting food in the way it should be presented.  We produce prime meat of all descriptions. We should be one of the foremost countries in Europe in this regard, but we are not.  When one goes to another European country and sees the way food is presented, one is struck by the point I am trying to make.  It must be borne in mind that some European countries export the best of their foodstuffs and present their second best in a first-class manner. We are presenting first-class food in a second-class manner.  The question must be asked: are we really serious about tourism?</P>
    <P>Tourism is Bord Fáilte's business. They have done very well in publicising this country in so far as international gatherings and conferences are concerned.  Hitherto we did not regard ourselves as a centre for hosting those gatherings.  One would hope that with our entry into Europe we could publicise the fact that we can provide first-class accommodation for this type of gathering.  This is one way of adding to the total tourist figure. We have had a number of visitors from Europe&mdash;of Parliamentarians and so on.  This is a good intermix because people notice the assets of a country, whether they be assets of natural beauty or otherwise, and speak about them.  We have those assets. We should be taking steps to protect our natural assets and we should be proud of them.</P>
    <P>Regrettably the march of progress, <Col N="1175" /> the age of affluence, increased industry, better production methods in the farmyard, affect our clean air and pure water and those are the assets of which I speak.  I am not speaking in a condemnatory way, but it would be a major disaster if we were to fall prey to pollution.</P>
    <P>Last summer was one of the best summers we had in this century.  This will have some effect on our fishing activities in the future.  Quite a large number of rivers dried up and salmon spawn and other types of fish spawn were killed.  Apart from that there are other types of pollution already affecting those elements.  I may be harping on this in a rather disjointed way but it is better to do so than not to harp on it at all; to point out some of our natural advantages and the way in which we are encroaching on them.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear whether or not Bord Fáilte have a plan for rezoning the country.  I would not be in favour of such a system.  However I readily concede that it would have this advantage, that it would bring home to the people living in those zones and elsewhere the steps that should be taken sufficiently early to avoid contamination from any source.  If zoning were to accomplish that it might be a good move.  On the other hand, the country being so small, I wondered whether we should not have an all-out drive to reduce this threat of pollution.  Of course, when some semi-State body, be it Bord Fáilte or any other, starts to introduce measures it is left to that board.  Regrettably we are not sufficiently public-spirited to speak about this as a subject and to seek the co-operation of every man, woman and child in the country in walking the same road as the board, in an endeavour to minimise all the elements of pollution.  Deputies might say: &ldquo;We are sick listening to the Deputy talking about pollution&rdquo; and they might be correct in that respect. But it is a subject in which all of us should be deeply interested.  Not merely should we encourage a board like Bord Fáilte to lead the way in eliminating pollution, but we should actively help it in every way rather <Col N="1176" /> than merely standing back when we see them talking certain steps to come to grips with this general threat.</P>
    <P>I was speaking on some of Bord Fáilte schemes and was referring to the major resorts scheme.  If I remember correctly it must be now nearly 15 or 16 years since this scheme was started&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is only in the last five to seven years that we have been making reasonable progress. Admittedly it cost a lot of money and was slow to get off the ground.  Now that the board have got the major resorts scheme started we should take it further because it has brought the Shannon to the forefront.  It has also brought people to small villages and towns who might otherwise have kept to the coast.  It is a mistake to think that all tourists are coastal-minded. There are those tourists who love to see good vegetation, green grass, who appreciate fresh air, lovely lakes and so on and who do not want to go around the coast at all but would prefer to remain inland.  We should do all in our power to cater for that type of person, keeping them inland, down the Shannon.  The many attractions which the Shannon presents, apart from its natural one, will be brought to the fore as time progresses.  The joint effort of Bord Fáilte and the Wildlife Section of the Department of Lands is another trend which should be welcomed not merely by naturalists but by everybody.  It will be welcomed by tourists and native alike who visit those reservations or parks and who take children to see the wildlife there and their other attractions.  It is a method of teaching children by visual aid how wild life exists in its natural surroundings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to cover the ground I covered last Thursday evening on this subject.  I wanted merely to highlight some of the points in which I was interested, having read the report of Bord Fáilte.  The more people we can attract here the better.  It is also far better to be able to sell our food at home than to export it.  We can <Col N="1177" /> regard those people who visit here as an import and export all in one.  That, coupled with the employment which the service is capable of providing for our younger people today&mdash;at a time when it is so difficult to place pupils from post-primary schools in employment&mdash;makes it regrettable that we do not put before a greater number of our girls the merits of domestic science.  Perhaps it is regarded as a hard life but any road in life is difficult especially if one does not know how to make progress on that road. The road through life is much easier if one knows one's way and knows what one will meet on that road. Therefore I would ask the Minister to urge on his colleagues the possibility of upgrading domestic economy as a subject.  I understand that diplomas are issued in this subject at present. I think it should lead to a degree because, for example, this year we have thousands of BAs redundant, who cannot be placed having finished their education, and a high proportion of them are girls who would be far better off with a degree in a subject such as domestic science rather than one in the direction of the classics, as it were, or in teaching. I do not want to labour that point.  I would like to see more interest in this regard.  The Minister still has to introduce his Estimate for Transport and Power, or was it introduced already?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the points I would make on transport and power is the quandary of CIE as to the direction in which the company will go.  The company is losing money heavily.  Since we came to accept the idea of setting up semi-State companies we have also developed the view that a semi-State company should have possibly a social as well as a commercial content.  We should be careful not to pile on too many social obligations on our semi-State companies and thus hinder them from fully commercial pursuits.  Railway companies all over Europe are losing money, and this being a small country, it stands to reason, from the number <Col N="1178" /> of cars we have here and the availability of buses and other transport, that railways here would have a hard time.</P>
      <P>The question arises whether CIE will go in the direction of preserving the railways we have and extending them somewhat, or, on the other hand, whether we shall embark on a programme of building roads and motorways, which would be very expensive now since the price of oil has risen, because tarmacadam is oilbased. I am not an expert and have not had time to study this trend, but if one were asked whether one would prefer road to rail development, one would be hard put to say which one would prefer at present.  Both road and rail are costly, and there is no possibility of the costs of the rail service falling.  I would think that a good mileage of rail at present would need replacement, and certainly quite a large number of our trains would need up-grading.  I do not see any scope for reduction in cost there.  For a country of our size, the number of cars per head of the population is phenomenal, particularly in the last decade.  Would it not be cheaper instead of engaging in an ambitious road-building programme based on each county, to provide a free bus or rail service.  When we come to talk about free transport, we have the choice of going in the direction of road or rail.  Having regard to the balance of payments and the consumption of oil, it might be cheaper to have fewer cars, but then perhaps we would have less employment. It is a point one could cogitate on for ages.</P>
      <P>One could be critical of the fact that railways are losing money, that the road services, particularly on the longer runs, are losing money, and that it is only in the more concentrated areas that the road services earn money.  There are a number of variables here.  While it might be a mad thing to suggest providing a free service, it might in the long run save money, keep more money in the pockets of the people and keep them from burning oil needlessly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of energy, I do not know whether we are doing all we <Col N="1179" /> could to preserve our store of oil and cut down on its usage.  We have had two very good winters.  Last winter was a very mild one and this one promises to be somewhat similar. Perhaps we could save energy by paying attention to small things like switching lights off earlier and so on. It might be deemed to be a crumb in our total expenditure but any saving we can make in the consumption of oil would be very useful at present. Those are just a few disjointed remarks on the Minister's Estimate. One could devote a whole speech to energy alone and Bord na Móna, for example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The improved figures for the tourist industry this year are very encouraging.  We have gone reasonably well on the road to the £200 million input.  We should endeavour to reach that target as fast as we can.  It is definitely within the bounds of possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a very successful year in County Kerry.  All our tourist houses, particularly farm guesthouses, were utilised to the full.  Most of the people visiting farm guesthouses were British farmers with their wives and families. It is very nice to see those people coming over here.  They like to compare our farming methods with theirs. They get as much enjoyment from that as they do from the beautiful scenery.  Bord Fáilte should look into this aspect of tourism and induce more of those people to come here.  There is a lot of work to be done towards developing that type of traffic into the areas we want them to come to <Col N="1180" />&mdash;the backward areas, the small holdings in the mountain areas and along the sea coast.  There is an expertise in those areas which has never been appreciated by Bord Fáilte and the agencies dealing with tourism.  Most of the housewives in those areas have spent some time in Britain, America and other places doing domestic work. They are fully trained and have a knowledge of the way of life of British people and American people.  This is a great advantage in relation to the farm guesthouse accommodation.</P>
    <P>Most of the people engaged in farm guesthouse accommodation have very suitable accommodation today.  Their houses have been well improved.  They have carpeted lounges and all of them have bathrooms.  Some of the British tourists have been amazed at the facilities available in some of the small houses on the mountainsides.  These facilities are not available in similar type houses in Great Britain.  The Minister should do his best to exploit this type of accommodation.  The remote areas can do with a large input from tourism.  There is an inexpensive asset available in those guesthouses without the great expenditure associated with large hotels.</P>
    <P>People who come to those small guesthouses have babysitters to look after their young children.  The housewife in most of those small guesthouses is usually available to look after small children so that their parents can go anywhere they like at night time knowing that their young children are well looked after.  This is an asset which is not readily available in any part of Europe.</P>
    <P>We need to improve the roads into the backward areas I have been talking about.  Local authorities need money because they cannot face up to the expense necessary for that type of development.  We have many roads in County Kerry, particularly in mountain areas, which need constant attention.  Tourists often remark that we have very good roads side by side with very bad roads.  The small roads into mountain and scenic areas, the quiet areas tourists want to go into, should be developed.  This would encourage many more people to spend at <Col N="1181" /> least a couple of weeks there every year.</P>
    <P>This year a considerable number of German tourists, particularly German youth groups, came on holidays here. I heard several complaints from them about the lack of directions to historic monuments.  I refer particularly to monuments which go back to the Stone Age and before that.  We need to develop the pathways into those monuments and we also need signs pointing the way.  Young German people are most interested in those monuments.  In Ballyduff near Castlegregory there is an old druid altar still standing as it did thousands of years ago.  There is no sign telling where that monument is and there is no literature available to any tourist who may be interested.  I met some young German tourists this year who came across this monument and got some explanation from a very old man.  They wanted to dig deeper into its history but were unable to obtain any literature to help them.</P>
    <P>All over the country, particularly in coastal areas there are monumental stones called galláin.  There have been many suggestions in relation to their origin and what they were used for in bygone days.  It appears they were the centre of considerable habitation, where large groups of people gathered. Those stones are usually very tall, wedge-shaped stones, the centrepieces of four other stones.  It was the marking system by which the Druids worked out their calendar.  The habitations have all disappeared but we know that very close to them there is the old pagan burial ground that is known as the cillín.  Thanks to the exploration and the cataloguing of the various areas we can inform tourists, particularly the young, of the past history.  We must not forget that these young people are the family people of the future and it is well worth our while to give them this information.</P>
    <P>We have not given enough attention to such matters.  For too long we have tried to compete with the sun-drenched European countries. We have a very pleasant climate, one that people from warmer countries enjoy and we should not <Col N="1182" /> be ashamed of it.  Even more important we have the advantage that Irish people are known for their charm and kindness and this is an essential factor in attracting tourists. In addition we have first-class fresh food which few European countries can offer.  We should exploit all those assets if we wish to reach the target figure of £300 million in the years to come.  As Deputy Carter pointed out, our tourists could consume the surplus food we export.</P>
    <P>Those engaged in tourism have concentrated for too long on the aspect of the expensive hotel.  The original idea was to get wealthy American visitors here but I doubt if there are very many really wealthy people around now.  We should concentrate on the working people of Europe and Britain; they have plenty of money to spend and we have much to offer them.</P>
    <P>Young European visitors are very interested in our Gaelic culture.  In Kerry we have found that they like to visit the homes of the people and they are very pleased if they can attend family functions or dances.  In publichouses in Beaufort, Killorglin, Glenbeigh and in Cahirciveen, for instance, when an accordion player starts to play and people dance the old dances, it entrals the young visitors.  They are rather amazed that it happens spontaneously, that it is not just a show put on for tourists.</P>
    <P>In this House we have often referred to the necessity to extend the licensing hours particularly for the months of July and August.  In seaside resorts and other areas that attract tourists it would be a considerable help if the licensing hours were extended at least for a further hour.  Hotels get extensions for one reason or another and in the western areas in particular which depend on tourism we should consider making the necessary adjustment.  In Spain and France the licensing hours are much later and if we want to attract tourists from those countries we should consider this matter seriously.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to develop boating facilities in harbours and on lakes.  Visitors from the south and west <Col N="1183" /> of England in particular want these facilities; they want small boats with engines which they can take out themselves or they want larger boats that will take groups of people around the inner harbours.  There is considerable scope for this kind of development and it is an aspect that Bord Fáilte should examine.  We have magnificent harbours here.  For instance, Valentia Harbour is an ideal harbour and one that could be developed.  There are many more places that could be considered.  There are the inner parts of Dingle Bay, Kenmare Bay, Tralee Bay and parts of the Shannon.  Boating facilities do not exist in these areas and this aspect should be developed.</P>
    <P>Reasonable progress was made in regard to sea fishing through competitions and so on but it is not sufficiently exploited when we consider that there are more than two million coarse fishermen in Britain. We have made no attempt to tap that vast potential which could develop a further side of the industry.  We have been too concerned with the type of tourist who goes into hotels and our thinking for too long has developed along that line.  The vast numbers are on the sidelines.  The farm guest house is now making progress.  There is still great potential for development and the extraordinary thing about this type of tourist traffic is that it can operate from March until October, a very long period.  These fishermen operate through clubs and if we made the contacts, provided boats and other facilities here, I feel sure the type of traffic we need could and should be developed.</P>
    <P>Roads are of vital importance and in the allocation of money the Minister should keep a special eye on that type of development.  Some funds should be earmarked for the improvement of tourist roads to help that side of our industry.  I should also emphasise the importance of historical literature in connection with the monuments and sights that abound. We now have many students looking for jobs and the Minister might consider <Col N="1184" /> starting an agency of some kind to look after this side of our unknown past and see if it can be put in writing and made available for tourists with adequate references.</P>
    <P>Parking sites along roads in scenic areas are very important also.  We have some, but not enough.  In the past we had tourist grants particularly directed towards this type of work. At one stage, we had the tourist road grant, which I thought would be used to improve back roads but the county engineers were allowed to use it for main roads in different counties, on the basis that if you did not have a main road you could not have a back road.  I think the main roads should have been left to the normal authorities and the normal grants and the tourist grants should have found their way to the mountainsides and the back roads.  This did not happen and there is therefore a lack of development of this type of road.  The Minister should also press for the removal of the horrible dumps that exist.  I am not hitting directly at the one I mentioned. For years I have been looking at that horrible sight along the main road out of Cork.  I think at last it has been removed.  It should never have been there, at the gateway to our main tourist areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be glad to know that dump is closed now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>So I heard recently and I am glad, because not only was it a horrible sight but in passing there was sometimes a stench from burning material.  It remained all too long. Why local authorities who are charged with responsibility for planning and keeping scenic areas clean should be so blind to this type of thing is a mystery.  In Tralee we have a dump on the edge of the town on the road to Dingle.  We also have a dump in my own region in Killorglin.  Of all places they went east towards Milltown and put a horrible dumping site on a minor road which is a road along which there is tourist traffic.  We have places in mountain and bog areas where these dumps could be sited without offending anybody but the authorities seem to want good road <Col N="1185" /> sites to which it is easy to transport the material.</P>
      <P>I have tried, in Kerry County Council, to get local authorities to accept no refuse from any household that puts out plastic bottles and milk containers which remain in the ground for ever.  They can easily be burned, even in a five-gallon oil drum, and the residue is good fertiliser.  The dustmen, however, carry those plastic containers and huge cardboard boxes and these are scattered around the dumping site in an untidy condition.  If the Minister has power he should bring in the necessary regulations to deal with the local authorities and see that this practice is stopped.  It is a horrible set-up particularly in tourist areas because tourists use small roads to find beautiful scenery and eventually get to these terrible dumps.</P>
      <P>We also have motor car bodies thrown into quarries and such places. Steps should be taken to deal with that type of dumping and stop it once and for all.  These dumps stand out along our west coast because there is so much beautiful scenery there that the desecration is all the more obvious. While it is not any fault ordinarily of the people on the dumping site, it is a fault in that they dump this material without any consideration as to where it will end.  It is a reflection on the intelligence of our people and on our general approach to cleanliness and tidiness.  If the Minister can devise ways and means of dealing with this abuse he should do so.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would say again that we have a great asset in our climate which is the finest in the world in one sense, even though we do get rain in the summer months. To most people it is a pleasant climate. Most of the young hikers and cyclists want to see as much of the country as possible and they enjoy our climate. The charm of our people is commented on by all tourists and the food served in most of the farm guesthouses is equal to, if not better than, that served in hotels.  We must exploit those assets to the maximum if we are to achieve the target of development we are aiming at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we achieve that target we will <Col N="1186" /> have improved our employment position and have consumed some of the food we are at present trying to export. If the tourism industry realised £300 million we would not have to export the bulk of our food.  Those who have carried out improvements to their houses with a view to catering for tourists should be given every encouragement possible.  The more people who visit our country the more who will be made aware of the facilities we have to offer.  We can develop the tourist industry by cleaning up the dumps, improving our road network and giving more encouragement to those involved in the guesthouse business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When a Bill of this type is introduced the regular procedure is that everybody welcomes it. Comments are offered on areas where improvement might be made and suggestions as to methods of application of the funds made available by the legislature.  There should also be a critical analysis of what is involved. We should consider the appropriateness of the purpose, the amounts involved and the efficient, businesslike and economic application of the funds made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should realise that the Bill provides for the spending of a considerable sum of money from the public purse.  Naturally, one is prompted to ask, and it is our responsibility to ask: for what and what good purpose will be served?  The Bill provides for the expenditure of a substantial sum for tourism and the tourist industry.  We all agree that that is a good thing but we should also be conscious of the fact that we are going to spend this money at a time when there is considerable financial stringency and economic pressure, when there are great demands on the public purse and when in the last analysis these moneys will be provided by the citizen.  We often vote moneys here lightheartedly because it is a popular or good purpose&mdash;in this case nobody will deny that it is a popular and good purpose &mdash;but that does not relieve us from the recognition that this is a further burden on the resources of the state and on the citizens.  In current economic <Col N="1187" /> circumstances, particularly in a situation of economic difficulty arising from difficulties in our environment, apart from local difficulties, we must realise that money does not grow on the bushes.</P>
    <P>It is pertinent to remark that, in a situation where it is necessary for us to maintain a considerable body of our citizens with social services, people who are not in a position to earn, who are either unemployed or inadequately remunerated, the tax-paying community have to provide the money for this.  That is also a reason why we should scrutinise every penny we vote for payment in this House.  It may not be a popular thing to say but I believe it is the correct thing. As a consequence of that fact one should recognise that no matter what Government are involved this is a difficult and continuing problem.  It is difficult for them to find the funds and to keep everything going.</P>
    <P>We should bear these facts in mind when we press a Government to spend public moneys for any purpose.  It is too easy to commend popular expenditure and it is easy to decry necessary expenditure that may not be so popular but that is one of the psychological burdens a democratic Government have to carry.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that the purposes outlined in this Bill and particularly in sections 2 and 3 are good and popular. Two questions remain.  Can we afford to do this at this time, having regard to the increasing burdens on us?  The second question deals with the efficient application of the fund.  I am convinced that most of the remarks in the debate will deal with this question.  At this very moment the attitude of the IMF to the finances and economy of Britain, and the questions being asked, are a warning to Britain on the magnitude of public expenditure or, if not the magnitude, on the efficiency of the application and the return from public expenditure.  Perhaps consideration of these matters and an appreciation of the views of the IMF might not come amiss as far as we are concerned.  Not only does the question of whether can we afford it arise, but we must ask <Col N="1188" /> if this is inflating public expenditure. This must act as a brake on the Minister and the Government in a situation of this kind.  Even though I am a Member of the Opposition I would like to help the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis it is obvious that the attitude of the House and the people, especially those in the country, is in favour of this Bill.  But we must now ask what we will get in return for this expenditure.  Bord Fáilte are to be commended on their attitude and their work.  Essentially, and more and more in the present context, their attitude must be supervisory and one of control.  These moneys are being voted. It is the responsibility of the board and the Minister to see that adequate returns accrue to the community for the expenditure of these public funds. That responsibility should be underlined here and now, not underlined in the sense of suggesting that it will not be carried&mdash;I will make no such suggestion&mdash;not from the point of view of putting oneself in the position of making room for criticising afterwards and saying: &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, but rather from the point of view of giving authorities certain moral support where it will be later necessary, through legislation or administrative action, to carry through appropriate programmes to implement the purposes for which these moneys are voted.  It is from that point of view that I stress their role as a control and their responsibility as administrators of the funds this House votes.</P>
    <P>In that connection a few general thoughts occur, many of which have already been touched upon by Deputies in this debate and it is difficult to see how to take them in order unless one embarks on a general disputation on tourism as a whole which, I think, would be going a little far on this restrictive Bill.</P>
    <P>The basis of a viable, lasting and well-based tourist industry is the attraction of the area and the environment to which it is sought to bring the tourists.  This island has many advantages for its size.  We have two natural tourist resources&mdash;a certain sparsity of population in the most attractive areas and natural recreational <Col N="1189" /> facilities.  These two features have great tourist potential.  Ireland is not like Italy which has its own natural beauty, holiday resorts and so forth.  Unlike Ireland, Italy has permanently attractive centres, such as Florence, Rome and so forth, where there are in massive proportions historical, artistic or archaeological features that continually draw visitors, and stimulate what is called the tourist industry, that is, the organisation of accommodation and catering for passing visitors.  It must be remembered that we do not have that.  Neither do we have large areas where there can be very intensive internal travel.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding possible uncertainties in planning, what we have are natural scenic features on a scale appropriate to an island of this size. We have recreational or sporting facilities such as fishing, boating, the study of natural history.  Particularly we have facilities for simply enjoying pleasant and beautiful views.  We have certain natural colours in our landscapes that will attract and, as somebody remarked, we have a friendly and not too dense population.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise just what we have and that if we try to change to anything else, we may very well not be successful.  If we try to change to mass holiday resorts where you have in summer organised recreational facilities and activities that require steadiness of climate, we may fail on that one point of reliability of climate when we come to compete. We are too far north to compete in any way commercially from that point of view.  During the winter months there is only a limited attraction and there will be only a limited growth.  We do not have a Florence, a Rome or an Athens.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor spoke of archaeological interests, but when all is said and done, from the point of view of the casual tourist, to turn up in Newgrange is a very different experience from visiting the Colossus or somethink like that.  There is nothing here to match the massive ruins in Rome <Col N="1190" /> or Athens or the historical artistic value of Florence and other European cities or the historical value of Paris.</P>
    <P>I am not decrying what we have to offer.  What I am trying to do is to focus attention on the reality of the assets we have so that we can realise what we are doing and so that we will not over-exploit.  We should try to develop the cultural and dramatic values we have and in this context I think we should develop such events as the Wexford Festival and exploit our drama, keeping a sense of proportion from a commercial point of view.  We are appropriating and spending certain moneys and we must realistically consider what we can expect to get back.  Therefore, great discernment is called for when we consider the purposes for which we will spend these moneys.</P>
    <P>As I have said, let us be realistic in estimating our drawing power and the provision that has to be made for full, not over-exploitation.  Over-exploitation has the added disadvantage that it could possibly attract so much around it that it would choke it off.  Perhaps our greatest asset from a tourist point of view is the pleasant and relaxed atmosphere, its natural beauty and appeal, the fact that it is not, as yet, over-cluttered by exploitation and organisation.  These are the features that have made these islands attractive and they are the things that will be of importance in the future. As I have said, over-exploitation of them is the danger to be guarded against.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter mentioned pollution. It is a very widely used word but in the first instance, in the modern world we want cleanliness and efficiency, what is commonly known as sanitation&mdash;fresh air and cleanliness.  Therefore, from that point of view the control of industrial pollution is of paramount importance.  In this context I would raise the question as to whether some of this money might not in the first instance be well devoted to ensuring that anti-pollution measures are in force.</P>
    <P>Let us take the situation in this city <Col N="1191" /> from the point of view of the tourist. I intend mentioning only matters of which I am aware personally and in respect of which I would be prepared to give evidence to a tribunal.  Some of what I have to say comes within the ambit of the Minister: some of it does not but, perhaps, as a civility I should begin with that part which is not within the Minister's ambit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for long.  A visitor to the centre of this city finds an open sewer under O'Connell Bridge, the odour from which even on a cold winter's day is nauseating.  If the visitor looks over the wall he will be shocked at what he sees floating in the water.  I have not seen it as bad in some of the worst cities in Europe, from a pollution point of view.</P>
      <P>If one looks down on the city in the morning from, say, Mount Merrion or higher up, one sees a layer of smog.  I am aware that the PH of the rainwater in the centre city area has been as high as four, that is the acidity level.  As the Minister is probably aware, the lower the PH, the greater the acidity.  This is no commendation for a capital city.  I invite the Minister to view at certain times the chimneys of the generating stations along the river beyond Ringsend, from two of which he will see black billowing smoke.</P>
      <P>The taller one, admittedly, looks fairly efficient but I am told that it only pushes the smoke as far as Mount Merrion.  However, I shall leave that argument to the residents of the areas concerned.  Especially at times when there is an east wind one can see this black smoke over the city.  In these circumstances how can we talk of attracting tourists to our city?  How can the Department or the board hope to control pollution when State-sponsored bodies are causing it.  I am aware that anti-pollution measures involve technical difficulties, some of which may be insurmountable, and are very costly but I am not convinced that a serious effort is being made in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> There is in one of the most scenic areas in County Wicklow a factory which is fixing nitrogen.  I have seen raw nitrous fumes discharged into the atmosphere there.  At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts I asked whether part of the reason for the agricultural interests vacating Shelton Abbey was the presence of fumes in the area.  I did not get a denial.  Anybody can see the damage done to the trees in that area by the fumes from the factory.  To control pollution involves costly and, technically, very inconvenient measures but we must face the problem.  The problem is a many-sided one but I am inviting the Minister to face all the facts and arrive at decisions accordingly.  The only aspect of all this which I found slightly amusing was that on a certain occasion a factory of that nature had the gall to threaten, with a defamation action, a newspaper which mentioned the pollution factor.  Let me hasten to add that the organ concerned was not one with which I am associated.</P>
    <P>The area I am referring to is part of the county that we know as the Garden of Ireland.  It has beauty <i>par excellence</i>.  Only about a mile from Arklow there is the Woodenbridge area and not very far away is the historic area of Glendalough.  I realise that there is the economic consideration. There is the employment problem, the question of local employment. About 20 years ago, during the term of the first Coalition, I was one of those who pressed hard for the establishment of a fertiliser factory.  I urged that such a factory be based on nitrogen fixation.  Therefore, let no one think that I am arguing against the factory or even its location which might be more accurate.</P>
    <P>What I am pointing out is that, from the point of view of the Bill, there is a problem which has to be resolved and its resolution requires two things: money and goodwill.  It also requires the correction of a certain attitude engendered as a result of setting up autonomous semi-State bodies not answerable in this House, since responsible Ministers are insulated from questions in regard to such bodies.  I am saying to the Minister in plain <Col N="1193" /> language: &ldquo;Take that tourist area as it is and just see what way things are. If you want to be able to control the ordinary private sector and everybody else, then put your own house in order first.  If it is money that is required&rdquo;&mdash;and money will be required&mdash;&ldquo;ask for it but, at the same time, ensure the control is there and that what should be done will be done.&rdquo; Through the agency of the Minister, supported by all of us, control can be made effective.  If it is not effective then there is a positive built-in contradiction and disability and, if the State does not put its own house in order, in plain language it will not be able to get the co-operation of the community as a whole in this very important matter of fresh air, clean water, healthy vegetation and all the other essential elements constituting tourist attractions.</P>
    <P>The first prerequisite is to define pollution.  The very building up of a tourist industry tends to generate pollution. One brings in people and one immediately has a problem of the disposal of sewage, garbage and so on. There is urgent need to face the fact and to realise that pollution can be attributed in large measure to the development of tourism.  Here the State has a definite responsibility.  Again, modern methods of industry and agriculture tend to create pollution, particularly pollution of flowing waters and lakes.  We all know the problems attending on silage and concentrated animal husbandry.  Then there is the human factor.  There is the increase in population density with the disposal of sewage and refuse into water conduits for ultimate disposal in the waters around our coast.  This pollution has got to the stage where the problem has now to be considered all over the world.  It is a problem affecting us deeply because we are a small island.  Every day we hear stories of the serious pollution of our inland waters, with the destruction of fish and animal and vegetable life in these waters.  Tourism aggravates these problems.  A solution is a matter of urgency.  It is a matter of control, and this I emphasise, by the authorities. We have had debates on this aspect <Col N="1194" /> and the arguments advanced in those debates have a direct relation to tourism and the spending of money on it.</P>
    <P>Another danger is that of overdevelopment and overcrowding.  When a particular area proves itself&mdash;an example of this is Miami and the wellknown resorts in the Mediterranean&mdash; there is a tendency for that area to become a tourist attraction.  It draws the crowd and the crowd are exploited. I suppose that is but a manifestation of one of the laws of economics&mdash; when there is gold the goldrush will start.</P>
    <P>In tourism it is very important to exercise a real and moderating discretion. Many instances of this can be quoted outside this county.  An attractive area is discovered.  Certain local amenities are developed.  The people immediately concerned become conscious of the asset and they exploit it reasonably in two ways.  They improve its amenities and facilities and, in the first blush of interest, and the desire to make it a success, they concentrate on giving the maximum services on terms which the visitor will consider worth while.  That visitor comes back. That lasts for a while and that place is a success.  Very soon, because it is a success, it becomes physically overdeveloped and the basic attractions are polluted in another sense, or destroyed by overcrowding.</P>
    <P>If more people are brought in than a certain number&mdash;and it is very hard to estimate what that should be&mdash;there is an overcrowding problem which in the end sends people away rather than drawing them in.  After the first blush of enthusiasm, service deteriorates under the pressure of numbers and, worse still, greed asserts itself.  It appears to have been too easy to get a return and, before anyone realises what has happened, there is overdevelopment, which destroys the environment. Because of overcrowding, there is a deterioration in service.  Then there is the rooking of the visitor, the exploitation of the visitor in trying to get the last penny from him.  The result is perfectly obvious in the long run.  The place has its day, and then you are left with the relics.  Otherwise you <Col N="1195" /> settle down with a trade which may not only be less remunerative, and hardly economic, but which may be positively objectionable.</P>
    <P>This is a history which has been repeated in many places.  Having regard to the nature of our tourist resorts.  I should like to impress on the Minister and on the board the need for moderation and always keeping in mind the dangers of overdevelopment in the sense of overbuilding with consequent overcrowding.  We have seen the experience in Spain and in many parts of the Mediterranean.  That should be a warning to us that careful planning, involving this moderating factor of which I have spoken, is necessary in all areas, granted always that we save the amenity from pollution.</P>
    <P>Closely akin to that point&mdash;and I have already mentioned it&mdash;is the question of overcharging and exploiting the visitor.  It might be well to reflect that the visitor does not have to come here.  You can bring a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink.  In this case the problem is to bring the horse to the water. You will not bring him to the water unless the water is very palatable.  If you want to maintain the attraction, if you do not want a flash in the pan, which in the last analysis may degenerate into a confidence trick, then you have to set standards of service and cost as well as providing <i>bona fide</i> and genuinely the attraction the visitor comes to enjoy.  I am afraid humanity all over the world tends to overcharge. In the long run, this tendency has cleared out lucrative and quality business from many resorts, particularly when overcharging is coupled with inefficiency and incomplete service.</P>
    <P>If you are in the tourist trade you are inviting someone here.  You are, if you like, begging them to come here.  You hope to make a profit. You represent that you have something to offer.  Tourists will not come along unless the reality is a sufficient attraction.  Exploitation can kill tourism, particularly exploitation in the sense of overcharging, failure to provide the service expected&mdash;worse still, <Col N="1196" /> the service advertised&mdash;and failure to provide, in essence, what the tourist came for.  Incidentally, that is a very important consideration where publicity is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter referred to cooking and to our food.  This is something to which we should pay attention.  We have a long way to go.  I have sometimes been a little disturbed to find that in Ireland, very often a place where you get that bit of quality, that bit of atmosphere, just the type of thing you get in certain areas on the Continent, is run by a non-Irish person. He may be a German or a Frenchman, possibly reinforced by at least one member of the staff coming from Germany, France or Switzerland. That should give us cause to think.  What it really means is that we have not become conscious of what people want.  There are fashions but I am not talking about a permanent tourist industry.  One can go out in two old left shoes, cut half one's trousers off on one leg, get a guitar, dance around the street corner and, for a while, it will be great.  People will pay a lot of money to see it. But it will not last; after a while some child will turn up and say what it is, as with the King's clothes.</P>
    <P>I do not want to mention or even indicate locations but I can think of a few places which will keep going on that kind of thing, where there is a type of atmosphere that basically most people want.  We are all ready to turn out now and then for a turn but what most of us want for relaxation, and particularly for holidays, is a certain amount of comfort, quality, good service and not too much strain on our pockets.  We are not terribly good at giving all of those things together.  If we are easy on the pocket we may be reverting to the austerities of the ancient Irish monks as far as tourists are concerned; they do not get much for it.  If we do give quality&mdash;and very often we do; our good food and so on have been mentioned&mdash;we fail to create the atmosphere and dress it up in that little way that would make all the difference.  Unfortunately, I have not the gift of graphic description of <Col N="1197" /> exactly what I mean but I hope I have conveyed a general idea to the Minister of what I am saying.</P>

      <P>Exchange an opinion and I am willing to play that card game with him.  But it would be an abuse of this House for me to go any further and of my privilege here, which I would not wish to do, nor would the Minister wish me.  I am saying it, I hope, in the most constructive way, but I am suggesting that &ldquo;excelsior&rdquo; would be an appropriate motto everywhere as far as our catering system is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About cooking, presentation, finesse, atmosphere&mdash;our people are naturally courteous but, perhaps, a little naive and sometimes, although putting people very much at ease, may <Col N="1198" /> just not hit the note.  Remember that the tourist or the person on holiday wants to go to live in a little fairyland for a while, wants to get whatever is his version of fairyland.  One fellow way want to spend most of his time with a breathing apparatus diving under rocks while another fellow might like to take his wife out to a pleasant place to eat.</P>
    <P>I make the point, reinforcing what other Deputies have said and in an endeavour to help the board and the Minister, to command support for them, to command particularly understanding of them when they try to enforce standards, or when they lay down conditions aimed at maintaining standards.  All too often the Minister and the rest of us receive complaints that the board have not given this, that or the other grant.  I am taking, perhaps, the unusual course of saying: &ldquo;Yes, we must back the board, the Minister and all the necessary authority in maintaining standards, achieving efficiency and doing a good job.&rdquo; I am not cavilling at the voting of these moneys, once I have pointed out their origin and the seriousness of the business of voting money.  But I do want to re-enforce all concerned in the application of these moneys, in their power and authority to get the best return from them.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say in this respect is, as far as I am concerned, speculative; and a question of a great deal of staff work to come to any conclusion.  I assume that what we have in mind is the building up of a good class, nationally remunerative, permanent tourist industry.  That means we need to develop a tourist industry of value to the visitor and of profit to ourselves, that will last, that will not be a series of flash-in-the-pans or quick-witted living from hand to mouth, catchpenny types of things. I take it we have in mind something that will fit into our whole economy and of which we can be proud.  On that premise the pertinent question to be asked is just what is the quantity. That quantity can be measured in two ways: what is the monetary return to the community, or the anticipated volume of visitors?  Of course, <Col N="1199" /> the two are interlinked.  The answer to the target will depend very much on the resources, their organisation, and the approach to their use.  Notice I have said &ldquo;use&rdquo; not &ldquo;exploitation&rdquo;&mdash;because I used the word &ldquo;exploitation&rdquo; in the same sense&mdash; as I would like to keep my words meaning the same thing at one time. If approached in this way, there are the same kinds of problems one has in any business.  What are one's estimates? If one attempts to overproduce&mdash;and in this case it would be to try to bring in more than the resources will bear&mdash;if one endeavours to get the money to bring in so many people that the maintenance of standards becomes difficult, there is overcrowding, overdevelopment, then one runs the risk of almost certainly bringing about a situation where one will quietly kill, in time, the goose with the golden egg.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, as an all-human activity it would be a pity not to make the best of it, in the best sense of that phrase.  This is the managerial problem and the directing problem behind the development of our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I have heard figures mentioned about targets of the number of visitors and all that.  That type of approach can be too naive.  The permanent equilibrium that one is seeking to achieve has to be sought and measures taken to enable that balance to be met.  If you do not get that balance you are going to overshoot on one side, and on the other side you are going to be in a constant state of uncertainty and a certain amount of turmoil that leads to indecision, and you will not be getting the best of what you have.  Therefore a bit of realistic thinking along these lines is called for.</P>
    <P>I do not think I should delay the House any more on a Bill of this nature.  I thank the Chair for the indulgence of letting me wander to the extent I did on a Bill that is essentially voting moneys.  I hope the Minister will not feel that I have simply taken the opportunity to inveigh on the question of pollution.  I did not intend <Col N="1200" /> to do that.  What I did want to point out was the contradiction here and, above all, to emphasise that when we are voting these moneys to the board for this purpose, we are prepared to take action that is needed to give a return for the moneys we are voting, and that we are prepared to support action that is needed to control factors like pollution and other things that are involved in the problem. It is in that spirit that the Minister will have my support for his Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very pleased to hear Deputy de Valera mention pollution. While it is not mentioned in the Bill as far as I can see, it is relevant. We would welcome the Bill if we could be assured that the moneys would be well spent, such as on propagating the fact that our atmosphere is less polluted than in other countries and on ensuring that we have purer air than continental or cross-channel cities.  Our biggest selling points are the scenery, the pollution-free atmosphere and the excellence of hotels or guesthouses.</P>
      <P>Many of us recently spent some days in the west and, whatever about the result of our endeavours, we came to appreciate the very beautiful, clean air of the west.  To a city man this is something priceless.  I feel that people living on the overcrowded mainland of Europe will come here in greater numbers, all the time attracted by the atmosphere here, where the air is not always soot-laden, and where one can expand one's lungs with fresh air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether we recognise that we may have this pollution problem, but I would suggest to the Minister&mdash;I do not want to expand too much on it&mdash;that he would direct the Bord Fáilte hierarchy to consider this aspect seriously and try to preserve our present atmosphere, and then let Europe and the world know about it.  People are becoming more conscious of pollution, especially on the Continent.  If they have this green and misty isle to come to, they will appreciate the atmosphere that nature put there.  Having attracted them here for that, we must then ensure that <Col N="1201" /> their accommodation and what they pay for it will be reasonable.</P>
    <P>One might say that the cuisine should be continental.  If our hotels and guesthouses decide to have continental cuisine that is all the more reason why it should be in a very Irish atmosphere. People coming from England do not want to see a replica of some of their own resorts, which in their own way have done a great job to attract people and which the mass of the English people and indeed many Irish people enjoy.  I do not think the type of resort you get on the Lancashire coast, for example, is what would attract people to a resort here.  People coming from Britain and the Continent will tell you that their societies have become so impersonal that many of them are coming to live here because we still have enough friendliness left to greet the stranger and, if he asks the way, to be helpful to him.  Their own societies have become so insular that people do not want to communicate outside their own friendly circle.  One of the characteristics of the Irish people is their friendliness.  Thank God it is still with us, but it may be in danger if we try to ape other people and are not true to ourselves.</P>
    <P>We must preserve this atmosphere of friendliness and our own way of life. There are certain common denominators which should apply to all hotels and guesthouses, such as comfort, cleanliness and reasonable charges.  If we are wise we will try to develop this type of industry.  Many Deputies referred to overcharging, and this does happen at times.  Apart from that, one very often cannot get the simple things one asks for.  During the summer I was on the south-east coast staying in a grade A hotel, the biggest hotel in the town, not that I sought it but the rest were full, which I suppose is a good sign.  I asked simply for a piece of brown bread and could not be given it.  The manager of the hotel asked me was everything all right, and I said: &ldquo;No it is not&rdquo;, and I voiced my complaint.  He went off and I did not see him again.  I do not like making trouble in hotels so I let the matter go.</P>
    <P>When travelling through the country one may stop at a restaurant.  If one <Col N="1202" /> is five minutes outside a certain time one is told in a not very gracious manner that one is late and cannot have lunch but may have a sandwich in the bar or sandwiches and tea.  Too often in Irish hotels the bar is the dominating factor, that if one can get a bar licence this will attract the customers.  Many English people are temperate drinkers and they may want to spend the whole night over two or three drinks.  While I do not drink I do not try to impose my thinking on other people.  However, I suggest that if our hotels and guesthouses, especially in small towns, were to concentrate more on the food served and less on the bar their business would be on a firmer foundation.  One finds in any town in the country a large number of public houses but very few restaurants.</P>
    <P>I have often commented to people living in small towns on the fact that there are so few restaurants and so many public houses and the reply usually is that it is a matter of simple economics: that you start a business to make profit.  There is nothing wrong with that but those people feel that there is a lot more profit in beer than in bread and butter.  As long as we have that type of thinking we will not build up throughout the country a large number of good guesthouses and hotels. Unless we attempt to provide these basic requirements we will not have a good tourist trade.  If we have not got a good tourist trade we will never reach full employment.  Everybody feels that tourism is very important and could be a great source of employment.  It can even be an export business.  Visitors who come here and buy drinks, clothes and gifts increase our export trade. That is real export business, with no shipping charges.</P>
    <P>A satisfied tourist can be a very good propaganda agent when he returns to his own country.  We should always think of the damage that one dissatisfied tourist can do when he returns to his own country and tells his own people that he was badly treated, that he was overcharged and the place he stayed in was not clean.  We all know that this can happen on the Continent as well.  One can be overcharged and one can find accommodation which is <Col N="1203" /> not everything one desires.  Generally speaking, accommodation on the Continent is very clean.  Even if most of us are not very fastidious about food we are about the containers the food is served in.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that we should concentrate more on the British market, where there are 50 million people, most of whom have some affinity with us.  England is only a short distance away from us and English people have no trouble in changing their money here.  We speak the same language.  I am not suggesting that we confine our efforts solely to the British market but I suggest that a market of over 50 million people a short distance away from us should be fully developed.  Apart from any business which would ensue from this, it is important to bring English people here to help build up understanding and goodwill between both countries.</P>
    <P>We could show those people that they can come here with little fear of anything happening.  Society is developing so much today that there are very few cities abroad, whether in the USA, Britain or the Continent, where there is not some kind of agitation or violence.  We hope that some day this will end, but in the meantime we should show English people that this part of the country is, generally speaking, as quiet as any other country. When one travels to the Continent one is immediately asked about our troubles.  Those people think that there is violence all over the country. Bord Fáilte should explain the position in the country in the best way they can.  They should be able to say to tourists that Ireland is a place where one can have clean air, good accommodation, beautiful scenery and the kindness of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>We may be in danger of pricing ourselves out of tourism, which would be a great tragedy.  I realise that hotels today have frightful problems.  They deserve our help.  The State have shown in this Bill that they are quite willing to play their part in helping Bord Fáilte and the hotel industry generally to make the industry much better than it is.  There is great room <Col N="1204" /> for improvement.  We should lay down some basic rules, reminding restaurant keepers, apart from hotels, that they have a duty to the travelling public: they should be friendly to the client who may feel rather lost in a strange town, who does not want a large dinner but may want a small meal at any time of the day.</P>
    <P>We were always noted for our hospitality, but we must ensure that we do not destroy the image we have. While a person working in a hotel may be tired and perhaps overworked he should always bear in mind that hotels hold a very special place in our society.  Hotel workers have a very special job to do in making visitors feel at home and giving them the best food.  Visitors do not want to buy cutprice meals.  Most people want to pay a fair price for their meals.  Bord Fáilte should consider how hotels, guesthouses and farmhouse accommodation might be improved.  I took a farmhouse holiday on two occasions and I could not complain about them. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the owners did their best to ensure that the guests were satisfied.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach spoke at length about the Dublin city scene and I agreed with much of what he said.  I admit that parts of this city have a rather rundown appearance.  We should remember that in the last decade this city has gone through a transformation with regard to housing.  Ten years ago we started to pull down many of the old Georgian buildings in which five or six families were living and we had to replace those dwellings.  Consequently there are many gaps left in the city.</P>
    <P>I agree that the litter problem is not being taken seriously by some people but the vast majority of people, whether Dubliners or visitors, are aware of the problem.  If they were not so aware it would be ten times worse. Much of the problem is caused by a small minority who are careless and who do not bother about how they dispose of litter.  I go to the office early in the morning and I walk a considerable distance and I must fault some of the business people who have <Col N="1205" /> the unfortunate habit of putting out their litter bins overnight.  Invariably dogs rummage through the bins and the litter is scattered around the streets. I have seen seagulls alight on rubbish bins; they pick through the contents in their search for food and, consequently, the surrounding area is left in a most untidy state.  If a person throws litter on the street in a continental city he is prosecuted.  The Germans, the French, the Belgians or any of the other Europeans certainly would look with distaste on such behaviour.</P>
    <P>Our capital city could be given a facelift.  Most of the tourists who visit this country spend some time in Dublin and it is important that they have a good impression of the place. I would suggest to the Minister that when the Cabinet are preparing Estimates for next year he might consider having a special grant for this city.  There has been a revolution on the housing scene in the last ten years and it is continuing.  Many of the ugly gaps are there because even uglier buildings were pulled down. Until the construction industry gets back into stride and starts to build on these areas we will not have a city with a nice appearance.  This is a pity because parts of Dublin are beautiful.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask why should not Cork, Galway, Waterford or Limerick also get grants.  My answer is that they should because in any city there are areas where old buildings have been pulled down.  The Minister is not responsible for local government planning but he has a certain say in this matter.  For instance, he has the power of granting harbour works orders and he should be vigilant that no order is made that will damage our coastline.  It is one of our greatest assets and we should ensure that nothing spoils it.  Because we have a large coastline we must not become careless about it; for instance, we should be careful about allowing certain industries to locate in particular areas. I do not want to take up the emotional stance of certain preservationists. We must look at these matters factually and if we do this we will make decisions that will ensure the <Col N="1206" /> appearance of the areas in question is enhanced.  I know that a Government would not deliberately destroy a scenic part of the coastline but where it is a case of allowing in an industry that will provide jobs I accept that pressure will be put on the Government. I agree that we need plenty of employment but, equally, there are features of our coastline that have been there for more than a million years and we must not sacrifice them for a temporary benefit.</P>
    <P>Each year I am obliged to complain about signposting throughout the country.  The people responsible for this matter have the most annoying habit of erecting signposts with only two direction signs and in parts of the country they appear to cater only for local people.  On the major intersections of every large town we should have signposts with four direction signs showing the largest towns in each direction.  If one goes off the main road one can journey for miles without seeing a signpost.  I must admit that the tourist board in the Six Counties are much better at signposting.  In the balmy days of peace one could go through the Six Counties and never have much difficulty in finding any place because there was proper signposting.  It is very aggravating to be lost in a rural area where one may not meet a pedestrian or another motorist, which is part of the attraction in leaving the main roads.  I ask Bord Fáilte and the local authorities to step up the standard of signposting.  There is great scope here for effort with a purpose because if we are to attract more visitors from abroad we need better signposting.  While the present signs are attractive we could go in for more colour and every so often we might introduce a new type of sign.  I think it is right to say that one sees less vandalism in regard to signposts now than a few years ago.  I could never understand people in a local area spoiling the direction signs there which are meant to help visitors to the area.</P>
    <P>General road conditions are improving and it must be heaven for a motorist from Britain or the Continent to <Col N="1207" /> travel on our roads, which are so traffic-free compared with roads in England, Germany or Belgium.  These are priceless things.  For many years under successive Governments, we have been trying to build up tourist trade and we had succeeded to a great extent until recent unfortunate happenings. People are so adaptable, however, that they are now coming back again and I think next year will see a big rise in our tourist trade.  This means more employment.</P>
    <P>Although much criticised, CIE do a good job in looking after those who travel on their tourist coaches.  Perhaps they could do more.  I suggest that perhaps Bord Fáilte could prevail on CIE to acquire smaller buses to take visitors on runs around Dublin. It is sometimes depressing to see a 39-seater bus carrying three or four people and it is also uneconomic. While they could retain the 39-seaters when they could fill them, they could also have a minibus, perhaps, in which people would feel more comfortable than if there are six people sitting in a 39-seater bus.  Apart from the cost, I applaud CIE's efforts to ensure that even the six people are taken around but they might consider acquiring the smaller buses for occasions when numbers are small.</P>
    <P>Foreign advertising by Bord Fáilte could be stepped up.  At home we see in offices and factories where young people work huge posters for Austrian and French resorts but if you go to a factory or office in Antwerp or Paris I doubt if you will see many posters advertising Ireland as a resort.  Bord Fáilte could well spend some money advertising abroad because when one speaks to continentals one realises how little some of these people know of Ireland.  One is forever telling them that we are not part of the United Kingdom mainland, that we are a separate island and people with separate traditions and characteristics.  If this were conveyed to them it would make Ireland much more attractive to them.  The whole matter of advertising must loom larger for Bord Fáilte in the future.  I would not complain about money spent on good <Col N="1208" /> advertising abroad.  I assume we shall improve the standard of our hotels and restaurants so that when we sell our country abroad in its many qualities we can do so happy in the knowledge that we are not overstating the case and that we can tell them truthfully to come to Ireland where they will have a very good holiday at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>It is essential for the development and expansion of our economy&mdash;and even in the interests of international goodwill&mdash;that we do this because the vast majority of the men and women in the tourist industry are striving to make things better.  Perhaps the Minister could consult with the Minister or the Department of Local Government so that we can plan what is to be done in those two Departments to ensure that ordinary public amenities are maintained at the high standard we should have.  Toilet facilities in country towns and even in some hotels have been the subject of vulgar jokes.  They have been derided generally and I do not want to go further and perhaps be accused of plagiarism but in some cases these fundamental amenities seem to be regarded as something for which there must be some provision but for which one does not need any standard of perfection. Through Bord Fáilte the Minister might insist on the simple requirements being met.  Grants to guesthoueses and hotels should not be given if the basic requirements regarding toilets and sanitation are not met. We should aim at a high standard so that Irish hotels will some day be able to boast that they rank as high as any, whether on this side of the world or in the United States.</P>
    <P>The people who hold the key to the success of this industry are the hotel staffs, the owners of hotels and farm guesthouses.  The staff of an hotel can make or mar a person's holiday by their attitude. Thank goodness most of the staffs in our hotels give one the impression that they want to see visitors, that they are glad visitors stay at their hotel.  They make visitors feel at home but, unfortunately, one meets the other type of person, the <Col N="1209" /> person who gives the impression that he thinks a visitor cannot pay the bill soon enough and get out, who charges visitors for little services.  Such people, when asked by a guest for a newspaper, are quick to tell that person that he will have to pay extra.  No one expects to be given a newspaper at no extra charge, but the charge could be put on the guest's bill.</P>
    <P>Hotel staffs have an important part to play in this industry.  If guests are not treated correctly the tourist industry suffers and unemployment occurs in hotels.  Those involved in the running of hotels are engaged in a very demanding business, and one which has many problems.  We are all aware that it is impossible to please some people but the majority of tourists are reasonable and only seek comfortable and clean accommodation at reasonable rates.  While the staff of our hotels have an important part to play in the development of our tourist industry the general public must also make a contribution.  The industry proved so successful in Switzerland, France, Germany and Spain because the people of those countries gave the tourist the impression that they were welcome.  They do everything possible to see that the tourist has a good time, is given proper food and clean accommodation.</P>
    <P>While we are practically newcomers to tourism Irish hospitality is centuries old.  The continentals have learned that to be successful in the business one must work hard.  They are also aware of the value to their economy of the tourist industry.  I accept that the hotel industry, in conjunction with vocational education committees, have sent people abroad on training courses but this should be expanded in order to ensure that the staffs in our hotels are trained to the highest possible degree.  We lack a fluency in continental languages and hotel staffs should be encouraged to learn another language.  Last week, while staying in a hotel in the west, I was pleased to hear a member of the staff conversing in French with visitors who spoke no English.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we lack this ability to speak continental languages. <Col N="1210" /> I admire the ability of continentals to speak so many languages.  I hope we can look forward to the day when our airports and sea ports will be packed with visitors who can enjoy their holidays in typical Irish atmosphere. When naming hotels owners should give them distinctive Irish names to show that we are different, that we have a national characteristic of our own.  Visitors would be more impressed by that than they would if we were a mere replica of what can be seen across the channel.  We are moving in the right direction but we should give ourselves a shake and go a bit faster to meet the requirements of the modern tourist industry.</P>

      <P>As most speakers said, any Government plan to improve the tourist industry is to be welcomed. Most of the contributions concentrated on improving the ideas of Bord Fáilte and the Government.  I had a certain amount of difficulty understanding the overall plan mentioned by the Minister in his opening statement. He said that the purpose of the Bill was to provide for a new tourism development fund which would replace the major resort development fund.  He indicated that all that can be done for the 19 resorts he spelt out in his opening remarks had been done and he was thinking of another type of assistance at this stage.</P>
      <P>What is section 2 all about?  I will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to query the Minister further on this.  Will the old heading&mdash;major resort development fund&mdash;be replaced by the new form of tourist development when it is introduced?  For years we have been trying to attract holiday-makers from Britain and the Six Counties.  We talked for years about attracting the North American visitors but when the wind blows, we talk about a falling off in tourist traffic from the North American area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently there was an alarming suggestion that Aer Lingus intended to withdraw their trans-Atlantic service. This got a great deal of publicity and it was said that Aer Lingus were losing a considerable amount of money.  We have been told that Aer <Col N="1211" /> Lingus will do their best to sell that service, but if they do that, we will be dependent on Pan Am, Trans World Airlines and other companies to bring visitors here.  I do not think those companies will co-operate with Bord Fáilte as well as Aer Lingus did. One could criticise Aer Lingus but taken all round they work in harmony with Bord Fáilte.  It would be an unwelcome step from the point of view of the tourist industry if this decision was taken.  The reason I made this point was because I do not consider enough encouragement has been given to the stay-at-home holiday-maker.</P>
    <P>A neighbour was telling me that he brought his niece back to school somewhere in the County Clare area.  When returning he went into one of the hotels for an evening meal&mdash;luckily I cannot remember the name.  He called for the dinner menu and noticed that the meal would cost £5.50.  Naturally he felt he was in the wrong place and was frightened off.  He called somebody&mdash;I do not think it was the head waiter, it was probably the manager&mdash; and asked him if he could suggest somewhere else he could go for a meal as he could not afford their prices.  He had his dinner in that hotel but it cost him about £2.00.  The management told him that they had to gear their business for the tourist trade; it was geared to milk the North American tourist.  He said he could give him dinner costing around the £2 mark and also told him to tell his friends that they too could get dinner there for that figure.  It is extraordinary that we should have this double standard, although it is extremely welcome from the Irishman's point of view.  I presume that the management could not issue two separate menus, one for the foreigner and one for the Irishman but if more Irish people knew about this I am sure a greater number would dine in that hotel.</P>
    <P>I know this neighbour very well and he is not in the habit of telling tall stories.  I believed him.  As I said, he mentioned the name of the hotel but it escapes me at the moment. <Col N="1212" /> One is inclined to say that something should be done about it.  If it was an economic proposition to serve that dinner at £2.50, the hotel would be more attractive to tourists if it stuck to that figure.  One of the reasons why we have so much squealing during the last few years about the fall in tourists is that both visiting and home tourists have been milked too much.  I appreciate there are overheads.</P>
    <P>I was not in west Mayo but some of my colleagues have told me about the situation there in the normal summer tourist areas, like Achill.  They are nearly totally closed down at this early winter period.  One would not anticipate any great difficulty about getting accommodation there in winter but I gather there was quite an amount of trouble about getting accommodation mainly because of lack of staff, and families who had worked up to six months during the summer taking the remainder of the year off.  One can expect such people to try to get a little bit more out of tourists if they have to live for 12 months on the income from six months.  I can see the Leas-Cheann Comhairle worrying lest I am wandering from the Bill.</P>

      <P>I will jump to another matter.  The one-time Minister for Transport and Power, the late President Childers, got a lot of adverse publicity and some favourable stuff&mdash; most Fianna Fáil Ministers at that time were getting 90 per cent adverse publicity&mdash;when he called for the erasing from hotel menus of the term &ldquo;Windsor Soup&rdquo;.  He succeeded because I have not been in a hotel for a long time in which I have found Windsor Soup on the menu.  I cannot understand many of the French terms on hotel menus.  I am not calling for the abolition of these terms but I was interested recently in a survey carried out by either the <i>Sunday Press</i> or the <i>Sunday Independent</i> who gave a view of the average Irishman's and Irish woman's choice from a menu.  The interviewer went out with a menu from the Shelbourne containing all the appetisers, all the soups, all the <Col N="1213" /> main courses, all that jazz.  Dublin men and Dublin women were asked what their favourite appetiser was, their favourite soup, their favourite main course and their favourite sweet.  There was a choice of ten or 11 dishes for each course.  The favourite appetiser was smoked salmon and next was prawn cocktail. Most of the items on each dish were in French but, of course, the interviewees could not pronounce them.</P>
      <P>Personally I am quite capable when I go to the Shelbourne&mdash;nobody covers an expense account for me&mdash; of asking the waiter what the heck that is on the menu in regard to some of the unpronounceable courses.  If I had been asked on the street what my favourite appetiser is, I would have said prawn cocktail or smoked salmon.  In the interview I have been speaking about, fillet of steak was the choice for the main course although there were three or four items on the list which did not get a stroke because of the inability of the interviewees to pronounce them.</P>
      <P>I would point out that I am not suggesting we should not have anything but bacon and cabbage or the straightforward steak, but there are the most extraordinary descriptions on menus for fillets of steak.  I do not think anybody has made any effort to simplify the description of roast beef.  We are part of Europe and I presume we are following the European pattern, but I think the whole object of the exercise from the hotel point of view is to put a fancy name on a dish and to add 20 per cent to its price.  I was listening to a radio broadcast, one of these Rodney Rice type of things&mdash;I have to switch off the Gay Byrne note&mdash; and somebody was saying we do not make sufficient use of the good food we have.</P>

    <P>Deputy Carter spoke of good food being spoiled.  To illustrate a point in this regard I would refer to my introduction recently to a Chinese restaurant.  While I enjoyed the meal presented, the type of food offered in those restaurants would not be entirely to my taste.  However, I noticed that there were pigs' ribs on <Col N="1214" /> the menu as an <i>hors d'ocuvre</i>.  This type of dish is not likely to be found in some of our own better class restaurants and this is a pity.</P>

      <P>The point I am trying to make is that some of the food which we have tended to belittle is becoming a speciality and at exorbitant prices.  When I was very young I recall pigs' feet, crubeens, being on sale on fair day but nowadays there are some people who would consider it <i>infra dig</i> to buy or eat these parts of the pig.  However, the wheel has turned and we are reaching a stage where ribs and crubeens will be more costly than the back rasher. This is not a welcome development. No doubt if such top-class hotels as the Hibernian, the Shelbourne or the New Jury's were to put those dishes on their menus as a speciality, the prices would be exorbitant.  It is regrettable that we have lost sight of the value of these sources of food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of tourism I might mention that I spent a short time touring in Scotland during August last. Something that struck me forcibly during that trip was the provision of numerous lay-bys and that on these lay-bys there was no shortage of litter containers.  None of these containers ever seemed to be overflowing, which indicated that they were emptied regularly.  This is an aspect of tourist amenities that we have not concentrated on.  I am aware from my contacts with the business community in my constituency that there is a fast growth in the number of tourists who choose to cook for themselves by the roadside.  I suppose the high charges in hotels have been a factor in this development.  Traditionally my constituency did not benefit to any extent from State subsidies to tourism.  This was because we had no tourist resorts. However, development of this nature is taking place now in the Slieve Bloom area.  We had, however, the benefit of a passing trade.  Were it not for the civic training that visitors have before coming here there would be much greater indiscriminate <Col N="1215" /> disposal of litter because of the nonavailability of disposal units.  The tidy towns competition has helped in this regard and the local committees urge school authorities to instruct the younger generation in these matters.</P>
    <P>I returned from Scotland <i>via</i> Larne.  I walked through parts of Dundalk on the way home and I was appalled at the absence in that town of litter disposal units.  There was one long street in which there was no such unit and this was evident from the general untidiness of the area. Contrasting this situation with what I had experienced in Scotland, I was appalled that we should be so remiss in these matters.  We are not as litter conscious as we should be.  I know from people who have been on the Continent that one can be fined the equivalent of £10 if one is caught dropping a matchbox, a cigarette packet or any kind of litter on the street.  We talk about encouraging people not to drop litter.  I wonder if eventually we will have to take more positive action in this regard.  There is carelessness and very often it is carelessness on the part of people one would expect to know better.  I have walked the streets of Dublin and I have been amazed at the people I have seen dropping litter in the streets.  There is no shortage of litter bins and, as the advertisement says, they are generally hungry.</P>
    <P>I do not go all the way with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach in his castigation of Dublin as a dirty city.  There is room for improvement certainly.  I support the Parliamentary Secretary in one of his arguments on the Bill.  He talked about people who come in to Shannon and visit Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo and Donegal and he suggested they should also be encouraged to visit the capital city.  On the other hand, there are people who come to Dublin who do not go down the country.  The Parliamentary Secretary suggested these people should be provided with very cheap tickets to encourage them to visit the country.  This would be beneficial. We have good train services and good bus services.  I agree with all <Col N="1216" /> that but I think we should also encourage our own people to holiday at home.  I know the Minister is bound to take the Parliamentary Secretary's contribution seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I recommend the Minister to take the Parliamentary Secretary's contribution seriously.  I have to be very careful now because the Parliamentary Secretary always seems to be listening when I am speaking and I have an extraordinary effect on him; he invariably comes rushing into the House to contradict something I said.  The Minister was not here when I spoke about the 19 resorts which got grants under the resort development fund.  This new fund under subsection (2) is considered to be a replacement for the original fund.  I expressed the hope that this will not mean there will be no more money out of this new fund for the still further development of the 19 areas the Minister spoke about.  We can deal with this in detail on the Committee Stage.  All my life since I was a child Tramore has been my seaside resort.  I always found it most attractive. There were a million and one different ways in which one could get rid of one's money.  Now there are two million and one different ways.  One can get rid of it in a more sophisticated way.  Tramore has everything.  A great deal of development work has been done but still more remains to be done.  Salthill has got its share out of the fund and Ballybunion, which I know reasonably well, has got its share.  I take it the new fund is not just for the purpose of developing new resorts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is merely enlarging the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Why it is called a new fund?  We can deal with this on Committee Stage.  I was a little puzzled because when the Minister was introducing his token Estimate for £10 he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the 1975 Estimates for my Department were being settled, £600,000 was allocated to subhead <Col N="1217" /> F2, which relates to grants to Bord Fáilte for the major resort development scheme, in the knowledge that advances of only £62,283 would bring total issues in respect of the scheme to the statutory limit of £4 million.  The intention was to transfer the balance of £53,717 later to a new subhead in respect of the tourism development fund envisaged in the Tourist Traffic Bill, 1975, which was then in preparation.</P>
    <P>If we did provide more than we were statutorily allowed to provide surely this Bill puts the matter in order.  I cannot understand why there is any need to create a new subhead to put the matter in order.  I trust the Minister will explain when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>We have express buses to facilitate tourists.  While facilitating tourists we should never forget our own.  In the early days Bord Fáilte emphasised that we should see Ireland first.  Over the past couple of years we had to rely to a great extent on home holidays, and on trying to encourage our own people to stay at home.  Last summer helped us to achieve that.</P>
    <P>Recently CIE introduced changes. They have an &ldquo;Expressway&rdquo; bus system to take people from one destination to another.  They overlook people at intermediary points.  I was looking at a television programme last night in which a beautiful little town in my constituency was featured.  It was remarkable that the man who was featuring his home town is PRO for CIE.  Of necessity, he had to feature a protest by the local community against the &ldquo;Expressway&rdquo; bus rushing through the town of Durrow without stopping in its effort to get to its destination in a hurry.</P>
    <P>That type of development which overlooks the requirements of the local people in towns which had a service, which is now being withdrawn, is bad.  A moment ago I spoke about the shopkeeper who benefits from the passing tourist in his car.  He is of benefit to towns in intermediate areas, from the time he arrives in the country.  Everybody on his route has a chance to benefit.  CIE are now cutting <Col N="1218" /> out half of the potential customers. I have heard other Deputies complain about this.  There is such an outcry about it that I would advise CIE to rethink this decision which affects tourism.  Overseas, Bord Fáilte tell potential tourists who are bringing their cars that our roads are comparatively less crowded, that they can have a leisurely holiday, and that the cars will not be bumper to bumper.</P>
    <P>I would like to try to slow down these &ldquo;Expressway&rdquo; buses.  That does not mean we should not have a more reliable and more genuine service which would keep to its time schedule. I appreciate that if a bus is travelling from Cork to Dublin without any stops it will get to Dublin much more quickly.  Of course, we have a train service from Cork to Dublin.  This &ldquo;Expressway&rdquo; service passes through Durrow without pulling up.  I do not see any reason why it should not pull up.  I should like the Minister to have a look at that.  While this does not directly concern the Bill, it concerns it indirectly.</P>

      <P>I should like to say first of all how interesting I found the discussion on this Bill and how pleased I was that so many Deputies contributed. Many novel, original and useful ideas were thrown out.  Early in the summer Bord Fáilte produced a little booklet with the catchcry that tourism is everybody's business.  This is quite true.  It is reflected in the fact that so many Deputies are knowledgeable about the tourist industry and the role of Bord Fáilte.  From reading the debate, Bord Fáilte executives will learn a good deal.</P>
      <P>I should also like to congratulate Deputy Leonard on his contribution as spokesman on tourism for the Opposition Party.  I appreciate the research he put into it.  I am sure we will be able to work together.  There will always be an element of working together between the Minister and the spokesman for the Opposition, and a necessary amount of collaboration and co-operation. I congratulate Deputy Leonard on his speech and on his constructive approach to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> A number of points were raised on which I feel I should comment.  Deputy Leonard, Deputy Brennan, Deputy Brugha and other Deputies referred to the problems of hotels and suggested that a banking system for the hotel industry should be set up.  I do not think that would make any difference unless the rate were to be subsidised.  If they incurred debts the debts would still need to be paid off.  Bord Fáilte already have an interest rate for hotels.  They subsidise the bank interest.  This is one of the grants they give.</P>
    <P>We must try to get the tourist industry into such a healthy state that the hotels will not need assistance.  We now have a good stock of hotels.  Any further growth should be generated from profits inside the industry.  This is a far healthier way of doing it. Early in the 1960s there was a need for Bord Fáilte to give an injection into the hotel industry to provide hotels where they were scarce and not up to Bord Fáilte standards. That day has gone.  In fact, in the late 1960s and the early 1970s the pendulum swung too far the other way and, perhaps, we provided too much money for too many hotels, some of them in the wrong locations. That has steadied down.  We are probably right now.  I do not say we will be right for all time in the number of bedrooms we have.</P>
    <P>It may seem strange to say that in a few years' time Dublin will possibly be looking for extra bedroom accommodation. It should be provided, if possible, through the industry itself, by the individual <i>entrepreneurs</i> who may want to go into the industry.  I know a separate banking institution has been called for frequently to cater for the industry.  It has been compared to the farming industry.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation provide funds for the farming industry but I do not think a separate bank would be a suitable vehicle for financing hotels.  Bord Fáilte have spoken to the banks and generally they have recognised the problems of the hotel industry over the past three, four, five or six years and have treated them as leniently as <Col N="1220" /> possible within the constraints of the banking stystem.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies also referred to the self-catering and rent-a-cottage schemes.  I am very interested in these.  They have been very beneficial to the tourist industry.  That was the tenor of the debate.  Deputy Carter and a number of others referred to the necessity to maintain standards.  The rent-a-cottage scheme has certainly done that.  In Europe and indeed most parts of the world now there is a movement towards a form of self-catering holiday as opposed to the hotel or guesthouse&mdash;a movement perhaps not so much from the guesthouse as from the hotel&mdash; which is growing in importance and in popularity among not alone incoming tourists but our own people. Although they do not show up on the balance of payments side of tourism, our people are tourists in the sense that they take holidays here, they must be catered for and the standards maintained for them as well.  The rent-a-cottage scheme is a new concept. It is one on which I am very keen.  The standards are high and it has a very good future.</P>
    <P>Certainly we should encourage the growth of self-catering accommodation but we must be very careful of our standards.  There is nothing worse than an advertisement appearing in an English or continental paper advertising a cottage or house for rent during the months of July and August in some part of Ireland, the advertisement reading: &ldquo;Fully equipped; bring nothing.&rdquo;  The visitor comes over and finds the cottage or house dirty, poorly equipped, with perhaps lack of furniture, utensils, heating or lighting.  This does not give the industry or the country a good name.  It is a sector of the industry I should like to see growing and perhaps we could develop a system of overseeing the standards of such self-catering units.  It has advantages over the hotel&mdash;as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows perhaps better than any of us&mdash;and has tremendous social benefits for the area in which it is located.  People who come to <Col N="1221" /> these houses benefit the local community and, in turn, they benefit from living in what is a strange community.</P>
    <P>I was in north Mayo last Sunday opening a scheme of cottages and six or eight out of the total ten are occupied at present.  Therefore it is a season that can be stretched, perhaps not at the full economic rent but at least in a way that will contribute to overheads.  In many ways it has changed Ballycastle in north Mayo since the scheme first started functioning in July, 1974, inasmuch as the people shop in the village, go to the pub to buy a drink and, when they walk down the road to the beach, they pass people and stop and talk to them.  Therefore it is of tremendous financial and social benefit to the natives living there.</P>
    <P>I have spoken with Bord Fáilte in this respect.  They are at present participating in a pilot scheme with a large operator in England advertising self-catering accommodation in this country.  I hope it will be very successful but I must stress that we must be terribly careful of standards. People are becoming more and more discerning, not alone about hotels and guesthouses but accommodation generally.  Deputy Lalor spoke about the condition of our streets and roads. We must always be very conscious of standards and ensure that they are maintained at a very high level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan spoke about the limited provision of money.  He totally misunderstood the purpose of the Bill.  Under the old Act the limit was £13 million.  To date nearly £12 million of that has been spent on holiday accommodation.  It was to allow a further £3 million, raising the amount to £16 million, that the Bill was introduced.  But that does not mean that £3 million will be spent this year.  I think Deputy de Valera referred to this also this evening.  It is merely a provision to lift the ceiling of what can be spent.  Bord Fáilte will have to come back to the Government and normal budgetary constraints will obtain in their case also. If the money is to be spent they will have to seek specific permission for <Col N="1222" /> any individual amounts spent under this subhead in the budget.  Because £3 million is passed here it does not mean they can spend it all in the current financial year or the next one. Each individual item will have to be approved by me and by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I cannot remember any Deputy who did not refer to pollution and the environment.  This realisation of the necessity to preserve our environment is very healthy.  This applies not only to visitors, although it is important to them as well because many of them come from countries where there is a greater awareness of the ugliness of a dirty atmosphere and conditions and they are appalled at the condition of some streets in this country.  In this regard the tidy towns competition has done a very good job in lifting the standards in villages and small towns. Regrettably that message does not appear to have got through to the larger towns or cities yet.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and a number of Dublin Deputies spoke about this.  In this city and my own city of Cork I am afraid the standard is extremely low in spite of the large sums of money that ratepayers in both these places contribute towards the clearing of litter.  It may be a long haul. Perhaps education is what is needed.</P>
    <P>If this message is got through to the three, four and five-year olds, and we keep plugging it through, they may come out better, cleaner and more litter-conscious than were we.  With regard to control in this respect, Deputy O'Leary seemed to think it should be left to the local authorities and I think it was Deputy O'Kennedy who felt that local authorities should have no say in the matter.  The middle road here would appear to be the correct one.  What Bord Fáilte are doing is exercising their powers under the 1963 Planning Act in conjunction with the local authorities.  This means a partnership and certainly the local authorities have a function to play. Bord Fáilte, from their very real concern and knowledge of the effect on tourism and revenue of a poor environment, <Col N="1223" /> have a function also.  They and the local authorities should concentrate on this in an effort to achieve higher standards.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also made the case that a Department of the Environment was necessary.  Practically every Government Department have what might be described as an environmental interest&mdash;Industry and Commerce from the point of view of the IDA; Local Government which have perhaps the prime interest; my own Department in tourism; and Health from the point of view of health standards.  It is for that reason that an inter-departmental committee was set up, as the Taoiseach mentioned in answer to a parliamentary question about three or four weeks ago, to investigate how co-ordination between the various Departments involved can be achieved in this matter of pollution and environmental control.</P>
    <P>I spoke at the opening of an effluent treatment plant in Ballineen, County Cork, in September.  For those Members who are on local authorities it is worth restating what I said, and I quote from it now as follows:</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that Industrial, agricultural and residential development is not achieved at the cost of serious environmental damage.  This applies particularly to water and air pollution and to waste disposal.  At the same time we must be realistic.  Economic expansion and the planned programmes for housing, industry and agriculture cannot but make some impact on the environment, bringing about changes in the landscape and increased pressures on natural resources.</P>
    <P>Then I went on to say that frequently towns and local authorities, by not having proper control of pollution in the area within their control, are ruining the very tourist amenity by which many of them live.  They are killing their own golden egg.  I think of two towns in particular who have very valuable fishing lakes into which they are pumping sewage from the town. <Col N="1224" /> If those two towns do not realise the damage they are doing to their own businesses and do not face up to the cost of treating this effluent before it is discharged into the sewers, then they will kill tourism in their area, to the detriment primarily of their own area because there are other areas which are treating it and in which there are lakes and rivers that are clean.  Hopefully, the worst that would happen in that regard is that the people who normally went to these areas to fish and enjoy themselves would switch to another Irish town, but it is possible that they would switch away from Ireland altogether.  We must face up to the fact that we can no longer put into our lakes and rivers untreated agricultural, industrial or ordinary domestic effluent.  There is a cost involved here that will have to be borne either locally by ratepayers or nationally by the Government or a combination of the two.  Otherwise we will kill some of our fish stocks in rivers and also our tourist industry.  As well as that, we shall ruin the environment in which we grew up and which we want our children to enjoy.  They will not enjoy it unless we apply our minds to this problem.</P>
    <P>In this regard Deputy O'Kennedy referred to Bord na Móna and to the damage that peat silt draining off the bogs was doing to part of the Shannon. This is something that was denied before by Bord na Móna.  I remember answering questions on this here in the House about six months ago.  Bord na Móna deny they are doing this and say that this pollution of the stretch of the Shannon in question has been observed comparatively recently, whereas they are draining the bogs into the Shannon for over 20 years.  The section of the river that is involved is the catchment of the Shannon above Portumna, but, in fact, the area of bog being worked there by Bord na Móna is only 1.5 per cent of the total catchment involved.  Nevertheless, they agree there is a mixture of silt and turf peat in the bottom of the river that makes boating difficult, this they have undertaken to remove this next spring at the low water.  They have engaged An Foras Forbartha&mdash;and I think most Deputies will agree that this is an <Col N="1225" /> independent organisation in this regard &mdash;to see what damage, if any, has been done to the fish in the river and, if so, who is to blame.  I will not anticipate the findings of An Foras Forbartha here today, but Bord na Móna are quite confident that when the report is produced they will be found to be innocent in this regard.  If any Deputy is interested, I shall be glad to send him a copy of the report, which I think will be available in about another month.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about the new zoning strategy of Bord Fáilte.  These zones are being drawn up in consultation with the various local authorities.  They are not permanent zones.  If as time goes on they are found to be wrongly drawn they can be redrawn.  The worst thing tourism could have is a set policy for all time.  It must be flexible and allow for changing circumstances, changing fashions, changing bank balances, and the changing sets of values of the customers, who are the tourists.  These zones will be published by Bord Fáilte in their new development plan which will be out some time early in the new year.  Most Deputies are members of local authorities.  They will have a chance to see the zones in their own areas, and if they feel changes are necessary they can take the matter up with their local authorities.  As I say, the zones have been drawn up mostly in conjunction with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>While on local authorities, I would refer to the financing of the local tourist boards.  A number of Deputies suggested that Bord Fáilte should supply more of the finance.  I do not agree with this.  These regional boards are established now about 10 or 11 years, and were a first move in decentralisation. Whoever pays the piper calls the tune, and if the local authorities and local interests allow Bord Fáilte to pick up more and more of the cost of the regional boards, then Bord Fáilte will want to have more and more say.  If more say is to be kept at local level, then local interests should supply more money. When the boards were set up Bord Fáilte were supplying 65 per cent of the money and the local authorities <Col N="1226" /> and local interests were supplying the balance.  Bord Fáilte are now supplying about 80 per cent of the funds involved. The Deputies here who are members of local authorities should make the speeches they made in this House on the value of tourism at their local authority estimate meetings and they should see that their local authorities contribute as much as possible.  There was a limitation prior to 1963 on the amount of money that a local authority could vote for tourism. There is no such limit now.  Some of the counties got this message very early and they are the ones who benefited most.  Others did not.  Some of them are contributing even less now than the statutory limit prior to 1963. If you want the benefits in your area, you must not alone promote tourism through your local authority but also get private people to contribute to tourism.  The less funds you get from Bord Fáilte the more say you will have locally.  A lot of tourism depends on local debate, local activity and local promotion.</P>
    <P>There was some criticism of the money being spent on promoting tourism in Australia, New Zealand and Japan, which were so far away, and it was suggested that this money should be switched to the Continent of Europe where we had a very good result, and that is true.  Deputies might bear in mind that in the last few years when so much of our tourism came from one source and when for certain reasons that source dried up, we had nothing to fall back on.  Bord Fáilte, while continuing to develop the existing markets to their fullest, must also probe around for new markets and see if they can get tourists from any other source.  There was no money spent in Japan this year. The amount spent in Australia and New Zealand this year was £30,000 from which we earned £1,5000,000 in tourist revenue.  That is a very good return.</P>
    <P>The Continent has been marvellous, the receipts from some countries being up over 30 per cent in 1975, and the expenditure on the continent on promotion this year has been £1.2 million. Furthermore, I think we are the only <Col N="1227" /> country in Europe that will show an increase in American tourists this year over last year.  Every other country will show a decrease.  I am keeping my fingers crossed, not having the final figures before me yet, but I am hoping we shall have a 4 per cent increase, which is a very good achievement for Bord Fáilte and one on which every side of the House should congratulate them.  In this very difficult year for world tourism they have managed to show this very significant return from the Continent of Europe, a very good return from America and a balanced or perhaps a slightly increased position from our nearest neighbour, England.  As planes get faster and bigger perhaps fares will come down or at least be a smaller proportion of people's income.  There is a vast tourist market in Japan, New Zealand and Australia.  If people are coming to Europe, it is right to try to bring a proportion of those people here to stay in this country.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the licensing laws, signposting and lay-bys.  As Deputies know the licensing laws are a matter for the Minister for Justice and I will transfer to him the remarks made here.  The matter of signposting is something which Deputies could best take up with the local authorities but I will pass on to the Minister for Local Government what has been said here.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor referred to fishing and, as far as I remember, he said this was neglected.  This is not true.  In 1974 Bord Fáilte spent £27,000 on access roads, car parks, signposting, jetties and slipways and a further £6,500 was spent on angling festivals, competitions and so forth.  Angling associations were helped to the tune of £3,000 and £5,000 was provided for boats on inland waters and other facilities. The development of fishing will continue to be a priority with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera spoke about the wisdom of providing this money in times of financial stringencies and economic difficulties.  I made the point that we are not actually voting this money; we are voting to raise the <Col N="1228" /> limit.  In my Estimate each year the amount to be spent by Bord Fáilte will have to be discussed here.  Investment in tourism is productive and provides employment in areas which are hardest hit in time of recession and places where there is least industrial employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor raised the question of Aer Lingus operations particularly on the North Atlantic route.  The whole attitude of Aer Lingus towards the North Atlantic, all the options open to them, whether to increase their charters, whether to come off it or whether to stay as they are, are matters which are under examination at the moment.  I would be the last person to say that they should come off the North Atlantic.  I know they are losing a considerable amount of money on it.  The ancillary activities which they are engaged in will hopefully produce profits which will help to cut away some of that loss.  They should be encouraged to go out and earn money from other sources to allow them to balance the loss on the North Atlantic.  It is essential that this country should have a presence on the North Atlantic, not alone from the tourism point of view but from the morale point of view and the prestige point of view.  These are things one cannot put a pounds, shillings and pence value on but they have a value. If we come off the North Atlantic there will be no competition for other carriers and that would not do.</P>
    <P>I would like to encourage Aer Lingus if they can, within their own resources, to provide money to invest in ancillary activities that will provide them with a profit that they can put against the loss on the North Atlantic so that we can stay on the North Atlantic until times improve and that that will again turn out to be a profitable sphere of their operations.  Of course, it is true that every airline in the world are losing money at the moment and the North Atlantic is a particularly heavy loss-maker for all of them.  We should grit our teeth and try to get other sources of revenue that will help cover some of this loss and wait for the good days to come again, as I am sure they will.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> I would like to thank everybody who took part in this debate and to repeat again what I think came through very clearly in the debate, that the two things we must watch in tourism are that the standards of everybody connected with it&mdash;from the first contacts somebody coming to this country has with somebody connected with Ireland, be it a girl in the booking office in Frankfurt or San Francisco, the staff on a boat or plane, people in the garages, hotels, guesthouses or the people on the street&mdash;should be the highest possible and that the environment into which we ask people to come is not ruined by our carelessness in the type of development we allow or in having standards which are not acceptable to our visitors.  If we do that I am confident that the money I am asking the House to provide today for Bord Fáilte will be repaid one hundredfold in the years to come.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,536,500 be granted to <Col N="1230" /> defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes and grants including a grant-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. O.J. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The gross amount required is £1,974,000 but this amount is offset in part by an increase of £147,500 in Appropriations-in-Aid and a further sum of £290,000 in savings, leaving the net amount required at £1,536,500.  The net additional amount required brings the net Estimate for my Department for the present year to a total sum of £50,989,510.  This sum represents part only of the total expenditure on Local Government.  When account is taken of the moneys provided from the Local Loans Fund, the Road Fund and the expenditure financed from local authority sources, the total expenditure is estimated to be about £365 million.  Of this sum, £218 million approximately is financed from Exchequer sources and forms part of the very large financial provisions made by the Government for essential services.</P>
      <P>These provisions have been made despite the extraordinary financial difficulties facing the Government in common with other Governments. Failure to provide adequately for important services which had been starved of money in the past made it necessary for the Government to step up considerably the level of provision for these services, but such expansion in capital expenditure cannot be continued indefinitely.  Those who think that capital can be handed out freely merely for the asking show little appreciation of the financial realities which obtain here and elsewhere at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount in the present Supplementary Estimate for my Department is spread over six separate <Col N="1231" /> subheads.  The largest of these amounts is an extra £1,000,000 for subhead E2&mdash;Private Housing Grants.  The original provision of £6.5 million for 1975 was based on the situation and prospects at the end of 1974.  Only £5.35 million of the £6 million voted for the nine-month period ended the 31st December, 1974 was actually spent.  However, the first five months of 1975 showed an expansion in operations under the grant scheme and in June the Government agreed to an increased provision.  The extra £1,000,000 being provided brings the total of the subhead for this year to £7.5 million.</P>
    <P>Next in importance is the supplementary sum of £650,000 for subhead N&mdash;Interest Subsidy for Building Societies.  I am glad to say that the net inflow of funds to the societies has shown a very satisfactory up-turn during the present year and, as a consequence, mortgages are now more freely available.  It is expected that the societies will advance about £60 million in 1975 as compared with £39.6 million last year.</P>
    <P>This subsidy, which was introduced by the Government in May, 1973, enabled the societies to offer a higher rate of interest on shares and deposits than would otherwise have been possible at a time when there was a serious fall in the inflow of funds to the societies.  The original sum of £1.4 million voted for this subhead was the amount estimated to fall due for payment in 1975 in respect of the continuance of the interest subsidy up to the 31st December, 1974 which was the termination date when the Estimate was framed.  The Government's decision to continue the subsidy during 1975 has led to the supplementary sum now required.  Because of the improvement in the inflow of funds to the societies, the continuance of the subsidy from the 1st August last has been at the reduced rate of ¾ per cent instead of the original 1 per cent and naturally the question of continuing the subsidy payment has had to be reviewed.  The matter will be discussed with the building societies very shortly. <Col N="1232" /> The Supplementary Estimate includes an additional amount of £205,000 required in respect of subhead A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and allowances&mdash;to bring the total for the year to £3,060,000.  The increase is due to the cost of the 15th-round pay increase and the cost of certain grade increases not provided for in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>There is also a sum of £30,000 included in the Supplementary Estimate to bring the total requirement for the year to £365,500 in respect of subhead B&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses.  The increase is required mainly to meet the cost of increases in subsistence rates since the original Estimate was prepared, and to provide for the cost of the Conference on Peripheral Regions held recently in Galway.</P>
    <P>The amount of the grant-in-aid provided under subhead I for An Foras Forbartha is being increased by £55,000 to a total of £572,000.  The additional sum is to meet the cost of salary increases arising since the original Estimate was prepared.</P>
    <P>The final item in the Supplementary Estimate is an extra £34,000 to bring the total of subhead H to £174,000. The subhead provides for the recoupment of 50 per cent of the cost to county councils and county borough corporations of preparing and publishing the register of electors.  The increase is due to increases in the remuneration of those engaged on the compilation of the Register and to increases in incidental costs since the original Estimate was prepared.</P>
    <P>While not arising specifically on the items covered by the Supplementary Estimate, I should like to take the opportunity to refer to two other matters. The first relates to an appeal by Aquarius Securities Ltd., under section 26 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 against the decision of the Dublin Corporation to refuse permission for the erection of an oil refinery in Dublin Bay.  The appeal is before me at present.</P>
    <P>Statements have appeared in the public Press to the effect that there are indications that the Government intend <Col N="1233" /> to allow the oil refinery to go ahead. These statements were made by persons who should know better.  It is a matter for me and not for the Government to decide the appeal.  In doing so, I must have regard to the matters laid down by law.  Not alone does section 26 restrict consideration to the improvement of the amenities thereof but, since I decided that there should be an oral hearing, I must consider the report of the hearing before I make up my mind as to what decision should be made.  It is highly improper that any suggestion should be made that I have made up my mind in advance.</P>
    <P>There have on the other hand been some suggestions that I have not dealt expeditiously with the case.  My wish has been to have this project fully and openly considered and it is for that reason that, on my own initiative, I fixed 14th July, 1975 as the date for the hearing.  Representations seeking a postponement were then made by a number of individuals and associations, by the planning authority and by the developers I agreed to this on the understanding that early October might suit Aquarius Securities Ltd., and the various objectors but since I heard nothing further from the developers, I wrote to their agents on the 13th October, 1975 stating that I proposed to fix a new date for the holding of the oral hearing but before doing so I wished to have confirmation that they intended to pursue the appeal. So far, I have received only an acknowledgement and a promise of a further communication.  I have since written to the agents asking that they indicate their principal's intentions without delay.  I hope that it will be appreciated from this account of what has transpired that such delay as has occurred is not attributed to me.  Responsibility for the delay rests with the appellants and the individuals and bodies who pressed for postponement of the oral hearing.</P>
    <P>The second relates to the fire service.  The report of the working party which reviewed this was published in July.  The working party made a broad examination of the organisation and operation of the service and <Col N="1234" /> made many recommendations, some of them of a fundamental nature.  In view of the importance of the service not only from the point of view of the personnel directly involved in it and of the local authorities who have responsibility for running it, but from the point of view of the general public, it is right that there should be full opportunity for consideration of the report by the various interests concerned.</P>
    <P>The report was published, therefore, without commitment so as to provide that opportunity for organisations and individuals to read it and, to make known any views they wish to put forward. Everything possible will be done to expedite and implement decisions on the report.  However, with the best will in the world it will take time to complete the process of change and improvement.</P>
    <P>In the meantime brigade strengths and equipment must be maintained at an adequate level having regard to the fire cover appropriate in each area.  If there are deficiencies my Department will carefully consider such proposals to make them good as are put forward after due consideration by the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the growing importance of the fire service is the added emphasis on fire prevention in the modern approach to the fire problem. There is tremendous scope here and now for greatly increasing the effectiveness of the fire prevention effort by personal communication at local level, backed up by the powers of inspection and control which local authorities have under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to appeal again to local authorities to step up their fire prevention inspections especially where the risk of fire is greatest and where fire could have the most serious consequences.  My Department have encouraged local authorities to review their fire prevention capacities and arranged a special course in fire prevention to make the necessary skills more widely available.</P>
    <P>The question of having further courses of this kind is one aspect of a general examination of the programme of central training for fire brigade personnel <Col N="1235" /> which has been undertaken.  The local authorities have been consulted for their views as to future needs and a special working group is now being set up to advance the work, with representation of the various interests concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the most significant matter in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech refers to the building societies, particularly the sentence in which he refers to the continuance of the subsidy from 1st August last which had been reduced by ¼ per cent from the original 1 per cent.  He went on to say that naturally the question of continuing the subsidy payment has had to be reviewed.  This is a very significant and I think very disturbing statement because it appears to suggest that the Government have in mind the removal of the subsidy at present available to the building societies.  It appears to give some substance to a report which appeared in an evening paper in relation to this matter.  It is necessary to stress the serious consequences which would arise from any such change in policy as the removal of this subsidy, the effect it would have on mortgage holders and the effect it would have, depending on the decision made by the building societies, on the inflow of moneys into these societies which is so essential for the well-being of the building industry which has been in an ailing condition for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather strange that at a time when we are being asked to vote extra money to pay the building society subsidy there should be at the same time an inference in the speech that this subsidy will be removed.  If such a step were taken it could have very serious consequences and I appeal very strongly to the Government to rethink this matter if this is what they <Col N="1236" /> have in mind in the review being conducted by them.  They should very seriously consider the effect such a move would have.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Supplementary Estimate and the building societies the additional sum required for the interest subsidy for the building societies should have been very much larger and would have been were it not that the Minister and the Government decided in the June budget to reduce that subsidy from 1 per cent to ¾ per cent.  I found it difficult then&mdash;as I do now&mdash; to understand the Government's reason for the reduction.  Those who borrowed money from building societies have had their interest rates increased and their repayments increased at various stages over the years because of the increasing cost of money.  Most of them, when they borrowed the money, budgeted with a certain interest level in mind and the fact that repayments rose quite considerably above the original level was the cause in many instances of severe hardship especially when this happened, as it usually did, at a time when family outgoings were increasing because there was a number of children to be catered for and educated.  I found it very difficult to understand why the Government decided in the June budget to reduce this subsidy and therefore by their own deliberate action put a further burden on the already hard-pressed shoulders of those who had borrowed money from building societies.</P>
    <P>As far as I can remember the reason given by the Government then was that borrowers from building societies should not have better terms than those borrowing through SDA loans.  The logic of that argument still escapes me, particularly when the Government in the same budget increased the SDA loan interest rate from 10½ per cent to 11½ per cent. Surely at a time of crisis in the industry the logical thing would have been to have left the interest rate on SDA loans as it was and relate the building society interest rate to that situation. It seemed to be a peculiar way of managing affairs that the Government <Col N="1237" /> should state that they were increasing the SDA loan interest level and then state that building society borrowers should not have better terms.  Why not have left the SDA rate at 10½ per cent and then relate the building society interest rate to that?</P>
    <P>When costs of all kinds are increasing very rapidly and when people repaying mortagages find it very difficult to make ends meet the Government might have had more consideration for such people and retained the subsidy as it was.  The borrowers concerned must now increase their repayments or repay the loans over longer periods.  This is not because of a decision on the part of the building societies but rather because of a deliberate decision of the Government to pass on part of their financial problems to the already overloaded mortgage holders just as in the same way they decided to charge a higher rate of interest to SDA borrowers.  They did this in both cases at a time when it is so vitally essential that the private house building industry should get every help.  The Government went out of their way at that time both in relation to the SDA loans and building society mortgages to make it less attractive to borrow money for house building purposes.</P>
    <P>It is not long since the income of the building societies fell drastically. This had serious consequences for the building industry and helped to create the serious problem that industry has had to face in recent years.  The Government of the time came to the aid of the societies in an effort to ensure that they could retain their competitiveness in the money market. The subsidy was necessary to help the building societies to retain that position.</P>
    <P>Because of changing interest rates related to many different financial agencies, there has been an increase in the flow of money into these societies. In the long term I believe the subsidy will not be helpful in ensuring a continuation of this inflow of money into these societies.  It is necessary for the building industry that this inflow of money at a worthwhile rate is continued <Col N="1238" /> so as to avoid the stop-go situation which obtains when there are wide variations from year to year in the amounts of money being invested in the societies.  In Britain some time ago when there was a lack of funds in the building societies the number of houses constructed dropped.</P>
    <P>A change came in the situation and the inflow increased considerably with the result that building societies were able to make more money available to borrowers.  However, because there were not sufficient houses built the price of the houses increased. When the builders saw that the money was available and that house prices had increased, they built as rapidly as possible but by the time the houses were built the inflow of money into the societies had fallen. The result was that builders were left with many houses on their hands. There was a depression in the building industry then.</P>
    <P>We have had a similar experience here in relation to a slump in the buying of private houses.  While to some extent this related to the fact that for a period the building societies were not getting sufficient money it also related to the inadequacy of the SDA loans and house grants.  We must try to avoid such a situation in future.  The Government should not have made the change in the subsidy in the June budget.  When the inflow of money to the societies was low in the past the Government did not admit responsibility for it and this Government cannot claim, in the present circumstances, credit for the fact that there has been a higher inflow of money into the societies.  It is the duty of the Government to ensure that the inflow of money continues.</P>
    <P>It was disturbing to find that the Parliamentary Secretary, in referring to the cut already made in the subsidy from 1 per cent to ¾ per cent, went on to say that the matter must be further considered.  The only conclusion I can come to is that in such circumstances the Government intend to abolish the subsidy altogether.  If that happens, there will be serious <Col N="1239" /> repercussions because the societies would have only two options open to them, to raise the mortgage rates or lower the interest rates to depositors. If the societies decided to raise the mortgage rates, it would have serious repercussions for the mortgage holders because the rates have increased considerably in recent times. Some people find that they are unable to pay.  When one relates increases of this kind to the fact that every other commodity people need for their homes, food and clothing and other items necessary for the upbringing of children, have increased enormously it would be the last straw if the Government were to remove this subsidy or reduce it further.  The people I am referring to would be placed in a position where they could only pay the mortgage by reducing the intake of food or cutting down on heating in their homes. This in turn would lead to considerably higher bills from the health side.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the building societies could decide to lower the interest rates to depositors but we know what would happen in such circumstances: the amount of money that would be available to the building societies would drop rapidly.  We have seen that a change of ½ per cent has caused money to flow from one area to another.  We have also had experience of the effect on the building industry of a shortage of money invested in the building societies.  At a time when the private housebuilding industry is in a crisis situation and where there are many unemployed workers the Government should think many times before making a change which would have such a disastrous effect on such an ailing industry.</P>
    <P>Originally, the Government recognised that it was essential to make this money available to the building societies so that the societies could maintain their mortgage rates at 11½ per cent and their deposit interest rates at 8 per cent.  It was vitally important that they should be given this subsidy but to remove it would force building societies into a situation where they would have to lower their interest <Col N="1240" /> rates to depositors and this would mean that there would be a rapid outflow of money from the societies.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to convey my feelings on this matter to the Government.</P>
    <P>The increase for salaries, wages, allowances, travelling and incidental expenses is indicative of the rising costs which are noticeable in all aspects of life.  The increase in private housing grants is not sufficient.  Does the figure for the private housing grants refer to the total for private housing and reconstruction grants?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows that the total amounts available this year for private housing grants was £6,500,000 and for the nine months of 1974 was £6 million. This shows that there was a considerable reduction in the 1975 figure compared with that for the nine months in 1974&mdash;£6 million would be equivalent to £8 million this year.  Yet the figure for this year was only £6,500,000.  I am not taking into consideration the very rapid increases in costs, nor do the figures I have given take account of the inflation rate. The official figures I got show that the ordinary inflationary rate a year ago was about 24 per cent to 25 per cent, and the rate of increase in the building industry was over 30 per cent.  It is in this context that we must view the extra £1 million being made available in this Suplementary Estimate, which is totally inadequate.  The figure for last year is greater then the total being provided for this year, including the £1 million in this Supplementary Estimate.  It is greater even without taking into consideration the rapid rate of inflation experienced over the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This extra money is not sufficient to give the necessary fillip to the building industry.  I stated before that there has been a crisis situation in the building industry over the past year.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that the number engaged in this industry dropped by about 8,000 compared with the number employed in the industry last <Col N="1241" /> year.  There are approximately 20,000 building workers unemployed, an increase of approximately 50 per cent on the number unemployed a year ago. We on this side of the House asked the Minister on many occasions to take positive action to overcome this problem, but without success.  I hope I may have more success in my appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the only real way in which the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary can reverse the unemployment trend in this industry is by making more money available to the private housing sector by increasing the level of loans and grants and the qualifying income limit.  Until such a step is taken the employment situation will continue to deteriorate, as it has done in the past year.</P>
    <P>The levels of the SDA grants and loans were fixed in May, 1973.  Since then there have been enormous increases in building costs and salaries and wages, which have resulted in many people who were entitled to housing grants and loans in May, 1973, not being entitled to them any longer. It should be remembered that increases in salaries and wages over the past two years were merely keeping in line with the increases in the cost of living. Therefore people in receipt of the increased salaries and wages were no better off than they had been at the earlier stage.  At best, they were keeping up with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>To be eligible for supplementary private house grants one had to have an income of less than £1,950 per annum and this was increased in certain circumstances, depending on the size of the family.  The maximum income limit, irrespective of the size of the family, was £2,350.  One need only try to compare the buying power of such an income today with that of 1973 to see the enormous difference involved.  If it were accepted that one needed such an income in 1973 to build or buy a new house, it should be obvious that the same income today falls well below the necessary level to enable a person to buy or build his own house.  The average wage of industrial workers&mdash;and I would like to impress this on the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;<Col N="1242" /> is approximately £400 higher than the maximum qualifying income limit for loans and grants.  This means that to a great extent the people for whom these grants and loans were made available originally cannot benefit from them.</P>
    <P>I asked the Taoiseach recently what was the increase in building and construction costs since 1973.  The answer I received was that it was over 70 per cent.  We should remember that the calculation on which this reply was based did not take cognisance of all the factors involved. Therefore the true percentage increase is much higher than 70 per cent. Surely it should be obvious that there is a real need to increase the level of housing grants and loans in order to do justice to those who wish to build or buy their own house and, perhaps equally important, to ensure that many of those at present unemployed in the building industry will return to work.  If the Parliamentary Secretary were to convince the Minister and the Government that an increase in the grant and loan levels under the qualifying income limit for private house building were essential he would be doing a very good day's work.</P>
    <P>It has been said in this House on many occasions by me and my colleagues, and it is generally accepted, that there is no industry which can bring about a worthwhile improvement in our unemployment problem as speedily as the building industry, if it is properly financed. The private sector of the house building industry can effect this improvement much quicker than any other section of the construction industry. If a loan is made available for a new house as well as a realistic grant, it takes a very short period to begin work on the house.  Other types of construction take more time because very often elaborate plans have to be prepared and there is much to-ing and fro-ing between the local authority and the Department.</P>
    <P>Though I am not objecting to the request for the provision of money for new houses, I want to point out that the £1 million is totally inadequate, that the money will not improve <Col N="1243" /> the position in the building industry one iota, that it will not help to improve the chronic unemployment situation in the industry.  It simply makes money available to fulfil existing commitments and I do not think it will be even sufficient to do that: there will be many people awaiting payment of grants into the New Year.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary for a change of heart in regard to the level of grants and loans and the qualifying period.  We are anxious to see a dent made in the numbers unemployed, and the advice we are giving to the Parliamentary Secretary would help not only those in need of houses but also to re-employ the many building workers who are now out of work. The Minister has said, and I suppose he will say it again, that he is concentrating on the building of local authority houses, but he is well aware that the total number of such houses built is only about one-third of the number built heretofore.  If the necessary fillip is not given to the private sector many of our people in need of houses will have to wait for years.</P>
    <P>We know the enormous number of people living in flats or in rooms with relatives.  These conditions, to say the least, will result in the break-down of marriages.  Many such people are anxious to build their own houses or to buy their own houses but they can only do so if realistic grants and loans are available.  It is of little use offering loans and grants which fall short by several thousands of pounds of the price which a new house costs&mdash;I am referring to the average price of SDA houses.  The position is that because of the low levels of loans and grants, unless a person proposing to build a house has another source from which he can get finance he simply is not able to proceed with the building of his house.</P>
    <P>The spin-off effects of the fall in private house building have had serious effects in ancillary industry. Cement sales in the first half of this year fell by 9 per cent and this is a <Col N="1244" /> pointer to the condition in which the industry finds itself.  The fact that there has been such a fall in cement sales is felt at the production and the retail levels and in employment.  I know there is money available for private house building from sources such as the building societies and the associated banks but the changing rates of interest and the interest levels have meant that these sources were not much availed of in the past.  SDA loans and grants were favoured because of the fixed interest rates.  This was unfortunately changed in the June budget when the interest rate was changed from 10½ per cent to 11 per cent, but at least the borrower is still in the advantageous position that he knows the rate will not change suddenly. Such grants and loans were the source of finance for home building for the man of small means.  Today levels of income and of interest rates make it impossible for people to avail of loans and, therefore, numbers of people who used to avail of them will be joining the queues for local authority houses.  This in turn will mean that applicants for local authority houses who would not normally consider building houses themselves will find themselves competing with many more people.</P>
    <P>My next point relates to the expenditure on the register of electors. This is a reflection on the increased cost of living in an inflationary position. It might be well to note that the increase over the original estimated expenditure is about 23 per cent.  This is a small business venture and if we apply it to production costs generally we can see how difficult it is for us to sell our goods in competition both at home and abroad where inflation rates are much lower.  The compilation and preparation of the register of electors is necessary work and I congratulate those involved in it for the manner in which they do the work.  A moment ago I said it is necessary because of the inflationary situation to make extra money available.  I would very much prefer to see the extra money spent on continuing to do a good job rather than making a saving which <Col N="1245" /> would reduce the standard with which we have been accustomed in this work.</P>
    <P>I support the appeal made by the Minister on a number of occasions to political parties and to other individuals to study carefully the draft register so as to ensure that every citizen is entitled to vote in elections, a right which he will not have if his name is not included on the register. The greatest care must be exercised at all levels to ensure that no name is omitted.  This process requires the help of all those concerned in the preparation of the register, from those who originally collected the names for insertion, through the publishers and printers who finalise the work.  It is very disappointing for a person to arrive at a polling station only to be told that he is not entitled to vote because of the absence of his name from the register but more than that he is being deprived of a fundamental right, a right that is essential if democracy is to continue to operate.  Therefore, I join with the Minister in appealing to those concerned to give all possible assistance in regard to the compilation and publication of an accurate register.</P>
    <P>There is the question, too, of the extra money required for An Foras Forbartha.  I take this opportunity of commending An Foras for the excellent work they are doing in the field of research.  No doubt this work is appreciated by the Minister and his Department.  An Foras have issued many reports on matters relating to the work of the Department and to such matters as housing, studies of the environment, planning, water pollution, water quality and so on.  In times of economic depression there is considerable merit in increasing involvement in research so as to make the best possible use of available resources and, thereby, help to increase employment.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat saddened, however, when I note that small industries have decided to cut back on expenses by leaving research aside for a period. This is a retrograde step and the money so saved is money which <Col N="1246" /> would have produced worthwhile results if the research concerned had been continued.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in most places at times of economic depression to cut back on research although increasing aid for work in this field could produce much more desirable results than a saving in expenditure.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether An Foras Forbartha have stopped to ask themselves if the work they are doing is helping, for example, the building industry, to respond quickly to the economic situation. No doubt it is very useful to plan the kind of house we are likely to build in three years time but for the moment perhaps it would be more advantageous if an examination were to be carried out into methods used in house building so as to ascertain how we could make better use of the means available. Perhaps, too, some of the resources of An Foras might be diverted to studying the problems which are now awaiting urgent solutions.  Some worthwhile reports have been published by An Foras, reports which highlighted areas in which, if action were taken, worthwhile improvements would result.  I am concerned to some extent regarding the lack of follow-up in relation to these reports.  Admittedly, it would not be possible to act at once on all reports but where possible there should be a follow-up and concrete action taken.</P>
    <P>I note from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that the increase for An Foras is in respect of wages and salaries.  It is regrettable that it has not been possible to make much more money available to them for the purpose of funding research.  I am convinced that it is at times such as those that the need is greatest for research into the most persistent of the problems facing the Department.</P>
    <P>I should like briefly to return to the statement in the brief which would lead one to believe that it is intended to discontinue the subsidy being paid to building societies.  When I read this in the context of a reduced rate of ¾ per cent instead of the original one per cent I cannot come to any other conclusion and then there is a further reference which indicates that the <Col N="1247" /> matter will be reviewed.  This step would mean very serious consequences for the mortgage holders who are overburdened with repayments particularly at times when there is such a considerable increase in the cost of all other aspects of living.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the consequences would be equally serious if the building societies were to decide to lower their interest rates to depositors because in that event the money which has been building up for some time past would flow out again.  There is nothing so sensitive as money.  Even a change of a ½ per cent means that money will flow from one area to another.  If this were to happen at a time when the situation in relation to building is very serious, when so many people in the industry are unemployed and when so many are becoming redundant in ancillary industries, the consequences would be grave.  That is why it would be a very serious step on the part of the Government to remove the ¾ per cent subsidy, a subsidy which I believe should still be 1 per cent.  At the time that this problem was before them, the Government realised that it was essential to make this subsidy available if the building societies were to be enabled to retain their mortgage rates at 11½ per cent and their interest rates at 8 per cent.  The Government know that if they did not make this subsidy available the situation in regard to the building societies would be very serious.</P>
    <P>It is less than a year since we had the situation where the societies had very much less money than they would have wished for.  This had a detrimental effect on the building industry.  We do not wish for a recurrence of that situation but if the Government were to remove the subsidy entirely we would have a recurrence of that.  It is only because interest rates dropped that building societies were able to hold their interest rates at a steady level.  Money flowed in but nobody knows better than the societies how rapidly that money would move out again if the subsidy were changed and they were forced to reduce their rates.  I appeal <Col N="1248" /> again to the Parliamentary Secretary to impress on the Minister and the Government the importance of being very careful in this matter.  Over the past year we have had a dual problem &mdash;one in relation to the shortage of money in the societies and another in relation to the qualifying income limit levels and the levels of loans and grants.  Both contributed to a very serious situation in the building industry. Money has once again flowed into the building industry because the rates are better now than they are elsewhere.  We should be careful not to disturb that situation.  We should be careful to ensure that not alone will that level be maintained but that the inflow will increase.  If we do this the building industry will successfully overcome the crisis and do what only the building industry can do, namely, provide homes for our people more quickly than any other agency and provide work for those who are unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Parliamentary Secretary well in his appointment. Like Deputy Faulkner, I hope there will be no cutback in the subsidy because, if there is, there will be a very definite danger of interest rates being increased.  High interest rates mean more people looking for local authority housing, more people who would normally build their own houses provided they could get money for that purpose at a reasonable rate of interest. One of the advantages of people building their own houses is that there is a greater diversity in architectural design.  This is something to be commended.  Industrial wage earners are nearly all over the income levels for a local authority loan which means that a young married couple are in the position that they simply cannot provide homes for themselves.  This is where the building society can help.  I appeal to the Minister not to hinder building societies in any way.  It would indeed be bad economics to interfere with the building societies. If they have to reduce the rate of interest the inflow of money will cease and the only alternative will be to increase the interest rate on mortgages.  One cannot <Col N="1249" /> emphasise too much the importance of making money available for people to build their own houses.  It is astonishing the kind of people who come along now to the local authority looking for help.  They cannot build themselves because the loans and grants are not sufficient and it is impossible for them to get a bridging loan.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to impress on the Minister the importance of increasing the grants. They are absolutely useless.  At present £410 is the maximum from the local authority, if you are entitled to the full grant.  If you are entitled to a county council grant, it is £920.  Two days ago I met a man who was charged £920 for ESB connection.  These building grants should be doubled.  By doing that, we would save money on housing.  If they were sufficiently high to tempt people to build their own houses they would be taken off the queue which all local authorities have at the moment.</P>
      <P>People talk about solving the housing problem but I believe that if that problem were completely solved something would be wrong with the country. When a country is expanding you need houses.  The real problem arises when you have too many houses and nobody to live in them.  Comments were made about what previous Governments did about housing.  They did their best. While people are looking for houses the country is not too badly off because it shows that people are working and are able to pay for them.  This is important. We would like to provide housing as quickly as possible.  We should provide an incentive for people who may be able to build their own houses by giving them a good grant and a decent loan.  This question of the income limit for a loan is absolutely ridiculous.  The income limit for getting a local authority loan is so low that very few people qualify for it.  With inflation and increased salaries they are all over the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building societies should not be tampered with in any way.  The fact that they got the subsidy increased the pool of money.  Do not take away this subsidy.  Do not give a feeling to the people who got loans that the mortgage <Col N="1250" /> rate will go up and up.  I would make a special request to the Parliamentary Secretary to tell his Minister not to do that.  I would also ask him to consider increasing the local authority loans and the income limit because even the maximum of the local authority loan at the moment is no use and the income limit is too low.  If the loans and the grants were increased many people would build their own homes to their own liking.  I might have my own design for my house and I should be entitled to build it as I like provided I keep away from roads.  In this way, the countryside would look nicer.  Some people who think they know everything build blocks of houses which are all the same.  I hate the sight of them.  When you see one you have seen them all.  Every man should be allowed to design his own house provided he does not exceed a certain figure.</P>
    <P>The only way to encourage private building is to ensure that the building societies have enough money to increase the loan and the grant.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to do that.  If that is not done we will be in trouble.  I advise people who come to me that, if at all possible, they should build their own houses.  The fact is that the only place they can get a large enough loan to start to build is from the building societies.  They must have a few thousand pounds saved. Very few young couples have £2,000 or £3,000, and they cannot start to build if they have not got that much saved.  Quite a number of people have gone to the building societies since they were made financially strong enough to give them loans.  I make a special appeal to the Minister on that score.</P>
    <P>I am very keen on the whole question of housing.  I am very concerned about the type of houses being built.  I firmly believe that the ordinary &ldquo;Joe Soap&rdquo; who builds his own house should also design it.  No one should tell him the type of slates or the colour of the slates he should use.  He should be allowed to do what he likes provided he keeps well in out of the way. Tourists would prefer the country to look like that rather than being in character as it is called by the experts. <Col N="1251" /> The Parliamentary Secretary said the additional sum provided for An Foras Forbartha was to meet salary increases. I agree with Deputy Faulkner on the question of research even when industry is not expanding.  The present depression will not last forever.  During a time like this industrialists should be doing research into the question of how they will expand when markets are available to them in future years. To tighten the belt on the question of research is not good business.  I know money is scarce but An Foras Forbartha are doing a good job.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also mentioned the oil refinery and pollution. The Minister who is in charge of planning has to decide the balance between having as little pollution as possible and industrial development. With industrialisation it is impossible not to have some pollution of the air. We must ensure that State companies are not the biggest offenders and that everything possible to ensure that the air is kept reasonably clean and that our waters are kept reasonably clean. The decision has to be made on balance.  Everything humanly possible should be done to prevent pollution.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power said Bord na Móna were doing everything they could.  We have heard many complaints about Bord na Móna on the question of settling lakes.  I just refer to that in passing because the oil refinery in Dublin Bay was mentioned.  A great deal of common sense is needed.  The air cannot be kept as pure after industrialisation as it was before.  The balance is very important.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to the checking of the voting register and the increases in salaries in that category.  There are many young people on the register now. They move about a good deal and it has become a difficult task to keep a proper register.  A fair effort is being made to do this.  I have no objection to this increase because a vote is a civil right.  Nobody sets much value on it until they realise they have not got it.  Some people stay at home when they have it, but if they discover they are not on the register they <Col N="1252" /> kick up a heck of a row.  It is up to the State to see that everybody who is entitled to a vote has one.</P>
    <P>I could say a lot on local government but I shall confine my remarks to housing.  Perhaps I am the odd man out when discussing houses.  I believe that if people want to build their own houses they should be able to do so, but it is a question of money.  A number of people came to me looking for local authority loans but were unsuccessful because their incomes were too high.  Since the building societies' capital was increased such people managed to get loans from them.  If there is any alteration in this subsidy I believe there will be no money available or that interest rates on mortgages will have to be raised.  If that happens people will lose confidence, because when they borrow at a certain rate they budget each year, knowing they will have to pay £X on their loan.  If that is increased, they lose confidence completely.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that that does not happen and impress upon the Minister, now that the building societies are fairly sound, to let this situation obtain.</P>
    <P>I put down a number of parliamentary questions about grants in the last 12 months and each time the Minister answered by saying he was still considering the matter.  However he did make one change for which I asked and with which I was delighted. As a farmer I always thought that the non-farmer was very handicapped in regard to grants.  At least a farmer had a site of his own but for the man who had to buy a site, without a valuation, he got only £300.  It has been changed now in accordance with income rather than valuation.  However the most important matter is that the grants be raised.  Loans have to be repaid, grants have not, and I believe the Exchequer would save on local authority housing by doing so.  Therefore, I would make a final plea, to the Minister, through the Parliamentary Secretary, to increase grants and local authority loans.  In the long run the local authorities, the Exchequer and the countryside generally will gain because the country will be a lot <Col N="1253" /> nicer, more attractive to tourists and houses will be more varied.</P>

      <P>I want to intervene in this debate very briefly.  I want to deal with the matter of fire service in so far as it relates to Dún Laoghaire.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in his introductory speech, referred to the report of a working party which reviewed this matter and which was published in July.  I am not quite certain because this matter was referred to by the Dublin city manager who arranged a meeting of the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire fire services. I understand also that a commission was set up by the Minister for Local Government in 1972 to report on the fire services for the whole country.  Perhaps I might refer to the report of that commision.  In recommendation 6.3.10 they recommended that Dún Laoghaire fire brigade merge with Dublin city fire brigade.  I understand that the Dún Laoghaire fire brigade chief, who was a member of that commission, made a minority report not accepting the view of the majority.  I need hardly say to the Parliamentary Secretary that we, in Dún Laoghaire, are very proud of our fire brigade.  If we recall the time when Belfast was in danger, the first fire brigade to go up from the South was the Dún Laoghaire one.  We are anxious to keep Dún Laoghaire fire brigade under Dún Laoghaire Corporation and separate from Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has been reported to Dún Laoghaire Corporation and we have had reports made to us by our own fire chief.  I must make it clear that the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire, as yet, have not finalised their decision in this matter.  I want to state quite clearly that I want to see Dún Laoghaire a separate fire brigade.  I want adequate cover for the people of Dún Laoghaire.  While there should be co-operation and while Dún Laoghaire fire brigade covers not alone the Dún Laoghaire borough area but a large portion of what might be described as the Rathdown area of south county Dublin, I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that we <Col N="1254" /> have a separate fire brigade in Dún Laoghaire. We feel that an outsider fire brigade based in Dublin would not be adequate because if and when a major fire occurred in Dún Laoghaire the fire brigade from Dublin would have to travel out on a major road with great traffic hazards.  The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that there was a very tragic fire recently in Dalkey although the fire brigade arrived on the scene within minutes. However if a major fire brigade were based in Dublin it could not have done so.  In Dún Laoghaire we have hotels and some industries and we are anxious to retain our own brigade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second Supplementary Estimate for Local Government we have had before the House.  Reading through it, I notice emphasis is placed on the trend in general spending.  It is both centralised and local.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the total spending in relation not merely to the Department of Local Government but all local authorities together it amounts to £365 million, and that is £1 million a day.  It is a good deal of money but, as was said here tonight and as is freely admitted, the trend is Government spending.  Whether or not the money is always wisely spent is the question, and I am not referring specifically to the Department of Local Government.  The Department of Local Government performs very useful functions in the sense that it is responsible for many matters which affect the lives of the people.  Not the least of these is the administration of local government for housing, roads, sanitation, and I was hoping to add earlier tonight when we were talking on the subject of tourism, another subhead.  I suggest some Department be made ultimately responsible for pollution.  However, I cannot elaborate on that here because one is confined to the six subheads mentioned in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, housing is not the least of them and in the last number of years housing has become a very hot subject.  It is debated on and off platforms, on the floor of this House, at <Col N="1255" /> local authority meetings and so on. We were castigated for not being interested in building houses.  Yet we find that the last year we were in office we left 24,000 houses behind us.  They were houses at a price to suit the pockets of the newly-weds and they were able to pay for them.  Today we find, unfortunately, that even the State support for housing is not all that strong despite the amount in question here.  When a newly-wed buys a house, contemplates the repayments on it and the investment involved, he finds it hard to earn enough money to service the money he borrowed for the house.  This is the crucial question for newly-weds.  I am not referring to quality, merely to price.  It behoves this House and especially the Minister for Local Government and all local authorities to re-affirm intentions in this regard. The price of money is driving housing out of the reach of the ordinary working person.  There is no doubt about this.  Despite the fact that we have recourse to the Local Loans Fund, the building societies, the insurance companies, and the £40 million set aside by the banks this year, those of us who are members of local authorities still find ourselves having to build houses for people with relatively high incomes compared with a few years ago, simply because those people are not able to avail themselves of the opportunity to borrow from the Local Loans Fund because the amount available would not be of any use to them.</P>
    <P>Another big problem connected with the financing of housing is that a person who borrows from the Local Loans Fund may have to have recourse to a bridging loan.  I have seen unfortunate young fellows nearly robbed clean by bridging loans while waiting for clearance for local authority loans.  The Minister, in conjunction with banks, building societies, insurance companies and other lending sources should examine this question.  Housing is of paramount importance and we should always aim at cheap housing and at providing finance for houses where they are most needed and at <Col N="1256" /> reduced interest rates.  This is not an easy task, because the more we spend on development the more demand there is on the money.  When there is demand for anything it becomes scarce and dear, and this is just what is happening at present.</P>
    <P>The argument which goes on about whether we should expand the private housing sector or build more public authority houses is irrelevant when it comes to the price of money.  A question I have asked for some time-and I have not seen concrete figures in this respect&mdash;is: what is the real cost of, say, a four-roomed public authority house?  I suspect that when everything is taken into account it is a pretty dear house.  As I said, I was searching through various publications and documents to see if someone would come up with a figure, and someone did ultimately mention a figure of £10,000. I have not seen that figure disputed, and regrettably, I never had time to refer to An Foras Forbartha to verify that figure.  If a public authority house costs £10,000, it is a very dear house, and we should take steps to find out what is the actual cost.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming local authorities because we are all caught up in this system of dear money and scrambling for scarce resources.  As Deputy Faulkner said, it is a tender market and if you put your finger on a nerve you are liable to bring about some type of seizure in the system where money will either disappear, go up in price and certainly get scarce.  Today the cost of money, labour, and land tends to push up the value of the house on the unfortunate person seeking one.  It would not be an easy task to bring down the price of housing in a hurry.  Whatever way we may differ about who will build the cheapest house, who will provide the cheapest land or which system of erecting the house is the cheapest, whether in the public sector or the private sector, we should try to find some system of keeping the price of housing on a more even keel here.</P>
    <P>We will not be able to meet the backlog in local authority housing if we do not do something about the price.  The cost is enormous today if one takes the cost of providing proper <Col N="1257" /> servicing for those houses, proper sanitary services, lighting and so on. This results in either higher rates to the local authorities where they have a gain to create a special interest subsidy to service the cash, or the unfortunate tenant finds himself hardly able to meet the rent involved.  If it were not for the differential renting system a great number of people in houses would not be able to afford them. Whether we agree with this system, or not whatever is dear in the system, housing is relatively cheap.</P>
    <P>We have available to us the best guidance and advice and it should not be beyond our imagination or the bounds of possibility to make some impact on the cost of housing.  An Foras Forbartha or the Minister should in any year provide a special prize for the firm or local authority who can come up with the most functional house at the keenest price.  Such a house should include all the latest requirements of insulation and so on. This would renew interest in this very important sector of our economy. House building provides a living for a great number of people.  Our hopes in the last couple of years were not maintained in this regard.  We were not able to provide employment for such a large number in the private sector.  The result is that a number of men who were gainfully employed up to this are now on the unemployment lists.  The sooner they can be got back into full employment the better.</P>
    <P>The amount of money allocated to an applicant through the local loans fund is not enough having regard to cost generally.  We should take steps at local authority level, in conjunction with the Department of Local Government in an administrative way, to try to kill off for all time, the bridging loan system.  Until legal conditions are fulfilled the law demands that before money can be issued from the local loans fund certain documents in connection with a house must be provided.  That relates to ownership of the site.  No money will issue to an applicant until those conditions are fulfilled.  We should be able to find a way around that.  Surely an applicant who selects <Col N="1258" /> a site for a house and proceeds to lay a foundation intends to complete the house.  Therefore, there should be some statutory conditions which could be met by applicants who otherwise have to have recourse to the bridging loans. It is despicable what banks charge and also the way they hound the unfortunate applicants to pay back the money lent.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the building societies.  Once the subsidisation to the building societies of 1 per cent, now ¾ per cent, took place they began to loan money again and people were prepared to invest money with them.  It will be an interesting question if this subsidy is withdrawn. I am not saying it will, but it is certainly being scaled down.  If it is withdrawn it will be interesting to see what results it will produce having regard to the conditions which exist now.  In the light of those conditions and in view of the demand for housing I would be against withdrawal of the subsidy.</P>
    <P>Money devoted to house building multiplies itself and the multiplier factor here works faster in regard to housing than in many other sectors of the economy.  If we allocate money to housing we do not create a balance of payments problem because the labour content in that industry is high and the demand for imports is not great if we use our native resources of timber, cement and other building materials.</P>
    <P>In addition to recommending that bridging finance be eased, I hope the Minister will be in a position to advocate higher loans from the Local Loans Fund and also an increase in housing grants.  This is good business because the improvement of the national housing stock is a long-term investment. During the years we have been able to keep the housing stock in a reasonable state of repair, but at the same time there are enormous numbers of applicants for new houses in each local authority area.  There is a place for the private sector as well as the public sector.  There is plenty of scope for building societies provided they are competitive.  There is opportunity for investment by insurance companies and by the banks who have provided finance in the last year.  This is welcome <Col N="1259" /> trend.  It may be that housing is not as lucrative as office building, but if the Government have any voice in this matter they should concentrate more on housing.  Having regard to the development that has taken place in this city in the last few years, office building must be up to requirement now.  If we have the money we must concentrate on providing homes for needy people.  At the same time we will be giving employment for 70,000 or 80,000 skilled people in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government should urge the Minister for Finance to remove income tax liability from building societies.  It would be a relief and it would lessen the cost of housing. He should insist on the building societies using all their funds for house building alone.  The business of these societies should be to deal wholly with the building of houses in the private sector and they should allocate all their funds to housing loans.  If the Minister for Local Government is able to prevail on his colleague to get the building societies to agree to this he will be doing a good day's work.  We should be considering the design of a new system for loans and built into that design should be cheaper finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the oil <Col N="1260" /> refinery for Dublin Bay.  It was somewhat disappointing to see that the agency involved do not seem to be pushing ahead.  It appears the Minister has had to use the whip in order to get a reply from those people.  If they were sufficiently concerned to make application in the first instance and if they were so annoyed that their application was refused by the Dublin authority, why are they not replying to the Minister, putting forward arguments in support of their case?  The Minister has invited them to do so but the agency are not giving any sign that they are in any hurry to bring the case to a conclusion.  The Minister is entitled to ask those involved to speed up their consultations in order to finalise the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the report on the fire services.  Members of local authorities have received copies of the report of the working party who considered this matter.  Those of us who are involved in local authority work know that fire brigades in each area are called upon to deal with a variety of outbreaks.</P>

      <Col N="1162" /> So far as the civil service is concerned, certain pay scales at present are differentiated either on a sex basis or on a marriage basis.  Sex-differentiated scales provide a certain scale for men in a particular grade and another, lower, scale for women in the same grade.  Marriage-differentiated scales apply one scale for married men and another, lower, scale for unmarried men and women.  Equal pay is being introduced on a phased basis and equal pay increases have already been applied on the lower rates with effect from 1st June, 1973, 1st January, 1974 and 1st December, 1974.

Where percentage increases only were given there was no differentiation between scales as regards the percentage increases applied but the increases for women, (and single men on marriage-differentiated scales) were, of course, applied on lower scales.</P>
    <P>Tables 2, 3 and 4 give the position as applied to teachers prior to the introduction of the common basic salary scale with effect from 1st July, 1968 and Table 5 sets out the position since then as applied to the common scale.</P>
    <P>In the local authority service the national rounds applied on the same basis as in the civil service, with a few exceptions.  The exceptions are outlined in Table 6.</P>
    <P>The Garda were an all-male force up to July, 1959.  Ban Ghardaí were appointed as from that time and their pay was fixed at a lower rate than men.  National round increases have applied in the same manner as in the civil service, see Table 1.</P>
    <P>The Army, apart from the Army Nursing Service, all female, is an all-male force.</P>
