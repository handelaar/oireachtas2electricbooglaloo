    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will provide as a matter of urgency on behalf of a firm (name supplied) a telephone in the house of their management officer (name supplied) in Portlaoise, County Laois.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped to provide service at the residence of the person named about the third quarter of next year after extra equipment has been installed at Portlaoise exchange. The firm concerned already has service and there are a large number of prior applications many of which have stronger claims than the application in question to priority attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if, in view of the fact that the equipment has been installed over two years ago, he will indicate when the telephone exchange in Killorglin, County Kerry will be automated; and the reason for the delay in the change over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Automatic exchange equipment has not been installed at Killorglin.  The best estimate I can give for the conversion of Killorglin exchange is four to five years.  This is based <i>inter alia</i> on an estimate by the Commissioners of Public Works for completion of a new exchange building at Tralee on which conversion of Killorglin is dependent. Earlier proposals for extension of the <Col N="1574" /> Tralee exchange building on the existing site proved impracticable owing to site limitations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of waiting applications in the Dún Laoghaire exchange area, which comprises most of the Dún Laoghaire Borough area, is about 240.  Of these 135 are having attention.  The remainder are expected to be attended to progressively during 1976.  Local underground cable shortages must be remedied to enable them to be cleared.</P>
      <P>Waiting applications in areas adjacent to the Dún Laoghaire exchange area but served by other exchanges will be attended to according as exchange and/or underground cable relief schemes are carried out in 1976 or early 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if, in view of the increased numbers of people now living in the Greenhills/Limekiln Farm areas, Walkinstown, Dublin, he will consider having a new sub-post office at the shopping centre in the area.</P>

      <P>Development in the area since I replied to previous related questions by the Deputy on 24th April and 10th July last has been reviewed.  However, the position remains as stated in those replies.  That is, that the provision of an additional post office would not be warranted. There are two post offices, at Walkinstown and Perrystown, which are both only about three-quarters of a mile away from Limekiln Farm shopping centre.  The matter will be kept under development in the general area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the manner in which his Department ensure that television cable companies are operating strictly in accordance with the licences issued by him and, in particular, if he will ensure that the standard of service required under the licence is provided in the Fairview and Marino areas of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question relates to compliance by cable television licensees with the conditions relating to technical standards determined under the Wireless Telegraphy (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1974.  Licensees of cable systems which were in operation before licensing was introduced on 1st April, 1974, were given a period of 12 months to bring their systems into conformity with the technical conditions.  My Department have no reason to believe that cable companies are not complying now with the technical conditions attached to their licences.</P>
      <P>My Department have powers under the regulations to require licensees to make available on request any information relating to their systems or any test equipment or apparatus necessary to facilitate testing of their systems by an authorised officer of my Department.  The manner in which these powers are exercised in regard to any particular system would depend on the circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reception from piped television <Col N="1577" /> system depends primarily on the strength and consistency of the signals available at the masthead and, secondly, on the efficient relay of these signals to subscribers.  The technical conditions relate only to this latter function.  The quality of the BBC and ITA signals available off-air at the masthead is, of course, completely outside my Department's control.  The vast majority of complaints about cable television received by my Department relate to reception problems which are found on investigation by the cable company concerned to be caused either by poor off-air signals, faults in the subscribers' own apparatus, or minor faults or breakdowns in the system.</P>
    <P>A number of complaints have been received in recent weeks about service on the cable television system in the Fairview/Marino area for which RTE hold the cable television licence.  RTE have advised that the recent faults in the system serving this area were due primarily to deliberate damage to the system carried out at some point on the system on most evenings from 1st to 20th October last.  These faults have been repaired and it is understood that there has been a considerable improvement in service in recent weeks.  There were also complaints of poor reception during the summer months.  I understand that at times of such fine weather reception was adversely affected by the quality of signals available off-air.</P>
    <P>My Department recently carried out an inspection of the system serving the Marino/Fairview area and this has confirmed that the system is technically efficient.</P>

Provision of the extra facilities sought will require the use of two telephone trunk circuits which are not available at present and are not likely to be provided until early in 1977.  The feasibility of making temporary arrangements to meet the firm's requirements earlier is being examined and I shall communicate the result to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that this small Irish firm, which started about five years ago, have now built up to over 70 employees, would the Minister not agree that special consideration should be given to them &mdash;the telex communication facility and automatic telephone communication would possibly mean an increase to about 100 employees&mdash;particularly in light of the large unemployment figures?  Is the Minister aware that automatic telephone communication is available within two miles of where this firm is based, on the Crusheen side of where they are operating?</P>

      <P>My Department are concerned about the employment aspects, to which the Deputy has referred, and it is for this reason that the Department are at present examining the feasibility of providing temporary circuits in the area.  The Deputy is aware, I believe, of the technical difficulties involved.  If this can be arranged it may be possible to meet the firm's requirements by about mid-1976.  I shall keep in contact with the Deputy about the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the two lines now operating operate through a small telephone exchange at Tubber and it is very unsatisfactory from the firm's point of view?  Would the Minister at least provide automatic service, regardless of telex service, to this firm in an effort to let them expand further even before the middle of 1976?  It is imperative that they should have it.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is aware of the problem.  They are connected to Tubber exchange, which is a small manual exchange, as the Deputy said.  They want to be connected by out of area telephone line to Ennis exchange.  This would require the erection of 1, 5/8th miles of new pole route between the premises concerned and a point about a mile from Crusheen exchange.  It is proposed now to erect an aerial cable between Tubber and Gort exchanges to replace the existing open wire circuits.  Circuits in this cable will be extended to Galway allowing provision of an out of area telephone line and also telex services.  However, this aerial cable is unlikely to be in service until early 1977 and it is for this reason that the feasibility of providing temporary service is now being examined.</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the contract in question that all the work involved will be carried out in the State.  The contract was placed in accordance with the standard procedure which has governed the award of State contracts for many years and which does not permit of any preference being given as between Irish firms.  Employment content was not, therefore, a factor in the award of the contract and I am not in a position to say what will be the effect on employment of the transfer of the work in question from one Irish firm to another.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's speech in the form of a question is grossly unfair and demagogic.  I have set out the position and the Deputy, as a former Minister for Finance, should well understand it.  The Government are not in a position to discriminate as between Irish firms which submit tenders for contracts.  It <Col N="1584" /> chooses the lowest of the available tenders and that would have been so under the Minister and well he knows it.  One of these firms will presumably be employing more people, the other presumably fewer, but the efficiency of the companies concerned is a matter which, of course, affects the process of tender and contracts and it ill-befits a former Minister for Finance to make the kind of point he has just made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of an urgent need for a post office at Parteen.  The sub-offices at Bridge Street and Thomondgate, Limerick, and at Ardnacrusha are each about two miles away and the very small amount of post office business arising in the Parteen area would not warrant provision of a sub-post office there.</P>
      <P>Kiosks are not being provided in rural areas such as Parteen where post offices are not warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this should not be described as a rural area?  It is a rapidly growing village.  In fact it is bigger than a village at present, with Clare County Council and private house developers operating in the area.  Surely the people there are entitled to a public telephone, even at night, when they have no access to one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise if I have given any offence by the description &ldquo;rural area&rdquo;.  The information I have from my Department states that Parteen is a village with a population of 500, which seems to me to qualify for the description I used.  I agree that approximately 100 of the houses have been built during the last three years. Of course, as development takes place, the matter will be further considered. However, when Deputies press for new post offices in very small areas they should realise that, in relation to population, the number of post offices in this Administration is rather extraordinarily high.  On average there is a post office for approximately every 1,300 of the population.  Figures for some other countries are: Britain, 2,300; West Germany, 2,400; France, 3,000; Denmark, 3,600; Italy, 4,000 and the USA, 6,400.  Therefore, we are well at the top of the league in the matter of post <Col N="1596" /> offices.  In these conditions, and in the light of the general economic situation, any Government would have to think twice about opening considerable numbers of new post offices.  Admittedly, population shifts do from time to time require this, but I am not satisfied that this is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Inisturbot islanders land at and take off from shore near Kingstown and the withdrawal of a public telephone service is causing the islanders serious inconvenience as they now have no way of making contact from the mainland, which is very often necessary in bad weather, and, since the telephone has been withdrawn in Kingstown, it is now necessary for them to walk back into Clifden, which is quite a number of miles away and quite a long walk, and, in those circumstances would the Minister not consider changing his mind?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very difficult for me to change my mind remembering that the call office telephone hitherto provided was very little used.  When I say that I am by no means exaggerating.  The revenue for the year ending 31st March, 1973, was only £18 for the entire year and I do not think my Department could provide a call office telephone on the basis of that kind of return.  Indeed, I do not think it ever was the practice to provide telephones in such circumstances.  I know that residents in thinly populated areas suffer inconvenience but I am afraid that inconvenience is inevitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's materialistic criteria.  Would the Minister review his decision in this and take into consideration the humanitarian aspect?

      <P>No, it is not. In proof that it is not, 205 kiosks were provided in 1973-1974 as against 154 provided in 1971-1972.  That is definite proof that the Administration is not negligent in its duties in this regard and does not require lessons in humanitarianism or in anything else from Deputy Molloy.</P>

      <P>Prospective savings to be secured in the manner suggested would have to be weighed against offsetting costs on the one hand and the difficulties and inconvenience for telephone users and exchange operators on the other.  The number of new and changed entries in the 1975 directory amounted to 84,000 and represented over 30 per cent of total entries.  It would not be satisfactory to print a separate supplement as the Department's experience is that most people would use the number appearing in the main directory in the first instance and a large proportion who failed to get the number would ring the exchange.  An abnormal increase in telephone directory inquiries would require extra staff and equipment in some exchanges and would add to overloading where it exists.  In the conditions obtaining it is considered that adoption of the Deputy's suggestion would not result in any real economy and, indeed, the contrary is the case.</P>

Plans for the future development of the airport provide for the construction of a new east-west runway to the north of the terminal area.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

Bord Fáilte have told me that they gave careful consideration <Col N="1605" /> to the matter but concluded that the costs and administrative difficulties involved in the implementation of such a system would not be sufficiently beneficial to warrant its introduction. Pressure on restaurant operators to improve standards can effectively be exerted by their customers, and Bord Fáilte's approach is one of stimulating customer awareness.</P>

      <P>I would like to see that happening but I must accept Bord Fáilte's advice when they say that it would cost a great deal in regard to what are called the gourmet areas, what might be parallel with the grade A type restaurants.  They are all of a very high standard and would not need listing except with regard to their prices or the type of cuisine they offer.  It is those below that level that I would be anxious to see registered and there would be considerable difficulties in that regard.  Bord Fáilte feel that if they were to list and grade them it would cause a tremendous amount of trouble and resentment among some restaurateurs.  They would prefer the approach of seeing that they are up to standard with regard to hygiene and the quality of food served.  They hope that customer pressure will keep the standard of the restaurant high.</P>

Up to the time of the oil crisis in 1973 many of the bogs which Bord na Móna are looking at again were considered uneconomic and some of these bogs are now suitable for development because of the higher price available for turf.

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the action he proposes to take to offset the ill effects on the tourist industry of the greatly increased cost of sea and air fares to this country.</P>

      <P>I understand from Bord Fáilte that, in conjunction with the carriers and tour wholesalers, they are increasing their efforts in the provision of inclusive holidays and special &ldquo;transport only&rdquo; offers from all markets, together with the promotion of charters from the United States and Canada.  The access transportation costs built into these inclusive holidays is at a rate significantly below the standard fare.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years the board have been successful in developing with the carriers a range of promotional fares on both air and sea services from Britain.  These &ldquo;transport only&rdquo; offers will again be available in 1976.  In addition, reasonably priced express coach-boat services introduced in 1975 have proved highly successful and an external route system is proposed for 1976.</P>
      <P>From the United States both inclusive tour and travel group charters have been extensively promoted.  The volume of traffic on such charter programmes continues to increase and the capacity available for 1976 has been significantly increased to meet the expected rise in demand.  The introduction of one-stop tour charters &mdash;with less restrictive conditions&mdash;and special event charters will further improve the range of low-cost transportation facilities on offer in the market.</P>
      <P>From Canada, advance booking charters have proved successful and additional capacity is planned for 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Access from Continental European <Col N="1608" /> markets is facilitated by the range of inclusive holidays available by both air&mdash;based on scheduled and charter services&mdash;and sea.  Bord Fáilte are anxious to develop, in conjunction with wholesalers, charter series where commercially viable.  The range of promotional fares on scheduled air services, where available, is vigorously promoted.  On both the direct car ferry service and &ldquo;landbridge&rdquo; routes via Britain, particular promotional emphasis is placed on the special &ldquo;transport only&rdquo; offers.</P>

      <P>Although it was suggested there might be time made available, I think it was also suggested by the Government Whip that such time would be taken out of that allotted for the Adjournment Debate. Under No. 12 there are 16 Supplementary Estimates in all, and only a fraction of them have been circulated.  I and members of my party do not know what will be contained in these Supplementary Estimates and we therefore feel we will have to reserve the right to debate some or all of them.  It would be unfair that time would be taken out of the short period being made available for the Adjournment Debate and I put the suggestion to the Taoiseach that he extend the time before the adjournment of the Dáil to allow for this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>For the purposes of this Act, an interest in a policy of assurance upon human life shall be deemed to become an interest in possession when and only when, either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the policy matures; or</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>

        <i>Cavan):</i> The purpose of the section in general is to prevent an insurance policy being taxed before anything becomes payable under it. Generally speaking, an insurance policy will not be taxed until it matures or until the death of the insured person.  The proviso is there to ensure that if, during the currency of the policy, some capital payment is made under it-supposing it is surrendered or that the insured person accepts a lump sum in payment of all moneys due under the policy&mdash; that would be treated as a gift and taxed, if it were liable to tax.  If instead of surrendering the policy the insured person accepted a partial payment under it&mdash;say he surrendered a half, one-third or a quarter of its value&mdash;then the amount payable would be taxed as a gift as of the date on which the payment is made.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 35 indicates the person liable for payment of tax and distinguishes primary from secondary liability.  The primary liability rests on the done or successor or the transferee, in any case where the provisions of section 23 apply.  Those with secondary liability, who will be called on to account only if those with primary liability default in payment, include the disponer, the trustees of the disposition under which the gift or inheritance is taken and every trustee, guardian, committee, personal representative, agent or manager who has the care of the property or its income and transferees other than purchasers.  In the case of those with secondary liability, except in the case of the disponer, they will be liable only to the extent of the property which they have received and which is comprised in the gift or inheritance.  Once tax is paid they will be entitled to reimbursement from the person primarily accountable.  The section provides also for the payment of tax out of the property affected by the tax.  It also gives the right to the Revenue Commissioners to inspect records in the custody of any public officer.</P>
      <P>Section 35 indicates the person liable for payment of tax and distinguishes primary from secondary liability.  The primary liability rests on the donee or successor.  In the case dealt with by section 23, where the benefit is transferred to a transferee by the beneficiary before it becomes an interest in possession, the primary liability rests on the transferee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subsection (8) the person primarily accountable for payment of the tax may raise the amount of the tax and interest and expenses by sale or mortgage of the property.  Those with secondary liability are (1) in the case of a gift, the disponer and (2) in the case of the gift or an inheritance (a)  every trustee, guardian, committee, personal representative, agent or other person in whose care any property comprised in the gift or inheritance or the income therefrom is placed at the date of the gift or at any time thereafter; and (b) every person in whom the property is vested after the date of the gift or inheritance except <Col N="1642" /><i>bona fide</i> purchasers and mortgagees.</P>
    <P>In the section 23 case, the donee or successor is out of it since the time he gave his interest to the transferee, and may be dead or may have gone away, so that the transferee is the logical person to pay the tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point which is not so much a question of possible evasion as of a certain vagueness which I should like to draw to the Minister's attention.  Owing to the time that is available in this Bill, I do not intend to do more than mention it.  Many people have misgivings about the capturing of a confidential agent like a solicitor, in particular, by clauses of this nature.  I do not want to repeat all the things I have said on this, but even in the case of a solicitor the point I am about to make should have attention.  Under subsection (4) of this section the person who acts solely in the capacity of the agent as I understand it receives immunity under the section until an event happens, and the event in question is provided for in the following subsection.  The subsection (4) to which I am referring says:</P>
      <P>(4)  A person who acts solely in the capacity of an agent shall not be liable for tax chargeable on a gift or inheritance to an amount in excess of the market value of so much of the property of which the gift or inheritance consists and of the income from such property which he held, or which came into his possession, at any time after the serving on him of the notice referred to in subsection (5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asking to be considered as making all the points that were made before in <Col N="1644" /> reference to solicitors in this context, I refer to subsection (5), which specifies that the tax is recoverable from that agent <i>inter alios</i> after the requisite notice has been served.  That puts the agent in the same position as if, from that out, subsection (4) was not there; in other words, subsection (4) ceases to operate to protect him.  I could develop this argument in support of the argument for exempting particularly solicitors from such provisions, but having said that on other Acts, as I say, I want that point to stand by itself.  The point I want to make now, therefore, is a new one arising under subsection (8) which says that (a) a person who is primarily accountable for the payment of tax and (b) a person who is authorised or required to pay tax&mdash;again I am referring to the agent:</P>
    <P>in respect of any property shall, for the purpose of paying the tax, or raising the amount of the tax when already paid, have power, whether the property is or is not vested in him, to raise the amount of such tax and any interest and expenses properly paid or incurred by him in respect thereof, by the sale or mortgage of, or a terminable charge on, that property or any part thereof.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that that requires something like the qualification that Deputy Colley mentioned in regard to consideration.  There is a defect or a danger there in that the sale of the mortgage could be effected, to the loss of the person beneficially entitled, by an agent merely to raise the cash to pay duty.  It might be argued from the Revenue Commissioners' point of view that, if the tax has not been paid properly in the first instance and so on, this is equitable.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is a danger&mdash;I would go so far as to say a temptation&mdash;that, if substantial property were to be in the hands of an agent, in certain circumstances that agent could either sell or mortgage the property under the colour of realising the funds necessary for the discharge of duties.  As I have said, in that case the powers are too wide and, although they are not dangerous to the Revenue, they are a dangerous provision <Col N="1645" /> in the legislation from the point of view of the regulation of agents generally.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister consider whether any limitation could be put on that power of sale to ensure that assets are neither misappropriated, nor squandered, nor the subject of any question about negotiations or deals, that they are disposed of for full value and that the full difference will accrue in the proper location.  It is difficult to see how to amend the section as it stands in that regard.  It seems to me that this is a desirable amendment, from the point of view of the public and not from the Revenue point of view.  I hope I have made the point clear to the Minister. If there is anything in an Act which would facilitate undesirable traffic, or even misappropriation of somebody else's property we should at least attempt to include some provision to safeguard the beneficiary, or whoever is really entitled.  In the case of an agent, it might easily be a question not only of a minor or an incapacitated person but, worse still, it could be the widow who might not be emotionally equipped at the time to deal with the problems which might arise.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy de Valera raised two points. First, he is worried lest the relief or the protection given in subsection (4) is in some way taken away by subsection (5). I do not think the Deputy need have any such worry because subsection (5) deals with the serving of a notice.  After the notice is served, the person referred to in subsection (4) is liable only to the extent of what he had at that date.  He has had notice that a claim is being made. If he parts with a possession, or gives it away, or divests himself of it, he does so in the full knowledge that a claim is being made and the amount of the claim involved.  I cannot see how subsection (5) in any way takes away from the protection given in subsection (4). Subsection (5) is part of the machinery used in subsection (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  I wonder would the Minister allow me to <Col N="1646" /> answer that point first.  I would respectfully submit that there is this difference.  Subsection (4) makes him liable only for such property as comes into his hands.  Subsection (5), in effect, enables the Commissioners to make a complete assessment, and serve a notice, and the tax is recoverable from any accountable persons, one of whom the agent is.  That assessment could go beyond the property which came into the agent's hands.  I may be in error.  I may have read subsection (6) as part of subsection (5).  I will qualify the case I was about to make on subsection (6).  I intended to make the case that subsection (6) was substantially part of subsection (5).  If the Minister makes the point that subsection (6) stands completely on its own I am answered in part.  Nevertheless, there is a point there.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> What I am saying is that subsection (4)  stands clearly on its own.  It says:</P>
      <P>A person who acts solely in the capacity of an agent shall not be liable for tax chargeable on a gift or inheritance to an amount in excess of the market value of so much of the property of which the gift or inheritance consists and of the income from such property which he held, or which came into his possession, at any time after the serving on him of the notice referred to in subsection (5).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In regard to subsection (8), there is a proviso similar to this in the estate duty code under section 9 (5) of the Finance Act, 1894.  This provision does not seem to have been abused.  A liability to pay tax could not be placed on a trustee without giving him the right to recover the tax out of the property.  If a donee or a successor defaults in paying the tax, he has no <Col N="1647" /> legitimate grievance if his trustee pays the tax out of the property.  If a donee or a successor has been <i>bona fide</i> unable to produce funds to pay the tax, he should inform the Revenue of the circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When this type of situation arose under the old death duty code, the Revenue were usually able to make a suitable arrangement with the taxpayer. They have power under section 44 (1) to make the arrangements for capital acquisitions tax.  As the Deputy will have seen from what I have said, this provision has been in existence since 1894 and it has not been abused.  If I followed Deputy de Valera's argument correctly, he was afraid the agent or trustee might abuse this subsection. While I would not like to give gratuitous advice on the subject I imagine if he abused it he would be guilty of a breach of trust and he would be liable to an action by the beneficiary.  That would be an added reason why he would behave in a responsible manner.</P>

      <P>I want to refer briefly to subsections (4) and (5) but on a different point to that made by Deputy de Valera.  I would settle for both of those sections.  I sought to have this done in the Wealth Tax Act by amendment, which was rejected, because I felt that an agent should not under any circumstances be made liable to account for tax when he is not even aware that there is tax due. This provides that he is not liable unless he is notified, which I consider is reasonable.  My only complaint is why it was not done in the Wealth Tax Act when we asked that it be done.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to raise is in relation to subsection (9).  There is a reference to &ldquo;every public officer&rdquo;. Could the Minister indicate the kind of person in mind and if there is a definition anywhere of what &ldquo;public officer&rdquo; means?  Is there any precedent for the kind of provision there is in section 9?</P>

This provision continues the provision of section 16 of the Stamps Act, 1891, for capital acquisitions tax purposes and it is in practically the same terms as that section.  Section 16 of the 1891 Act is incorporated bodily in the capital transfer tax code by the British Finance Act, 1975, Schedule IV, paragraph 42 (2).</P>

      <P>Even when we spoke about these Bills on the Second Stage, there was a considerable jam in the Estate Duty Office but my information now is that there has been a considerable clearance, that matters have greatly improved and the pressures have eased where that office is concerned.  It seems that the procedures will remain the same.  It is convenient to deal with an inheritance here in the case of a death because the problems that arise on a death are the most general ones embracing both gifts and inheritances.  In such a case, whether the devolution is testate or intestate, as I understand it, the first move by the personal representative, agent or other <Col N="1650" /> person acting is to furnish the inland Revenue affidavit.  These two sections, in effect, provide the statutory base for what must be disclosed and set out in the Inland Revenue affidavit.  At the moment there takes place, as quickly as the Revenue Commissioners can manage it, a provisional grant assessment, and that provisional grant assessment is made and furnished to the accountable person, the personal representative or whoever, and upon payment of that assessment&mdash;which is then required to be paid&mdash;a receipt is endorsed on a copy of the Inland Revenue affidavit and it is returned and thereafter the process of law can take place.  In other words, when the accountable person or personal representative or agent is in possession of the duplicate Inland Revenue affidavit with the receipt endorsed thereon he may lodge the papers in the probate office and proceed to extract probate or letters of administration as the case may be.</P>
      <P>I understand this is the opening gambit in the administration and incidentally in the collection of debts. Once the grant has issued the authorised person can pay debts and proceed to administration and distribution but at the same time it is necessary to have regard to possible revenue directions in other contexts with the Revenue Commissioners who may give directions and may make further requisitions.  I understand that in cases like that, if a solicitor or agent is acting, these documents are furnished equally to the personal representative as well as to the agent.  There may then be what can prove sometimes a long process of corrective affidavits and receipts and you then come to a residuary account; but in the end there may be an additional balance of duty and there will be a final assessment.  On payment of the balance of the duty the Revenue Commissioners give a certificate of discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To summarise, the present procedure seems to be the furnishing of the affidavit, the provisional grant assessment and payment of it, the subsequent taking out of probate or letters of administration, the administration <Col N="1651" /> of the estate, the payment of the balance of the duty and the final discharge from liability by the certificate of discharge from the Revenue Commissioners.  My first question therefore is: does this mechanism hold and are we to interpret these two sections as the new statutory base requiring the furnishing of information within that framework?  In particular, I want to ask will it be necessary to wait for a provisional grant assessment before going further and will it be necessary to pay the duty on the provisional grant assessment before moving to the probate office?</P>
    <P>These questions are more than academic since a substantial difference has been made in where the primary liability&mdash;particularly in the case of debts&mdash;lies.  The Minister for Finance has been at great pains to point out that under the estate duty code the liability was on the estate and that now, in the case of inheritances, the liability is on the legatee.  It is, therefore, of some importance to know what is the mechanism on which the operation of these two sections will be based.  I have outlined the system heretofore, as I conceive it, by asking the Minister if that is to apply and, if so, is it to be varied or changed and if so, what new system will be substituted for it?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The procedure to be followed in regard to inheritances arising on death will be largely the procedure followed with estate duty at present in regard to payment of estate duty on estates, with one notable exception and that is that normally it will not be necessary to pay any tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> (a)  that an adequate payment on account of inheritance tax in respect of the property passing under the deceased person's will or intestacy or Part IX or section 56 of the Succession Act, 1965, has been made; or</P>
    <P>(b)  that the payment of inheritance tax in respect of such property may be deferred for the time being.</P>
    <P>they shall issue the certificate which will enable probate to be taken out.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy goes to subsection (3)  of that section he will see:</P>
    <P>If, in the opinion of the Commissioners, the payment of inheritance tax in respect of the property passing under the deceased person's will or intestacy or Part IX or section 56 of the Succession Act, 1965 cannot be deferred for the time being without serious risk of such tax not being recovered, they may refuse to issue the certificate referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i> until the tax has been paid, or until such payment as is referred to in <i>paragraph</i> (<i>a</i>) of that subsection has been made.</P>
    <P>That would be the exceptional case where the executor or administrator is out of the country or where, for some other reason, the Revenue Commissioners thought it would not be safe not to secure the tax before issuing the certificate.  The Deputy will see that from the solicitor's point of view and from the executor's point of view it has been considerably simplified because he will not have to raise the tax in advance of getting out the grant in a normal case.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to relieve the successor from interest on inheritance tax which accrued after the 1st of April, 1975, and before the Bill is passed.  The Bill, as initiated, had provided already&mdash;subsection (7)&mdash;for interest on gift tax. When the Bill was being drafted it was anticipated that it would be law <Col N="1655" /> by the date on which inheritances became liable to capital acquisitions tax, the 1st of April, 1975.

      <P>Subsection (8), which this amendment proposes to add to section 41, is designed to make rule 8 of the First Schedule more workable by not charging interest on tax payable when funds are applied from time to time, except from the date of application of the funds.</P>
      <P>Rule 8 in the First Schedule was included in order to deal with the valuation of limited interests which are given in such terms that the other rules in the First Schedule do not provide a method of valuing them.

      <P>I do not want to waste time going back over the same ground but I do want to record our disapproval of a rate of interest of 18 per cent per annum, as is proposed in subsection (2) here.  Of course, it is in conformity with what is being done in other legislation that has come before us but that does not make it right.  In my view, it leads to problems for the Revenue Commissioners, problems which should not arise, because the rate of interest is excessive.  I do not want to labour that point.  We made our views clear on it before.</P>
      <P>However, I do want to ask the Minister if he could outline for us the position in regard to liability to interest, particularly having regard to the valuation date on the one hand and the date of assessment on the other.  In other words, how does this difference arise: that it is the valuation date on the one hand and the assessment date on the other?  What is the precise effect in regard to liability to interest, as provided in the section, in relation to both the valuation date and the date of assessment?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> If I understand the Deputy's point correctly, it might be answered by saying that the date of death would be the date of inheritance.  The valuation date would be the date on which the residue was ascertained, which might be two years afterwards.  It is proposed only to charge interest from the valuation date, not from the date of death.  Of course, if the beneficiary became entitled to interest from the date of death or from any date subsequent to the date of death, that interest would be added to the inheritance, would form part of the inheritance and tax would be charged on it.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that this provision is desirable and necessary but it seems that the Bill should also contain provision to carry over the special provisions existing in the death duty code relating to, for instance, the special method of treating shares in Irish companies in certain circumstances.  Indeed, all of the reliefs which applied in the death duty code should have been applied to inheritance tax unless specifically excluded. If they were specifically excluded the Minister should explain why.  There are quite a number of reliefs, such as quick succession relief, that should apply automatically to inheritance tax unless specifically excluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Because of their familiarity with the old death duty system, many professional advisers and TDs have pointed out that well-known reliefs in the estate duty field find no place in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  The <Col N="1664" /> simple answer is that these reliefs grew up with the gradual increase in severity of the impact of estate duty, in order to alleviate genuine hardships, or to cut down a heavy burden of tax on particular property.  Such reliefs were necessitated by the high rates of tax and the low thresholds of liability.</P>
      <P>Sophisticated reliefs, especially when costly to administer and of doubtful value socially or to the development of the economy, are out of place in the new tax system proposed in this Bill. The new tax will bear very lightly on beneficiaries who might be said to have a moral right to receive the bounty of others&mdash;spouses, children and even parents and grandchildren.  Outside the immediate family, a person is usually very fortunate to receive such an acquisition as would bear a significant amount of tax under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Practical experience of the tax in action may, over the years, show areas in which reliefs, other than the very generous reliefs already given, may be desirable.  If a genuine, widespread hardship exists, a remedy will be considered.  But one or two hard cases&mdash; often caused by unwise dispositions of property, or neglect to make a will&mdash; are not grounds for a general relief which benefits the fortunate with the unfortunate and erodes the yield from the tax.</P>
      <P>In relation to yield, the new tax will probably be relatively expensive to administer: a multiplicity of exemptions and reliefs would have the effect of so eroding the yield as to increase to an unacceptable level the costs of collection of the tax, with a consequent demand for an increase in the effective rates of tax for those not relieved.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it can confidently be stated that the burden of the tax, for virtually all taxpayers, is very light, compared to that imposed by the death or inheritance tax systems of other countries, not to mention the inroads into capital made by the now defunct death duty system here.  That is the reason behind the failure to carry forward all the reliefs which grew up over the years.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) provides that the commissioners on an application to them by a person who is an accountable person will issue what is the equivalent of a certificate of discharge from death duties as would be the case in relation to inheritance tax. I am wondering whether there ought not to be provision stipulating: &ldquo;a person who is an accountable person or a person who has an interest in the property&rdquo;.  I am using that term loosely.  For instance, if one were dealing with the case of a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value who has notice of the liability, ought he not be in a position to apply for the certificate?  He might have completed the sale quickly knowing that this was outstanding.  In the case of his having to discharge the liability should he not be in a position to get this certificate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  In relation to a guarantee referred to in paragraph (b) of this and the preceding subsection in money in a currency other than the currency of the State, the references to principal in those paragraphs shall be taken as referring to the equivalent in currency of the State of the actual principal, such equivalent being calculated according to the cost in the currency of the State of the actual principal at the time of the giving of the guarantee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 37 of the 1969 Act the authority have power to give guarantees in a currency other than that of the State.  Since in section 2 (2) (b) of this Bill the limit on guarantees of principal is expressed in sterling, it is necessary to have a provision which regulates the calculation of the equivalent amount in the currency of the State of a guarantee given in another currency.  This amendment provides that in calculating the aggregate amount of the guarantees, amounts guaranteed in a currency other than Irish £s shall be <Col N="1674" /> converted into £s at the exchange rate obtaining on the day the guarantee was given.  This will obviate any danger that the aggregate of guarantees given could be pushed over the statutory limit by a change in exchange rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that the net effect of this would be somewhat to reduce the value of guarantees given by the IDA in circumstances where they were given in non-sterling currencies.  I am afraid it will be looked at in that light by those to whom the guarantees are given in respect of borrowing.  I think it best to explain what appears to be the meaning of this amendment by way of example rather than in the manner in which the Minister explained it.  No doubt it was correctly explained but it was rather technical.</P>
      <P>The example that one might give is the one frequently given in relation to the depreciation of sterling since the agreement of December, 1971 when it was arranged to float the £ sterling against what is known as a basket of currencies under the arrangement that is described as the &ldquo;snake&rdquo;.  This agreement was concluded in Washington in December, 1971 and the net effect since then has been a depreciation in sterling of 30.2 per cent up to a few days ago, although it may be slightly higher or lower today.  Someone borrowing in non-sterling currency on the basis that he would have to repay in the currency in which he borrowed, and assuming that he borrowed £1 million in December, 1971 and that he were to repay it today on that basis, would have to pay back £1,320,000.  Of course, that would be exclusive of interest which he would have had to pay in the meantime and the interest payments would be subject to a corresponding depreciation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume the purpose of the amendment is to protect the IDA against the continuing inflation or depreciation of the Irish £ and sterling as against non-sterling currencies by providing that if they guarantee a loan of £1 million today to an industrial promoter they will not be called on to repay more than £1 million when the loan becomes repayable and if their <Col N="1675" /> guarantee is called into effect.  I assume their liability to repay will not exceed £1 million, at any rate in Irish currency irrespective of whatever depreciation may take place on the part of sterling as against non-sterling currencies.</P>
    <P>For that reason I welcome the amendment in so far as it protects the funds of the IDA in a way that they might not otherwise be protected.  We are entitled to inquire if the IDA, having given guarantees in non-sterling currencies in the past, potentially are caught if called on to honour their guarantees, with the repayment to the lender of more than the original amount lent because of depreciation in sterling as against the basket of currencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has correctly seized the kernel of the amendment which is that the £ has been sinking quite dramatically and the old circumstance which people were used to, of fixed parties, has disappeared but the conclusion reached by the Deputy is not the correct one.  The intention of the amendment is a little different and I will try to indicate more fully that intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Guarantees given in other currencies are not necessarily reduced in value.  For example, if there is a farm that is putting in a certain piece of equipment made in Switzerland&mdash;a hard currency country&mdash;the loan to purchase the equipment may be in Swiss francs and it might need to be guaranteed in that.  It might need to be guaranteed in many currencies. The guarantees, up to the limit of £100 million, are cumulative.  The great majority of them will be in sterling but if you have a circumstance where there is already an accumulation of guarantees up into a sum of £90 million and some of those guarantees are in currencies other than sterling, if the value of the sterling equivalent of the non-sterling guarantees is to be calculated on the fluctuating rather than on the fixed rate, then some day, with no new guarantees given, simply by a change in the value of sterling you could find you had <Col N="1676" /> gone over your £100 million limit.  It is the opinion of some of the legal experts who have looked at this that if your limit of £100 million is burst by that fluctuation in exchange rates, then all your guarantees become invalid.  This is a mechanism to prevent fluctuations in the tot from taking place so that you always know exactly where you are.  There are no guarantees at present in non-sterling currencies, but if there were downward floats, then the IDA would pay the amount even if that was a larger amount than the amount borrowed. This is one of the dangers of guaranteeing in currencies other than one's own, at a time when one's own is weak, but the point of the amendment is to ensure the legal validity of all of the guarantees given.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak subject to correction, but I understand that that is not the opinion, that the purpose of this amendment is to provide that the guarantee shall be computed with an equivalent in sterling of the value of the non-sterling guarantee on the day on which it was given, so that the limit of £100 million is not burst through inadvertently, but that does not exclude the possibility that if <Col N="1677" /> there is a dramatic down float of the pound that, in the case of a guarantee being defaulted on in a non-sterling currency, the IDA might have to pay back more than the face value in sterling of that guarantee at the original time that the guarantee was negotiated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, which would validate all guarantees.  While that is undoubtedly of importance, is it not equally important from the IDA's point of view and from the national point of view that the IDA should not be stuck in this position, that, if in the example I have given, they had guaranteed in December, 1971, a loan of £1 million, and are called on in December, 1975, to honour the loan&mdash;this is of course assuming the loan is in non-sterling currency&mdash;in order to honour it they would have to pay the lender £1,320,000 in sterling?  Would the Minister not take the opportunity, as the two matters are so closely connected, to extend this amendment to cover that situation as well as the situation of the inadvertent excess of the total number of guarantees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the objective the Deputy is aiming at, but I am unwilling to restrict the IDA in this matter.  Everyone who has been dealing with borrowings or guarantees&mdash; and this is an important distinction, because we are now talking about guarantees and not about IDA loans&mdash; recognises that many sterling borrowers have been caught in the last four years and caught desperately, but the IDA are aware of this, and they <Col N="1678" /> will drive the best bargain they can. In other words, if they can secure acceptance, either with regard to a guarantee or a loan, of repayment at a fixed rate, they will certainly take that course, but I am unwilling to bind them&mdash;and they have done this &mdash;to do so in all cases.  I want to give them the flexibility, if there is no way out, if they are cornered into guaranteeing repayment in the currency in which borrowing is made, regardless of the fluctuation of sterling, of being able to do that.  They are very well aware of the danger, but the guarantees in this case are merely guarantees of loans and not loans.  Normally in the region in which we are working, with the scale of firms with which we are working and taking the suppliers with whom we are working, the default and, therefore, the necessity for our agencies to honour that guarantee is very much the rarity and is something that is not part of the normal scheme of things at all.  As I say, it is a guarantee and not a loan itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If from now on the IDA are to give guarantees in non-sterling currencies, and assuming&mdash; and we have got to assume when we are discussing a thing like this&mdash;they are called on at some stage to honour at least some of their guarantees, would the Minister take into account the position the IDA will be in if there is a major collapse of the British economy, which is not impossible.  There may be a further devaluation of the £ sterling.  If things do not improve in Britain, it could be 20 to 25 per cent in a year or two. Does the Minister realise the position the IDA is put in?  It may have a huge excess to repay over its original guarantee.  Would it not be better to bind the IDA by statute to repay only what it guaranteed originally in sterling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point of the Deputy's remarks, but since 1971 sterling has been going down and down.  The catastrophe that he speaks of is possible but it is also possible&mdash; and there are people speculating on it at the moment&mdash;that the £ is as low as it is going to go and that it is going <Col N="1679" /> to rise.  If we did not allow this variation in parity either way, we would then prevent the IDA from benefiting from the strengthening of the £, if it strengthens.  We would lock them to repaying at the exchange rate which is now as disadvantageous as it is ever going to be, right at the depths of the devaluation of the £.  If the British economy steadies, and if the North Sea oil produces the boost for the British economy that is anticipated, then the £ will harden from here on out and the amount of actual repayments will be less.  The IDA is well aware of this problem.  I am advised that the expert opinion is that we should leave it without tying them either way.</P>

Taking fluctuations into account and assuming another 10 per cent devaluation, could this not drive the IDA outside this bracket?  Does the Minister follow the point I am making? How would the IDA get out of this situation?</P>

      <P>I follow the thought, but I would refer the Deputy to the final subsection of the amendment, which reads:&ldquo;...such equivalent being calculated according to the cost in the currency of the State of the actual principal at the time of the giving of the guarantee&rdquo;.  In other words, on the day the guarantee is given, even though we know that subsequent fluctuations will take place between the £ and the currency of that State&mdash;maybe to the disadvantage of the £, maybe to its advantage&mdash; for the sake of calculating this guarantee limit the amount will be taken as on the day the guarantee was given.  In that way&mdash;and this is the whole object of the amendment&mdash;you stop those fortuitous fluctuations from obtruding and possibly bursting a guarantee.  Because it is frozen as of the day it is given, it cannot fluctuate in the total.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 45, to add the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Not less than 50 per cent of the aggregate amounts of grants referred to in subsections (2) (a) and (3) (a) of this section payable after the passing of this Act, shall be paid to Irish citizens or Irish controlled companies.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is quite clear.  It seeks to have 50 per cent at least of the various grants referred to in section 2, which will be payable in the future, paid to Irish controlled companies.  The reason I put down this amendment, as I stated at some length on Second Stage, is that, in common with many people, I am a bit disturbed at what appears to be the low rate of participation of Irish <i>entrepreneurs</i> or industrialists in our industrial drive over the past 20 years.  Since the late 1950s there has been a major effort to attract foreign industry, <Col N="1681" /> a very commendable effort, an effort which in its time, and up to quite recently, was eminently successful, and the wisdom of which one could not question.</P>
    <P>In the past couple of years due to various circumstances things have changed.  I believe, and this Party believe, that a far greater proportion of our new industries could be Irish owned, Irish controlled, or have a much larger Irish content than they had hitherto.  There are a number of reasons for this.  One is that there has been a recession which caused foreign companies to be less anxious to stay in Ireland if their whole group were running into difficulties.  Secondly, because of the industrial policies which have been followed successfully in the past, including the attraction of a large amount of foreign industry, the necessary skills, the necessary experience, and so on, are now available in Irish hands to a much greater degree than was the case in the past.</P>
    <P>The necessity for the heavy predominance of foreign participation in our industries, and in particular in our new industries, is much less that it was in the 1950s, the 1960s, and, perhaps, even in the early 1970s.  I believe active encouragement should be given to the IDA to seek to promote in so far as they possibly can Irish enterprise and Irish controlled industries. The Minister will probably tell me they do this already as best they can.  While it would not have been appropriate in the past, some form of statutory obligation is very arguably appropriate in the future.</P>
    <P>I am not tied to the figure of 50 per cent, although it seems a reasonable one.  If the Minister were prepared to accept the principle of what I am saying, I would be quite happy to see it reduced to 40 per cent or 35 per cent if he or the IDA thought it was necessary to reduce it in that way, and, perhaps, in five years' time or so, we could increase it to 50 per cent. I am in no way tied to that figure but I am tied to the idea that a fixed percentage of our new industrial <Col N="1682" /> enterprise every year should be under Irish control and should be on the part of Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>I endeavoured to obtain from the Minister the figures of the grants paid in the past five years to Irish citizens and Irish-owned companies on the one part and foreign citizens and foreign-controlled companies on the other part. I had a question down for oral answer today and it was not reached.  I took the written answer which is:</P>
    <P>Apart from the difficulty of defining the terms used in the Deputy's question, information is not available in the form in which he has asked for it.</P>
    <P>However, I have been informed by the IDA that the amount of capital grant payments made in respect of new industrial projects initiated by foreign promoters from 1st April, 1970, to 31st December, 1974, the latest date for which information is available was £48.237 million, while the corresponding figure in relation to new projects initiated by undertakings within the country was £14.026 million.</P>
    <P>It goes on to talk about re-equipment and adaptation grants which are not quite relevant to this point.</P>
    <P>I worked out roughly the proportion of these two figures and it is 3½1.  From my reading of the Minister's reply, I am afraid this is not a full reflection of the actual position because the Minister does not state that the £14.026 million was given to Irish-controlled companies or Irish citizens. He said it was given in relation to new projects initiated by undertakings within the country.  That suggests to me that any existing factory is included in that figure.  As we know, a high proportion of our existing factories is foreign owned or foreign controlled.  Therefore, the actual figure I was looking for in relation to Irish citizens or Irish-controlled companies may well be only half of that £14 million or could even&mdash;I do not know: I am only speculating&mdash;be substantially less than half of it.</P>
    <P>Inevitably in recent years many of our grants were given to foreign projects which were already established within the country.  A good factory <Col N="1683" /> were going ahead and employing 100 or 200 people and they decided to have another one to expand their existing factory substantially.  For example, EI in Shannon, which had a big factory, opened one in Galway a couple of years later.  Scripto in Shannon opened a factory in Limerick.  There must be many other examples such as that. Therefore, the proportion of 3½1, when you analyse it, is probably more likely to be about 7:1 or 8:1 in favour of grants to foreign-owned or controlled projects as against Irish-owned projects. I fully accept that in the 1950s or the 1960s that kind of proportion was inevitable because we did not have the tradition, expertise, capital, experience and the <i>enterpreneurs</i> to enable our citizens to take up a higher proportion of the grants available.</P>
    <P>It is very disturbing that in the years from 1970 to 1974 Irish citizens seemed to be getting only one-eight, or perhaps less, of what is going in terms of industrial grants under all these various Acts and sections that are set out here. The time has come when this House should, through statute, compel the IDA to ensure that a higher proportion than was so in the years between 1970 and 1974, should now be reserved to and paid to Irish enterprise.  They may well say that Irish enterprise would not be able to take it up.  If they got the necessary encouragement I believe they would be able to take it up, even if not to the extent of 50 per cent, as set out in my amendment, which is a fairly pious hope, at least a much higher proportion than the one-eight or one-ninth which they were able to take up in the five years we have been talking about.</P>
    <P>I am primarily concerned here with the principle of the amendment rather than the actual percentage.  I would be happy to withdraw it if the Minister was prepared to say that he would substitute a different amendment with some lower percentage but nonetheless would give a guarantee to Irish enterprise and place an obligation on the IDA to start looking around at home perhaps to a greater extent than they have been doing up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the <Col N="1684" /> purpose of Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  For reasons that I hope will be clear to the House I hope he will not press it.  I understand its motivation and I agree with very much of what he said now.  It serves a useful purpose that we can have this exchange about it.  I will certainly draw the contents of the exchange to the attention of the Industrial Development Authority.  We have, regardless of what percentage is written in, some genuine difficulties here which I would like very briefly to tease out.</P>
      <P>An amendment, regardless of the percentage, whether it is 50 per cent or another percentage, which makes an explicit differentiation in favour of Irish firms is basically contrary to the Treaty of Rome and the Accession Treaty.  It is contrary to the fundamental treaty of the Community, to Articles 7,58, 90, 92 and 93, I am informed.  Let me, without going into the fine print of this, indicate the general drift, because a quotation from Article 3 says:</P>
      <P>Any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.</P>
      <P>The other articles flesh that out.  Article 58 says:</P>
      <P>Companies or firms formed in accordance with the law of a member State within the Community... shall, for the purpose of this chapter, be treated in the same way as natural persons who are nationals of member States.</P>
      <P>That obviously extends to firms the prohibition on discrimination set out in Article 7.  That makes one of the formal difficulties to our accepting the amendment.  If we passed this amendment we would immediately have it struck down by the Commission.  There is not a shadow of doubt about that. I have no particular pleasure in telling the House that that is the way it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other difficulties also. When we talk about foreign firms we all think of the firms who have come in here in the last 20 years, but because of the relationship of Irish industry with the UK in the past those that we think of as perhaps most indigenous, most Irish, are not Irish.  Guinness is an example.  That firm would have to be counted in the non-Irish category <Col N="1685" /> as also would Fry-Cadburys, Rown-tree-Mackintosh and other firms like that.  A lot of the food sector would have to be counted in this category.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley deplored the low rate of participation by Irish <i>entrepreneurs.</i>  I share that feeling of his, the same as everybody does.  I have done my utmost, through small industry promotion, through finding new enterprise and through the enterprise and development of the IDA, to direct the IDA towards Ireland and small industry.  Part of the answer is that it is not possible legally.  There is also the answer that it is not a good thing to do either if one thinks of the practicality.</P>
    <P>One must think over what period of time one keeps one's totals.  Are they simply running totals?  Do you do it day by day?  In some cases, where a grant is approved the final payments may not be made for six or seven years. Some things are paid very quickly. There is a genuine technical difficulty. The big difficulty is that in the middle of very good times, when you could create jobs at a rate that to go any faster would disrupt your economy, you could get selective.  While I agree with Deputy O'Malley's basic thinking I have to say that to turn away any source of jobs from anywhere would be a mistake and something I could not go along with.  Deputies on all sides of the House represent constituencies all over the country.  I believe that all constituents would answer the same way.  They would say that provided the industry is firmly based, that it is not crooked or shady, provided it is a good industrial job with a future growth, they would accept it from whatever source it comes and be very glad to get it.  I must say in the middle of a depression that is also my opinion.</P>
    <P>I believe the way to get over this is not by putting any sort of statutory limitation on how much goes to non-Irish sources.  With company law and the structure of ownership now, even the determination of what is an Irish source and what is an non-Irish source is genuinely difficult.  Deputy O'Malley has more legal experience than I have <Col N="1686" /> and he knows that I am not inventing that as a difficulty just to throw something out.  It is also quite hard to identify the ultimate ownership and to make decisions about whether it is Irish or not.  Even granting that you could do that, that you could keep a tot, that you could get past the Community objections, the job is not to make statutory limitations either way but simply to use all our ingenuity to promote Irish growth.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the IDA that the reasons for turning down Irish applications are because they are in sectors already overcrowded and where they are very poor risks, that Irish applications are not turned down for want of funds by the IDA.  It is not an either/or.  If we were diverting the funds away from Ireland to foreign investment and we could get the Irish investment by diverting them back, I would agree that we would have to think differently.  That is not the case. Irish investment is not starved for want of funds.  If more of a sound kind were to come forward more could be funded.  It is not a robbing of one to serve the other.  Therefore, I believe the correct task at the moment is to keep both the Irish indigenous and the foreign going as fully as possible.  This has been a very useful exchange and I agree with the basic sentiment.</P>
    <P>The task is to think up mechanisms by which Irish Industry can be favoured within the context of the limitations of our Accession Treaty with the EEC which is very rigorous on the subject of avoiding any advantage to any nation.  I think we must do it by promotion and stimulation.  I am informed that no project from an Irish source is refused on the basis of shortage of funds.  Once I am guaranteed that, an amendment of this kind is not necessary and could be counterproductive because we could lose useful investment.</P>

      <P>In recent years there has been grave dissatisfaction about the allocation of grants by the IDA to various firms, foreign or native.  It is almost impossible also <Col N="1687" /> for an Irish concern to get off the ground at the moment&mdash;and especially in the case of small industrialists employing fewer than ten or 15 people by getting a grant from the IDA unless they can show a huge profit in the past few years.  This means jobs are lost and the would-be promoter loses confidence not only in the IDA but also in the Government and the country.  There appears to be a certain amount of talk and even clarification by the Government indicating they intend to phase out county development teams.</P>

      <P>County development teams should be fully supported and should not be phased out at this stage of our development.  It is well known that a native industrialist must show a profit in previous years before he can get a grant from the IDA.  I consider that is wrong.  When an individual or a group have a good proposal which they can show could make a profit and would be of service to the people and that they would employ more workers as time went on, the IDA should give them a grant. Many chances were taken in the past with foreign industrialists but now and in the future we should give our own people a reasonable chance.  If we do not trust our own, how can we trust a foreign industrialist?</P>
      <P>I am very much in favour of foreign industrialists coming here to set up industries with all their know-how and technical knowledge and I do not want to be misunderstood on that score.  But it is also a fact that in all counties there are people who have local knowledge and skill and who want to set up industries and they should not have to fight their way through the county development teams, which the present Government are inclined to knock, right up to the IDA and then be refused a grant. They must then set themselves up on bank loans at 15 per cent or 20 per cent or through hire purchase companies at 20 to 25 per cent.  After three or four years when they have proved themselves they can get a grant&mdash;and only then&mdash;from the IDA. The sooner this situation is changed the better.  The IDA should make grants available to local authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of late I believe there is grave dissatisfaction amongst the public generally, particularly those involved in industry here, regarding the allocation of grants by the IDA.  I say that without fear or favour.  Whether or not the Chair stops me I shall say it, and I say it again: there is grave dissatisfaction throughout the country at present amongst industrialists, particularly Irish industrialists, regarding the allocation of grants by the IDA and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister is merely bluffing by referring to EEC directives and regulations.  It is a well-known fact that EEC directives were changed at the instigation of the Government quite recently on at least one occasion, if not on a few occasions, and for good reasons too.  I congratulate the Government on having done so.  I see no reason why we should be bound to the EEC where the jobs of 150,000 of our people are concerned.  The Italians did not do so.  There is no other country within the EEC that would bow to rules and laws where the jobs of 150,000 of its people were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> It is a well-known fact, of course&mdash; and I am sticking strictly to the terms of Deputy O'Malley's amendment&mdash; that one cannot have industry without its attendant services, water, sewerage, roads, without the infrastructure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe that the Minister and the IDA are letting down the ordinary Irish man and woman who may want to set up an industry here and, if the Minister is serious about it, he will accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to speak at any length except to say that, if for no other reason than that it contains an acknowledgment or recognition of our regard for what might be called the coming-of-age of the Irish <i>entrepreneur</i> and of the obligation on us to treat him in the same fashion as anybody else, the amendment is to be welcomed.  It may be shown that we do.  On the other hand, it would appear from the figures Deputy O'Malley has given that, in the past, the weight of financial assistance has gone towards&mdash;I do not like using the term &ldquo;the non-Irish&rdquo;&mdash;the outside company, a figure of £48 million assistance given to those deemed to be outside the country as against £14 million to undertakings at home.  However, it is not the time or place to have any great discourse on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> The Minister did accept that the spirit of the amendment was such that it was stretching out to acknowledge the Irish element in our industrial development.  We should realise that in the past, because of our agricultural background and our lack of industrial tradition, it was necessary to have, indeed we welcomed and continue to welcome, outside influence and aid.  But surely we must now be reaching the point, and I am saying this because I am mindful of the fact that there are rumours abroad&mdash;I am not saying I agree with them&mdash;that if an Irish concern goes to the IDA looking for money they practically have to prove beforehand they do not want it.  It is like going to the bank manager for an overdraft.  The same yardstick is not applied to companies from other countries.  I am not saying that this is true.  I am saying, and I am sure the Minister is aware of this that these things are being said.</P>
    <P>I am not hoping that acceptance of Deputy O'Malley's amendment would exclude repetition of that but I am concerned that there should be an indication as far as Irish <i>entrepreneurs</i> are concerned that it is acknowledged they have, as it were, come of age and will, provided they have the proposition and indicate that jobs are being created, get a hearing and that a certain amount of the moneys allocated will be aimed at Irish industrialists.  If our faith in our own industrialists should prove unfounded, then it will be quite easy to introduce appropriate amending legislation.  Some months ago we had another IDA Bill before the House and if what Deputy O'Malley seeks to provide is not availed of then the law can be amended.</P>
    <P>As far as the Treaty of Rome is concerned, I had thought the Minister would appear at least before the Opposition to be made of sterner stuff.  I do not think the Minister need will before the Treaty of Rome because a case can be made, having regard to our special position, that that which is appropriate to the German, the French or the British industrialist is not necessarily <Col N="1694" /> appropriate in our case.  In the matter of discrimination, so long as it appears we are not discriminating against the outsider one can introduce conditions which may appear discriminatory against the native industrialist.  I am sure that can be circumvented so that the spirit of Deputy O'Malley's amendment can be honoured.</P>
    <P>Those are the only two points I want to make.  The time has come for us to acknowledge the position of the home industrialist.  Instead of thinking in terms of bringing in industries from outside we should be assisting our own who are in urgent need of assistance.  This could be done by acceptance of Deputy O'Malley's amendment. Where the Treaty of Rome is concerned, in our special circumstances and with the expertise the Minister has in his Department and the expertise he himself can contribute we could, I believe, circumvent the relevant inhibition in the Treaty of Rome.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> From the figures Deputy O'Malley has given there is a wide discrepancy in amount as between grants given to foreigners and grants given to Irish industrialists.  I know it has been difficult for some years past to get Irish people to invest in Irish industry and looking at the industrial climate the Minister will have a difficult task on his hands where the small investor is concerned even with the acceptance of Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  There is an air of uncertainty.  There is a lack of return on capital.  The problems facing Irish industry will continue for the next four or five years.  There are small companies that could expand and could command markets abroad but there is a lack of cash flow and there is a non-availability of loans. Because of the scarcity of money and the cost of money, industrialists will not take up these grants.  Even if they did take them up there is the problem of the cash flow, a problem they have to contend with every day of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> It is difficult to get money from the banks and, even if one does get it, it is very costly.  These firms have to buy their raw materials c.o.d. and they have to sell on three to four months' credit.  This reduces profitability.  Unless something is done to solve these problems there is not much hope of small companies expanding.  Those industries on the export market have some concession because they are exempt from income tax.  We have reached the stage now where the companies selling on the home market are meeting the same competition as if they were selling on the export market.  For the sake of retaining staffs and keeping factory wheels turning, British and American companies are exporting to the Irish market and they are subsidising their goods to keep their factories going.  The Minister should have a look at the possibility of some concession from the point of view of taxation for those of our industrialists selling on the home market.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I agree, but it is certainly one of the problems confronting us from the point of view of expansion. The IDA should examine into applications.  Large companies do not have a problem in formulating applications and giving proper projections.  There are, however, people who do not have the same expertise in formulating applications and these are the people Deputy O'Malley would like to assist. We are not channelling resources into potential manufacturing units.  What consideration would the IDA give to a group of four or five people who could establish a small factory in which they would be the actual work force?  I doubt if we are channelling enough resources into small manufacturing units.  If we are to continue in our present state, we will have to depend on the larger units.  These large units will take up a bigger portion of our work force but at the same time we <Col N="1696" /> must encourage more of our people to go into the manufacturing industry.  At present our people are hesitant to do so because they feel there is too much of a risk involved.  The person with £50,000 or £100,000 at his disposal is hesitant to embark on any venture even if that venture is backed by an IDA grant.  If there was some other system, such as interest free loans, such people might be encouraged to invest their money because they would not be running such a high risk.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that such people have the expertise, a very important factor.  It will be difficult to encourage people to invest in manufacturing industries because at present they can get a good return, without any risk, on gilt-edged investments. These people are waiting for the end of the economic recession but in the meantime the country is suffering.  I believe that the credit available at the banks is not being taken up.  The Minister will not be able to tackle this problem alone.  The Government will have to generate a climate of confidence.  A number of manufacturers told me last week that their auditors advised them against reinvestment in their companies because of the wealth tax.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Government are considering proposals with regard to small industries and in this regard I hope such industries are encouraged to expand.  While there has been criticism of the IDA they played their part in boosting our industrial development. It is hard for the IDA to be perfect and grants cannot be given to every project.  If we are to stop the decline in employment, positive steps will have to be taken.  The Minister must produce, without delay, a blueprint for industrial expansion.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The majority of manufacturers are operating at 70 to 80 per cent of capacity.  They should be encouraged to improve their output, particularly on the export market.  We should do everything to improve their <Col N="1697" /> situation even to the extent of subsidising their exports.  If our exporters are not subsidised they will be swamped by competition from countries who have introduced such subsidies in order to keep their people in employment.  It is better to subsidise exports and keep our people in employment than paying people on the dole.  Unless we do something in regard to the small manufacturers we will find that when the recession ends there will be nobody to avail of the IDA grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that strikes me about this amendment is that Irish citizens should not be at a disadvantage when they apply for IDA grants.  There is money available for investment here if the proper facilities are made available to our own people.  Irish industries, when they apply for assistance from the IDA, must produce records of trading over five years but a foreign industrialist can start from scratch.  An industry with the names of five or six foreign directors on its letterhead will be given sympathetic consideration before an application from an industry with Irish directors.  Are the IDA attracted by foreign directors or do they feel that foreigners are more efficient than Irish directors?  A reexamination of the outlook of the IDA should take place.</P>
      <P>According to figures quoted by Deputy O'Malley, the IDA has been milked by some big industrialists, but to a large extent they were foreigners.  I am not against foreign industrialists coming here but we must remember that in most cases such industries are subsidiaries of companies operating in wealthy countries.  As the pressure comes on the parent company it is more than likely the subsidiary will be the first to go.  In such circumstances we are very vulnerable here.  I think the IDA outlook is too rigid and should become more flexible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I was dealing with the IDA in connection with a concern anxious to establish an industry here giving guaranteed employment to 56 people in a designated area, but they are having severe problems with the IDA. The result is that this concern are considering <Col N="1698" /> getting some of their commodities manufactured in Switzerland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about Irish-controlled companies.  If the IDA fears were well founded I could understand it, but this company who have the ability to supply markets are being offered a 35 per cent grant in a designated area while their competitors get the full grant.  It is only when one is intimately involved in such a situation that one can see the injustice meted out to some small companies.  We know there is a risk involved in any industry, but the IDA should not take up such an attitude in relation to small industries.  In the international set-up, somebody in Germany, Switzerland or Japan, by a stroke of the pen, can wipe out the Irish subsidiary, maintaining full employment at the home base. Therefore, when an Irish concern is anxious to establish a factory they should be given full consideration by the IDA whose present approach is driving people here to examine alternatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They have had to close down because of decisions by the parent companies.  Would the Minister direct the IDA to take some initiative, to take over these subsidiaries when they get into difficulties?  I am suggesting that the IDA become more directly involved in the running of some of these companies under Irish management and manned by Irish workers.  A case has been made by unions and others for workers' co-ops.  I am suggesting that the IDA take the initiative and I am asking the Minister to request the IDA to get involved in the initiating of companies under Irish management, companies who could produce goods which now have to be imported.  Somebody mentioned tags for cattle, ear-tags required by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in regard to testing.  These have to be imported and I suggest the Minister might draw the attention of the IDA to the need to establish companies which would manufacture such commodities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  We all welcome foreign industries but in the long run companies established by Irish people are more committed to the country than foreign companies.  What Deputy Daly has said merits attention&mdash;the IDA should get more involved in Irish industry, particularly in small private companies.  Personal supervision in a company means a lot and foreign industries coming in, although they employ Irish workers, have not the same commitment to the country. There is more personal attention in small home-based industries and we should give every assistance to their formation, always knowing the risk involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having spoken at length on the Second Stage of this Bill I do not intend detaining the House now but I support this amendment fully.  We are not saying that foreigners should not be encouraged to set up here but we are saying that there should be more <Col N="1700" /> encouragement and incentive for Irish industry.  Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the question of subsidising the exports of Irish industry.  Other countries have done this in relation to their industries and, indeed, some of these are guilty of dumping their exports here.</P>
    <P>I am surprised and disappointed that during this pre-Christmas period there has not been more emphasis on the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  Has this campaign been dropped altogether?  I have not heard it referred to in recent times.  Our people should be patriotic enough to support Irish industry and to take into account the jobs of their fellow countrymen.  While we welcome foreign industry Irish industry should be given the advantage in terms of support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the assurances given by the Minister and the assurances that the IDA give, it must be accepted that there is a widely held belief among Irish industrialists, whether justified or otherwise, that it is more difficult for an Irish industry to get assistance from the IDA than is the case in respect of foreigners.  It is regrettable that this is the belief among our own industries because it deters people from applying for assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might interrupt the Deputy to assure the House that if I get evidence of differentiation on the part of anyone against Irish industry I will have such differentiation dismissed.  There is no such differentiation that I am aware of.  I promise to dismiss any that is brought to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that assurance from the Minister and from the IDA but, unfortunately, there exists this widespread belief in regard to foreigners being in an advantageous position <i>vis-à-vis</i> Irish industrialists in relation to getting assistance from the authority.  One of the reasons for this belief is that immediately somebody starts talking to the IDA about an industry he is asked whether he has been engaged in this type of operation before, what were his <Col N="1701" /> figures in previous years and so on. Invariably the Irish promoter proposing to become engaged in any such industry has not been involved in such operation before and, consequently, is at a disadvantage because he cannot comply with a fundamental criterion of the IDA in the same way as can a foreign industrialist who, probably, has a similar factory in his own or some other country.  The IDA should go out of their way not to apply the same criteria to Irish industrialists as they would apply to foreign industrialists.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty with which Irish industrialists have to contend and which is not taken into account by the IDA is in relation to the relief of income tax on industrial export profits.  This concession is of far more value to foreigners than to Irish persons.  I say this because normally in an Irish export manufacturing industry the whole process is conducted in Ireland whereas in the case of the foreign industry this may not be the case because a substantial part of the manufacturing process may be carried out abroad and a partly-finished product exported to Ireland for completion and, consequently, for re-export. In that way it is possible for the subsidiary here of the foreign company to show a much higher degree of profit in Ireland than is possible in the case of the Irish manufacturer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to this point on Second Stage and it is relevant to this amendment in that the concession gives a considerable advantage to the foreign industrialist who is operating in the way I have outlined.  There are a number of foreign industrialists who carry out the entire process in Ireland. I am not referring to those.  In the case of the partly-finished product being sent here for completion, it is imported at an artificially low price, a price that would cause a foreign company to suffer a loss or at least to show no profit in their own domestic market.  This price could be so bad that the difference in the two prices is not accounted for by the value that is added here so that there is a very large profit element in the re-export price from Ireland.  Therefore, the <Col N="1702" /> profit is maximised in Ireland and the export tax relief is of much greater value to a company operating in this way than it is to an Irish company who may have only a small profit, or, as is common nowadays no profit. Alternatively they may show a profit on paper on the basis of the traditional method of accountancy but may not have a profit if the new form of inflation accounting which is now being recommended in Britain is applied.</P>
    <P>I mention this as a further instance of the disadvantage in which an Irish industrialist finds himself and to show the necessity for the IDA to give Irish industrialists particular assistance.  I agree with the Minister that it may not be appropriate to spell out in statute the obligations of the IDA in so far as this might create problems in regard to our EEC membership and that there are certain problems which make it difficult for the IDA to estimate percentages in advance in any year but if they were to approach the whole question of the encouragement of Irish industries on the lines that have been advocated today by five or six Members, including the Minister, all of whom were <i>ad idem</i> on what should be the approach, I would be happy with such assurance and would not seek to bind the authority by way of statute. Numerous Deputies have said that there is this widespread belief regarding the Irish industrialist being at a disadvantage in relation to assistance. However, I am sure that in the sense of the IDA receiving two precise applications, one from a foreign company and one from an Irish company, there would not be any discrimination in so far as the Irish company are concerned.  But the IDA will have to bear in mind that it is difficult for the Irish industrialist to make an application which, from the authority's point of view, is as acceptable as an application from a foreign company who have been engaged in the industry concerned for many years.</P>
    <P>On the basis that the IDA will take account of the views that have been expressed, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

It states that the reference to moneys in subsection (3) shall be taken as referring to the cost in the currency of the State of the actual moneys payable by the authority.  The actual moneys payable by the authority would be those the authority are called on to pay on the day their guarantee is called up or when they are asked to honour that guarantee.  The distinction is drawn in the subsection between moneys in Irish £s and sterling and moneys in some other currency. Under that subsection the IDA would appear to be in the difficulty that they will be called on to pay the higher figure if there is a depreciation in a non-sterling loan guarantee.  Perhaps the Minister would say why section 37 (4) of the 1969 Act differs in this respect from the amendment we have just passed?</P>

      <P>Although we may be referring back to matters already dealt with, I will try to help the Deputy.  One relates to the actual amount of money to be repaid if there is default and if the guarantee is called in and the other relates to the keeping of a cumulative total <Col N="1705" /> of the aggregate amount lent.  If some of the amounts of guarantee within that cumulative total&mdash;it is made up of a number of separate transactions&mdash;are in a currency other than the currency of the State they can, and would, fluctuate up and down every day.  In terms of repayment that is not a great problem but in terms of not going through a maximum which is authorised by law it is a great problem.  The legal advice I have received is that if by accidental fluctuation it went through the maximum then all the guarantees would come into question because the statutory limit was burst by the fluctuation of the currencies.</P>
      <P>The amendment relates only to the keeping of an absolutely accurate tally of a known amount that will not fluctuate due to currency fluctuations and which therefore cannot be accidentally burst.  Therefore, it cannot happen that all the guarantees will be accidentally invalidated due to currency fluctuations.  They are two separate matters. The purpose of the amendment we are discussing is to absolutely ensure the validity and the legal standing of the guarantees given and, apparently, that can work only according to the mechanism introduced by this amendment.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> On subsection (1), the first £250 of the total taxable value of all gifts taken by one donee from one donor in any &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo; is exempt from tax and is not taken into account when computing tax.  In subsection (4) &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo; means (1) the period from 28th day of February, 1969, to 31st day of December, 1969, and (2) every subsequent period of 12 months ending on 31st day of December in each year.  This subsection means that gifts totalling up to £250 will be disregarded and that gifts exceeding £250 will have that sum deducted from the total.</P>

      <P>I received some representations in regard to this section, which, I imagine, were also received by the Minister, suggesting that it is not clear under this section that the normal recurring expenditure by the head of a household on children's education is outside the charge of gift tax and particularly where payments are made direct to children to defray educational expenses, as would happen frequently, say, in the case of the children of a family attending university.  There is also doubt expressed as to whether normal expenditure on the maintenance of spouses or the support of elderly relatives would come within the charge of gift tax.

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to secure that a benefit from a superannuation fund taken by a beneficiary under a disposition by the employee will not be exempted from tax under section 54 (3) if the fund is administered by the State.  Section 54 (3) exempts from tax the benefit which a person takes when public moneys are applied for his benefit.  However, one possible type of case of the application of public moneys for a person's benefit is a payment made under a superannuation scheme which is administered by a public body.  When such a payment involves a gift or inheritance under section 56 (5) there is no equity to exempt it, and the purpose of this amendment is to exclude it from the exemption given in section 54 (3).</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) (a) Any object to which this section applies and which, at the date of the gift or at the date of inheritance, and at the valuation date, is comprised in a gift or an inheritance taken by a person shall be exempt from tax in relation to that gift or inheritance, and the value thereof shall not be taken into account in computing tax on any gift or inheritance taken by that person from the same disponer unless the exemption ceases to apply under the provisions of subsection (3) or (4).</P>

If the exemption ceased to <Col N="1710" /> apply under subsections (3) or (4) there was some doubt as to whether the non-aggregation provision would continue to apply.

Under subsection (2) as initiated one of the conditions on which the object is exempted under section 55 is that it be comprised in the gift or inheritance both (1) at the date of the gift or inheritance and (2) at the valuation date&mdash;section 21&mdash; which, in the case of an inheritance could be later than the date of the inheritance. <Col N="1711" />  In the course of the administration of an estate, an object which was not specifically bequeathed by the testator could be appropriated in or towards the satisfaction of a legacy.

Even if it was paid over as part of a pecuniary legacy it would still be exempt, provided it was part of the estate.  Of course, it could not be introduced into the estate to gain exemption.

If it was appropriated by the executor towards payment of the legacy it would not have been in that legacy at the date of inheritance.  We are applying the treatment afforded in section 19 (6) to deem it to have been in the legacy at the date of the inheritance. I hope I have made it clear now.  The exemption would not apply unless the object was in the gift at the date of the inheritance and at the date of the valuation.  Here it did not form part of the legacy at the date of the inheritance but subsequent to that the executor has decided to give this object as part of the legacy and the legatee has decided to accept it.  If the amendment was not made the exemption would not apply to this particular object because it was not in the legacy at the date of the inheritance.

      <P>(b)  which are kept permanently in the State except for such temporary absences outside the State as are approved by the Commissioners; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  in respect of which reasonable <Col N="1714" /> facilities for viewing are allowed to members of the public or to recognised bodies or to associations of persons.</P>
    <P>There is one genuine case which is not covered, that is the case of a scholar or somebody who is <i>bona fide</i> working on cultural matters and is using these cultural objects but who does not fit in with paragraph (c).  I fully appreciate that this has to be spelled out because, unfortunately, in the case of art and some similar things there is considerable financial interest and pecuniary value attached to the objects concerned.  The Revenue Commissioners have the difficult task of deciding if such a collection is <i>bona fide</i> being used or kept for what I might broadly call cultural purposes or if it is an investment. In the latter case it would afford a means of evading tax because it would be an investment which would evade tax.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Revenue Commissioners must approve of the purpose is unquestionable.  The fact that it should be kept in the State is reasonable but the fact that it should be available in the way the section says is a little bit restraining on the genuine scholar.  I am talking of art collections here where their value is to be seen but there may be other things of scientific or artistic interest.  Take, for example, an amateur collector who nevertheless is systematic and can bring himself within a category that would justify the Revenue Commissioners in treating the matters I am going to suggest.  You could have a naturalist studying a certain area intensely, who might collect a unique collection which might be very valuable.  I admit that the case I am making here really has more impact in relation to the wealth tax.</P>

      <P>So far as they went, but I was not satisfied that the point I was making had been met.  Let us take books or manuscripts.  The private scholar may be a retired professor or somebody who is in another profession and has the time but is contributing to knowledge.  In the course of this he collects a library that may be of value.  The Minister is quite right in saying that this is of more practical interest in connection with the wealth tax.  If the restriction in regard to reasonable facilities for viewing could be widened with a further discretion to the Revenue Commissioners as to the <i>bona fide</i> user for the purpose of scholarship, this would be an admirable section.  I know we want to get the Committee Stage completed this evening, so I will leave it.  I do not expect any further answer from the Minister because he gave me the answer on the wealth tax and just now.</P>

I think that if the objects mentioned were available to a particular association interested in that sort of thing and they were allowed to view them <Col N="1716" /> at reasonable times, that would cover the point.  The policy and thinking behind paragraph (c) is that somebody other and beyond the owner must have access to them.  That seems reasonable.</P>

      <P>I know that they come in under another category.  Since this is intended to be&mdash;the purpose is different&mdash;for cultural purposes I suggest that it seems strange in the case of private scholarship where there is definite evidence to this effect that there should not be a slight extension of paragraph (c) enabling the Revenue Commissioners to exercise discretion. I am really talking on principles more than practicalities.  An instance where there would be a substantial, taxable collection or library of this sort is hard to visualise.  That is as far as I can push the point.  I recognise the difficulties of another sort and I do not intend to pursue the matter further with the Minister.  I accept what he says.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to put it on record that I could not agree that the objects mentioned in section 55 (1) (a), if they are used exclusively for an individual's own use and benefit and if the public or associations interested in them are denied access to them, should be exempt because the owner could be using them for his own financial benefit.  The study he might carry out on them could be turned to his own very substantial profit. Here we say that in order to gain exemption there must be some sharing of the objects with the public or other interested persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is typical administrative thinking, a failure absolutely to appreciate the things of the mind, what culture really means. If it was a question of profit, of turning them to his own interest, there would be manifest evidence of that. I can think of one case in the past where, say, a consulting chemist in a private capacity had a library of his own and he was using it for the purpose of trade and business and that came in in another way.  The point I wanted to make there was that public inspection was not one of the tests.  The test was not public inspection or interference with his professional or intellectual activities but whether he was using them for trade or business.  That disposes of the first leg of the suggestion, that a person might make gains.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other, it is notorious in history that the great achievements of the human mind have not come from the nine-to-five offices of the administration but from individuals. Neither have they come from the nine-to-five lecture rooms in universities but from the intellectual activities of individuals.  Very many contributions have been made even by retired members of various sections.  A very considerable contribution to our history, for instance, has been made by retired members of the public service or the private sector.  It was with that approach I was suggesting that this should be considered.  It seems a typical example of administrative blinkers to talk about public viewing and make a differentiation of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the practical difficulties and can say very little further on the matter.  I could understand an argument based on the fact that there would be a loophole or that it would be impracticable, but not to suggest that the whole object of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest in viewing by the public is equivalent to the attitude of the tourist who goes on time schedule to see objects and sets down that he has seen this, that and the other thing.  That is not scholarship, not what I am talking about.  I am talking about the intellectual activity of man which is much higher than the <Col N="1718" /> globe-trotting tourist mentality that can be too easily accepted.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Deputy misunderstands me.  We are dealing here with pictures, prints, works of art, manuscripts, jewellery, scientific collections or other things not held for the purpose of trading and we say that if a person wants to gain exemption in respect of these he must share them with somebody else.  If he wants to gain exemption from the ordinary tax laws, we say he must.  We are not saying he must share them with the world and its wife.  He may share them with a highly intellectual association of persons and that would meet the test set down in the section. We are only saying that they are not exclusively used for private purposes, they are not exclusively used as the private property of the individual, that he is sharing in the benefit from or pleasure of them with some other people, either the public in general or some association of persons interested in that sort of thing.</P>

      <P>There is one other point I want to raise.  The Minister referred to the corresponding provision in the Wealth Tax Act and, I think, indicated his belief that it was reasonable. Therefore, why does he omit from this Bill the reference in the Wealth Tax Act to gardens?  He will remember I was trying to get him to agree also to include historic houses but he could not see his way to doing so.  It is true to say that, in the Wealth Tax Act, gardens of that kind were included.</P>

In the Wealth Tax Act there is a variety of exemptions and reductions, such as the private dwellinghouse, the garden, agricultural property, stock and so on.  Also wealth tax is an annual tax.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 51:</P>
      <P>In page 38, to delete subsections (1) and (2) and to substitute the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Subject to the provisions of subsection (2), any payment to an employee or former employee by, or out of funds provided by, his employer or any other person <i>bona fide</i> by way of retirement benefit, redundancy payment or pension shall not be a gift or an inheritance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> (2) Subsection (1) shall not have effect in relation to a payment referred to in that subsection, and any such payment shall be deemed to be a gift or an inheritance where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) (i) the employee is a relative of the employer or other disponer; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  the employer is a private company within the meaning of section 16 (2), and of which private company the employee is deemed to have control within the meaning of that section;</P>
    <P>(b)  the payment is not made under a scheme (relating to superannuation, retirement or redundancy) approved by the Commissioners under the Income Tax Acts; and</P>
    <P>(c)  the Commissioners decide that in the circumstances of the case the payment is excessive.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>First, in this amendment the &ldquo;former employee&rdquo; is inserted, removing a possible ambiguity.  Secondly &ldquo;or any other person&rdquo; is inserted to allow for the case where a gift or legacy is given to the trustees of a superannuation fund.  Thirdly, &ldquo;retirement gratuity&rdquo; in the Bill, as initiated, line 3 of subsection (1) is being changed to &ldquo;retirement benefit&rdquo;.  Fourthly, the amendment of subsection (2) is proposed in order to exclude schemes that have been approved by the commissioners under the Income Tax Acts from the operation of subsection (2). Thus, payments made to the employee under an approved scheme will be exempt without any conditions as to their not being excessive.</P>

That remains in subsection (1)&mdash;&ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> by way of retirement benefit&rdquo;.  But, when one comes to (b) of subsection (2) one is differentiating between schemes that have been approved under the Income Tax Acts and other schemes which, presumably, are approved as <i>bona fide.</i> In one case, one is allowing things to take their course because, with regard to schemes under the Income Tax Acts, in effect the approval exists before the payment.  In the other case, it does not.  Therefore, clause (c) is there in order to decide, in the circumstances, whether the payment is or is not excessive.

A disponer wishing to benefit a foreigner could buy Government stock due for redemption in a month's time and give same to the donee and, if the donee accepted conversion terms into conversion <Col N="1725" /> stock, instead of taking cash, the exemption stood and the donee could then sell the conversion stock without loss of the exemption.

      <P>In page 43, before section 64 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>64.&mdash;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;death duties&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 30 of the Finance Act, 1971; and</P>
      <P>&ldquo;purchaser or mortgages&rdquo; includes a person deriving title from or under a purchaser or mortagee in the case of such a sale or mortgage as is referred to in this section.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where an interest in expectancy has, prior to the 1st day of April, 1975, been <i>bona fide</i> sold or mortgaged for full consideration in money or money's worth, and that interest comes into possession on a death occurring on or after that date, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the purchaser or mortgagee shall not be liable in respect of inheritance tax on the inheritance referred to in paragraph (b) for an amount greater than that referred to in paragraph (c);</P>
      <P>(b)  the inheritance referred to in paragraph (a) is the inheritance of property in which the interest so sold or mortgaged subsists and which arises in respect of the interest of the remainderman referred to in section 23 so coming into possession;</P>
      <P>(c)  the amount referred to in paragraph (a) shall be the amount that would then have been payable by the purchaser or mortgagee in respect of death duties on the property in which the interest subsists as property passing under the same disposition as that under which the said inheritance is taken, if the property, on so coming into possession, had been chargeable to death duties&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  under the law in force; and</P>
      <P>(ii)  at the rate or rates having effect,</P>
      <P>at the date of the sale or mortgage;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> (d)  where such an interest is so mortgaged, any amount of inheritance tax payable in respect of the inheritance referred to in paragraph (b), and from the payment of which the mortagee is relieved under this section, shall, notwithstanding the priority referred to in section 47 (1), rank, in relation to property charged with such tax under that section, as a charge subsequent to the mortgage;</P>
    <P>(e)  any person, other than the purchaser or mortgagee, who is accountable for the payment of so much of the inheritance tax as is not the liability of the purchaser or mortagee by virtue of the relief given by this section, shall not be liable for the payment of any amount in respect thereof in excess of the amount which is available to him for such payment by reason of there being, at the time when the interest comes into possession, other property, or an equity of redemption, or both, subject to the same trusts, under the disposition referred to in paragraph (c), as the property in which the interest in expectancy subsists; and</P>
    <P>(f)  nothing in section 35 (7) or (8) or section 47 (1) shall be construed as derogating from the relief given by this section to a purchaser or mortgagee.</P>
    <P>It was found that the original version of this section might be defective, in subsection (2) (a), because only the rates of death duties and not the general law in relation to death duties were mentioned.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, since a purchaser might be given relief by the section only to find that some other accountable party might have a right of reimbursement against him or a charge on the property purchased, it has been decided to extend the relief to persons other than the purchaser or mortgagee in certain cases and to prevent the relief given to a purchaser or mortgagee from being taken away under section 35 (7), 35 (8) or 47 (1). The additional persons protected would normally be the trustees of <Col N="1733" /> the settlement, who might have no other funds out of which to pay the tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this which is not clear to me and I should like the Minister to clarify it. It arises under paragraphs (d) and (e). Paragraph (d) provides that:</P>
      <P>Where such an interest is so mortgaged, any amount of inheritance tax payable in respect of the inheritance referred to in paragraph (b) and from the payment of which the mortgagee is relieved under this section, shall, notwithstanding the priority referred to in section 47 (1) rank, in relation to property charged with such tax under that section, as a charge subsequent to the mortgage.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that that implies that, although the mortgagee in this case is relieved, there can be a liability over and above the liability from which the mortgagee is relieved.  If that is so I am not clear how that situation can arise.  I should like the Minister to give an example of how this would work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have an example.  A by will leaves lands to B for life with remainder to C absolutely.  C expects to receive lands, now worth £40,000, on B's death; B is 65 in 1970 and may live another ten years; on the advice of an actuary, C values his reversion at, say, £20,000 taking into account death duties payable on B's death on the lands.  He raises a loan of £12,000 from D, assigning his remainder interest to D by way of security.  On B's death, the lands will normally be worth more than the total of (a) the inheritance tax payable by C; (b) the loan plus any unpaid interest thereon.</P>

    <P>If, however, this is not so, due to a sharp fall in the value of land or of securities if the land is sold and the proceeds reinvested&mdash;and the inheritance tax exceeds what would have been the death duty burden&mdash;at 1970 rates&mdash;this section protects the mortgagee by giving him priority for his mortgage over the charge for the excess of the inheritance tax over the death duty burden.  Accordingly, if (a) <Col N="1734" /> the lands realise only £20,000; (b) £15,000 is due on the mortgage&mdash;including interest; (c) £8,000 is due for inheritance tax; (d) £6,000 is the amount that would have been payable in death duties, the sum of £6,000 on account of inheritance tax is payable in the first instance, reducing the available funds to £14,000; the mortgagee's charge is given priority to the £2,000 balance of inheritance tax, so that he receives £14,000 of his entitlement of £15,000 and is relieved of the liability to pay the rest of the inheritance tax&mdash;he has, in effect, suffered a loss of £1,000.  Since the remainderman's equity of redemption&mdash;the difference between the value of his interest in the property and the amount due to the mortgagee&mdash;is worthless there is no person accountable for the balance of £2,000 tax, unless the remainderman is entitled to other property under the same trusts, for example, where the settlement included personalty or other lands as well as the interest mortgaged and such property also passed to the remainderman.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 62:</P>
      <P>62.  In page 44, before section 67, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>67.&mdash;(1) (a) In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;foreign tax&rdquo; means any tax which is chargeable under the laws of any territory outside the State and is of a character similar to estate duty, gift tax or inheritance tax;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;event&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) a death; or</P>
      <P>(ii)  any other event, by reference to which the date of the gift or the date of the inheritance is determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> (b) For the purposes of this section, a reference to property situate in a territory outside the State is a reference to property situate in that territory at the date of the gift or the date of the inheritance, as the case may be, or to property representing such property.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where the Commissioners are satisfied that a taxable gift or taxable inheritance, taken under a disposition by a donee or successor on the happening of any event, is reduced by the payment of foreign tax which is chargeable in connection with the same event under the same disposition in respect of property which is situate in the territory outside the State in which that foreign tax is chargeable, they shall allow a credit in respect of that foreign tax against the gift tax or inheritance tax payable by that donee or successor on that taxable gift or taxable inheritance; but such credit shall not exceed&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the amount of the gift tax or inheritance tax payable in respect of the same property by reason of such property being comprised in any taxable gift or taxable inheritance taken under the diposition on the happening of that event; or</P>
    <P>(b)  the amount of that foreign tax,</P>
    <P>whichever is the lesser.</P>
    <P>(3)  The provisions of this section shall be subject to any arrangement to which the force of law is given under section 66, and, if any such arrangement provides for the allowance of the amount of a tax payable in a territory outside the State as a credit against gift tax or inheritance tax, the provisions of the arrangement shall apply in relation to the tax payable in that territory in lieu of the provisions of subsection (2).</P>
    <P>(4)  If the amount of tax payable in respect of a taxable gift or taxable inheritance would be less by making a deduction (in ascertaining the taxable value of the taxable gift or taxable inheritance) of the amount of the foreign tax to which the taxable <Col N="1736" /> gift or taxable inheritance is subject than by making the allowance of a credit&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  under subsection (2); or</P>
    <P>(b)  under any arrangement to which the force of law is given under section 66.</P>
    <P>such deduction shall be made notwithstanding the provisions of section 18 (5) (b), and no such credit shall be allowed.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where the foreign tax in respect of property comprised in a taxable gift or a taxable inheritance taken under a disposition on the happening of an event is, under the terms of the disposition, directed to be paid out of a taxable gift or a taxable inheritance (taken under that disposition on the happening of the same event) other than the taxable gift or taxable inheritance out of which it would be payable in the absence of such a direction, then, for the purposes of subsection (2), the taxable gift or taxable inheritance out of which the foreign tax would be payable in the absence of such a direction, and no other taxable gift or taxable inheritance, shall be treated as reduced by the payment of the foreign tax.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give double taxation relief, by way of deduction of foreign tax from Irish tax, where property is taxed in a foreign country and in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The original section 67, which is being totally replaced, provided for a deduction of the foreign tax from the capital before assessment of Irish tax, a procedure which in most cases would afford considerably less relief. The alternative of an allowance against capital is kept open where greater relief would be obtained by choosing such an allowance.</P>
    <P>The relief afforded is in advance of, and will give way eventually to, bilateral relief negotiated by treaty or convention under section 66.  It is seen as a desirable interim unilateral relief and has counterparts in the new British Capital Transfer Tax, the US Federal Estate Tax and in the death duty systems of many other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> The amendment is a response to representations in the Dáil and elsewhere pointing to the hardship arising where double taxation occurs in the interim between the passing of the Act and the negotiation of a bilateral convention.  Even if the convention were backdated, a successor could be out of pocket for a substantial amount for a long period.  A double taxation situation arises where the taxable gift, or inheritance, consists in whole or part of foreign assets, that is, where the disponer is domiciled in the State or where the proper law of the disposition is Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain aspects of the Schedule with which I am less than happy.  I indicated earlier, <Col N="1739" /> both on Committee Stage and on an earlier Stage, certain views in this regard.  First, it is my contention that the upper limit whereby no tax is payable on a gift or inheritance by a child from a parent on a sum of up to £150,000&mdash;and where the same can apply to a number of members of the family, each receiving £150,000&mdash;is going too far, even allowing for the difficulties that arose under the death duty code.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it seems that at the lower end of the scale, the limits are too low in some instances and do not take account of some of the realities of life, particularly life in rural Ireland.  Various representations have been made in this regard and I should hope that on Report Stage there would be some amendments to the Schedule, particularly to the Tables in Part II.  Otherwise we shall have to give consideration to an amendment in regard to the upper limits in the later part of the Tables. However, at this stage I wish only to indicate that the Tables as they stand are not satisfactory and that we wish to be in a position, in the event of the Minister's failure to introduce amendments on Report Stage, to do so ourselves.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am clear regarding the Deputy's reference to the higher threshold of £150,000 but I am not clear as to the other point he is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me illustrate by referring to the fact that under Table IV tax is payable on an inheritance of £5,000 or more where a person is a stranger in blood.  In circumstances where it is represented that death duties have been abolished, many people will be shocked when they discover that they will have to pay inheritance tax on inheritances of £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Deputy cannot have it both ways. What we said, and I was the one who said it originally prior to the 1973 general election, was that in the case of the family&mdash;in cases where property was passing from one spouse to another <Col N="1740" /> or from parent to child&mdash;death duties would be abolished.  We have fulfilled that promise in this measure and that is why the thresholds are so high as to shock Deputy Colley.  Had we provided for lower thresholds, the Deputy would be telling us that, although we undertook to abolish death duties, we were not doing this.  When we said that death duties would be abolished we said also that they would be replaced by a small annual capital tax on the very wealthy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley seeks to make the point that those whom he regards as the very wealthy are being treated very lightly and that a man may make a gift of £150,000 to his wife and to each of several children without those gifts being liable to tax.  That may be so but that type of person is the one who, during his life, will have been paying wealth tax and, in that way, will have made his fair contribution to the Exchequer.  Therefore, the threshold of £150,000 is necessary in order to fulfil the promise made in our statement of policy.  It means, in effect, that death duties within the family are gone and that there is no substitution for them.</P>
      <P>In regard to the stranger there is a threshold of £5,000 and as the Deputy knows, under the old system, if the entire net estate amounted to £10,000, death duties were payable.  Now, a person can have a very substantial estate and distribute it by way of gifts of £5,000 each to several people who would be strangers in blood, without the estate being liable to duty.  In those circumstances I put it to the House that Part II of the Schedule of the Bill is reasonable and will be accepted generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that on this occasion I am more of the Minister's point of view than of my colleague's.  At the same time, the Deputy has a point.  Regarding the upper limits, I do not consider these to be excessive and the Minister's approach is acceptable in regard to the limits in Table I of Part II.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that at the beginning of this year, as measured against the dollar, for instance, the £ <Col N="1741" /> was somewhere in the region of 2.3 plus, whereas today it is down to something like 2.017.  The depreciation in the value of money and general inflation suggests that these limits not only are not exorbitant but are proving that.  The situation that brought about the principle situation in regard to the immediate family would become acute again.  I think what will happen in the future will be that pressure will come for a revision upwards of Table I.  I accept what the Minister has said with regard to Table IV but I think that, for instance, a brother and sister should be included in Table II rather than in Table III.  It is a very specific type of case that occurs in this country, that of a lone brother and sister who may be elderly or middle-aged, and there is a strong case for treating them as the family relationships visualised in Tables I and II are treated.  I accept what the Minister has said with regard to Table I and I understand the arguments he has made but I suggest that it might be practical to bring the case of a brother and sister into Table II rather than into Table III.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister did not get my point about the specific social case in this country.  By asking that question the Minister has prompted me to make a further comment.  Perhaps the key to this matter is to differentiate between dependency&mdash;but that can get messy&mdash;to recognise the close relationship between a brother and sister here, where they are socially more in the category of Table I than of Table IV.  I wonder what would be lost to the Revenue Commissioners if Tables II and III were amalgamated?  At any event I suggest that the case of a brother and sister be transferred to Table II and that Table III would apply only to a child of a brother or of a sister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> There is no doubt that the exemption granted here is more generous than the death duties provision.  The whole thinking behind the removal of death duties was to abolish them utterly and completely as far as the property passing from one spouse to another or from a parent to a child was concerned.  It is generally accepted that we have abolished them.  That was the assurance given and it was done.  In doing that we have also given very practical and substantial relief in regard to other categories, right down to strangers in blood.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera made the point, one that is often made here, with regard to brother and sister.  I can tell the Deputy that before I came into the House today I was discussing brother and sister in relation to another matter within my own Department and it was urged on me that they should be treated in the same way as a husband and wife are treated.  Deputy de Valera does not go that far.  He suggests that they be switched from Table III to Table II and that the threshold in their case should be £15,000 instead of £10,000. All I can say is that full consideration was given to this matter before the tables were drafted and the figures agreed.  The extent of that can be seen in that Deputy Colley thinks we have gone too far in Table I and that the threshold is too high, but he considers that the threshold is too low in Table IV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good to hear different views from the opposite side on a matter like this where human elements are involved and where we are dealing with the relationship of parents and children and brothers and sisters. However, the fact that we get different views from the opposite side perhaps bears out that the line I am taking is a kind of happy medium between the two views. <Col N="1743" /> Perhaps I have the right solution, which is to give the immediate family a very generous threshold and, while increasing the other threshold considerably, not to go as far as the Opposition suggests I should go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I agree with Deputy Colley that the thresholds in Table I are generous with regard to transfer from father to son or daughter, or from husband to wife.  However, we must consider the current rate of inflation and how property is affected. Today a property of £150,000 is not very excessive.</P>
      <P>I am not too concerned about Table I, but I am concerned about Table III.  The limits the Minister is proposing are completely out of line in comparison with those set out in Table I. In that table the Minister at least is making provision in another part of the Bill where the nephew stands in the place of a son or daughter. However in Table III where brother and sister are concerned, there is not the same provision as exists for the nephew with regard to the concession. I should like the Minister to consider some of the estates and properties in Ireland today.  I am sure the Minister is more aware than I am, especially in his legal profession, as to how some properties are held in this country. In agricultural and other types of property where the parents die and where the children are reasonably young the property or business is signed over to the eldest child for the purpose of taking out probate. It happens that members of a family who have not married do not get anything out of the farm or business although they have contributed substantially to its assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Table III the Minister is allowing an exemption of only £10,000.  I am particularly interested in this Schedule of the Bill.  I do not know how the Government or the Minister can justify that big gap where the nephew or niece can take the place of the son or daughter and be entitled to £150,000.  The only exemption given here is £10,000.  I <Col N="1744" /> am sure the Minister understands as well as I do how property is held throughout the country.  Now when the member of the family to whom the property has been entrusted dies there is no doubt but that that family will be broken up completely to meet the duties.  This will be worse than death duties, because provisions would be made in a situation like that after a certain number of years.  What is the situation where agreements are drawn up by the person holding the property that in the event of his death a certain annuity will be payable? An agreement could be in existence for a considerable length of time, that in the event of the person who holds the property dying, it would go to the brother or sister.  As far as I can see there is no provision for this.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to have a look at the thresholds.  If that section stands, it will be one of the reasons for the breaking up of many farms and businesses throughout the country.  I will go further than Deputy de Valera and say that this particular section should be brought as near as possible to Table I of the Bill.  I am not talking about a person that got his education out of a farm whether he is a doctor, dentist or lawyer or the brother or sister who got their portion when they left the farm.  I am talking about the brother and sister who should qualify because they have a genuine claim to that property.  The Minister, who is a professional man, should realise that a threshold of £10,000 is insufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Thinking about this, I can see an excellent social reason for having Table III as it is.  Deputy Fitzpatrick visualises a brother and sister living on a farm, not getting married, reaching old age, and then one of them dying, and the farm going to the other one who lives on there on his or her own having nobody to look after him or her and seeing the place run down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of these people&mdash;I do not say all-have nephews and nieces, and Rule 9 in Part I of the Second Schedule &mdash;this is the favoured nephew or niece section&mdash;will quite possibly encourage the old brothers and sisters who are <Col N="1745" /> there to bring in a nephew or a niece to live with them for the last few years of their lives or to bring them to live with them at the start of their getting on in years.  If they do that it will be a highly desirable situation for a number of reasons.  First of all, it is mostly land we are dealing with because we do not often find brothers and sisters living on in a business; it does arise but not so often as in the case of a farm.  If the generosity of Table I and the fact that Table III is not so generous encourages the brother and sister who have not married and who have nephews and nieces to bring a nephew and niece to live with them, it will mean the farm will be better run, that it will be kept in production, that there will be a youthful person there to do the work. It will be better for the old person or persons who have not got married, because they will have somebody to look after them in their declining years. They will have their own flesh and blood around the house and will not end up their days in an institution.  If it does that, I think it is a highly desirable social object.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick fears that Table III of this Schedule as it stands will mean that the farm will have to be divided up, that it will have to be sold for the purpose of paying this tax. That did not happen when death duties were applicable.</P>

He should bear in mind that if A owns a farm worth £60,000 and he has three brothers and sisters living on the place&mdash;and, indeed, even if they are not living on the place&mdash; if he dies and leaves one third to each of them, each of them takes £20,000, but that is reduced to £10,000 and there is no tax payable.  If the person with £20,000 dies later on and leaves the other two, there is no tax payable either.  I am convinced it is undesirable that brother and sisters should be encouraged to live on farms together, holding on to them until their dying day.  It is not good, first of all, for themselves because they will end up in loneliness, not in destitution because they may be well off, but they will end up in helpless loneliness or in an institution.  If this provision encourages them to bring some with and in to live with them, it will be doing excellent work.  I do not want to say this, but if Deputy Fitzpatrick was making a case for the extension of rule 9 to anybody in <i>loco parentis</i>, or to any child or any relative who was living there and to whom the disponer could be regarded as being in <i>loco parentis,</i> he would have a far better case.  The case that is always put up is the nephew or niece and that is why we dealt with it in paragraph (9).  I repeat that I think Part II of the Second Schedule, Tables I, II, III and IV are generous, are desirable, and I certainly would not agree to change them.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Would the Minister not consider making some differential between a brother or a sister who is not living on the farm and a sister who has lived on the farm all her life? Surely there must be some difference?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In many of the cases that Deputy Fitzpatrick is speaking of, you will find that the farm is not vested in one of them, that, perhaps, there was no will made, and that the brother and sister lived on there and acquired an absolute ownership in the land by long possession and each of them owned the land equally.  That is the <Col N="1747" /> position you will find in a great many of these cases.  Unfortunately, very often you will find that is why neither of them got married.  The old man died without making a will, the farm went to a brother and sister who were living there; the sister would not release the place to the brother to get married; he could not get married; and you have this unhappy state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the Minister himself may have said prior to the 1973 general election, I do not think he would seriously deny that the electorate understood, and were given to understand, that he and his colleagues proposed to get rid of death duties.  Given that understanding, a provision which obliges somebody who inherits property worth more than £5,000 to pay duty or tax is not what people understood the Minister said was going to be done. On the other hand, if the Minister says that what he really undertook to do was to abolish death duties in the case of inheritance in the family, that is, by a son from a father, or a daughter from a father or mother, he is not doing that either, because he has a limit of £150,000.  It seems to me that, whatever the Minister said, he is not doing it.  What the public were led to believe is not contained in the Schedule.  Whatever view may be taken by the Minister or anybody else, including Deputy de Valera, I still say that if the children of a wealthy man may each receive an inheritance or a gift from their father of £150,000 without paying any duty or tax, that is not a situation which I would favour or be prepared to defend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of what is being done in this Schedule, and the liability being imposed on other categories, and the Minister's statement that death duties were being abolished at least within the family, one has to remember what is also being done, which is, the imposition of wealth tax and the imposition of capital gains tax and, under this Bill, the imposition of a gift tax as distinct from an inheritance tax <Col N="1748" /> which is the equivalent of death duty, in circumstances quite different from those in which duty was payable under the death duty code.  To get it into context one has to bear these things in mind.</P>
    <P>Whether the persons benefiting under this upper limit of £150,000 in Table I are liable to wealth tax makes no difference in my view as to the extent of the exemptions being given.  It seems to me to be quite inconsistent with the approach adopted in relation to the other tables and, in particular, the kind of cases described by Deputy Fitzpatrick of this party, the nephew or niece living his or her life on the farm.  It seems to me that the treatment of such a person under Part II of the Schedule is very harsh to say the least.  The case he made is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>There is some truth in what the Minister said&mdash;I freely admit that&mdash; about the social desirability of people being encouraged not to hold on to the farm and not to live out their lives to the end alone.  Other considerations come into it.  I do not want to go over all of them now.  In his other capacity, that is, other than substituting for the Minister for Finance as he is at the moment, in his capacity as Minister for Lands, the Minister is probably more familiar with this problem than most of us and recognises that, in order to achieve the kind of desirable social objective he was outlining, it cannot and, indeed, should not be done by way of severe penalty, and that is what is being done in this part of the Schedule. Quite a severe financial penalty is being imposed.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge the Minister to think again at least about that part of the Schedule between now and Report Stage and to see if it is possible to devise an improvement in relation to the kind of case outlined by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  It is not, as he said, a case for all nephews and nieces but refers to particular circumstances.</P>

      <P>Not only has the factor of inflation or depreciation in money values to be taken into account but we must also have regard to the fact that the reliefs given here are the inclusive reliefs.  Here again I differ from Deputy Colley's interpretation.  The way Deputy Colley talks about exemptions of £150,000 to each child suggests that it is a pecuniary £150,000 but it is not.  In relation to wealth tax the house is exempted and an acre is exempted.  There are also other exemptions, such as the agricultural exemptions.  In this Bill these tables are inclusive and there is no exemption for the family dwelling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there is no exemption for the dwelling.  Therefore, having regard to property values and a lot of things we need not go into, this is a strong case for not diminishing any of the levels in any of the tables and a particularly strong case for increasing the level for brother and sister in the category that both Deputy Fitzpatrick and I have advocated.  Although, as Deputy Colley says, there is something to be said for the Minister's point, I would like to change the emphasis slightly. Deputy Fitzpatrick rightly put it on the agricultural sector and what was happening in the country.  This is very close but he, who represents a Dublin constituency the same as I do, will realise that there are many cases in this city where a brother and a sister are living together in a house.  They may have been, until inflation hit them, reasonably comfortable but completely dependent on their investment income.  Under the wealth tax they are within the threshold for the house and so forth but when death <Col N="1750" /> hits that protection is gone.  These are analogous cases to the agricultural case the Minister was talking about.</P>
      <P>The Minister could extend his argument into that sphere.  Although it seems that the subsequent Tables II and III are a little out of proportion, if the Minister were to reconsider even amalgamating those tables there would be a great improvement.  I do not know, in relation to the Revenue Commissioners, how much is to be captured.  For the sake of a tidy scheme, if there was not a lot involved for the Revenue Commissioners, it might be worth the Minister's while considering how far he could merge Table II into Table III. This would effect a substantial improvement because not only would the threshold be raised but the percentages chargeable are more favourable in Table II than in Table III. That is why I approach the matter in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to say a few words in regard to Deputy Colley's line of argument.  I suppose it would have been too much to hope that we would see the end of the Committee Stage of this Bill without the political line of thought creeping into it.  Deputy Colley introduced it and that is understandable.  I fail to see the logic in his argument.  He says here that the threshold of £150,000 for the child of a wealthy man is too high, that it should be reduced and that capital acquisitions tax should be payable at some unspecified lower threshold.  I presume, if he is going to interfere with it at all, he would reduce it substantially.  I fail to understand that argument from Deputy Colley because I heard his argument on the wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time the Deputy objected to a man with property of practically £250,000 in the agricultural field, which is the one we are discussing mostly here, being called on to pay a small wealth tax notwithstanding that the law, as it then stood, enabled that man to arrange his affairs so that on his death he would not be liable for any capital tax either, if he was lucky enough to transfer his property <Col N="1751" /> to his family.  He would escape death duties, if he transferred his property five years before he died.  There you had a man who had property valued at nearly £250,000 being asked to pay a small annual payment.  Deputy Colley argued that he should not have been called on to pay that although the same man could escape death duties.</P>
    <P>When we come in here and in Table I seek to give an exemption up to £150,000 per child to a man who has been paying wealth tax&mdash;it is likely such a man would be paying it, certainly if he is spreading it around a few children he would have been paying wealth tax, which Deputy Colley says he should not have been paying and it is harsh to ask him to pay it&mdash;he says we are too generous with him, that we should ask him to pay 10 per cent or 15 per cent at a much lower rung of the ladder.  I do not see the logic in that.  I suppose it is true, when you are in Opposition, you do not always have to be logical. You can make such argument as suits you at the particular time.  That is all I want to say about Deputy Colley's argument.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, before the last general election, I spoke on television about the abolition of death duties.  There is no doubt in my mind, and I know the record will prove it, that I specifically spoke about property passing from a husband to a wife and property passing from a parent to children.  That was the type of death duty situation I was talking about and that was the undertaking I gave.  By and large, we are substantially carrying out that promise. Deputy Colley does not want to let me do it because he wants to reduce the threshold and then he could say I did not carry out that promise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying if the Minister made that promise he would have no threshold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We are doing it and nobody is complaining except Deputy Colley.  I made this argument before.  Before the last general election there were people with moderate means, such as <Col N="1752" /> farmers, who were living in terror of the infliction that death duties would be on their families when they died. They were living in terror of that.  In regard to Table II, III and IV of the Schedule, no undertaking was given about death duties.  There was no promise, election or otherwise, made about death duties.  The position has been greatly improved here.  If these thresholds are not generous enough, and if the situation at the time demands that it should be changed, there is a Finance Act introduced annually which provides the machinery for changing these thresholds to deal with the prevailing conditions.</P>
      <P>If a person is making gifts to complete strangers those strangers have no call on the bounty of the disponer and it is not unreasonable that they should be called upon to pay tax at the rate mentioned.  The further one gets away from the family the less claim the collateral relatives have on the bounty of the person.  Very often the best way to get Irish country people to do things is to make it worth their while to do so for one reason or another.  Those who live in the country know that the reason why farms were transferred to sons, daughters, nephews or nieces was to qualify for the old age pension.  That has been done down the years, even if the old age pension was not worth looking for.  It encouraged people to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People do not like parting to the State; they do not like paying taxes, death duties or seeing their property going to the State.  They do not like the idea of a substantial portion of their property, when they die, going to the State.  In my opinion this will encourage them to make provision for themselves in their old age by bringing a nephew or a niece in to live with them.  The person concerned does not have to live with them.  If the farm is big enough he or she can build a bungalow on the farm.  Under the terms of the condition they do not even have to transfer the property to the nephew or the niece during his or her lifetime in order to take advantage of the benefit in paragraph 9.  It is sufficient if the nephew <Col N="1753" /> or niece have been living with them for five years prior to the death.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9 states that in any case where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the donee or successor is a nephew or niece of the disponer who has worked substantially on a fulltime basis for the period of 5 years ending on the date of the gift or the date of the inheritance in carrying on, or assisting in the carrying on of, the trade, business or profession or the work of or connected with the office or employment of the disponer; and</P>
    <P>(b)  the gift or inheritance consists of property which was used in connection with such trade, business, profession, office or employment or of shares in a company owning such property,</P>
    <P>then for the purposes of section 19 (6) and for the purpose of computing the tax payable on the gift or inheritance, the donee or successor shall be deemed to bear to the disponer the relationship of a child.</P>
    <P>That is an excellent provision.  It does not even make it obligatory; they can have a trial period.  The nephew or niece can stay there for six months or <Col N="1754" /> one year and if they do not agree they can take themselves away again.  They are not tied to each other.</P>
    <P>The position is likely to work satisfactorily when they are not tied to each other.  Often when a person transfers his or her property to a child, nephew or niece, the child, nephew or niece finds himself or herself in authority and differences arise but here it can be done on a voluntary basis.  If they are not getting on together the nephew or niece can leave and there is no harm done.  If the nephew or niece live on for five years he or she is deemed, for the purposes of this Bill, to be a child and the threshold of £150,000 applies.  After the trial period, if they are getting on well, an outright transfer can be made.  The idea behind all this is highly desirable.</P>

      <P>The person concerned did not furnish any evidence of unemployment between 22nd October, 1975 and 1st December, 1975.  He made a renewed claim for unemployment benefit on 2nd December, 1975 and payment has been made to him from that date.  Payments will continue as they fall due.  Inquiries regarding the earlier period are proceeding.  The question of payment of unemployment assistance does not arise at this stage.</P>

      <P>A claim for unemployment benefit made by the person concerned on 19th September, 1975 was disallowed by a decision of a deciding officer.  In addition to his insurable employment the insured person is a farmer.  Statutory regulations provide that where a person has another occupation, as in this case, from which the remuneration or profit is more than £1 per day he cannot be paid unemployment benefit unless at least 78 employment contributions have been paid in respect of him in a given period of three years prior to his claim.  In this <Col N="1612" /> case the estimated profit from the farm is above the statutory maximum and the claimant does not satisfy the contribution requirement mentioned.  He has been advised of his right to appeal against the deciding officer's decision but he has not so far done so.</P>

    <P>(1)  Gross income is taken as income as computed for income tax purposes, that is, after deduction of superannuation and social welfare contributions and expenses, but before deduction of personal allowances and reliefs.</P>
    <P>(2)  Gross income for 1965/66 and the later years has been adjusted in each case to take account of the increases in the Consumer Price Index since 1960/61.</P>

      <P>An average enrolment of at least 70 children would be necessary to warrant the retention of a third teacher at this school.  The present enrolment is only 58 and I am advised that this figure is likely to increase to no more than 62 in the coming school year.  Since there appears to be no prospect of the school obtaining an average enrolment of 70 in the foreseeable future, I regret that the retention of a third teacher would not be warranted.</P>
