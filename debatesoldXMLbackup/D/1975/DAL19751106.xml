    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I was referring to a development within the RTE Authority or within the production of home-produced programmes. The Members of this House, when it comes to light-hearted <Col N="1032" /> programmes, come in for a fair share of stick from characters in RTE.  They have been looked upon down the years as fair game and politicians on all sides are criticised.  On the morning radio programme, the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo;, the compere has a go at politicians in general and very often he can be personal.  The impression is conveyed to the public that all politicians are in the business for what they can get out of it.  During crossfire in this House Members from this side have had occasion, justifiably in recent times, to attack Government Ministers on certain appointments made but it is a bit thick from a politician's point of view to have to listen to the innuendoes and various side swipes at them by these &ldquo;intelligent men&rdquo; and &ldquo;intelligent commentators&rdquo; in RTE.  They love pointing the finger at the son, daughter, first cousin or niece of a politician who gets fixed up and claim that that person would not have procured the appointment were it not for the fact that he had a relation in Leinster House.</P>
      <P>We all have to be a little thickskinned in this regard but I find it objectionable to hear comments from these people who engage in the old club mentality in connection with the production of home produced programmes. There is a lot of this inbuilt self projection and this inbuilt holding down of opportunities for their own.  Once one becomes a member of Actors Equity or the NUJ within that institution it appears that one has a passport to quite an amount of pickings on the side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the home produced programmes are very attractive and I find the word game &ldquo;Password&rdquo; very interesting.  The two contestants have to guess so many words on cards within a minute.  There is a prize to be won.  I find the programme quite attractive.  The individuals who give the clues are selected from within the club and, while they can win prizes themselves, they are obviously also being presented with appearance time money.  I hate that kind of operation and I hate to see people getting away with it, people who are very quick to have a go at the establishment <Col N="1033" /> here and at how well able we are at looking after ourselves, according to them.  It is clearly a case of people in glasshouses being very anxious to throw stones in the belief that they themselves are free of offending. Some of these people may decide that this is sour grapes on the part of the Deputy because he has the advantage, or disadvantage, or having no brother or sister to get fixed up. Of course another disadvantage is being a spoiled only child.  I find the whole thing irritating.  None of us is without sin and I object to sinners having a go at us.</P>
    <P>The Frank Hall programme is very popular and the Minister can absolve himself from any blame in regard to influencing the programme or being responsible in any way for what Frank Hall says on his programme.  I believe we should have more of these programmes. On the other hand, whoever directs that programme uses the Ballymagash council to have a go at the Government and at politicians.  It is supposed apparently to be a miniature version of the standard county council meeting.  In fact it is designed to have a go at politicians for being so good to themselves.  It can be described as an enjoyable programme but the general public, who are not professional politicians, will accept that there is 90 to 95 per cent of hard cold truth in the programme.  All I am pointing out is that there is no point in these people preaching at us or aiming at generating a certain public opinion for the purpose of downgrading politicians and creating the impression that politicians are as bad as those taking part in the programme say they are to each other while, at the same time, in the RTE establishment there is day-in and day-out evidence of so much back-scratching &mdash;&ldquo;You scratch my back and I will scratch yours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I deliberately reported progress the last night because I felt I did not have enough time at my disposal to draw attention to this.  I object to being lectured.  We are hard enough on each other here within this establishment but overall I think we can regard ourselves as both honest and honourable. <Col N="1034" /> In my time here in the last 15 years I have done my utmost to make the country, particularly the constituency I represent, a little better.  I do not like to be classed as a vulture living off society.  The people who produce these programmes should take a look in the mirror before deciding to be as rough as they apparently like to be on politicians.</P>
    <P>I believe a number of the amendments in this Bill are unnecessary.  The idea is to bring up to date the 1960 Act.  When one examines the amendments one finds that most of them are amendments for the sake of amendment to justify statements made by the present Minister down through the years.  In the light of the experience we have had over the last 15 years I believe those who drafted the original Bill are to be congratulated.</P>

      <P>As one who comes from a multiple channel television area I should like to make a few remarks about this Bill.  The survey is over and the Minister has accepted its findings.  On this occasion the public did not ask for Barabbas.  They thought differently and, once more, another man has found himself in a position in which, by looking into his own heart, he was unable to decide what the Irish people wanted.  From the beginning I could not understand how it could be seriously proposed we should broadcast BBC 1 at our expense and without any control whatsoever. The idea was most unacceptable to me.  Other speakers have gone into the arguments for and against at length.  From my point of view I thought one of the most presumptious arguments made for BBC 1 by people in Limerick, Cork and Galway was that, because I and people like me had three channels, two of which we were not paying for, they should get this amenity and I and others as taxpayers should be asked to contribute to providing this amenity for them. To me, this was bringing the argument to an extreme.  Those areas have other amenties.  They are centres of higher education.  They have hospitals and railway stations.  If the people in my area, in Carrick-on-Shannon, Boyle and Drumshanbo, demanded <Col N="1035" /> from the Government that we should have all those facilities or amenities just because the people of Galway and Cork and Limerick have them, we would be laughed out of existence and considered most unreasonable.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister encouraged them in their selfishness at a time when the country was in grave economic difficulty.  When I read that the Minister had appeared in those areas, I thought what a much better contribution he would be making to the economy if he had been there asking and encouraging the Irish people to buy Irish goods so that more Irish people would be kept in employment.</P>
      <P>I have said I could not accept the broadcasting of BBC 1 at our expense and without our control.  That does not mean I would deprive the people who want it of it.  If they want it, is it not possible for a commercial company, by making a subvention to the State, to broadcast those signals into those areas and let the people who want them pay for them?  In this way a more equitable situation would be brought about.  I think it is correct to say that the Minister still has ideas along those lines.  The years may prove that this cannot be prevented by virtue of the fact that so many more signals will be made available by satellite, and so on. This may be so, but the electronic age is so strange that probably, by that time, somebody will have succeeded in inventing something which will block the signals within a certain distance of their emission.  I read recently that something has been invented which interferes with bugging and makes it ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that the object of his Bill is to expand the interests and area of television and to increase its autonomy.  One of the obvious extensions, of course, is a second television channel.  This is badly needed to give people a choice of Irish programmes, and it would do a great deal towards making RTE more acceptable to the viewers.  Broadcasting a selection of programmes from other stations will prove much more attractive to viewers in the long run and <Col N="1036" /> people who advocated this from the beginning will be justified.</P>
    <P>I have not got a great deal of time to watch television but when three programmes such as &ldquo;Poldark&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; and &ldquo;Upstairs, Downstairs&rdquo; are televised at the same time it is difficult to decide which to watch.  The same thing applies to the &ldquo;Late, Late Show&rdquo; and &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo;.  From my inquiries and observations, I have a feeling that if &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo; had been televised, as it is now being televised, there would have been very little demand for BBC 1.  However, there are many programmes which could be taken from other channels which are of an informative nature, and it would be of advantage to viewers to see them.  On the other hand, there are many other programmes which are not worth watching and which are certainly of no advantage to children.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister seemed to place on RTE a duty to break down the differences in the cultures of the people of this island.  He put forward the laudable objectives, with which nobody in his sane senses could disagree, of peace, harmony and prosperity for the whole island.  He also referred to control of the areas between us.  In the beginning there was a suggestion that we would broadcast into the North in exchange for BBC 1.  As the debate went on, this seemed to have been lost sight of. Assuming there is some development between the use of RTE 2 and what is referred to as Television 4 in the North, how far will that get us?  We cannot force the viewers in the North to look at our channels.  This is one of the big weaknesses in the Minister's argument to the effect that RTE should take on this job.  Even though I make that point, the Minister's objective is praiseworthy.</P>
    <P>Reading the Minister's speech and, indeed, reading his recent book, one gets the overall impression that he continues to place all the blame for the ills and the differences in the two communities on the people down here.  He continues to suggest we are the people who should make all the advances and make all the surrenders, although &ldquo;surrender&rdquo; is a very bad <Col N="1037" /> word to use in such a context.  The present happenings seem to indicate that very little advance has been made on the opposite side, and that a position of absolute intransigence had been taken up from the time of Terence O'Neill up to the News last night, when it was indicated that there was some changed thinking among the Loyalists in the North with regard to the documents they will send to Westminster.</P>
    <P>RTE 2 will also provide extra work for Irish actors who, I understand, are running into very difficult times. They seem to have many difficulties compared with other people, even in times of prosperity.  It was a pity to see Irish actors and actresses on BBC taking part in programmes which one feels they would hate to do but for the fact that their bread and butter was concerned.  I have no doubt they would be delighted to be at home here making their talents available to the Irish people.  Some of the people I am thinking of have a lot to offer to us and would help to fill the vacuum which exists in RTE.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that his other objective was to give RTE more autonomy.  This is a controversial area.  Even though he sets out this as an objective he retains the authority of the previous section 31, now section 17 and, to my mind, rightly so. He transfers the power from the Minister to the Houses of the Oireachtas. This may be a laudable exercise but in practice it is not likely to make much difference because, if the Minister and the Government decide that something is a necessary activity, they will have a majority in the Houses to put their proposals through.</P>
    <P>The question of partisanship and impartiality was also mentioned.  This is a very subjective area.  At times we are all delighted with some RTE programme and at other times we are very annoyed.  It must be said that on occasion some of the interviewers poke very hard at some interviewees whereas, in dealing with other interviewees, just at the psychological moment they are prepared to let them off the hook.  I do not think that is right because it shows they are partial in dealing with the particular <Col N="1038" /> problem.  It may be purely subjective and it is quite possible that there is no other way of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's broadcasting complaints commission may help in some way to reduce those incidents.  One wonders how this commission will work in actual practice and with how many complaints they are likely to have to deal.  Obviously, this cannot be a full time job.  There is also the question of whether oral evidence will be taken or whether it will be just a question of writing in to them and they will deal with the complaints by correspondence. It might be no harm if the commission came on television once a year and answered questions in detail explaining why they gave particular decisions.  In this way they would become more involved in television.</P>
    <P>Overall I am satisfied with RTE.  I get much more information from and spend more time listening to the radio than watching television because I spend so much time in my car.  I find many radio programmes most informative. There is one little thing which is probably peculiar to me and to people like me.  I am one of those people who has no organised time.  I come and I go.  I am interrupted when I am watching television or listening to the radio. There are times when I come in in the middle of a programme and the interviewer closes off the programme without indicating to whom he was talking and there are times when I would love to know who was expressing those views.  At the end of each programme the interviewer should say: &ldquo;Goodnight Mr. or Mrs. So-and-so.  Thank you.&rdquo;  In this way I would be aware of who said what I was listening to.</P>
    <P>There is also a tendency to ape British humour to a certain extent. This is a pity.  Irish humour is different. We have Irish humourists and, as I have said already, some of them have to go across the channel to earn a living.  The second channel should bring them back.  One hopes that this development will be based, as the Minister has stated, on our own culture. This would be much more acceptable to us and it will be one way of keeping our people interested in their <Col N="1039" /> own television channel rather than switching over to another.</P>
    <P>Another matter which strikes me from time to time is that the GAA games, apart from the bigger events, do not get enough time on television. This seems to be a running sore between the GAA and RTE.  It is said that people interested in the GAA overplay their hand and are too demanding. I do not think that is right.  This is one area in which some of our culture could be further developed.  Irish games are under a great deal of pressure now particularly with &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo; coming in on the other channels.</P>
    <P>The Minister also interested himself in the language in giving extra duties to RTE.  This indicates that there is a great deal of work for a second channel too.  One hopes they will have the personnel and the money to do what is suggested.  The Minister mentioned other small matters which are of some importance.  He mentioned the fact that he was taking extra powers to deal with interference.  This is very important because there are many areas in which the television signal is not strong enough.  I suppose this is the fault of RTE.  In other areas the signal is interfered with by electrical equipment.  To a certain extent this is probably the fault of consumers who installed electrical equipment without consulting the ESB.  Nevertheless, there should be an obligation on the ESB to take an interest in this and the person who is in a position to bring this about is the Minister.  Motorcars running outside one's house can also cause interference.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to giving more freedom to RTE to publish books, magazines and so on dealing with their programmes.  This is laudable.  I expect what he has in mind is something like the Davis lectures.  There are programmes one would like to see turned out in book form so that one could have a further look at them.  I should like the Minister to comment on the availability of scripts to listeners or viewers.  If you hear a particular programme and you write in to RTE would the full script be available?  The fact that they are kept for 60 days suggests <Col N="1040" /> to me that they should be available. Perhaps they might be made available on payment of a few pence.</P>
    <P>As I said, the radio is the medium I use most.  Overall it is very attractive from the point of view of information as distinct from education.  I would hope that whatever developments take place the radio will not be forgotten and that they will continue to broadcast the many worth-while programmes which are to be heard on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has placed before RTE the objective of trying to break down the difficulties in our culture. I hope he will not exert too much personel pressure to see they are broken down at a price which we in this section of the country will have to pay and without a contribution from the northern section.  Everybody in this House and outside it must agree with him that, if he achieves his objectives of peace, harmony and prosperity and if radio and television make a contribution this Bill will be very worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by welcoming the new Fianna Fáil spokesman on Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, and to congratulate him on his constructive contribution to this debate which was, I think, his first major contribution in this area.  His contribution, though a very good one, was not fully representative of the views expressed from the benches opposite in this debate and in some ways ran counter to some of the more weighty of these views.  I shall come back to that in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate here differed from the debate in the Seanad in some important ways, though it was similar in others.  It was similar in that both debates were conducted in a thoughtful, constructive and courteous way, which is something we ought to be able to take for granted and may increasingly do so in the future.  We, perhaps, cannot entirely do so yet. But that was so, and these were long and useful debates which I believe will be consulted in the future with interest by people interested in the <Col N="1041" /> history of broadcasting and, indeed, of culture generally in the country. There were also interesting differences both in relation to the areas of what might be called national culture and in the area of autonomy and security, the autonomy of RTE and the question of the relation of that autonomy to the security of the State and to the role of the Government.</P>
    <P>First of all, as regards culture, I think it fair to say that in the Seanad there was more defensive emphasis on the need to protect our national culture.  This was partly so by reason of the fact that section 6 was then before that House in a sense in which it is not before this House now. However, I do not think it is entirely accounted for by that, because many speakers here did refer to the question of a second channel, as it was natural that they should do.  They went over the whole second channel debate in retrospect, as they were perfectly entitled to do, so that whatever might be thought in that area could find expression in both Houses. As one of the few people, perhaps the only person, who has sat through the entirety of both debates, apart from the officials, I was struck by the fact that in the Dáil hardly anyone spoke about the need to protect our culture. The value of pluralism was generally taken for granted; that it should be exposed to these signals from outside was seen as a good rather than a bad thing.</P>
    <P>This was not true of all the contributions. Deputy Callanan, for example, spoke in a different sense, but his was what I would call a very gentle and sincere form of cultural protectionism, as one would expect from that Deputy.  He was concerned lest old values be disturbed, and I think that concern of his, so voiced, is a legitimate and proper part of our culture, and it is proper that it should find expression here.  On the whole the tendency of our debate in this House was not exclusionist, whereas several interventions in the Seanad were strongly so, speaking of broadcasting coming in here almost as if it were some dread contagion that ought to be kept out.  That may be due to the <Col N="1042" /> fact that some Senators, by reason of the character of the House, are less in touch with the mood of the people than all of us have to be here.  We may be wrong, as I have sometimes been wrong myself, in our estimates of what exactly the people want, for example, whether they want a selection channel, a multiple channel such as RTE 2, or BBC 1.  However, we all know that people in the single-channel area want more choice and want access to broadcasting from outside, and that knowledge was reflected in our debate here.</P>
    <P>The other difference concerned this question of autonomy and security. In my opening statement in the Seanad I devoted considerable time to the reasons for and the need for some degree of State oversight of broadcasting and the need to localise this more in Parliament than in Government as a protection against arbitrary power.  Expecting there, criticism on the side that there should be less control, less censorship, I devoted a good deal of time in introducing that measure&mdash;there described as a measure of moderate liberalisation&mdash;to the justification for a degree of State control over broadcasting.  The criticism I anticipated did materialise there to a considerable extent, principally from the, as it was then, three independent Senators, who made a very valuable contribution to the debate there.  I am glad to say in parentheses that one of them is no longer an independent Senator but a member of the Labour Party.  I do not know whether he actually saw the light during that debate, but anyway there he is and we are very happy to find him on our side in that House, and hope that at some future time we may find him here on these benches where he would be capable of making a very valuable contribution in this and other areas.  I refer, of course, to Senator Horgan.</P>
    <P>As I said, that criticism on the ground of too much State control did emerge there, not very much from the Fianna Fáil Opposition in the Seanad.  In the main, with certain exceptions, the drift of their criticism of the Bill tended to be that there <Col N="1043" /> was really nothing in the Bill except section 6, that the other changes were cosmetic, meaningless and so on.</P>
    <P>The debate here on this matter took quite a different turn.  This is the most significant aspect of it. There are signs that the Opposition have not made up their collective minds on that matter which is the main sense of this Bill.  The Bill aims to strengthen the autonomy of RTE under the Oireachtas.  Do we want to strengthen the autonomy of RTE or do we not?  That is the question.</P>
    <P>I will come back in some more detail to the various remarks later. At the moment I am just concerned with general trends.  The Fianna Fáil spokesman, Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, spoke rather in the vein of one who wished to liberalise, to give RTE more scope, not less.  In particular, he wanted the relevant sections not to use the words: &ldquo;tendency to undermine the authority of the State&rdquo; but to use the word &ldquo;undermine&rdquo; which gives RTE more scope and the State somewhat less.  However, it appeared that in this, as in some other matters, the utterances of a Fianna Fáil spokesman are not necessarily the best guide to what his party may be actually thinking and the direction in which they would like to move if they had power.</P>
    <P>One can reasonably say, without being invidious, that the three weightiest interventions in this debate were those of Deputy Joe Brennan, Deputy Vivion de Valera and Deputy Paddy Lalor.  They were weighty, not merely because of the individual capacity of these Members, but because of their status.  Deputy Brennan speaks as deputy leader of his party and as a former Minister of Posts and Telegraphs.  Deputy Paddy Lalor also speaks as a former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  They were the only two former Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs who spoke in this debate. Of course, we know the reason why the attendance has perhaps necessarily been rather thin on this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera speaks with the authority of one who has more control in the area of the media than any <Col N="1044" /> Deputy, not excluding the Minister, because he controls one of the most important newspaper chains in the country.  What these three Deputies have to say has to be heard with particular attention.  The thrust of the remarks of all three of them was rather strongly against the extension of further autonomy through this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan spoke&mdash;again I will come back to his remarks in a moment&mdash;in the sense that the Minister or somebody appointed by him or directly responsible to him should view certain programmes in advance. When I come back to the detail of this I will cite the place and the actual words.  When I interrupted him, which I am sorry I did but I needed clarification, to ask whether what he had in mind was pre-censorship he said in a very candid and straightforward way &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, that is what he did mean.</P>
    <P>Pre-censorship would mean going back to the earliest practice before what I would refer to as the Childers reforms, which were, of course, the great extension of broadcasting autonomy in the country to the system which prevailed before that when there was a very strict, detailed and constrictive State censorship on RTE.  Apparently, Deputy Brennan would like to see that back.  He is a man who weighs his words and I am sure he did not make that suggestion lightly.  I am sure he means it.  That is a rather serious matter.  In connection with that I noticed, when I praised the structure of the Act which I am now amending, there was an affirmative response from the benches opposite but when I mentioned the role of the late President Childers in reforming the structure in the sense of granting greater autonomy there was no similar affirmative response to that although in fact the reforms of Minister Childers, as he then was, were really the important things. They preceded the Bill and are enshrined in the Bill but the move was made by him.</P>
    <P>Now, it appears that there is a tendency on those benches to go back behind that.  I am not sure just how serious that tendency is.  I hope this may become clarified as the Bill goes through Committee when we see if <Col N="1045" /> there are attempts to amend or oppose certain sections.  The most important section in this Bill is section 2 which deprives the Minister of the power to dismiss a member of the Authority and, of course, by inference, the Authority itself, and vests that power in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this is a cosmetic Bill but there is nothing cosmetic about this provision and the various provisions that link with it and constitute together a structure which very greatly strengthens the economy of RTE as an institution of public service broadcasting under limited and weighted State control. Both Deputy de Valera and Deputy Lalor saw that with a clarity with which their Seanad colleagues did not see it.  They were not on the line, in relation to section 2, that it was cosmetic, meaningless or unnecessary.  I will come back later to the detailed quotations from their speeches.  If I may, I would like at this point, to refer simply to them generally.  The attitude they took was that this section unwisely limited the power of the Minister to dismiss the Authority. Deputy Lalor specifically linked that with the decision of my predecessor, Deputy Collins, who unfortunately was not able to participate in this debate, to dismiss an entire Authority.</P>
    <P>In this matter the penny has dropped, that is to say, that these Deputies who are among the most sensitive to media questions, among the most aware of what is involved in power over media, have realised what some Senators, less involved in the party political process, did not, I think, fully realise.  They did not realise, that this is a provision which means not merely that I, Conor Cruise-O'Brien, who happens to be Minister now, am divesting myself of a particular power, but that I am depriving future Ministers of it by means of a Bill which will be extremely inconvenient to repeal if anyone wants to do so.  That is where the shoe pinches.</P>
    <P>We, on these benches, may not think, and do not think, that Fianna Fáil have much to worry about here because we hold the view that it is <Col N="1046" /> likely to be a very long time before there is a Fianna Fáil Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or a Fianna Fáil Minister for anything.  That is our view but we can understand that Deputies opposite may well take a different view and if they do, what they see in this section, what Deputy Lalor most clearly sees, and Deputy de Valera also, is that if this Bill is passed no future Minister, not Deputy Collins himself, should he come back here as Minister, will have the power to do what Deputy Collins did, that is, to dismiss an entire authority without a by your leave from anyone.  In future a Minister will have to come before this House and, as these Deputies pointed out quite shrewdly, it might not be easy to get such an order through this House.  That is quite true. Deputy de Valera, in particular, made a case which is not to be taken lightly, and I do not take it lightly, against this section of the Bill.  What was most apparent is, what I think will be apparent to the public from the opposition voiced to that section&mdash; which was only voiced and I do not know whether it will be expressed in the form of an amendment, which I rather doubt but it has been expressed here in words and those words make it quite clear&mdash;that this is an important Bill.  It is important because it strengthens the autonomy of Radio Telefís Éireann and its authority, strengthens the autonomy of public service broadcasting in this country and because it curtails arbitrary power.  One of the great facts in the progress of democratic and liberal legislation has been precisely this, the progressive curtailment of the possibility of arbitrary power.  This goes back a very long way.  I think the Government can claim for this Bill that it is, in its own small but not insignificant way, a part of that great process.  For that reason, as in all ages, there is some degree of resistance to it except that it becomes more difficult to avow such opposition.</P>
    <P>Therefore we ought to be grateful to those two Deputies, and to Deputy Brennan also, for bringing things out in the open that are not often exposed. Deputy de Valera, in particular, has a <Col N="1047" /> mind which is unfashionable.  I think he will be pleased with that description. I do not think he would wish to be regarded as fashionable or trendy and I think he has very grave doubts, perhaps about democracy itself, certainly about liberal values; he speaks about what he calls &ldquo;corrosive liberalism&rdquo;.  When I say he has doubts about those things, I mean he has doubts; I am not accusing him of being anti-democratic, or indeed accusing him of anything, but I think the trend of his mind is in that general direction.  He made a most interesting and important speech and I should like to come back to that, as also to the speech of Deputy Lalor.  Both those speeches were made rather late on Tuesday evening.  For that reason, and because of the technical possibilities and limitations of the media, they were not as fully reported as I believe they deserved to be.</P>
    <P>I should now like to come to the general course of the debate and to deal, as far as I can, with the various points made in so far as it is appropriate to do so.  Apart from the matter which I touched on there&mdash;the question of the conflict, if you like, between the requirements of autonomy and those of security&mdash;three main areas were touched on in the course of the debate.  One was the question of the second channel and its use.  The second area was points made on various sections of the Bill which there will be an opportunity of considering further in Committee.  The third was points of programming.</P>
    <P>On the question of the second channel I would like to be reasonably brief in my answering because this is a debate which, as the country knows, has been very thoroughly conducted, indeed unusually widely, at unusual length and with an unusual degree of media participation, due to its nature. Some have said, and there is merit in the point, that there is too much being said about the second channel and such matters and not enough about more important matters.  I would certainly accept that there are many more important and pressing problems <Col N="1048" /> facing this country.  That is beyond doubt.  But it so happens that this is a Bill about broadcasting and, therefore, it is appropriate to talk about broadcasting on it.  It is for the media themselves to decide how much attention they will give to such a debate.  So I do not think we here can be justly blamed for devoting our time to the matter actually before us.</P>
    <P>As regards the second channel itself, it is true that I have taken a certain decision to recommend a certain course of action to the Government following the survey and, in that sense, the debate might be regarded as closed.  However, Deputies here have exercised their right of not regarding it as closed, they have made some comments on it, and I shall be replying as briefly and, I hope, as noncontentiously as I can to at least some of those points.  Also on the points on various sections of the Bill I shall reply at no great length to most of them because we will have an opportunity of coming back to them in Committee.  I make something of an exception there of section 2 because it has been subject to such weighty assault and because it is perhaps the key provision of the entire Bill, in the light of which the sense of the rest may be understood.</P>
    <P>The third category was what might be described as points of programming. A number of Deputies referred to programmes to which they objected or which they commended and to the wrong emphasis on programmes as they considered it.  It is entirely proper that these points be introduced into the debate.  However I do not think it proper for me to reply to them because I have no control over programming except that degree of emergency control vested in me for reasons of State security and which, for that reason, is very rarely applied.  The Authority themselves must normally be taken to discharge the responsibilities they have in that area and which are now thoroughly spelled out in this Bill.  Our debates are scrutinised in RTE and I think that the points made by Deputies in relation to programming are invariably brought to the notice of the Director-General, who is <Col N="1049" /> the appropriate person to consider them.</P>
    <P>I have laid some stress, and will do so again, on the element of divergence which arose in relation to the key area in the Bill, namely, section 2.  In relation to the major areas of the Bill, those which restrict governmental power, retain and extend the power of the Oireachtas and safeguard the autonomy of the Authority, I should like to express the hope that on these there may not be a division here.  The whole point of the Bill is to strengthen both the controlling power of the Oireachtas over the actions of the Minister of the day and the autonomy of the station itself in relation to the Government of the day.  If we are putting, as we are, so much weight on the Oireachtas as distinct from the unlimited powers previously vested in the Government of the day and not subject to Oireachtas control, it is very important that there should be the widest possible concensus in the Oireachtas so that it is clear that there is a secure framework of autonomy for broadcasting here, subject to safeguards and controls which are spelled out and the oversight of which is entrusted to Parliament.  Therefore a division in that area would be regrettable but of course, if it has to be, it has to be.  I would appeal to those Deputies who have spoken in that sense if they conscientiously can, not to press such matters to a division.</P>
    <P>I should like to consider now the statement made by the Fianna Fáil spokesman, Deputy Fitzpatrick, as contained in the Official Report dated 28th October, 1975, Volume 285, column 414 onwards.  He said the Government were elected to make decisions and, although he did not put any great emphasis on it, apparently he thought it improper for the Government to put that responsibility on the Oireachtas.  To that extent he seemed to be at <i>ad idem</i> with his colleagues who spoke later, although the feeling of his contribution is rather different.  At column 416 he accused me of being too dictatorial and he said that I seemed to believe I knew what was best for the people and that I could dictate <Col N="1050" /> to them that BBC 1 was the best type of service which could be offered.  I understand that Deputy Fitzpatrick may have got that impression but I should like to correct it because it is wrong.  I did not seem to believe I knew what was best for the people, I may have been wrong to some extent, although I think I indicated in my opening remarks the limitations of the extent, about what the people thought was best for themselves. The whole point of my contribution to that debate throughout the country was that the people should be free to choose what they thought best for them.  The process may be open to objection but I should have thought the last adjective which could rightly be ascribed to it is &ldquo;dictatorial&rdquo;.  I found out what the people wanted.  It was not what I thought originally they wanted, although I found out as I went along that the arguments of RTE were carrying weight.  When I found out what it was by the best means available I agreed to recommend that to the Government.  If that behaviour is dictatorial I wish gentlemen in the past who have been dictators had acted in that way.  They did not.  I think the point made is not very well taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also referred to a conference of the ITGWU and said that many of my colleagues in the Labour Party told me they did not agree with me.  If the Deputy had listened to later stages of the debate he would have discovered that the matter on which two of my colleagues find themselves in amicable disagreement with me at the moment is on my accepting the findings of the survey.  They still hold out for BBC 1, or would like to do so, and it is not a fact that many of my colleagues approached me in this way.</P>
    <P>With regard to the conference of the ITGWU&mdash;I might add I was present and I do not believe the Deputy was&mdash;I think it probably unwise to comment on proceedings at which one was not present to people who were.  There was a clear difference of opinion among union members in relation to this matter. Clearcut opposition came mainly <Col N="1051" /> from trade unionists in RTE.  All this is something of a closed chapter but I wish to set the record straight on those points.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick objected to &ldquo;tending to undermine&rdquo; and he seemed to take a more liberal view on that matter than some of his colleagues.</P>
    <P>On the question of what we are calling cultural protection, Deputy Fitzpatrick was very forthright.  He said at column 417 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>I am not speaking about cultural protection.  We are now in the Common Market, an intergrated part of European society, and we must broaden our outlook on such matters.  The same applies to our people in Northern Ireland.  We must look at their problems and culture and see how they can be embraced in our network.</P>
    <P>That is what I say myself.  He also took a line on the appointment of the Authority, a line which was also taken by some Members in the Seanad, that there is something wrong about the Minister divesting himself of the power to sack the Authority without consulting the Oireachtas while retaining the power to appoint. As Deputy Esmonde properly pointed out, this is exactly the state of affairs in relation to the appointment and dismissal of judges who are appointed by the Government but can only be dismissed by the Oireachtas.  I propose that this procedure should be followed in relation to members of this Authority also, because of the particularly politically sensitive nature of the Authority's function and because of previous transactions which we regard as regrettable and which are also regared as regrettable by all who understand the nature of public service broadcasting and its need for autonomy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said at column 460:</P>
    <P>I am not sure that we should not also remove the appointment of the Authority completely from the Government.  I believe that if <Col N="1052" /> people in all walks of life, such as farmers organisations, trade unions, the FUE and any other organisation had a say in the appointment of the Authority we would get away from the feeling people have that the Government of the day have their own people in the RTE Authority.  That is damaging the function of RTE.  I would say the very same if this party were in Government.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that I interrupted at that point:</P>
    <P>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien: The Deputy did not say it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went on to say:</P>
    <P>I do not believe I said differently. Perhaps some of my predecessors did.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether they said differently but they certainly acted differently.  The power to appoint the Authority is in the 1960 Act and I do not know that anybody proposed to change it.  If Deputy Fitzpatrick, as spokesman for his party in this area, means the suggestion seriously, perhaps, he would introduce an amendment of that kind and we could debate the matter more fully.</P>
    <P>We now come to Deputy Brennan's remarks, which were interesting, as reported in Volume 285.  Some of what he said was interesting historically; for instance, at column 667 when talking about cable television which is very important in relation to this theme of cultural protection which bulked so large in the debate in the Seanad and on the whole not so large in our debates here&mdash;but it came in&mdash;he said:</P>
    <P>I was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when the first demand was made for cable TV.  The demand came from the high-rise flats in Ballymun and those who sought cable TV pointed out that many of those living there could not receive all the stations because of the lack of uniformity in the heights of the flats.  The Department stood out strongly against it, being completely influenced by the desire to maintain the revenue from commercials.</P>
    <P>I should like the House to note <Col N="1053" />&ldquo;completely influenced by the desire to maintain the revenue from commercials&rdquo;. That is to say, that the only opposition to that came from this very frank and pragmatic desire to hold on to certain revenue from RTE and thereby save the State money.  No consideration at all was given, apparently, to the cultural implications of the extension of cabling.  I think that sheds a certain light on the sincerity or otherwise of some of the arguments used against the project of retransmitting of BBC 1.  These arguments occurred especially in the Seanad&mdash;that we were allowing an alien culture to be propagated and contaminate our people.  If the viewing of outside stations direct is contaminating, then the extension of cable television has done that already to a much more dramatic extent than anything proposed by me and it was apparently decided by a Fianna Fáil Government to do that&mdash;to permit the extension of cabling&mdash;without even thinking seriously, if Deputy Brennan is correct, about the cultural aspects of that decision.  If what Deputy Brennan says is to be taken completely seriously, he says that the Department stood out strongly against it, being completely influenced by the desire to maintain the revenue from commercials. He want on:</P>
    <P>It is understandable that if a station is depending on its commercials for financing support that it should not be entirely enthusiastic for making it possible for the viewing public to see other stations.  In fact, it was finally taken as a Government decision with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at the time, myself, objecting.  However, the majority around the Government table were in favour.  In stating that I am not giving away any Government secrets.</P>
    <P>It sounds to me rather as if he were giving away Government secrets but I do not mind.</P>
    <P>... That was the first move towards bringing in piped television and it was understandable that once that happened it would be impossible to resist demands for it elsewhere.</P>
    <P>So they knew the full consequences of <Col N="1054" /> this very important decision in the cultural area but they were not in the least bothered then, apparently, about the cultural implications.  They became bothered about the cultural implications when another government was active in this area.  He continued:</P>
    <P>We lost the battle.  We were entirely influenced by the desire to get as many of the viewing public as possible confined to looking at our own stations and that is only natural. Commercial pricing was based on set count and set count would be less important if the people had an opportunity of seeing a number of other stations.</P>
    <P>&mdash;all very pragmatic&mdash;</P>
    <P>The value of the advertising is bound to be influenced by the fact that more and more people have more channels available to them. This was something which would occur inevitably and while many people, like Deputy Moore, do not like commercials anyhow&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Again, I interrupted:</P>
    <P>Dr Cruise-O'Brien: Would the Deputy permit me to put a query to him?  The Deputy has indicated his own stand, and this is very interesting historically, but would he also feel able to indicate why his colleagues over-ruled him and gave the decision making possible cable which was an important decision? Why did the Government decide to authorise cable against the Deputy's recommendation as Minister?</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan continued:</P>
    <P>I thought the answer was obvious. The decision was in favour of the people in the Ballymun area at the time who were able to make a good case that they could not get the number of channels their neighbours could get.</P>
    <P>That sounds remarkably like the argument a number of people were making in Cork, Limerick and Galway and which was decried recently. Deputy Brennan continued:</P>
    <P>It was inevitable that at some stage there must be a relaxation towards giving them the choice.  Some people could receive the other channels. The exact same question prevails <Col N="1055" /> in relation to the Minister's problem when he had a survey to see whether there should be a second channel or not.</P>
    <P>In reply to that I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Exactly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That was one important point in Deputy Brennan's speech but more important was the point he made at column 672 of the same volume of the Official Report.  I referred to this matter already and I promised to give the quotation of Deputy Brennan on the subject of pre-censorship.  The quotation is:</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has learned&mdash;</P>
    <P>I shall come back to the theme of what I have learned or not learned later; that is not so important&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and that he has regarded it as necessary to maintain some ministerial control.  This is something that cannot be ruled out because when you say, &ldquo;The Minister&rdquo;, you mean this House.  He must have some means of ensuring that he can intervene at times and I am not so sure that the statutory notice or order provided for in section 17 is sufficient.  In regard to events that could incite to crime or lead to violence, there could be <i>ad hoc</i> situations and because of that I cannot understand why a statutory order should have force for 12 months.</P>
    <P>I will answer that point later.  Deputy Brennan continued:</P>
    <P>In this regard, there could be prepared scripts or produced programmes and these should be available before screening so that the Minister could see they do not contain material that could be inflammatory, incite to crime or lead to violence.  Intervention in relation to prohibition of this sort of behaviour should be in the form of machinery that could be immediately applied.  It should not be a matter of having to wait for a year before annulling or changing the order.  Perhaps the Minister will explain further the effects of section 17 when he is replying.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> I interrupted again and said:</P>
    <P>I apologise again for interrupting but it is for the purpose of trying to be clear so that I may reply more adequately.  The statutory order can be replaced by the Minister himself if the situation changes.  The point is, it can be annulled by either House at the end of the year.  It holds for a year.</P>
    <P>Unless cancelled.  I continued:</P>
    <P>May I ask what was the Deputy's suggestion about how he sees it? Was he suggesting the State should see programmes before they are broadcast?</P>
    <P>Mr. Brennan: Yes.</P>
    <P>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien: Pre-censorship?</P>
    <P>Mr. Brennan: Yes.  Unless the Authority, and through the Authority the State or the Government, have the right to see a prepared script or a programme that has been produced, it would be too late to see it after presentation.  It could be that the wrong material was presented, the wrong people interviewed, and the wrong things said.  That is the kind of thing that can do most harm in the context of section 17.</P>
    <P>That is a form of censorship that did, apparently, at one time prevail. I should like to read an extract from a work called, &ldquo;The Rehabilitation of Michael Davitt&rdquo;, published in the summer of 1946 by the Davitt Commemoration Committee of Straide, County Mayo, as a record of the centenary ceremonies held in Straide in June of that year.  It says:</P>
    <P>After some changes, the date was eventually fixed for 9th June.  The speakers finally selected were Mr. E. de Valera; Mr. Hugh Delargy, MP; Mr. Miles Platting and Mr. Cahir Healy, MP, Fermanagh.</P>
    <P>Chief Justice Connor Maguire who was invited to speak, was unable to be present due to pressure of work.  General R. Mulcahy, TD; Mr. J. Dillon, TD, and Mr. J. Blowick, TD, were also invited to speak, but when they were informed <Col N="1057" /> that copies of the speeches they intended to deliver at Straide were required by the Director of Broadcasting for censorship purposes a week in advance of 9th June, they refused to submit the scripts and, consequently, did not speak.</P>
    <P>That was a situation prevailing in what many of us certainly on these benches, would regard as the bad old days of broadcasting here.  The bad old days were terminated&mdash;I should like to make this explicitly clear because it is important&mdash;by a Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Childers, who deserves every credit for what he did in that area as in so many others. Apparently, Deputy Brennan with his explicit acceptance of the motion of pre-censorship, and he spells it out&mdash; he means State pre-censorship of broadcasting&mdash;would return to those days.  One might think from what Deputy Brennan said that when he referred to the wrong people appearing and saying the wrong things he meant, what we would hope he meant, members of illegal organisations dedicated to pursuing political objectives by violent means.  However, one can see from the quotation I have read that these powers when they did exist were used in quite a different context, they were used to pre-censor the utterances of members of a legitimate democratic opposition. At that time they were required to go through this humiliating procedure of handing in the text of their speeches and then the Director of Broadcasting, very amenable to the Government in those days, decided whether they could be broadcast or not.  Presumably, if they contained any criticism of the Government they were out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I should like to quote that part of the section:</P>
      <P>(1) When the Minister is of the opinion that the broadcasting of a particular matter or a matter of a particular class would be likely to promote, or incite to, crime or would tend to undermine the authority of the State, he may by order direct the Authority to refrain from broadcasting the matter or any matter of the particular class, and the Authority shall comply with the order.</P>
      <P>It is true that the words in question are susceptible of the inference which the Deputy has drawn from them and that that could be done.  Indeed, looking at it in the light the Deputy invites me to do I shall consider whether we may not do something to take away that inference.  It is not my intention, nor has it ever been the practice in recent years, that the Minister should go and preview programmes to see whether they are all right.  I think it would be undesirable that he should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but nevertheless at the final point the Minister must make a decision, irrespective of whether it goes through A, B, C, D or E. To this extent he is <Col N="1059" /> writing pre-censorship into the Bill and no doubt it will be enacted in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not as regards to matter of a particular class.  If you say, for example, as we do at the moment under the directive, that persons belonging to a particular category shall not appear, then the Minister knows it to be violated after it has been violated, and this is the point&mdash;but it is the responsibility of the officers of the station to see that it is not violated.  The idea of the Minister or somebody specifically delegated by him exercising that function is very undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Minister's responsibility and he criticised section 31 when it came in and exercised his authority under it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I must be allowed make my own speech.  I did not interrupt the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I accept that, but I felt that at this point of time it should be written into the record so that it will be beside what the Minister said about Deputy Brennan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It has already been written into the record by Deputy Lalor, and I will come to that shortly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass made a rather interesting point when he said:</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the direct transmission for outside broadcasting services here and the Minister has stated that he intends to amend that section in view of the survey. I do not see that it should be necessary to amend that section because there might be an occasion in the future, if not immediately, where the provision might be useful, which would prevent the Minister of that day coming back to the House seeking fresh legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> I do not know if that view is held by Deputy Lemass's colleagues but, if it is put forward by the Opposition, I am certainly prepared to consider it.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to a number of detailed matters made by various Deputies.  On the financing of the second channel Deputy Fitzpatrick asked about the arrangements for financing the construction of the second television transmitter network.  The intention is that the financing of the construction of the second television network will be by repayable Exchequer advances when the Bill becomes law.  In the meantime expenditure incurred on this project is being financed by bank borrowing with my consent and the consent of the Minister for Finance under section 27 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  At the end of September, 1975, a total of £675,000 had been spent on the project.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also suggested that the Authority should have greater flexibility as to the amount of advertising and the time of it.  Section 15 provides greater flexibility in regard to broadcasting advertisements by the Authority.  It is considered desirable however that the Minister should retain control over the maximum period of advertisements in any hour so that the Authority will not concentrate the bulk of advertisements in the peak viewing period.</P>
    <P>Again on the estimated cost of the second television channel, Deputy Fitzpatrick quoted figures of £2 million to £3 million as the capital investment necessary to set up the second transmitter network and suggested that the cost might eventually be £3 to £4 million.  The capital cost of the transmitter and microwave link network for the second channel is estimated at £4.1 million at 1975 prices.  The original estimate of the cost was £2.4 million at 1971-72 prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that there should be 20 per cent home-produced programmes and greater regional production on the second RTE channel. The question of programming the second channel is a matter for the RTE Authority.  Their document &ldquo;The second channel: A statement on television <Col N="1061" /> development in Ireland and the question of national choice&rdquo; mentioned 20 to 25 per cent home-produced programmes.  It is, however, expected that initially the amount of home-produced programmes will be smaller than that.  RTE also stated that there will be a significant increase in programming about regional and local affairs in all parts of the country on the two-channel service.</P>
    <P>Deputy C. Murphy, in an interesting speech, referred, as did Deputy Brennan, to the important question of violence in television programmes.  All material is viewed in RTE&mdash;and I mean viewed in RTE and not by the Minister&mdash;prior to its transmission and RTE also receive advice from the film censor.  In previewing film material particular attention is paid to scenes of sadism or excessive violence which could be too strong for consumption in a domestic environment.  RTE get a great deal of comment and feedback from the community in various ways on television programmes and any seemingly excessive violence could be brought to their attention in this way. The Authority believe that their standards are stricter than those for the cinema.  The broadcasting review committee in their report of 1974 also refer to this question.  The committee commented as follows:</P>
    <P>The meagre evidence given directly to the committee did not suggest that RTE programmes in general merited censure on the score of overemphasising violence or sex.  Nevertheless, the committee itself is satisfied that there is an undue portrayal of violence on RTE television, especially in imported programmes.</P>
    <P>BBC and ITV also have codes of behaviour in this matter.  Those codes draw attention to the danger of depicting brutality in children's programmes. In 1970, the British Home Secretary's television research committee reported:</P>
    <P>The whole weight of research and theory in the juvenile delinquency field would suggest that the mass media are never the sole cause of delinquent behaviour.  At most they may play a contributory role, and at that a minor one.</P>
    <P>A report published by UNESCO in <Col N="1062" /> 1971 on the mass media in a violent world concluded that in this realm much is suspected, much is presumed, but little is actually known.  The same point was brought out by some speakers in the Seanad debate.</P>
    <P>Similarly a BBC report <i>Violence on Television,</i> published in January, 1972, stated that the results of its survey do not of themselves provide a basis for concluding either that those who criticise television for showing too much violence are justified or that there is no cause for concern.  The state of research in this matter, as you will see, is extremely unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>An article in the April/May, 1973, issue of <i>Social Studies</i> by Michael Morris, RTE research consultant in relation to the social effects of television in the Irish context concluded that there was a need for the development of empirical research into the social and human effects of broadcasting and that there was little knowledge about the impact of broadcasting in Irish society.</P>
    <P>I think it is very difficult to separate that impact from the other processes going on in society.  Dr. Grant Noble of the Department of Psychology, Trinity College, Dublin, formerly of the Centre for Mass Communication Research at the University of Leicester in England, recently completed a research paper on a study carried out to assess the effects of television violence on Irish children.  He concluded, <i>inter alia,</i> that realistically televised aggression, as distinct from stylistically televised aggression as found in many western countries, promotes aggression in children.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>If society continually generates newsworthy violence we should not perhaps be surprised that our public actions not only disturb nonaggressive boys with well-socialised aggression inhibitions, but also incites them to the violence which news and sport portrays as the social norm.</P>
    <P>That is probably the strongest statement I know of in this area.  It is a very difficult area, as will be seen from the distinction there between realistically <Col N="1063" /> televised aggression and stylistically televised aggression, not always easy to make in practice.  It is, I think, impossible to eliminate violence completely, as some people seem to suggest, from the television screen, for several reasons.  One, unfortunately, as the last writer I quoted mentioned, is that it is a part of our lives in this island now and if we are to have news of what is going on around us, very often that will be sad and frightening, but I do not think we can keep it from the people.</P>
    <P>It is also true that the portrayal of violence, grappling with the problem of violence, forms a large part of our culture and our literature, including our dramatic literature.  A total ban on violence on the screen, for instance, would mean you would have to cut out the last act of <i>Hamlet</i> and many other important elements in the culture we have.  But the distinction between stylised and realistic violence made by Dr. Grant Noble is, I think, of sufficient importance to be studied and retained by those responsible for programming. It is a fact of recent years that there has been a very considerable increase in realistic violence, without dwelling on details of what actually happened, in a manner verging on the sadistic, if not sometimes going over the line, and I would agree there is a need to be vigilant about that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ciaran Murphy suggested that the broadcasting complaints commission should be able to deal with complaints about programmes provided by local community groups through cable television.  The whole purpose of the commission is to deal with complaints against the RTE Authority. The intention is that local programmes for distribution on cable television will be experimental for a time, but when the Bill before the House becomes law the Minister will have power to make statutory regulations which will enable the Minister to subject these programmes to the same type of restraint as RTE programmes. After some experience has been gained, the question of providing machinery for complaints regarding these programmes can be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> Deputy Murphy also mentioned a possible.  Telefís na Gaeltachta.  No serious consideration has been given to such a service.  The capital costs would be extremely high, as would the operating costs, and RTE's experience of programmes in Irish suggests that it would be very difficult to provide programmes of a suitable standard. The same Deputy mentioned BBC 1 in the Northern Ireland context.  He stated that there was a difference of 12 minutes between BBC 1 and BBC 1 Northern Ireland.  In 1973-74, BBC 1 produced 296 hours of which 265 hours were on BBC 1 Northern Ireland.  The balance of 31 hours was networked.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde mentioned the case of somebody who did not see a programme which treated him unfairly and he asked whether a complaint made to the complaints commission would be privileged.  Under section 7, RTE will be obliged to keep sound recordings of programmes for 60 days.  This will enable the commission to deal with any complaints in regard to any programme.  The consideration of any complaints by the commission will, of course, be carried out under section 18B (10), but no question of privilege arises, I am advised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore asked how far the Minister has gone in trying to get the British to accept &ldquo;Pan-Irish&rdquo; programmes.  The Deputy must have misunderstood the reference in my opening speech to &ldquo;Pan-Irish&rdquo; programmes.  Proposals in regard to this matter were put forward by the BBC Northern Ireland Advisory Council to the committee looking into the future of broadcasting in the UK. This is a matter being put forward in that context, not by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore kindly suggested that because of the survey result, the Minister should offer his resignation to the Taoiseach.  He also suggested that I was the only Minister who favoured rebroadcasting.  My main concern at all times was that the viewers should receive the type of television choice they preferred.  I received a very strong impression during the Galway by-election campaign that people would prefer a rebroadcasting <Col N="1065" /> of BBC 1 and I was by no means alone among Ministers or Deputies in that impression.  Indeed I know that quite a number of Deputies still remain of the same opinion.  Having given RTE the opportunity to make their case, I do not regard the fact that the public responded as they did as a defeat for my policy or as justifying the course of action Deputy Moore has urged on me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore also referred to the question of an open university or a university of the air.  I would refer the Deputy to the report <i>Adult Education in Ireland</i> which was presented to the Minister for Education in November, 1973.  In dealing with the possibility of establishing an open university, that report concludes that since the British &ldquo;Open University&rdquo; is still evolving, and is in any event so costly, it would be advisable to postpone further consideration until the British system has been some time longer in operation.  Furthermore, the very cost of an open university in relation to our population would give it a low priority in our educational requirements. On the question of introducing a service along the lines of the BBC &ldquo;Open University&rdquo; the committee found there were other countries in western Europe much wealthier than Ireland which regarded this as beyond their financial reach.  The BBC &ldquo;Open University&rdquo; is a system of higher education for adults involving a partnership with the Open University which is an independent teaching and degree-awarding university.</P>
    <P>The BBC produce and broadcast programmes for Open University students in a close working relationship with the university.  The present agreement between the BBC and the university expires at the end of this year.  The Department of Education and Science in Britain pay a grant to the Open University and they in turn meet in full the BBC production and programme costs to the university. Students pay a proportion of tuition fees, of the cost of summer schools, of books and other expenses.  In 1964 the BBC provided 700 hours of radio and 840 hours of television in support of 65 courses prepared by the Open <Col N="1066" /> University.  In 1975 the university is offering 84 courses or part courses to more than 40,000 students.  The programmes are followed by many thousands of interested listeners and viewers in addition to the Open University students.</P>
    <P>Regarding the cost of all this, the BBC accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1974 showed a figure of £2,199,000 the income received from the universities representing reimbursement of operating and capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore and others, too, raised the question of advertising alcoholic drinks.  Advertisements for spirits&mdash;hard liquors&mdash;are not taken by RTE.  The advertising of other alcoholic drinks accounted for about 7 per cent or £372,000 of RTE's revenue from advertisements in 1973-74. For some years past there have been criticisms of drink advertisements. Following joint consultations between the Department of Health, RTE and the Post Office in this regard, the Authority introduced a stricter code for such advertisements in November, 1973.  The question of advertisements for alcoholic drinks on radio or television must be considered in the context of the general question of advertising in all the media.  A complete prohibition on radio and TV advertisements might result merely in a diversion of the money spent formerly on these to advertising in the other media.  The Broadcasting Review Committee considered this question but in their report they did not recommend that the advertising of alcoholic drinks on radio and television should cease. However, they welcomed the introduction of the RTE code in this regard. I shall continue to be in touch with my colleague, the Minister for Health, in relation to these matters and should he indicate that he considers a change in the present practice to be necessary I would see that that is complied with.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies spoke of the use of advertisements produced in Ireland. Virtually all radio commercials and sponsored programmes are produced in Ireland.  A few are made outside <Col N="1067" /> the country to suit the convenience of Irish artists working abroad.</P>
    <P>Regarding television all slides are made in Ireland.  About half of the advertisements, other than slides, are made specifically for the Irish market and practically all of these are made in Ireland.  The rest of the commercials shown on RTE are not designed specifically for the Irish market and are not produced in Ireland but in almost all cases Irish actors are used for these sound tracks although in some cases the sound tracks may be produced elsewhere to facilitate Irish artists working abroad.</P>
    <P>I understand that an agreement was negotiated between Irish Actors' Equity and the Irish Institute of Advertising Practitioners at the end of January, 1975 which provided that only Equity members would be employed in radio and television commercial work except in exceptional circumstances and in consultation with Equity.  It appears that in the case of advertisements not made in Ireland the sound tracks must be dubbed using Equity members' voices except, again, in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass urged that there be statutory control of interference caused by television and radio receptions. There is a draft direction under consideration at present in the EEC which, when adopted, will set down maximum interference levels for television sets and FM radio receivers. When the objective has been adopted, regulations will be made applying the provisions here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred also to the television licence scheme for certain old age and blind pensioners and for veterans.  These schemes are administered by the Departments of Social Welfare and Defence and any extension of them would be a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare and for the Minister for Defence.  I should be happy to co-operate in any schemes which they might deem possible and advisable.</P>
    <P>Deputies McLaughlin, Callanan and others raised the question of the desirability of the improvement in RTE <Col N="1068" /> television coverage of the existing service. RTE say that fairly satisfactory coverage of their television service extends to about 98 per cent of the population.  In conjunction with the renewal of the existing television service which is taking place, RTE plan to increase the power of some of their transmitters and transposers and in conjunction with the provision of a network for the second service, new transmitters being installed will transmit the existing service as well as the second service.  These two factors will result in improved reception in many areas.  When the existing network has been renewed and the second one completed, RTE will be in a position to investigate the effects on reception and to determine what further action needs to be undertaken.  The renewal of the existing network and the provision of a second network are expected to be completed at the end of 1976.</P>
    <P>It has been decided, in relation to plans for improving reception, to make repayable advances from the Exchequer of more than £1 million to finance a large scale RTE programme for improving reception in those areas where it is not satisfactory.  However, owing to the heavy programme of capital works which RTE must undertake, including the provision of the transmitter network and the renewal of the existing network and the various demands on scarce capital, it will probably be four to five years before the programme is completed.  Even when it is completed there will remain small pockets throughout the country where, because of unusual topographical features and the low density of population it would be impracticable for economic reasons to improve reception.  It is not possible nor would it be appropriate to say at this stage when individual areas will be catered for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass made the interesting suggestion that the entire cost of the second channel should be borne by those who will benefit most from it, that is to say, by viewers in the single channel areas of the west and south.  I do not know whether the Deputy was speaking for his party when he made that point but I did not hear it mentioned in Mayo last weekend.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> Turning to the points made by Deputy Brennan who had already referred to the question of pre-censorship, it must be remembered that section 3 of the Bill prohibits the Authority from broadcasting any matter which may reasonably be regarded as being likely to promote or incite to crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State.  The complaints commission can consider any complaint that the Authority were in breach of that prohibition.</P>
    <P>Every order made under section 17 comes into effect immediately on its being made but can be annulled subsequently if either House of the Oireachtas passes a resolution annulling the order within 21 sitting days of its being made.  I shall come back shortly to those general matters but in the meantime there are several further questions to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>On the question of the RTE Symphony Orchestra, Deputy Brennan suggested that when he was Minister this orchestra cost between £700,000 and £1 million per year.  The Deputy's recollection would appear to be rather seriously at fault because, according to information supplied last year to the Department by RTE, the direct cost of the Symphony Orchestra in 1973-74 was £218,565.  When hired accommodation and the apportionment of overheads, production, technical and transmission costs are added, the total cost of the orchestra in 1973-74 was £452,000.  It does not appear likely that it would have been twice that when Deputy Brennan was Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDonald suggested that with four or five radio transmitters at their disposal RTE should be able to operate a choice of radio programmes. The Broadcasting Review Committee considered that a second TV channel should have priority over a second radio channel, presumably because many TV viewers can receive one programme only, whereas listeners can get many radio programmes from other countries.  RTE now operates one high-powered and two lowpowered medium frequency transmitters to give national coverage of the national radio service on medium <Col N="1070" /> wave.  The national radio service is duplicated on VHF.  Five high-powered RTE transmitters are necessary to give national coverage of the service on VHF.  It is possible the Deputy may be able to receive adequate reception from a number of transmitters in certain parts of the country where in certain areas these transmitters overlap.  RTE have authority to provide a choice of radio programmes when splitting wavelengths for up to 450 hours per year which does, if you like to so regard it, furnish a sort of nucleus of a second radio channel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan inquired as to when RTE 2 would be on the air.  The Government have not yet given the go ahead for RTE 2 though I am recommending this to them.  As Deputies are aware, a substantial increase in the licence fee will eventually be involved. Further capital expenditure will also be necessary for production facilities for the second channel.  RTE are planning to be ready to begin operating in the spring of 1977 but it is not possible to say precisely at this stage when the new service will begin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass asked if existing legislation was adequate to allow other countries to take broadcasts from here for direct transmission to other countries. Under section 16 (2) (1) of the 1960 Act, inserted by section 5 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1966, RTE has power to arrange with other broadcasting authorities for the distribution, receipt, exchange and relay of programmes whether live or recorded.  The present legislation is adequate for the purposes visualised by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also suggested it might be desirable at this time to engage a firm of management consultants who would go into the question of the structure and management of the RTE Authority.  The Broadcasting Review Committee, which submitted its final report in 1974, dealt with all aspects of the RTE Authority's activities and it is considered that there is no need at present for a further detailed examination of the structure of the RTE Authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass asked if ordinary <Col N="1071" /> RTE signals can be received on TV sets in the North and remarked that television sets bought in Northern Ireland will not operate here and <i>vice versa</i>.  Many TV sets in use in the North are suitable for the reception of programmes broadcast in the UHF band only.  The RTE transmissions are on VHF and they cannot be received by such sets.  RTE 405 line transmissions can be received on the older dual standard receivers which are suitable for both VHF and UHF transmissions.</P>
    <P>Several speakers made reference to the survey.  I do not propose to go into detail on that.  Deputy Callanan inquired how the survey was carried out and Deputy Coogan questioned the way in which it was carried out and said he happened to have information of an interview and of the way it was carried out.  The report of the survey, which is now in the Library, explains in detail how the survey was carried out and gives particulars of the areas in which interviews were carried out.  Deputy Coogan may be interested to know that the report shows interviews were carried out in Galway city, in Tuam urban district and in certain rural districts in east Galway.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Kelly, the Parliamentary Secretary, made some interesting remarks on the cultural aspects and he indicated that he thought cultural protection perhaps desirable but essentially a lost cause.  He found the country to be culturally porous.  He seemed rather to regret that.  Personally, I think pores are necessary for health and, if it were a society not culturally porous, it would be a bad thing.  I think a number of Deputies did agree with that, including Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, whom I have quoted already, and I think Deputy Carter.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in an interesting but, I thought, curiously pessimistic speech spoke of the Irish people's vestigial anxiety not to disappear. I think that is putting it too strongly.  Our anxiety not to disappear is quite as healthy and non-vestigial as that of other peoples.  What is disappearing is, I believe, the tendency to insist excessively on the differences <Col N="1072" /> between ourselves and other people. I think that was unhealthy&mdash;an unhealthy product of our past history&mdash; and I think that is what is disappearing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter said, and I welcome this very much indeed, that the debate on this whole matter has tended to promote a better understanding and has helped to educate the public.  I am glad to have that generous acknowledgment of that fact from those benches because I believe it to be the case.  Whatever the outcome, and irrespective of the outcome, the debate was a healthy thing.  It was useful as a means of proceeding and as an expression of respect by the State for the views of individual people and I believe it marked some kind of step forward in that area.</P>
    <P>Two Deputies of my own party challenged the survey and held themselves to be aware of a preference in their own areas for BBC 1.  That comment was made publicly here.  It was also made in private to me by a number of others.  It is, I think, a fairly widespread feeling.  I should like to say here what I think is involved. What is involved is, I think, that the sample taken of those who were interviewed by the surveyors represented, as it should represent, a proper crosssection of the Irish people, urban and rural, young and old, of different classes and different sections, and so on, in different regions.  Those who examine the survey will be able to satisfy themselves of this.  They differed from many others like them in other ways in that they were fully exposed to the arguments offered in support of both concepts, and specifically, of course, to RTE's version of RTE 2.  Specifically they knew when they made their choice that RTE 2 would consist very largely of imported programmes and that it was presented as the nearest thing available to multi-channel television viewing.  They knew that as did those who attended the various debates held in the country&mdash;the six debates I attended and the others.</P>
    <P>I found during these debates that when RTE made their point&mdash;this is the nearest approach to multi-channel you can get and our RTE 2 will consist <Col N="1073" /> of a selection&mdash;that point carried; the audience took that.  I would agree that they also took the point that the selection would be in Irish hands.  That argument registered, too.  The arguments however registered together: the selection will be in Irish hands and what will be selected will be mostly imported programmes.</P>
    <P>Those who were interviewed for the survey knew that, but not everybody knows it even yet.  There are those&mdash; and this may be true of many, Deputy Kyne, Deputy Coughlan and others&mdash; who think that RTE 2 will be as like as two peas to RTE 1 and will represent for them no freedom of choice at all.</P>
    <P>I think the sample represents what most Irish people would think if they had fully realised what the choice really was.  But there now is this somewhat awkward period of a discrepancy between the views in the survey and the views of some people to whom the full arguments have not gone home.  I should say that that in no way qualifies or mitigates my own acceptance of the survey.  I do accept it as scientifically and properly conducted and as being the nearest approximation I am likely to get to what people want.  I believe that most Deputies, though not all, will take that view.  Those Deputies who are of a different view in this matter will have an opportunity to come back to the question when we come to consider the repeal of section 6.</P>
    <P>I should like to come back to the important statement made by Deputy de Valera.  First of all, I should like to acknowledge his very generous observations on the Bill generally and on my contributions here.  However we are possibly as opposed in general viewpoint regarding many important issues in this country at present as any two Deputies can be.  Therefore I shall have to take issue with him.  I hope in doing so to emulate as far as possible, the high standard of courtesy and generosity he has set, and indeed does generally set in this House and elsewhere. He referred to the question of section 2.  I only have a typescript of his speech here.  I hope I will be allowed to quote from it.  I appreciate that if there are any inaccuracies they <Col N="1074" /> will have to be cleared up later.  However, he said:</P>
    <P>The second section raises the question of the autonomy of the Authority and the relationship of that body to the Minister of the day.  In the parent Bill and this Bill, there is no question, it would appear, that this is a State enterprise.  There is no difference of opinion between us that it is a service for which the community is paying, it is the community's property and the Government are the custodians of the community's property. As executors of the community's property they have their duties.  Therefore, it is a question of how much should be delegated, how much autonomy should be divested directly from the Minister and the Government and how much be retained by the Minister and the Government to enable them to discharge their trust and responsibility. These questions arise under the parent Bill and answers have to be found on both Bills within a common framework.</P>
    <P>He sees merit in the proposal but then he turns around and says:</P>
    <P>On the other hand, looking at another aspect of it, the Minister said&mdash;I will refer to that in more detail at the end&mdash;that this can be a very inhibiting provision for him. When he talks about retaining direct power in certain areas and provides for it, he still precludes himself from the possibility of exercising the sanction that may be necessary to enforce that power and he may come up against a managerial difficulty.  This section provides, in effect, that any member of the Authority may be removed in certain conditions.  One asks naturally what about the Authority as a whole?  Of course, from the strict legal point of view all the Minister has to do is to remove them individually, but the practical difficulty remains.</P>
    <P>I would insert there that I do not really think there is a difficulty.  The power conferred on me, I understand, remains&mdash;and, through this, on the Oireachtas&mdash;of removing the entire <Col N="1075" /> Authority if the Oireachtas decide to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera continued:</P>
    <P>It is not so serious if it is the case of one recalcitrant member, but if it comes to the whole Authority, the Minister may very well find himself with problems.  He may have urgent reasons as well as cogent ones for giving a directive within the limits he has defined and the Authority may refuse to carry out his directive.  There may be a practical urgency in such a case.  What then does the Minister do?  The procedure the Minister has provided for here can be cumbrous.  What happens, for instance, in a certain situation&mdash;I am not thinking of an ordinary political situation but the type of problem the Minister digressed on in the Seanad and a little in the Dáil when presenting his philosophy?  The Authority might well flout the Minister to his face.  It might be Oireachtas vacation time and it might take a period to assemble the Dáil or the Oireachtas as a whole.  Then because of the democratic nature of the Oireachtas there may be delays, perhaps from recourse to the traditional filibuster. Meanwhile the Minister is powerless; the thing he seeks to control goes on out of control and the mechanism he has set up here will aggravate it.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the justification, the advisability or anything else of the decision that might have been taken, but it was made and the directive given.</P>
    <P>He is referring to the directive given by Deputy Collins, my predecessor, and subsequent action.</P>
    <P>He continued to say:</P>
    <P>There was a directive under section 31 given by the Minister's predecessor. What about a case like that?  If the provision is there as in sequences might have been serious.  I am putting a hypothetical case.  Supposing the Authority do not act in accordance with the Minister's directive. <Col N="1076" /> There is in such a case a stimulus given in the opposite direction. The object of the exercise under section 31 was to minimise publicity and incitement, but the result of this provision will be to maximise publicity and incitement in such a situation.  That is the difficulty I see in a section of this nature.</P>
    <P>Then he rather turns round, as he sometimes does, and says:</P>
    <P>I must say the section appeals to me.  In principle, I feel that when authority is delegated it should be delegated thoroughly so that a body or an individual cannot carry responsibility unless he has the inner certainty that comes from security to carry out that responsibility.  Therefore, I see this section as a dilemma for the Minister in which the last stage will be worse than the first.</P>
    <P>These objections made by Deputy de Valera are important and they highlight the significance of this section and of the Bill as a whole.  It does indeed limit the powers of Government in relation to the Authority.  It limits the powers of Government in relation to Parliament, and the Government must put its proposals before Parliment.  It strengthens the autonomy of the Authority.  It is meant to do all these things.  The question is whether, as Deputy de Valera has said, it does these things to too great an extent, whether it weakens the Government's power of prompt response to a dangerous degree.  That is a consideration which I certainly have had to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>I shall spell out again what my objective was.  My objective was to curtail arbitrary power, that is to remove from any Government power which could be used without any restraint and therefore possibly in pursuit of some purpose other than the purpose ostensibly aimed at.  I considered that the events leading to the removal of the former Authority showed that these dangers were real under the former legislation.  Good through that legislation was in many respects, I think it showed that it could be abused.  I will say what the <Col N="1077" /> abuse was, using as temperate language as I can.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me&mdash;and I said this then in opposition and I say it now&mdash; that the fault of the Minister was not in issuing a directive under section 31, but in the totality of what he did.  He issued a directive then.  The Authority did not demur to the directive, and certainly did not refuse to carry it out.  It did what it was quite within its rights in doing: it asked for clarification of the meaning of the directive.  The Minister did not provide that clarification.  It does not seem that he sat down with the Authority and gave them general indications of his thinking, as he might have done.  He just said: &ldquo;That is the directive.  It is for you to carry it out&rdquo;.  Then a certain programme was broadcast which was deemed to be in violation of the directive.  The Minister told the Authority so.  The Authority did not defend the action. It said it was a mistake made in good faith.  The Minister then dismissed the entire Authority.</P>
    <P>I said then that I thought this was a humiliating course of action, not only in relation to the individuals who were so treated&mdash;although that is not unimportant in relation to people giving the public service of that kind &mdash;but in relation to broadcasting generally, and that it showed an inclination to bring down the big stick unnecessarily.  I could not help relating it to other disputes which the Minister had had with the Authority &mdash;one dispute involving a matter within the competence of his own Department, a post office in Letter-more, one regarding excessively frequent appearances on television of a certain Deputy in this House who happens to be the present Minister, and another involving his predecessor on the moneylending matter.  There was the general impression that impatience had been built up with the Authority on a variety of scores and that advantage was taken of an error, which they acknowledged, in order both to humiliate them and assert the principle of State control over broadcasting in its most naked and uncompensated form.  Deputy <Col N="1078" /> de Valera and Deputy Lalor, to whose remarks I will come in a moment, were quite right in assuming that I had these transactions in mind when I was framing the present Bill.  But Deputy Lalor made the point which, if I may say so, was rather disingenous: &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; That the Dáil had an opportunity of debating the matter and that I contributed to the debate myself.  That is quite true. The Dáil did have an opportunity of considering it and I did contribute to the debate.  I shall go back to that shortly.</P>
    <P>However, this was fortuituous.  It happened that the Authority were dismissed while the Dáil was debating the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs. If the Dáil had not happened to be debating that Estimate, I do not see that the Dáil would have had an opportunity, certainly not an easy opportunity, of raising the matter except by means of parliamentary question.  As it was, it could be debated. This legislation would not only make a debate mandatory but would make it necessary for the Government to carry their point.</P>
    <P>I think most people will agree with me when I say that this legislation constitutes a barrier and quite a formidable barrier against any arbitrary action of that kind in the future, and that Deputy de Valera would not deny that.  His point is that in providing against arbitrary misuse of power I have cut into what ought not to be cut into, that is to say, the power which the Government have the right and the duty to use to see that the institutions of State are not undermined, which is recognised in this Bill, but, according to Deputy de Valera and Deputy Lalor, the powers retained are not sufficient. That is by no means a frivolous objection and I have weighted it against the other matter, the use of arbitrary intervention.  We know that arbitrary intervention is possible because we have seen what we at least regard as a clear example of it.  It has been unknown, as far as I know, in any country possessing a similarly liberalised broadcasting code to our own, for a Minister to sweep aside an entire Authority.  He swept them aside not because <Col N="1079" /> they defied him, not because they said: &ldquo;We are not going to comply with your directive&rdquo;, not because they declared themselves or sought to present themselves as free from statutory restriction on them, but because they admitted they made a mistake and they looked for a clarification.  That was not a very defiant Authority but nonetheless they were swept aside.</P>
    <P>Similar powers exist in relation to British broadcasting.  The British Government have similar powers in relation to the board of governors of the BBC. A story goes&mdash;I do not know whether or not it is true&mdash;that Ted Health, then Prime Minister, who was having trouble, as governments do from time to time in every country with the broadcasters, is said to have congratulated Deputy Lynch on this drastic action and to have wished he could do the same with the board of governors. The point there is that he had the legal power, but he had not got the power in terms of the conventions which have grown up in Britain and which made public service broadcasting a rather sacrosanct affair, conventions which make such action so unlikely as to be virtually impossible.  Therefore a Prime Minister has to say: &ldquo;I should like to do all sorts of things to those people but I would not get away with it&rdquo;.  The whole affair showed that our legislation, virtually identical as it was with the British in this respect, was not hedged round with the same conventions which protect the autonomy of public service broadcasting in Britain; and if we desire to provide that autonomy we have to take positive steps to do it by legislation.</P>
    <P>I had in mind that this would be what you would almost call ratchet legislation, that it would be very hard to repeal it, hard to put it back, because of what I regard as the clear merit it has of curtailing arbitrary power and being seen to do so by making this more open and above board, obliging the Government of the day to come to Parliament whenever they have to take such action.  They would, I suggest, know that, if it were action genuinely intended to safeguard the institutions of the State, they would <Col N="1080" /> get the power and the support they require.</P>
    <P>That approach requires a certain amount of confidence in people both in the Authority, in Authorities likely to be appointed and in the Oireachtas.  It implies at the same time a degree of suspicion of government, even democratic government.  Suspicion of government is warranted because governments have power and, human nature being what it is, have some tendency to misuse it.  They are more likely to misuse it, if his, her or their actions are not subjected to the maximum public scrutiny.  The maximum public scrutiny of government is what this is intended to secure.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera and Deputy Lalor appear to me to be less suspicious of government than they are of Parliament and of a nominated Authority. That is the difference between us.  I regard it as exceedingly unlikely that any Authority will take it on themselves both to violate the specific legislation under which they are there to function and also directions lawfully issued to them.  Any Authority will have to be nominated by a democratic Government. They will have to be an Authority which are regarded as at least tolerable by the Oireachtas as a whole.  They will tend to consist of respectable, moderate, rather cautious people.  That has been true of all Authorities and it will remain true of all Authorities I can foresee, barring such convulsions in the State as would make the whole matter of broadcasting of little significance.</P>
    <P>I am therefore disposed to say that the State should trust the Authority to the extent that they regard the situation in which an Authority would defy the Government in persisting in a course of action likely to undermine the State as exceedingly improbable and so much more improbable than arbitrary interference by the Government that it is much less necessary to provide against it than to provide against the other.</P>
    <P>It may be said: &ldquo;All right, what you say is probable&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say it is not likely that an Authority would not behave in this way.  It is possible, and section 17 implies the possibility, that they may at least so seriously diverge from the Government's interpretation <Col N="1081" /> of what undermines the Authority of this State that a direction from the Oireachtas may have to be sought.  Deputy de Valera said: &ldquo;What happens in the emergency situation?&rdquo; He spoke of an emergency situation where the Authority differ from the Minister and refuse to carry out what he regards as their obligation under the law, under the statute generally and under any directions issued under it.  The Authority say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, which is something which no Authority have hitherto done.  Suppose they do it.  So improbable a course of action on the part of the Authority would suggest they were running parallel with a grave emergency in the State as a whole, in which case the Oireachtas would be in session and in which case certainly it could and should be called into session, as it could be at any time if an emergency of this kind existed. Deputy de Valera and Deputy Collins, therefore, are wrong when they suggest that this dangerously erodes the power which the Minister has. However, it reflects the fact that the legislation divests the Minister and, by virtue of the sort of ratchet mechanism I referred to, probably all future Ministers of certain powers.  It is certainly well that the Oireachtas should be aware of that.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera spoke of a dilemma but I do not think the dilemma is real in the sense that the danger on the one hand is so clear and has been exemplified so clearly in the recent history of this country&mdash; that is the danger of arbitrary intervention by the State unnecessarily in this sphere of broadcasting, is a real danger&mdash;while, on the other hand, the danger of the Authority defying the Government in an area where they ought not to defy the Government and getting away with it is very small indeed.  I am making the point &ldquo;defying the Government in an area where they ought not to defy the Government&rdquo; because that is important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor, in particular, to whose remarks I shall come in a moment, spoke in terms as if he believed&mdash;he may have been somewhat unguarded in his use of <Col N="1082" /> language, but he used the language repeatedly&mdash;that for the Authority to refuse to obey any order was wrong. Of course the old section 31&mdash;it was its great weakness&mdash;could be interpreted in that sense.  The Government could tell the Authority to do anything and Deputy Lalor seemed to suggest that the Government had a right to do that, that the Government had and should have absolute authority in relation to broadcasting.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to express explicitly the obligations of the Authority and the Minister's powers of intervention, namely, that they are limited to this matter of incitement to crime or tending to undermine the Authority or State institutions.  Outside that area, in the future the Government will not have any powers to dictate to RTE. For example there is the question of impartiality of which the Minister was formerly the sole judge, and I have mentioned the case of matters within the Minister's departmental responsibility where he told the Authority that they had violated impartiality. Although he was himself a party in the proceedings he also made himself judge and I think that is most undesirable. In the future if the Government tell the RTE Authority to do something which does not fall in this area the Authority will have the right politely to decline.  Of course they will not have a right to do anything or to tolerate anything in broadcasting which incites to crime or undermines the institutions of the State.  However, undermining the institutions of the State is a very different thing from saying severe things about the Government.</P>
    <P>I thought Deputy Lalor in his remarks this morning went on to a rather inordinate extent about broadcasters who criticise or even satirise politicians.  Perhaps it is not important that a Deputy should be a little hypersensitive about all these things.  Skins are not of equal thickness on either side and occasionally we all burn at things said about us by broadcasters and journalists.  What distressed me rather in Deputy Lalor's intervention, both on Tuesday night and this morning, was the combination of that kind of hypersensitivity to criticism&mdash;I think <Col N="1083" /> I can describe it as hypersensitivity because I have been more severely satirised on that medium than has Deputy Lalor&mdash;the combination of that hypersensitivity and the attitude that the broadcasters have to do what the Government tell them without restriction of the class of matter in which the Government have and must retain the right to tell the broadcasters what they shall not do.  This combination would be ominous if broadcasting were to be exposed to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera rendered the House the service of going through the Bill section by section and, as one would expect, it was a very useful and philosophic discourse on the major areas of the Bill.  I should like to refer now to some of the points he made. I have already dealt with his observations on section 2 and, although I do not agree with these observations, I wish to record that I think them important and the most important case that can be made against this Bill, that in curtailing arbitrary power it goes too far in the other direction.  In the Seanad I referred to the Bill as a measure of moderate liberalisation and that is what I believe it is.  I expected criticism that it was not liberal enough. Deputy de Valera has made the criticism, which on the whole is rather better founded, that it is too liberal I think the Deputy has deep suspicions of liberals and liberalism and these were undertones in his speech.  His attitude towards what is liberal is complex; he is partly drawn towards liberal values and partly recoils from the dangers inherent in them.  This may only mean he has thought a great deal about these matters, as I think he has.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera spoke at some length on section 3&mdash;it was an interesting contribution&mdash;and he referred to the question of impartiality.  He thought journalists were too often accused of a lack of impartiality and a lack of objectivity.  As he acknowledged, there are very difficult problems involved here and I would not claim that this section does any more than indicate an area of concern for the Authority and provide them with <Col N="1084" /> a kind of general conceptual framework in which to approach their responsibilities in the matter.  Certainly they will not find out what to do by looking up the book&mdash;the stipulations in the Act are only pointers for them.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy de Valera's point when he said that journalists are too often accused of a lack of impartiality. Certainly the accusation is easily thrown about.  It is easy to think that somewhere in broadcasting or on a newspaper there is some bad little man about his nefarious designs. There might be, but usually what is involved is not that but quite sincere differences in human evaluations of what, for example, is important. Every broadcaster and journalist believes in presenting what is significant in terms of news, comment, the choice of what is going on which should be commented on and so on. In his choice the journalist is like the historian.  No two journalists would select the same things as significant and this is quite inevitable.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera spoke very scornfully of what he called commitment, the idea that a writer, historian, journalist should be committed to an idea and serve that idea in how he selects the facts he relies on, how he presents them and so on, using them as a tool in pursuit of an idea.  I found this very odd coming from Deputy de Valera because he is the head of a newspaper chain which is committed not, I think&mdash;I should like to define it as precisely as I can&mdash;to the service of a political party as much as to the service of the ideals which its owner, Deputy de Valera, believes to be the ideals of that party. That commitment most certainly influences its editorials which no one I think would claim to be impartial or detached and which would not make that claim for themselves but also influences the selection and presentation of the news.  They do that in a way they believe to be right in pursuit of an ideal that they have and, as they think&mdash;although we may think they are very wrong&mdash;for the public good.  What else is that but commitment?</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Deputy, <Col N="1085" /> although he rejects the term, is a highly committed person.  I think he uses the term with the contempt he does because he associates it with the Left and in particular with the far Left where this term has been held. Of course, one can be as committed to right-wing ideas or to strongly nationalistic zenophobic ideas quite as much as you can be to left-wing ideas and you can show that commitment by deviating from what others would regard as objectivity.  It is absolutely right that in the State there should be newspapers which are committed in that way.  Everybody knows that when you get <i>The Irish Press</i> you will get a particular point of view and a presentation which suits that point of view.  That is all right if there are other newspapers available and if you are not required to swallow that all the time, undiluted with any other matter.</P>
    <P>Of course&mdash;and Deputy de Valera and I would be in agreement here&mdash; this is precisely the kind of commitment one cannot have in a national broadcasting system.  It would be intolerable in a democratic state if you had the sole broadcasting system putting out all the time one point of view, selecting facts to suit that point of view.  To a certain extent, although I think people who hold a strong point of view usually have some respect for facts, they cannot help being influenced by their own views in their selection of what is significant, just as, if you take an obvious example outside our immediate sphere, <i>The Irish News</i> and <i>The Belfast News Letter</i> are not likely to give the same coverage to Protestant deaths and Catholic deaths.  That is an unfortunate fact but it is a fact and I am quite sure that the journalists who handle facts in that way do not think of themselves as deviating from objectivity.  Also, I am sure their readers do not think of them as deviating from objectivity. Again, these deviations can be tolerated in newspapers where there is competition and diversity but cannot be tolerated in broadcasting&mdash;hence the particular restrictions which hedge around broadcasters, which separate them from their fellow journalists and <Col N="1086" /> which they, quite naturally, are professionally inclined to resent and sometimes, perhaps, to evade.</P>
    <P>That is where the collective element must be brought in, a collective element which necessarily is a check on individual creativity.  Anything produced by one person or under the guiding mind of one person is likely to be more interesting than anything that has gone through the oversight of a committee, has been trimmed and smoothed down and had a certain amount of waffle inserted in it&mdash;more interesting but in the case of a monopoly broadcasting system also regrettably to be sacrificed, I think, because since no single human being can attain objectivity&mdash;perhaps a committee cannot attain it either&mdash;you need in a monopoly broadcasting system some kind of umpire.  The Authority is there as umpire and is strengthened by this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera rightly said that objectivity is not attainable humanly. That, philosophically, is so.  The legal objectives set by this Bill and other Bills are, if contemplated philosophically, not within reach.  You may ask why they are there.  They are there to point in a direction that is desirable if not fully attainable.  Objectivity may be unattainable, but I think the effort towards objectivity is always recognisable. One can see and often does see across these benches when somebody on the opposite side stands up, the degree to which he is being polemical, whatever side he is on, and the degree to which he is really trying to get at the facts or present fairly the facts he has.  It is never full in the case of any of us but we know when the effort is there and the Authority, a body of reasonable men and women, is also in a position to judge when the effort is there and when it is not and to curb its not being there&mdash;if one can restrain a negative.</P>
    <P>I think the section rightly subjected to this criticism should, nonetheless, stand and I think Deputy de Valera would agree with that and, in fact, does agree with it.  He paid tribute to the objectivity of the news services and I am glad that he did so.  The problem of objectivity is probably more acute <Col N="1087" /> in relation to current affairs than it is to news because there one is representing views and there are difficult choices involved in what to select and whom to select.  There are difficulties in the possible clash between the pursuit of what is interesting and the need to remain within the limits posed by this legislation and intended also by the last legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera said, and I think this is right, that the best safeguard lies in the multiplicity of media which we still have here.  It is very desirable that we should have that.  That same multiplicity is now threatened in many countries, including our own, by the difficult finances of the newspaper industry. If we had only one newspaper and only one broadcasting chain the dangers of departure from objectivity would be greatly strengthened.  Deputy de Valera used the formula that there should be freedom of responsible views.  I think I know what he means but I am not quite sure.  It is desirable to be more specific than that; to be specific about what are limitations of the freedom, even of responsible views.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, Deputy de Valera regards his own views as responsible but I would consider them to be, in some respects, irresponsible.  I will return to that matter later.  All of us know that no charge is thrown across the floor of this House more frequently than that of irresponsibility so that test is not the one that should be applied.  Views, even frivolous, should be allowed to be heard and, in fact, so should all views that do not come into the category as set out in the Bill of incitement to crime or tending to undermine the institutions of the State.  He also spoke of a censorship of a mature mind which seems to beg the same question.  None of us would agree on who has a mature mind.  Just as he suggested that the multiplicity of media was the best check so also would the multiplicity of minds on a body like the Authority provide the best barrier here.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera also said that the Government's judgment might not be as sound as the journalist's judgment, <Col N="1088" /> a point I find interesting.  That is true but it remains also true that it is the Parliament elected by the people, and the Government which results from the formation of that Parliament, which have the responsibility under law in this matter and which should have it even if their judgment on a particular point is not as good as that of a private citizen.  If their judgment is consistently bad we trust in the conception that eventually the electorate will correct its mistake and change the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera in his attack on commitment, which he regarded as an incitement to go and demoralise people, somewhat overstated his case in that part of it.  He seemed to deny any role to what the Americans used call, muck-raking&mdash;that is not a derogatory term&mdash;which relates to the function of probing and exposure which is a function of journalism, particularly current affairs journalism. Deputy de Valera seemed to suggest that this should be altogether eliminated. It would be a pity in the public interest if that was no longer considered to be a function of journalism, including broadcasting.  I do not think it is eliminated under the present legislation.  The merit of the present legislation is being specific about what shall not be done instead of having as of old the blanket proviso that was in section 31.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy referred to the tendency as a bad habit of journalists to behave as if they were examining a hostile witness.  As a politician I would not at all be afraid of a journalist who examines one as a hostile witness; it is the chap who is very nice, draws one out and makes one feel comfortable and gets one to say the things one should not say who must be watched.  The fellow who is attacking one is not usually a danger.  The habit of the hostile examination is one which is probably tending to fade out anyway.</P>
    <P>On section 4, Deputy de Valera made the point about the complaints commission that when they have found something the Authority either take it or leave it.  This is true.  The complaints commission were not intended to have any sanctions which they could <Col N="1089" /> apply.  Their sole sanction lies in their finding.  The Government take the view that any Authority are likely to be a responsible body which will not take lightly the findings of a commission if the commission find there is something wrong.  Of course, the ultimate sanction is there; and if an Authority&mdash;I think this unlikely&mdash;is constantly being found to be in breach by the complaints commission and if they blithely ignore the commission's findings, that fact will have to be considered when the Authority come up for reappointment. It might have to be considered even before that.  In that unlikely event there is an implicit sanction behind the complaints commission, but it is implicit only.  The complaints commission have only the right to find or not to find that there is something wrong.</P>
    <P>So far the complaints commission, which have been functioning at a more informal level since I set it up, have in general found in favour of RTE in the three cases that came before them, though with some qualifications in one case.  I was asked how much this would cost and I should like to state that the cost would be very small.  At the moment it amounts to the cost of secretarial services.  There is a possibility that if the commission's work increased it could be remunerated.  For the information of the Oireachtas I should add that the Government have been requested by the committee not to provide for remuneration.  They undertake this work voluntarily for which they deserve thanks.  It would not be my immediate intention to introduce remuneration for them.</P>
    <P>I want to provide for the possibility in the rather unlikely case that the work of the commission will so expand that this is required.</P>
    <P>Deputies and Senators referred to the possibility of the commission being inundated with complaints.  So far there is no sign that that will be so.  Equivalent bodies elsewhere are not deluged with complaints; they get very few in fact.  The complaints commission here have already received six complaints, which shows that they are being useful but not inundated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> Deputy de Valera puzzled me by raising a question about crime.  He asked: what is crime?  I thought the definition of &ldquo;crime&rdquo; was fairly clear in law.  In this connection I would specify that it includes membership of an illegal organisation.  I do not have time to cover all the Deputy's arguments, though I would like to do so.</P>
    <P>He criticised me when he spoke of the problem of the North and said I was too preoccupied with the North in this Bill.  He also said that the North does not really arise in connection with this Bill.  I profoundly differ from the Deputy here and I am sorry he did not spell out more specifically exactly what he meant by this comment.  It seems to me clear that the North is relevant under a number of heads.  It is relevant under democratic values because of anti-democratic groups which seek to reunite the North with the rest of the country by force.  It is relevant under the heads of culture.  What do we mean when we speak of our national culture?  Do we have the North in mind?  Would Deputy de Valera say we have not and we should not have the North in mind?  I do not think he would.  It is relevant of course in relation to the whole question of violence and crime including membership of illegal organisations, which necessarily comes up here.  I think, therefore, that Deputy de Valera is wrong in that suggestion.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I am right &mdash;and he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;but I read into what he said here an implication that to treat as criminals&mdash;he asked this curious question: what is crime?&mdash;people who might be regarded as patriots seeking to bring about Irish unity by force is wrong and ought not to be done.  I do not know whether he believes that, but if he does, I profoundly disagree with him and I do not think the questions can be separated.  Those who use violence in the North will be, and are, prepared to use violence in the Republic also. I do not intend by excluding the question of the North from the ambit of <Col N="1091" /> consideration that this Bill should give any licence for that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor spoke of my backtracking from views which I had held and quoted me on section 31.  I think he must have been disappointed&mdash;and he had the air of being disappointed &mdash;when he failed to find anything dramatically at variance in what I said in Opposition and what I say now.  I would agree there is a difference in emphasis, which you would expect, from being in Opposition to being in Government, but in substance the matter is clear.  I will quote passages, if I may, from the speech I made at the time of the crisis over the Authority which culminated in their dismissal.  In Volume 263, No. 13, column 2492 of the Official Report I said:</P>
    <P>There are two basic questions which should be asked.  The first is: has the conduct of the Authority been such as to justify such drastic, such draconian actions as the Minister has taken and is about to take through the directive and now through what the Press calls &ldquo;the ultimatum&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This was before the actual dismissal of the Authority.</P>
    <P>I would not argue that circumstances could never arise in which such an action would be justified.  If it could be shown that in all their features and in all their news presentation RTE were concerned steadily with building up a pro-IRA atmosphere then in the last resort the State has to be defended.  The State cannot allow itself to be undermined in a deliberate, systematic way through the exploitation and abuse of the freedoms of expression which are enjoyed and of the autonomy of such a body as this.  Has that been the case?</P>
    <P>I went on to say, and I think I was right, that it was not.  I also said at column 2498 of the same debate that:</P>
    <P>We believe that a real threat to the State exists but that the existence of this threat is being used not to defend democratic institutions but to erode them further because we <Col N="1092" /> believe that in modern conditions the degree of autonomy possessed&mdash;it is only a degree but it should be a very strong degree&mdash;by a body like RTE is a major bastion of democracy, democracy including liberty of expression, liberty of discussion.  That is a pillar of democracy, to the same extent as Parliament and the Press in reality.  When any one of these three pillars goes the whole structure is endangered.  There is a tragedy of collusion here, that is to say that the existence of a direct and vicious threat to democracy, coming from illegal organisations, should then be used by the Government who have the duty of defending that democracy, not for defending it but for breaking it down through the humiliation and enforced degeneration of one of the major pillars of that democracy.</P>
    <P>I held that view then and I still hold it and I think that is consistent.  I said towards the end that we entirely supported the Government in the maintenance of law and order and in the enforcement of existing laws but that the Government had taken advantage of this situation in order to extend an arbitrary power and it is against the possible use of arbitrary power that this Bill is directed.  Again it is for the reassertion of the supremacy of Parliament in this area, it is to ensure that the actions of the Government of the day are brought under adequate scrutiny and are such that they can carry the support of Parliament with them, and it is in support and extension and protection of the legitimate authority and autonomy of our public broadcasting system.</P>

      <P>As a result of the representations, not as many closures took place as were originally envisaged by the British.  Specifically, there was a programme of which the British notified us in December to close a number of roads, and in consequence of the representations made from our side two of these, the H.1 and H.2 were not closed.  To that extent, as I have told the House, the representations made by us had the effect of minimising the inconvenience.  The British have been told that the Garda Síochána regard these closures as counter-productive.  We have been making representations at police level <Col N="1094" /> and at Department level and the feeling we now have is that our point is getting through at last.</P>

      <P>The Government support the view that the jurisdiction of coast states with regard to fisheries should be extended.  They consider that this can be most effectively achieved by general agreement among nations. This is, therefore, the Government's position at the UN Law of the Sea Conference where it seems most likely that provisions to this effect will be adopted in any convention which may emerge from the conference.</P>
      <P>The Government are of the view that unilateral action extending jurisdiction might well jeopardise a successful outcome to the conference.  Pending the outcome of the conference, therefore, the Government do not propose to extend the Irish fishing limit unilaterally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE have drawn up a programme for improving reception in areas where it is not fully satisfactory.  Owing to the heavy programme of capital works RTE are facing over the next few years, and the varied demands on scarce capital, it will probably be four <Col N="1095" /> to five years before the programme is completed.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

      <P>The steps I have been taking to deal with the situation are mainly to ensure a far greater capital inflow than in the past, and thereby to step up the connection rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The following are the figures for telephone connections from 1970 up to the present: in 1970, 22,800; in 1971, 21,100; in 1972, 24,000; in 1973, 28,700; in 1974, 31,600 and, in 1975 to date, 31,600.  There has been a steady rise since the change of Government. A comparison between this year and last year shows the monthly connection rate in 1974 was 2,500 and in 1975 it is 2,940.</P>

If that is the interval from the date of the installation of the capital equipment, I presume the Minister will agree that there is a much longer interval from the date of ordering and paying for the connection.  If that is so, the Minister must agree that any increase which occurred in the last few years must arise from what was done before he became Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are both going to be absolutely fair about this, as I think we would wish to be, then the credit or discredit for the condition of the telephone service has to be distributed between the two Governments. We say we inherited a grossly under-capitalised telephone system and we have been trying to catch up.  To be fair, it is also true that in the period immediately preceding the change the last Government were making an effort to compensate for the under-capitalisation of which they had been guilty and the effects of which are shown in the actual fallback in the number of connections in 1971.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there are two kiosks in Mountrath. The nearest one in the Market Square is about half a mile from the centre of the Father O'Connor Crescent&mdash;St. Fintan's Terrace area.  As I have said, in urban areas kiosks are provided only where they are likely to pay their way, or by way of relief for existing heavily used kiosks. Neither of these conditions would be satisfied in the Father O'Connor Crescent-St. Fintan's Terrace area as the number of houses would not be sufficient to support a kiosk.  It would need to be of the order of 200 to 300 untelephoned houses.  The nearest kiosk at the Market Square is not used to an extent which would warrant <Col N="1109" /> provision of an additional kiosk in the area.  Creditable revenue for the year ended 30th June was £400.  It would need to have been £600 before the question of providing an extra kiosk would be due for consideration. Receipts at the second kiosk are even lower.  The Deputy will understand the need for the preservation of rather strict priorities in these matters.  A kiosk is obtainable if the revenue is above a certain point and not below it.  That is the rule which has to be kept.</P>

From a circular which the Minister issued to the local authority representatives less than 12 months ago, my understanding was that, in order to pay its way, a kiosk should be able to attract business to the extent of £180.

      <P>Is the Minister suggesting it is the ratepayers who should now provide telephone kiosks where formerly the Department of Posts and Telegraphs accepted that responsibility? It was a State service.  Now apparently it is to be a service for which the ratepayers will have to pay, as well as everything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the answer to that is in the figure of kiosks provided.  In 1971-72, it was 154, in 1972-73 it was 199 and in 1973-74 it was 205.  As the Deputy is interested in the provision of rural facilities, that figure has also gone up from 116 in 1971 to 166 in 1973-74.</P>

      <P>The numbers of applications made in the periods mentioned were about 600, 800 and 650 respectively.</P>
      <P>Figures of average times from application to installation are not available on a county basis.  However, there is no reason to believe that the average sought is substantially different from the national average of approximately 12 months which I gave to the Deputy earlier in the year in reply to a previous question.</P>

      <P>There are two points involved.  The demand has increased considerably for telephones in County Mayo.  The connection rate, I am happy to say, has also increased from 379 in 1972 to 639 in 1975.  The best we can do for County Mayo, as for other areas, is to try to step up the connection rate and, at the same time, improve the service.

The installations are falling far short of the applications.  Is there not a greater build up of this fall back in Mayo than anywhere else? Is the fact that there was a fall off in applications of over 100 in 1975 a clear message to the Minister that people are frustrated and are not applying for telephones because they have no hope of getting them?</P>

      <P>It is not intended to designate the new telephone exchange at Ballina as auto-manual.  In the automatic system a small number of such centres will suffice for the whole country.  The auto-manual centre for virtually all exchanges in County Mayo including Ballina will be located at Castlebar where installation of the auto-manual exchange equipment has begun.  The existing manual exchange at Ballina will be retained for some years on a reduced scale to handle some of the traffic from the smaller exchanges in the Ballina area until they are converted to automatic working.</P>

Current plans provide for the conversion to automatic working of 29 manual telephone exchanges in County Donegal including all the larger ones. An auto-manual exchange building is at present in course of construction at Letterkenny.  It is expected that the exchange there, which will be the major switching installation for the area, will be brought into service in about three <Col N="1113" /> years and that the other manual exchanges referred to will be converted over the following year or so.  Meanwhile, a number of schemes are in hands to improve the manual service in the county by the provision of additional switchboards and trunk lines.</P>

These include schemes for substantial increases in trunk circuits serving the area and provision of additional switchboards at Letterkenny, Lifford, Carrick-on-Shannon, Donegal, Ballybofey and other exchanges.  The programme for conversion of exchanges to automatic working provides for the conversion within the next four to five years of 29 telephone exchanges in County Donegal, ten in County Leitrim and four in County Sligo including all the larger manual exchanges.</P>

The position should be considerably improved when the number of circuits on the main route for such calls is increased by 30 per cent within the next six months.

      <P>The arrangements approved for the civil service generally were applied in my Department.  Staffs in Dublin offices who were not required for maintenance of essential services were given time off to enable them to pay their respects as the funeral cortège passed.</P>

      <P>The Government have designated the day of the funeral, Tuesday, 2nd September, 1975, as a day of national mourning for the late Mr. de Valera.  Civil servants in the Dublin offices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I may be, but let me give the information I have from my Department.  That is, that the absences which occured and which had to be penalised took place at Athlone, Cork, Dundalk, Galway and Westport.  Instructions in accordance with the circular letter I have read were issued to all Dublin branches and offices of the Department on the 1st September, 1975, and all head postmasters outside Dublin were informed by telegram on the same day that the arrangements made by the Government in connection with the funeral did not involve the closure of any offices, or the granting of time off to civil servants outside the Dublin city area.  I think the whole matter is extremely clear and that my Department acted perfectly properly.</P>

      <P>The stamp programme for the current year originally provided for the issue of seven special stamps.  An eight was added in April last&mdash;which is an unusually late date for a decision on a stamp&mdash;when the Government decided that a stamp should be issued to mark the canonisation of St. Oliver Plunkett. The Revenue Commissioners, who arrange for the production of our stamps, advised that, in the context of total demand on their printing facilities&mdash;of course they do other Government security printing work apart from printing postage stamps&mdash;they would be capable of printing a maximum of six postage stamp issues in 1975, and that only with the working of prolonged overtime.

      <P>The budgetary measures announced by the Minister for Finance on 26th June, 1975, included provision for subsidy for CIE to enable the reduction of the board's fares on Dublin city bus services, <Col N="1123" /> road passenger provincial services and Dublin and Cork commuter rail services to the levels which obtained before 12th May, 1975. These reductions were implemented by CIE with effect from 28th July, 1975.</P>
      <P>The budgetary measures did not extend to mainline rail passenger services or to services provided by private road passenger transport operators. Consequently, no money is available to provide the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company with a subsidy to enable the company to reduce its fares in the northern part of County Donegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister would agree that the object of the subsidy is to reduce the cost of living for the persons using public transport. That being so, would the Minister explain the reasoning which excludes public transport operated by private operators from the benefit of the subsidy; and will he further indicate whether in the assessment of the consumer price index account will be taken of the incidence of transport charges to consumers who use privately operated transport companies?</P>

      <P>The budgetary measures announced by the Minister for Finance on the 26th June, 1975, included a provision for subsidy for CIE (1) to avoid the necessity for further increase in the board's charges of 1975, and (2) to enable the board to reduce their fares on Dublin city bus services, road passenger provincial services and Dublin and Cork commuter rail services to the levels which obtained before 12th May, 1975.  The reductions in fares referred to above were implemented by CIE on 28th July, 1975.  The effect was to reduce the fares in question, on average, by 25 per cent.  The fare reductions were not extended to main line rail fares which have a relatively small weighting in the consumer price index. Neither was any provision made for a reduction in fares on bus services provided by private road passenger transport operators licensed under the Road Transport Acts.  There are 31 <Col N="1124" /> such operators, including the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company operating stage services mostly in rural areas.  The charges by these operators are not reflected in the consumer price index.  Moreover it has never been conceded that road passenger transport operators in the private sector should be subsidised. Extension to private operators of the subsidy given to CIE in the June budget would create a precedent for the payment of further subsidies.</P>
