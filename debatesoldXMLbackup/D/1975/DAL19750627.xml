      <P>The Opposition and myself have agreed a programme of work up to and including 8th July and that does not include finishing the budget debate before the 8th July.  I think the best thing to say is that up to this stage we are agreed and that thereafter matters will take their course.  There is no necessary connection between completing the budget debate and the introduction or passing of the Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with any situation one tries to avoid resorting to old and outworn phrases but there is one such phrase which, like many of them, can be aptly applied to the present situation but I would rather reverse it and put it in what I see as the order of priority, and that is that this budget is too late and too little. It is too late for many reasons, mainly because the Government failed to face up to the economic realities of the situation.  It is too late for other reasons also, perhaps mainly that they saw the force of the case made by the Fianna Fáil Party over six months ago in asking them and in pointing out to them how to come to grips with that situation.</P>
      <P>We suggested, as is now well known and well recorded, means whereby the Government could have eased the extraordinary inflationary position in which we now are.  They refused &mdash; perhaps for obvious political reasons &mdash; to accept the advice we gave them.  Instead, they resorted to glib talk, talk that was designed, I presume, to get them out of the crisis but in effect they talked themselves deeper and deeper into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then they resorted to the expedient of asking anybody and everybody to come to their assistance by way of advice.  The National Economic and Social Council was in existence in which all the elements to which they subsequently appealed were represented &mdash; employers, Government, trade unions and farming interests.  They set up instead a series of working parties, hoping against hope.  I presume, that they would come up with some <Col N="2097" /> solution other than that which was offered to them by a responsible Opposition.  But having waited for months, having sought the advice of these organisations, including the Economic and Social Research Council and other bodies, they ultimately found themselves driven back to reluctant acceptance of what Fianna Fáil had proposed.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that they allowed &mdash; for whatever reason &mdash; over six months to elapse before ultimately coming to grips with the situation.  I think that never in the history of this Oireachtas have an Opposition been proved so precisely accurate in determining the causes of our economic difficulties and suggesting the ways of easing those difficulties.  Never in the history of the Oireachtas have an Opposition been so clearly vindicated in their approach.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's budget is, in effect, the fourth in the two-and-a-quarter years of the period of administration of this Government.  If I add the unwarranted increase of 15p on the gallon of petrol which was introduced by the Government by the device of an Imposition of Duties Order before last Christmas, which brought the most significant sum of £27 million to the Exchequer, one can say that in effect there were five budgets in that period.</P>
    <P>In introducing the January budget the Minister anticipated that there would be yet another budget in the autumn.  He did not advert to that prospect yesterday but, having regard to the fact that his hopes of reducing inflation amounted to a mere 4 per cent of the 24 per cent anticipated, it would seem that more Exchequer moneys will be necessary to provide against the inflationary trend that affects the social welfare benefits introduced in the last budget and therefore I take it we may expect yet another autumn budget. And, because much of the cost of the medicines prescribed yesterday is unknown, I take it this, too, will be a factor in obliging the Government to come again to the Oireachtas for more taxation and more money in the autumn.</P>
    <P>During the course of the previous <Col N="2098" /> formal budgets, if I may distinguish them that way, the budget of April, 1973, the budget of April, 1974, and the budget of January, 1975, we in the Fianna Fáil benches complained that not one of them in any way helped our economy, not one of them had any co-ordinated strategy to maintain growth and to improve our standard of living, rather did they tend to undermine the solid growth that had taken place under the Fianna Fáil Government in the 1960s and right up to 1973, the time of the accession to power of the National Coalition.</P>
    <P>We did not complain at the time at the strategy of deficit budgeting <i>per se</i>, this deficit budgeting which was so markedly contained in these three budgets.  But what we did complain of was the excess amount of these budget deficits and the fact that the moneys that would be necessary to be borrowed in order to cover these deficits were applied, not in any productive fashion as borrowed moneys should be, but rather in the main in the payment of current account.  In ordinary times of recession this strategy would have been bad enough in itself but when recession is coupled with the galloping rate of inflation that we have experienced, in the last year particularly, this maladministration helped only to compound the inflationary trend.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have no intention of compounding the difficulties for the economy that the Government by their lethargy, their neglect and their downright ineptitude have created. Unfortunately, the Government had for many months past deluded themselves into the belief that only outside sources were responsible for the extraordinary rate of inflation from which we are suffering and, indeed, from which we have been suffering for about two years.  Time and time again we pointed out the fact that there were internal forces over which the Government had control and, at least, over which they had influence, internal forces within our own economy which contributed as much as up to 50 per cent of our inflationary rate.  Indeed, the Central Bank <Col N="2099" /> in its autumn 1974 report confirmed what we had been saying in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance yesterday rather reluctantly and, of course, belatedly, as usual, acknowledged that perhaps the outside forces accounted only for 80 per cent of our inflationary trend but now he acknowledges that the inflationary trend since last autumn has been entirely generated from faults within our own system, faults which the Government had the duty and had within their power and capacity to remedy.</P>
    <P>We urged them at the time and indeed time and time again to take some action but the euphoria which attended the coming into office of this Government blinded them to the hard realities of the situation.  For too long they have tried to be a Government of all things to all men, unable to resist demands, demands that they knew were going to cause difficulty for our economy.  They must have known in their hearts that every time they did not face up to reality they were running our economy deeper and deeper into the mire.  At the same time they were, of course, by this lack of action and ignoring of the realities trying to gain political popularity.</P>
    <P>It was indeed longer than six months ago that we urged them to take some action.  We urged them to take action largely along the lines that has now been taken.  Had they done so and had they faced up to the reality of the situation, had they shown political courage then of the type that they are forced to show now, and belatedly forced to show, I believe we could have enjoyed the comparatively satisfactory situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> inflation that is now being enjoyed by every other country in the economic organisations of which we are a member, the OECD and the EEC, with the single exception of Britain.</P>
    <P>Instead of attending to the most serious economic situation that our country has ever faced since the foundation of the State, the Government were engaged in a series of <Col N="2100" /> diversionary tactics or activities.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs commenced the debate on open broadcasting and when he ultimately saw that this was simply not on he just left it there and turned his attention to the stumping of the country with the idea of providing a second TV channel through the expedient of using BBC 1 in its entirety.  It now appears that this too was a wasted effort designed to some extent to divert the attention of the public and especially those in the so-called single channel areas from the dire economic situation.</P>
    <P>Next we had, of course, the diversionary tactic of transferring the Criminal Jurisdiction Bill from the Dáil to the Seanad on what I can only describe as the spurious ground of urgency.  There was a long delay before the Bill was introduced.  It lay on the Order Paper of the Dáil for many months and then, having transferred it to the Seanad, we were faced with the charade of the on again, off again exercise of putting that legislation through the Seanad which, to say the least of it, justifies us in viewing this whole exercise with the greatest suspicion.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was urged time and time again several months ago to take some action against the flood of imports from third countries that were closing down factories and putting thousands of our workers out of employment.  We were inundated with phrases like &ldquo;studying the economic mechanisms and the mixes&rdquo; and various other Madison Avenue expressions but little was done.  In fact, nothing was done on the lines we had suggested, on the lines indeed that other EEC countries had taken to protect employment in the textile and footwear industries particularly.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, glibly the Minister for Finance announced that we are approaching the EEC to see what can be done when we know and were told specifically and when the work force&mdash; another charade &mdash; from the EEC that came to our country around the Christmas time, indicated clearly to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the appropriate remedial action <Col N="2101" /> lay in his own hands but he refused to take it, for whatever reason we on this side of the House cannot comprehend.</P>
    <P>There is possibly another reason why this Coalition Government failed to tackle soon enough and adequately enough our current economic problems and another reason why they have failed to produce any cohesive, long-term strategy to deal effectively with the disastrous spiral of inflation.  This is the dichotomy that exists within the Coalition and which is the very essence of their failure.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat the traditional arguments against coalitions though, they are valid now as they were 25 years ago, but I will pose one basic question.  Will this Government make up their minds and plan or organise our recovery and future economic progress on the basis of a mixed economy which, it seems to me, is the desire of the majority, at least of Fine Gael, or will we have to depend on a socialist planned economy, which I assume to be the aim of the majority of the Labour Party?  Is this the real reason why the Minister for Finance is either unwilling or is not permitted to embark on an economic programme?</P>
    <P>It is this dichotomy that is providing the uncertainty in the present situation, which creates the lack of confidence, as Deputy Colley pointed out yesterday which is crucial in present circumstances. If a realistic programme is impossible, as it seems to be, are we to be faced with recurrent crises of the kind we are now enduring during the remainder of the Government's term of office, whatever period that may be, and a recurrent series of emergency packages that will stave off the worst effects of the situation for a short period?</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that at best that is what yesterday's package will do.  Here I will take the point the Taoiseach made last Sunday that the medicine may be unpleasant but if not taken the consequences will be far worse.  If that medicine is to be dished out or injected in small doses the disease will become immune to these doses and injections and there <Col N="2102" /> will be no possibility for any Government to get out of the morass.  <i>The Irish Times</i> in its leading article today put its finger on the problem:</P>
    <P>There was no Government economic policy worth the name before yesterday's Budget.  Neither is there one today.</P>
    <P>We agree wholeheartedly with what <i>The Irish Times</i> stated in this respect. To continue with the quotation, it states, and I think it is near enough to the Taoiseach's analogy of medicinal injections:</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to make the courageous stand that was required and has limited itself to tinkering with the faulty economic machine when it should have opted for a complete overhaul.</P>
    <P>I will resort to the leader writers in <i>The Irish Independent</i> a couple of days ago.  <i>The Irish Independent</i> is generally regarded as being close to Government thinking &mdash; indeed one might think after yesterday it was privy to it.  They had a most revealing statement:</P>
    <P>The Government has waited for a very long time to see if inflation would moderate of its own accord.</P>
    <P>Therein lies the tragedy of the present situation.  Experienced Governments know that economic difficulties just will not go away of their own accord.  In this crisis, Government neglect to use the means at their disposal at the appropriate time &mdash; this is crucial &mdash; has made the prospect of recovery much more difficult, and even worse, the process of recovery is likely to extend very far into the future.  Not only have they missed and neglected the opportunities to stave off the worst elements of inflation&mdash; a declining standard of living, reduced employment, reduced investment, the turning away of investment and the driving out of foreign investment already here &mdash; in the interests of the people they purport to serve, but they have also missed an economic opportunity in relation to Northern Ireland.  By permitting our economy to sink into a morass along with that of Britain, the Government <Col N="2103" /> have lost the opportunity of inducing Northern Loyalists in their present economic difficulties, which are there as well as the other difficulties, to turn their eyes towards the South for hope and inspiration in their own economic troubles.</P>
    <P>For too long have this Government wallowed in the morass of indecisions; for too long have they neglected to take appropriate action; for too long they have whistled their way past the graveyard of lost opportunities by indecisions; and, I fear, too late have they come to grips with an attempt to find a solution to our extreme problems. Last summer, when unemployment was first starting to rise, the Taoiseach, to give him his due, and later the Minister for Finance referred to the crisis that rising unemployment would bring on us, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce said we were talking ourselves into a crisis.</P>
    <P>Indeed that is what the Government must have done because they did nothing else &mdash; talk and no other action. They spent a long time talking while the crisis was building up around them. Last autumn when Fianna Fáil were calling for action to aid the building industry, our spokesman on Finance said he prayed that his worst fears in relation to that crucial industry would not be realised, but the Minister for Finance said Deputy Colley could rest assured his prayers would be answered and that the Government would provide. What has happened?  If the Government had provided, would there be the present difficulties, indeed crisis, in the building industry?  Would there be the present increasing rate of unemployment?</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister for Labour, Deputy Michael O'Leary is here, I remember him telling the European Parliament last week, at least he was so reported, that it was in the interests of the poorer countries that the West should continue to be prosperous.  Why not apply the logic of this argument to the situation at home?  Is it not the case that whoever is motivating the wealth tax legislation in the Government will not make the poor richer but will make <Col N="2104" /> the rich poorer?  Is it not so that we must do something positive to create wealth and opportunity?  Rather than doing something positive, contrary action is being taken.</P>
    <P>Then, almost in desperation during the last couple of weeks of our Presidency of the EEC, the Minister, blamed the EEC for not coming to grips with unemployment; but he was told, and rightly so, that it was for him to set his own house in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioner for Social Affairs and another spokesman of the EEC, as reported in the Press.  The Minister appealed, belatedly and tragically, to the EEC to solve his problems.  He will not deny that.  However the immediate task is to reduce unemployment and to cut back in so far as we can on inflation.  This budget at least attempts to do this, although it is a belated attempt.  It is based on a contingency, that is, that the national wage agreement be modified.</P>
      <P>By their actions in the past Fianna Fáil have demonstrated their belief in the value of national wage agreements. Apparently, the Government believe in this value, too, and the Minister for Finance endorsed that belief in his budget statement yesterday. We support the Government's request for the modification of the agreement.  We believe that those who are party to it will face up responsibly to the difficulties in which our country finds itself, but we realise that those who are party to the agreement will be reluctant in so far as new national wage agreements are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, part of the drastic price we must pay now for the failure of the Government to act in time is this undermining of confidence in national wage agreements.  This would not have been necessary if the Government had listened to our advice. I said in this House on January 16 that action taken then on the lines we suggested &mdash; action that is being <Col N="2105" /> taken now &mdash; would have immediately caused a 5 per cent reduction in the cost of living, would have stimulated demand and, consequently, kept people in employment.  It would have staved off the then next round of the national wage agreement of ten per cent and which has fuelled further the inflationary fire.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, when asked on radio last night why he did not take that action then, said that to have done so would have been inflationary. What has been the alternative? We have had the most inflationary burst ever experienced.  I demonstrated then exactly how we could have stemmed the inflationary fire but the Minister had the gall to say yesterday that this would have been inflationary.  Could anything have been more inflationary than the failure to take some appropriate action then?</P>
    <P>If the Government had accepted the Fianna Fáil proposals last winter and before the January budget prices would have been cut already and the new national wage agreement would have been negotiated on that basis. Now the unions and the employers are being asked to break the agreement which they signed so recently. At that time there was not a word of warning from the Government, although it was obvious from the terms of that agreement that the economy could not sustain a rate of increase of 24 per cent in prices and wages in the current year.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this aspect, I shall quote what I said on January 16th this year, as reported at column 378 of the Official Report for that day:</P>
    <P>The Government had a clear, speedy and effective remedy open to them to deal with that problem. They could have, and should have reduced prices either by introducing subsidies on food and other essentials or by reducing VAT.  The Minister cannot tell us he could not introduce subsidies on food by reason of our obligations under the EEC because the British did it.  Last summer they introduced a subsidy on bread, flour and, I think, sugar, <Col N="2106" /> costing some hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>If the Government had done either of these things in October or thereabouts it would have cost about £20 million out of the Exchequer at that time.</P>
    <P>On television the Minister had the audacity to say that Fianna Fáil thought these subsidies and VAT reductions could come out of the air but we costed this almost exactly as he costed it yesterday.  We knew we could not get that money other than by imposing taxation.  If he had taken the action then we would have supported the taxation.  We objected to the taxation yesterday because, like the whole package, it was too late. We voted against the resolution imposing this income tax surcharge mainly on that basis.  This was the only means we had of marking our disapproval at that time yesterday and until such time, perhaps, as the Finance Bill comes before us, of marking our disapproval of Government inactivity.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>That would have lowered prices by about 5 per cent for the remainder of the year.  This lowering would have had a comulative effect. It would have kept up spending power and so would have kept thousands of workers off the dole. It would have meant that the payment due under the escalator clause in the national wage agreement in March would have been 5 per cent instead of 10 per cent.  Not only would that have reduced inflation in 1974 but it would also have made a major contribution towards a further reduction in 1975.  It would also have avoided the imposition of the winning of that extra increase by workers which would not have been necessary.  Employers would not have been faced with the added difficulty of paying the extra 5 per cent.  They would not have been faced with the extra problem of having to increase their costs, thereby making them more noncompetitive and pushing up still further the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>However, I have been referring to the <Col N="2107" /> weakening of confidence in national wage agreements and to the drastic price we have had to pay for this.  Already the Government have weakened confidence in another important institution in this field.  They had weakened price control by overruling the recommendations of the National Prices Commission in relation to CIE fares and to ESB charges. Obviously, for the purposes of relieving the Exchequer, the Government ignored those recommendations and increased the fares and charges.  In the subsidisation of CIE fares and the removal of ESB charges from VAT it has been proved again that the Government were wrong.  They have weakened the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister described his budget as one of the most significant to be produced by a Minister for Finance in this State.  I want to say categorically it is no such thing.  This budget does not mean any new departure for the budget. It is a budget of adjustment due to inaccurate assessment at the time of the January budget, inaccurate assessment due to misconception, unsustainable forecasts and, might I add, downright bad Government decisions.</P>
    <P>This budget may have some of the beneficial effects the Government hope in the short term; indeed, I hope it will.  But what of the long-term? Together with the miscalculations of January last, to which I have referred, when the budget deficit stood at £125 million, the present package will bring the deficit to £241.6 million this year, twice as much as the huge deficit forecast in January.  Perhaps I am wrong in saying that the present package will bring that, but maladministration that occurred between January and now, plus the money that would have to be found to pay for the present package, in effect, will have doubled an already huge budget deficit.  We have been told by the Taoiseach that we are living on borrowed time and the goodwill of our creditors.  We are now dependent on twice the goodwill of our creditors and with only half the borrowed time he foresaw.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that between <Col N="2108" /> 15,000 and 20,000 jobs will be created as a result of this budget.  Again I must disagree, because it will do no such thing.  Possibly it will create a mere 6,000 jobs through the injection of £30 million into the construction industry. Incidentally, quite a sizeable portion of that is for expenditure on telephones, to which I do not object, but much of the money will have to be spent by way of importing necessary equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This £30 million will create approximately 6,000 jobs in the construction industry but that is likely to be offset by approximately 2,000 jobs because of a decrease in consumer spending due to the taxation imposed yesterday.  Therefore, as far as I can judge, probably we will have, at least in the short-term, a net increase of some 4,000 jobs.  I believe that what may create more jobs is the contingency which is in this budget, that is, the agreement between the trade unions and employers to modify the wage agreements and, as I have already said, I sincerely hope they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At best and with everything in the budget going as the Minister would want, with everything checking into gear, the level of unemployment at the end of this year, according to independent calculations, will be approximately 120,000 after almost, then, three-and-a-half years of Coalition Government, not a very happy prospect for a Government elected on the promise of increasing employment. <Col N="2109" /> Again, to use an Americanism &mdash; 120,000 unemployed &mdash;&ldquo;big deal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This budget has nothing more than the modest objective of mitigating the worst effects of the January budget. The Government are now endeavouring to combat the domestic inflationary spiral they themselves inspired. But the basic, underlying, problem of lack of confidence in the economy persists and has not been tackled effectively.  What is needed, above all, is a climate which will encourage investment. That is important particularly for manufacturing industry and, of course, for the construction industry also.  Inflation and liquidity problems are immediate obstacles to investment but looming in the background are the Government wealth tax proposals which, as we all know, are sufficient to eliminate and frighten away foreign investment.  There is nothing in the budget to assist industry in coping with these liquidity problems.  There has been no reference to easing credit facilities or reducing tax on manufacturing profits. No action will be taken to ease the effect of imports on the sorely depressed textile industry mainly, and also, the boot and shoe industry.  I refer to the textile industry and am relating the problems not only to imports but to lack of confidence and to wealth tax imposed, in addition to income tax and corporation profits tax, on all industries, on old family-owned Irish industries in particular. Two of those come immediately to mind.  One is being liquidated and the other in the hands of a receiver with little prospect of overall resumption of employment &mdash; some prospect.  I will admit, in parts of it.  I refer to Martin Mahony Brothers of Blarney, a firm hundreds of years old, based initially on family investment.  The textile blizzard was bad enough but, add to that the wealth tax proposals and one can see the difficulties in which such firms are placed.  The same would apply to St. Patrick's Woollen Mills, Douglas, Cork.  I am referring to industries with which I have been familiar for many years, with whose backgrounds I am also familiar and on whose performance I <Col N="2110" /> had occasion to compliment the directors in recent years.  What has been done to help such industries?  Had the Minister for Industry and Commerce taken the action we proposed in time, instead of the kind of laconic reference we got to action in the budget yesterday, then perhaps workers in this industry would still be in their jobs.</P>
    <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Colley, yesterday, I welcome the initiative of the proposed premium employment programme.  Even though it may restore some jobs, it is my belief that it will not encourage new investment. In relation to this employment premium programme I might say that the Government will have to be particularly careful that existing employers do not find themselves at a disadvantage as a result of these new proposals emanating from new ventures which may avail of the scheme while existing employers have not the capacity for taking on additional staff.  I am not deploring the initiative in any way but want to point out the practical and likely difficulty involved in its administration. Another difficulty is that it is a flat-rate premium of £12 up to March next year and £6 up to June of the following year, or is it June of the same year?  &mdash;I am not sure.  Here again, by reason of differential wage rates we have not yet received &mdash; and there was no indication in the Minister's statement of yesterday &mdash; equal pay for women and differentials will continue.  Some employers may take advantage of low rates of wages but get the added advantage of the employment premium at a flat rate.  I suggest that consideration be given to setting the premium at a percentage rather than a fixed rate.  That is, I think, a constructive suggestion because I am sure that when the scheme is examined these anomalies will be bound to be shown up.</P>
    <P>Now, to come to the subsidisation of transport fares and the reduction of VAT on fuel and foodstuffs these are to be welcomed.  Again, it appears as a stop-gap remedy to cure the inadequacies of the budget earlier this year.  In no way is this based on any <Col N="2111" /> long-term solution to present economic difficulties.  As I said already it is contingent on what will happen between the employers and the trade unions.  The Minister has very clearly indicated that the package is not on unless employers and trade unions agree to modify the agreement.  In the meantime the new rate of income tax will have been imposed and the subsidies will have been in existence.  If the employers and trade unions do not respond what will the position be in relation to those two facets of the budget?</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given us any indication except that the Government will withdraw or something to that effect.  As he knows, it is very hard to take a bone from a dog.  It is very hard to remove subsidies even if the <i>raison d'etre</i> of these subsidies is no longer there.  As well as that, the costings of the programme are by no means clear.  The Minister had no idea what the cost of the employment premium scheme will be nor has he given us any clear indication of the cost of the food subsidies and the reduction of VAT on essential commodities and services.</P>
    <P>On another particular of the budget I would like to mention the subject of personal income tax.  We see here anomalies and the problem of one section being asked to bear more than another.  The change-over to PAYE by employees, who are subject to a statutory tax deduction scheme, has not been adequately explained.  In effect, it seems the change over could mean an increase of about 50 per cent in the long term in the tax payable by civil servants, teachers, gardaí, industrial workers employed by the State as well as members of the Oireachtas.  This increase would come about primarily by a change in the year of assessment and, secondly, by means of the income tax charges.  This is what I mean by a round increase of about 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say in the Minister's favour, in relation to the construction industry, that he has provided more funds by increasing the allocation to the Local Loans Fund, that is an increase of £9.5 million, but even this is <Col N="2112" /> hedged around by penny pinching, by which he has found it necessary to increase the level of interest payable to 11½ per cent from 11¼ per cent and increasing the pressure on the new borrower by reducing the period of payment from 35 to 30 years.</P>
    <P>We have a difficulty here.  The problem in relation to stimulating private building has not been tackled at all. The Minister should have granted in this budget the long overdue increase in the maximum loan payable to borrowers under the Local Loans Fund scheme.  As well as that, the reduction in the subvention to the building societies of one quarter of 1 per cent from August next will obviously increase the cost of borrowing in the private building sector.  This is precisely the opposite of what is urgently needed to get the building industry really moving again.</P>
    <P>The budget provides no stimulus whatever for the private sector of the building industry.  While the increased funds are being made available for public housing I am afraid they will be largely beyond the reach of the effective demand due to the failure to increase the maximum loan level.  The huge demand for private housing will, therefore, continue to grow side by side with unemployment in the building industry.</P>
    <P>As a general comment on the package for the construction industry it can be said that had it been presented a year ago it would, perhaps, have prevented the worst of the past year's set-back, but coming at this stage the proposals in current circumstances are just as inadequate as the Minister's measures of last January have proved to be.  It can be fairly said that he has yet again failed to grasp an opportunity and has merely postponed the disaster.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that we would be constructive, that in so far as we can as an Opposition we will try to ensure that the package will be an effective one.  The Minister says that we all have a part to play.  We certainly have, but the part that most of us can play to the best advantage is to encourage, in so far as we have any power of influence, the modification of wage demands along the lines the <Col N="2113" /> Minister has suggested.  I believe those who are party to that wage agreement will be responsible and will recognise the dire circumstances in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying that the Government have now, after two and a half years, clearly shown themselves to be incapable of dealing with economic problems.  Above all, they have clearly shown themselves to be inept in the matter of crises.  Crises will continue to occur.  When they cease to occur in this world then there will be no further need for Governments.  This Government, having proven themselves to be incapable of grapling with crises, we only ask again, for Ireland's sake, do not stay on too long and do not sink us deeper into the economic morass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an insight into the minds of the Opposition that they should seek, on the basis of a speech made by me to the International Labour Organisation in Geneva last Saturday, to read into that speech a criticism of our proposals on capital acquisitions, capital gains tax and the other items going through the House at the present time, designed to equalise the ownership of wealth in our society.  I suppose I should be honoured that the Leader of the Opposition reads my script, but it will be apparent to anybody who read it in its entirety that the very same philosophy runs through that speech to the ILO as runs through the philosophy and thinking behind the current taxation measures brought into the House by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I should also say that I regret that the Leader of the Opposition should seek to bring statements of the Commissioner for Social Affairs into domestic debate in this Parliament.  I do not think the Commissioner for Social Affairs intended his remarks to be used in the sense they were deployed here by the Leader of the Opposition this morning.  I do not think he meant them in that fashion and I regret that the Leader of the Opposition thought it necessary to use them in this Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since much will be heard over the <Col N="2114" /> next few days of the Government's attitude in general towards national agreements, I wish to clarify and confirm what that attitude is to ensure that it is not misrepresented.  I wish to concentrate on some of the aims of the Government's package announced yesterday.</P>
    <P>Inflation and unemployment were the related issues sought to be met in the package measures announced by the Minister for Finance.  What has concerned us is that our ability to provide now and in the future for employment depends on our ability to reduce our rate of inflation to a level which will permit us to sell our export goods competitively. The Minister for Finance yesterday, and I this morning, aim to make it clear that we are not singling out the inflationary potential of wage and salary earners.  We are not singling that potential for inflation alone. Besides the general revision of the taxation code there is the capital gains tax and the capital acquisition tax legislation going through the Dáil.  The Minister made it plain yesterday that control on dividends will follow any revision of the national agreement that may be negotiated by employers and unions in response to the Government's anti-inflationary initiative.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that this Government are committed to the system of national agreements which are the joint creation of unions and employers in recent years.  I know that the Opposition spokesman on Finance often claims authorship for the entire system of national agreements when, in fact, they are the property, the creation, and the joint bargain of employers and unions. National agreements have materially assisted those employees whose bargaining power otherwise would have been insufficient to guarantee them adequate remuneration.  It would be conceded also that national agreements have laid a valuable foundation for linking employee incomes to the overall capacity of the economy.</P>
    <P>Our proposals are designed to create conditions leading to reduced living costs in which the benefits of <Col N="2115" /> the national agreement, freely revised by the parties to that agreement, to meet the Government's anti-inflationary initiative, may accrue to larger numbers of workers than does the present national agreement in the circumstances obtaining before the Government's initiative.  As Deputies may be aware, many firms are invoking that clause of the national agreement which permits them to avoid payment on the plea of economic inability.  Should our initiative succeed in eliciting a positive response from the Employer-Labour Conference, it is to be hoped that many more firms would be in a position to meet their obligations under the national agreement because of the impact of our action in reducing the cost of living.  Secondly, our proposals should enhance our ability as a community to provide more jobs for our people because however beneficial the provisions of the national agreement may be those benefits will be enjoyed only by those who have employment.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that the development in recent years towards centralised wage bargaining involving the complex institutional framework of the Employer-Labour Conference has the full support of this Administration.  This development towards centralised wage bargaining reflects a growing maturity in our industrial society.  It reflects a growing awareness on the part of employers and unions that in dealing with the complicated problems of pay increases, differentials, productivity and working conditions generally, these elements require centralised wage bargaining. Before we knock that agreement and the achievements associated with it we should remember that it is a new development for which there is no precedent or equivalent in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that the Opposition spokesman on Finance considered he was the author of these agreements.  I already gave him credit for this delusion of his.  Before national agreements came into being we topped the table of the ILO for mandays lost through industrial disputes. While we can never completely prevent public inconvenience through serious industrial disputes, because this is after all a free society, national agreements have bestowed on our industrial relations a system of relative tranquility, a tranquility in sharp contrast to the confrontation of the last decade.  That contrast is highlighted by the fact that in 1970 one million mandays were lost and that figure has been reduced to one-fifth of the amount for 1971, 1972 and 1973 and halved in 1974.  This is not to minimise the dislocation and hardship caused by any individual dispute but to put the record right.  It is important that we should point out the contrast that obtained in greater and general industrial disruption before the advent of the agreement and the position obtaining after its coming into existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1975 national agreement is the successor of agreements which have brought many constructive achievements in their train, more industrial peace and a more orderly increase in incomes as well as the important socially just element of improving the lot of lower paid workers whose position could not have been improved had they been forced to bargain in the position of the so-called free-for-all which obtained generally before 1970.  Before that year their incomes, their capacity to bargain and the incomes <Col N="2117" /> they obtained dropped back but since the inception of the national agreements their position has improved.</P>
    <P>The effect of the 1975 national agreement in a time of high inflation has been to bring about a closer correspondence between pay increases and increases in the cost of living. During a period in which there is no real growth in the economy because of world depression, the national agreement should be designed to ensure that pay increases are directly related to cost of living increases. This was the general intention of both sides in drawing up the present agreement and the trade unions, in particular, are to be commended for the responsible and serious attitude which characterised their general approach in the negotiations preceding the agreement.</P>
    <P>A new situation has been created because of the Government's prices package introduced yesterday.  These measures will, if successful, result in lowering the rate of inflation below what the Employer-Labour Conference anticipated when concluding the current national agreement in January.  As the Minister for Finance said yesterday:</P>
    <P>What we are asking is that, in return for a slowing down of price increases, there should be a corresponding slow down of income increases.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable request and a logical extension of the principles upon which the existing agreement is founded.  Should this request be acceded to it would not derogate from the terms of the agreement and neither would it violate its original intent of linking prices and pay increases. It would be no more than a new response to the new situation created by Government initiative.</P>
    <P>What are the elements in that new situation?  The new situation is as follows.  In the quarter ending mid-September the consumer price index should rise by far less than the 4 per cent minimum pay increase provided for in the national pay agreement.  If <Col N="2118" /> the 4 per cent floor agreed upon in that agreement is not modified in a sensible manner so as to relate directly to the actual consumer price increases, then the effect of the national pay agreement would indeed be inflationary. It can honestly be said that yesterday's package brings down the rate of inflation.  Logically, therefore, it must bring about a corresponding modification of the national agreement. If this course of action is followed it will not involve a cut in real incomes but it will ensure a slowing down in inflation and a real boost to employment.  The Government have asked the Employer/Labour Conference to reconvene and to consider <i>in toto</i> the package for inflation and unemployment.</P>

      <P>We must, of course, consider that.  We have a legacy of suspicion in this area, suspicion that can be addressed to the most genuine offer in any circumstances.  We must remember that throughout the sixties wage and salary earners were the whipping boys of every White Paper on the economy which emerged from the hands of successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance.  Wage and salary earners were constantly castigated as the major culprits responsible for all economic problems.  Such is the legacy of suspicion arising out of this obsession on the part of our predecessors to penalise wage and salary earners that today, when genuine co-operation based on the Administration's ambition to save as many jobs as possible is required, legitimate suspicion as a result of past experience of wage and salary earners at the hands of previous Governments is bound to arise.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;fiscal measures designed to put the burden on those who can bear the burden easiest, even in these difficult times, and finally the use of the banks as a major source of credit.  This is the Government's contribution to moderating inflation and stimulating employment.  Legitimately, I think, the Government can expect a corresponding contribution of equal magnitude from the Employer/Labour Conference.  This can best be done by introducing a new element of flexibility into the provisions of the existing national pay agreement so that pay increases are proportionate to price increases. If this is done over the remaining phases we will have taken a major step forward in restoring our cost competitiveness, reducing inflation and saving jobs, not injuring the existing or any future national agreement but ensuring by our initiative on inflation that this and future agreements will positively assist us in our efforts to keep jobs at a maximum by our investment policy.  This was the objective of the Government's measures announced yesterday.</P>

      <P>We have had the usual criticisms from the Opposition on this occasion.  We have heard them many times before and, no doubt, during this debate we will hear them again.  We have heard the criticism of the excessive deficit budgeting engaged upon by this Government deliberately to maintain employment at a time of international recession.  The Opposition have, of course, been very coy in the quality of their criticism of this aspect of Government policy. Deputy Colley, leader of one of the parties in the coalition opposite, referred to the large budget deficits for unproductive purposes, deficits that were in the main produced because of political weakness and not for economic reasons.  As I say, there has been a certain coyness in the Opposition's criticism of this deficit budgeting of ours.  They do not go so far as to say we should cut down on the capital programme.  No, they say that is not large enough.  They do not go so far as to criticise our proposals in welfare.  No, we do not go far enough there.  Generally speaking, when this Government attempt to maintain demand at as high a level as possible in the home economy, we are criticised by the Opposition because our expenditure is excessive.  They will have to make up their minds.  Let them state openly in what areas they would like to see Government expenditure cut. In social welfare services?  In health services?  In our expenditure on training which, this year, has been substantially increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is needed, and this is what the <Col N="2122" /> Government are keeping, is a delicate balance of expenditure which, while attempting to control inflation, aids the creation of new jobs and lightens the hardship in terms of social welfare benefits for those who are unemployed. Let the Opposition state clearly whether they want us to defeat inflation by permitting our unemployment to find its own level in the market.  Let them state if that is their prime objective.  Let them state if that would be their prime weapon in reducing the present rate of inflation.  That measure could be open to us.  That remedy is there and it has been used by other countries whose rate of inflation is less than ours.  It has been used in Germany where the highest unemployment since the war is coupled with the lowest rate of inflation in Europe. The leader of the Opposition this morning spoke of a criteria of experienced government.  Admittedly, the party opposite have not had much experience of Opposition yet but they certainly had many years of experience in Government and one would expect them, based on that experience, to come forward and on credit of that responsibility which they now claim is theirs in Opposition, spell out the expenditure cuts required.</P>

      <P>One of the important elements in the package announced yesterday by the Minister for Finance was the premium employment programme. This represents a new departure in our economic policy and is designed for the first time to give a subsidy to labour in preference to the more traditional grants and aids to capital investment.  The scheme has been drawn by the officials of the Department of Labour and the Department of Finance.  We have been working on it for some weeks now and we think we have a scheme that will be of positive assistance to the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the introduction of this new scheme resides in the fact that because of our high rate of inflation and because of the present recession many manufacturers may prove <Col N="2123" /> to be reluctant in preparing for economic recovery.  Consequently when the recovery takes place they may find themselves unprepared in terms of manpower to take advantage of the general improvement in economic conditions. We hope to prevent this time lag between improvement in the general economy and the employment situation occurring by providing financial incentives to employers which will encourage them to re-employ workers.</P>
    <P>The new premium employment programme will be administered through the national manpower service of my Department.  The staff of that service will advise employers on the operation of the programme and I have already taken steps to ensure that as and from today information will be readily available to employers who are interested in the operation of the programme. Subject to details and regulations which will be available next week, the scheme is based on the principle that employers who increase their work force above the level of the 20th June, 1975, will receive a premium of £12 per week in respect of each additional employee who has been in receipt of unemployment benefit within the last year and who has been on the live register for four weeks prior to his re-employment under this scheme.  In effect, therefore, it can be seen that the premium employment programme is primarily designed to re-employ those workers who have been recently laid off.</P>
    <P>Our unemployment problem has been largely intensified within the last 12 months, and this programme is specifically designed to ameliorate the short term difficulties which have thrown workers out of employment. The attraction of the scheme lies in the fact that employers will now find the cost to them of re-employing workers considerably reduced.  It should prove particularly attractive in labour intensive industries and in some of our more traditional industries whose cost competitiveness has been most seriously affected by our current rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>It will, I hope, help us to grapple with the cost effects of the inflationary <Col N="2124" /> spiral, and it should encourage employers into the belief that they can invest with confidence not only in capital equipment but also in the necessary skills of the labour force which will be required to take advantage of the up-swing in the world economy when that gets under way next year.</P>
    <P>It should be particularly beneficial in helping to absorb spare capacity which the Confederation of Irish Industry admitted this morning exists in industry.  The Confederation estimated that due to decline in demand industry is operating at about 15 to 20 per cent below capacity.  This is a great waste not only of economic resources but of social skills and manpower.  We have done our utmost to lessen the social hardship caused by unemployment through increases in unemployment benefits, the extension of pay-related benefits and redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>Both the Tánaiste and his Parliamentary Secretary have worked ceaselessly to ensure that at this time of unparalleled economic difficulties for our people the weakest in our society should be protected and defended. These measures, however, deal with the effects rather than with the causes of unemployment.  The purpose of the new programme is to come to grips with one of the causes, that is, the growing lack of competitiveness in Irish industry due to spiralling increases in unit labour costs.</P>
    <P>I hope employers will take note of the Government's determination to moderate the rate of inflation.  They should draw confidence from the fact that we are acting and they should plan for an increase in demand and general economic activity over the next 12 months.  It is therefore important for them to plan now for future expansion by investing in plant and equipment.  It is equally important that they should plan for the future by expanding their labour force wherever possible and by intensifying the skills of their workers.  As Deputies may be aware we are spending the largest amount ever this year on training and retraining with precisely the same objectives in mind.  Over the next 12 months they will get assistance from the Government in this <Col N="2125" /> expansion of forward planning, and that assistance will be available at a diminished rate over the second half of next year.  If employers avail of the scheme it should prove a substantial boost to employment prospects. It is not possible at this stage to estimate the cost of the programme because we cannot forecast the rate at which the Government's offer will be taken up by employers.  So far as it is in my power there will be no ceiling to the cost of this programme.  It will be pushed forward with the greatest possible energy by the officials of my Department.  It is sufficient for me to say at this stage that whatever money is required to finance the programmes along the lines I have indicated will be made available by the Government.  Our experience will of course teach us a great deal about its operation as it evolves but one thing can be certain, it will not fail by an absence of commitment on the part of the Government for its success.</P>
    <P>I do not know if previous Ministers for Labour have been critical of this lack in the general conception of a Department of Labour here, but I have been critical of the absence of any role of the Department in employment creation.  At present we do not have a role in the creation of employment, but we have a role in supplying labour.  Therefore I welcome this challenge which has been given to my Department for the first time to play their part in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a clear choice before us as a result of the passage of Government measures announced yesterday. We may continue to absorb scarce resources of capital in current expenditure, or we may voluntarily agree to stay income expectations over this period of exceptional difficulty, directing all available resources into capital job creating projects, or we may opt for higher incomes resulting in a reduced number of workers in a contracting industrial sector, while the numbers unemployed increased.  It may come as a surprise to some people to know that the question of control of incomes lies in the hands of free citizens in a democracy.  No <Col N="2126" /> Government in any democracy I know of may control this question.  Therefore there is a free choice before citizens in a democracy on this supreme question: higher incomes or less jobs.</P>
    <P>Again, employees in secure employment may continue their chase for special treatment only at the expense of others who do not have jobs.  Relativities may be urged on the particular justice or case, say, in the public service or in any area of secure employment. Surely the relativity which should govern all our behaviour on the income front at present is the supreme relativity between having a job and not having a job.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the package announced by us will meet with a positive response from the leaders of our trade union movement who are more aware than most of the ravages of unemployment. We have never claimed as an Administration that the fortunes of the Irish economy have been solely in the hands of the Irish people or their Government.  For good or bad we are part of an international economic community in relation to European and wider world markets.</P>
    <P>This morning the Leader of the Opposition did me the honour of referring to my presidency of the Council of Social Affairs.  As he said quite rightly that is coming to a close.  I know he has many weighty matters on his mind watching the conflicting claims of the various sections which comprise the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I know he has these matters on his mind and, therefore, one might excuse the fact that he might not be too up to date on the policy measures pursued by me in my presidency of the Council of Social Affairs.  For the record, I should say that it was not last week I was looking for a united European initiative on the question of unemployment. Last December at a meeting of a European body called The Standing Committee for Employment, an institution comprising employers, unions and Government representatives of <Col N="2127" /> the EEC, the call went out for a conjunction of social and economic policies throughout Europe in an effort to solve the problem of unemployment. It was suggested that there should be a European initiative and that we should not simply wait for the American recovery to take place to save all of us.  There is nothing particularly original in the pursuit of such a policy, but it was not an invention of last week as the Leader of the Opposition seemed to think.</P>
      <P>As reported in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 24th June, 1975, the German Chancellor in an interview with a German newspaper said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... national economic programmes will work now and in the future only in a limited way...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He continued:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...parallel policies in the most important industrial countries are the precondition for recovery from the worst economic recession since the 1930.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He concluded by saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...In so far as psychology is concerned, New York is the capital of the world economy.  So long as American economic pessimism remains as marked as it has been in recent months a turn for the better in the world economy appears to be ruled out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the German Chancellor, who is the leader of the leading industrial country in Europe, admitting the limitation of national programmes to save employment.  We are criticised by the Opposition who state that it is a failure of domestic policy which has contributed to present unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had better not emulate the example of the Opposition spokesman on Finance who spent a great portion of his speech yesterday proving how right he had been over the past two years.  I remember a time when he could have been called the Fianna Fáil Savonarola of the 1960s.  He was the critic of low standards in high places.  He has played several roles.  I remember my colleague the late Seán <Col N="2128" /> Dunne saying at one stage that Deputy Colley aspired to a Robert Emmett role because of some handouts which appeared from a State company which suggested that he wished to pursue this kind of role in Irish politics.  Yesterday he considered it a matter of amusement to mention the name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, probably the most distinguished Foreign Minister in the history of this State, and certainly the most distinguished President of the European Community since its foundation.</P>

      <P>The leader of that faction in the Opposition party, Deputy Colley, will be an essential prop to an election victory for this Administration, as he was in the television interview with the present Minister for Foreign Affairs in the last election.  We will need his help the next time and I am sure we will get it.  On the evidence of his speech yesterday, I am sure he will be in as good form as ever to produce an election defeat for his own party.</P>
      <P>I was putting the record right in relation to some wrong attributions to the policy I have been pursuing as President of the Council of Social Affairs.  I had better not emulate the Opposition spokesman on finance in avoiding more important items by constant references to my own past statements.  I thought it important to put the record right.  I see I am in good company in suggesting that the problems before us require the co-operation of many countries if we are to succeed in overcoming the present crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While admitting that many problems are outside our control, the objective of the Government has been to shield our economy in so far as that is possible against the adverse effects of worldwide conditions.  To a large extent we have been successful. The percentage increase in unemployment in Ireland is less than it is in many other European countries.  It is true that our unemployment has always been inordinately high by <Col N="2129" /> European standards.  The percentage increase is less than it is in other countries and, had we adopted a different approach to our budgeting, it could have been far more.  That achievement in keeping down unemployment to the admittedly high level at present has been due in no small measure to the budgetary policies of this Government over the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>Despite this achievement we have not been successful in moderating the rate of price inflation.  On the most recently available figures, the rate of inflation in Britain has exceeded our rate.  The latest consumer price index in Ireland shows an easing off in our inflation rate.  In the Government's judgment, now is the time to combat the rate of inflation we have been experiencing. We have chosen this time of upturn to commence a prices offensive, this time in which the major economies appear to be improving their economic performance still without effect in those economies on the figures of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday President Ford's economic advisers were saying their unemployment rate would still persist well into the early part of next year. There is an upturn in these major economies which is necessary to defeat unemployment here.  Whatever resources we deploy in this area are necessarily limited.  Any resources which are confined to maintaining demand in a contracting home market are necessarily limited.  For full recovery in employment, we need recovery in major industrial countries. This is a time at which an initiative can be taken with some hope.  That is why we have chosen this as an opportune time to strike at price increases and price inflation.  The measures announced yesterday should bring the rate of inflation down further than that recorded before our initiative.</P>
    <P>If the measures we propose are accepted, it can confidently be predicted that our rate of inflation can be reduced to close to 20 per cent over the year and we can begin the process of winding down the price spiral which has so afflicted our economy over the <Col N="2130" /> past years.  This is the opportunity which lies ahead of us, the opportunity to end the useless wages-prices spiral. I do not wish in any way to underestimate the gravity of the position.  Nor do I underestimate the hardship increased unemployment has caused. Neither am I pessimistic about our ability to pull through our present difficulties. We have been through a very difficult period, a very testing period, and we are now approaching a period of recovery.</P>
    <P>The international indicators of business confidence show the first signs of upturn.  The Government are determined that no opportunities will be lost and that our economy will be fully prepared not only to take advantage of the worldwide recovery but to be in the vanguard of those economies leading the way to a period of greater growth.  To do all these things involves two equally important pre-conditions&mdash; a reduction in our rate of inflation and a stimulation of employment.  I am confident, and so are the other members of this Administration, that the package of measures announced by the Government yesterday will help us to this end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not an occasion for a debate which would concern itself with political exchanges and in so far as I was tempted into some intemperate responses I apologise to the Chair and the House for them.  The situation in which we find ourselves furthermore is one which decries any suggestion that we should attack each other on matters of detail and I do not propose to go too deeply into the details of this package.  The main emphasis of the remarks of the Minister for Labour seemed to be directed to the case that because of the international situation there was need for international action to enable us to overcome our difficulties.  He is going completely contrary to the views expressed by the Minister for Finance yesterday when he said that &ldquo;this means that for the next year or more we shall have to tackle and solve our economic problems largely on our own and without the benefit of the growth in international trade.&rdquo;  I think the <Col N="2131" /> Minister for Finance has the right approach in that statement.</P>
      <P>We should not be concerned with scoring political points but we are concerned with the whole question of the courage and competence of this Government to face the most deep seated, far-reaching economic collapse that has ever overtaken this country. If it is decided that this Government have not that courage and competence, it should go now before the catastrophe becomes irreversible and the very foundations of our nation are engulfed by it.  It is relevant to examine the performance of the Government up to this point as the managers of our economy and to look at the reasons why that management has led us into this frightening situation and in that way and by such an examination we can assess whether there is any reasonable prospect of this Government getting us out of this situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the universal reaction to the Government's proposals of yesterday was one of sickening disappointment. That seemed to be the general reaction last evening and it deepened this morning as a full realisation of the pitiful inadequacy of the Government's proposals became fully and generally realised.  In a situation which called for a major economic attack, for tough, realistic measures the Minister has produced a pitifully inadequate set of proposals. I believe there is widespread and universal agreement this morning that this package will not work.  Apart from the timidity and inadequacy of these measures and the number of key issues which are not grasped but are simply adverted to by the Minister as being put aside for further discussion, the whole approach in this package is self-defeating.  No matter what gloss a glib commentator may seek to put on budget deficits the simple truth is that they are a major cause of inflation and the result of yesterday's proposals will be to swell the budget deficit for this year to a massive £241 million at least.  That represents 18 per cent of the total <Col N="2132" /> budget and it is clear to me that it is self-defeating, contradictory, meaningless, nonsense for the Government to put before the nation a set of proposals whose stated aim is to arrest inflation when one inevitable outcome of those proposals is a budget deficit which must in itself positively contribute to inflation.</P>
    <P>An integral part of yesterday's package, an essential element, should have been a realistic attempt to get the public finances under some degree of control and either on the expenditure side or the taxation side to get this inflation generating deficit down to some significant degree.  I believe that because there is not an attempt to do so, because the Government either have not the courage or the political will or the political unity to enable them to come to grips with escalating public expenditure and escalating budget deficits, this whole package is doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly legitimate to criticise this package on its timing because timing is of very great importance and significance in all economic matters. Why are we only getting this package now?  Unemployment has been steadily increasing for over 12 months; inflation has been raging unchecked for over 12 months and only now are the Government finally bracing themselves to attempt to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to look back at the progress of inflation over the last few years.  In the sixties, the period which the Minister for Labour just now seemed to infer was a time when we had a badly managed economy, inflation was running consistently about 3 per cent per annum.  In 1970 it went to 8 per cent; in 1971, to 9 per cent; in 1972, it went back to 8 per cent; in 1973 it moved up again&mdash;11 per cent; in 1974 it went to 17 per cent and in 1975 it is estimated it will be 24 per cent or 25 per cent.  I remember many years ago coming back from South America having been to Rio de Janeiro to a meeting of the International Monetary Fund and being absolutely aghast to find that in some South American countries the rate of inflation was 25 per cent.  At that time the idea that any European country <Col N="2133" /> would ever find itself with a rate of inflation of 25 per cent was laughable.</P>
    <P>With that steady march of inflation since this Government took office, why are we only now getting some sort of attempt to come to grips with it?  The fact that the national wage agreement was looming up in March or April of this year was known for a long time.  It was something which the Government were aware of in the early months of this year.  Nevertheless, the Government, either in their budget of January of this year or in the months which led up to the national wage agreement, took no action whatsoever to anticipate the effects of that agreement or to influence its character in any way.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance have just published their annual statement on the economy.  The annual statement is entitled <i>A Review of 1974</i> and <i>Present Outlook</i>.  I do not need to remind the House that the Department of Finance are the Government's principal agent of economic management and have overall responsibility for the formulation and implementation of economic and fiscal policy.  This review, therefore, is the official authoritative statement of the Government's view on economic matters, their assessment of the performance of the economy and of the outlook for the year ahead.  The review published a week ago contains the following statement and there is no qualification to this statement:</P>
    <P>Planned income increases in 1975 superimposed on 1974 income levels for non-agricultural employees will give pay increases far in excess of any possible productivity growth and beyond the capacity of the economy to bear.</P>
    <P>That is a positive, unequivocal statement just issued by the Department of Finance and we must take it as representing the Government's view of pay and wages and income.  It says that the pay increases provided in the national wage agreement are far beyond the capacity of the economy to bear.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be a clear condemnation by the Government of the terms of the national pay agreement <Col N="2134" /> which was signed in April and it must have been the view of the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance at the time that agreement was signed.  Why, then, did the Minister for Finance not make public this vitally important, this crucial assessment of the implications of that national pay agreement at that time? Why did he not warn the parties to the agreement of what he deemed to be the reality of the position?  I believe that he had a solemn responsibility as Minister for Finance at the time those negotiations were being conducted to convey to the parties to the agreement that view of his so that they could conduct their negotiations in the light of that assessment.  He did not discharge that duty at that time. Indeed, not alone did he not say anything but he permitted this neophyte Minister for Labour to issue a statement at the time, as far as I remember, welcoming the agreement.</P>
    <P>That, I believe, was a massive piece of fraud on the part of the Government and the Minister for Finance. They stood by at that time and let the parties to the national wage agreement proceed to adopt it and to sign it as if all was well, that the terms of the agreement which were being hammered out were compatible with our economic prospects, when the Government knew, the Minister for Finance knew and the Department of Finance knew that the economy just could not support the terms as they emerged.</P>
    <P>How now can this Government have the audacity to ask that that agreement be set aside?  How can they ask the parties to that agreement to set the agreement aside?  These parties are fully entitled to say to the Government, &ldquo;If you knew at the time that the terms to this agreement were unsustainable, why did you not tell us so?&rdquo;  The parties to the agreement are perfectly entitled to say to the Government that by the Government's silence at that time they, both employers and employees, were deceived and led into signing an agreement which they thought was perfectly in keeping with the economic situation and which the Government knew was not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2135" /> Therefore, the responsibility for this unfortunate and, perhaps, irreconcilable confrontation which is now looming up between the Government, the employers and the representatives of employees is directly attributable to the Government and arises from their failure to accept their duty to make the statement at that time.</P>

      <P>The capital expenditure and the borrowing programme of the Government for this year present a complex and intimidating picture. Now that this staggering budget deficit of £241 million, at least, has been added to the amount which has to be borrowed, the total borrowing requirement of the Government is £824 million.  When every conceivable internal source has been tapped, when every fund has been raided, when the commercial banks have been pressurised into providing £196 million, when £120 million has been raised from the general public, there still remains a shortfall, described in these days as residual borrowing, of £276 million and that £276 million has to be borrowed from some source which is as yet unknown or undisclosed. Presumably it will have to be borrowed abroad.  The major crucial question is: can that be done?  From what sources can that huge additional sum be raised &mdash; £276 million over and above every possible known source that can be approached?</P>
      <P>The Central Bank gave an indication in their 1975 report that, rather than have the Government borrow abroad excessively, the bank was prepared:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2136" /> to help in financing the borrowing requirements on the basis of substantial adherence to the budgetary dispositions and in the context of the objectives of monetary policy set out in the <i>Statement of Monetary Policy, 1975.</i></P>
    <P>What now is the position of the Central Bank to be?  The budgetary dispositions of January last have of course been totally breached and discarded. The Minister for Finance yesterday said it is proposed to have further discussions with the Central Bank in the light of the revised dispositions. He recognises that the Central Bank's undertaking to discuss the Government's borrowing requirements in the light of the budgetary dispositions of January and the bank's monetary policy being substantially adhered to no longer applies and he proposes now to have new discussions with the bank on the basis of these new budgetary dispositions.</P>
    <P>Why have not those discussions already taken place?  The Minister came in here yesterday with, from his point of view, a major set of economic proposals.  Why was the Central Bank not involved?  Are we to assume the Central Bank were not involved in the preparation of that set of proposals? If they were, did they agree with them?  Why is it necessary for the Minister to tell us, as he did yesterday, that he will now go back to the Central Bank to have discussions with them about his borrowing requirements? We could have expected in this crisis situation with which we are confronted that the Government would have come to us, to the House and the nation, with the full agreement and consent of the Central Bank to what they were doing, and with the role of the Central Bank in what was required to be done fully understood and spelled out.</P>
    <P>It is relevant for us to inquire what the Government will be asking the Central Bank for in these discussions. The Central Bank have a very solemn national duty imposed on them by statute, and that is to protect the currency of this country.  The Central Bank must not in any circumstances deviate in any way from that responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2137" /> It is also important to look at the position of the commercial banks and their role in the remaining months of this year.  The role these banks play in our economy is one of the greatest possible significance.  The commercial banks have been called on, according to the Minister's statement yesterday, to provide a massive £196 million towards Government borrowing this year.  In addition, the Minister explained to us yesterday, they are being asked to provide £40 million for private housing purposes which is not within the normal ambit of bank lending.  That is a total of £236 million the banking system is being called on to provide this year.</P>
    <P>To put that figure into some sort of perspective, I would point out that in February of this year, the latest date for which we have figures, the total lending of the banking system to the Government was £471 million. The Government had outstanding to the banks a total of £471 million.  It does not take any great arithmetical calculation to know that the amount they are now being called on to provide, £236 million, is a full 50 per cent of the total amount outstanding in February this year.</P>
    <P>To help to visualise the enormity of this situation and to put it into perspective, in February, 1975, the total lending of the banking system to both public and private sectors &mdash; the Government and the private sector &mdash; was £1,850 million to £1,860 million.  In that context, the figure of £236 million which the banks are now being called on to provide for Government purposes is of very great significance.  I think it will involve a major recasting of the ratio of the banks' lending between the public and private sectors, and I should like to know from the Government what are its implications.  Deputy Colley yesterday asked did it have any significance from the point of the banks' capacity to lend to industry and trade and business.  The simple answer is that it must have.  It is well known that the commercial banks are already, in the public interest, supporting a considerable number of firms which otherwise, if normal commercial tests were applied, would fail.  On top <Col N="2138" /> of that they now have this onerous burden of being called upon to provide an additional £236 million for Government purposes.  I believe that in this whole area of the management of the capital resources of this land we are getting very close indeed to the plimsol line.</P>
    <P>The provision of employment, wellpaid permanent employment at the highest possible level, should be a central aim of any Irish economic policy. With us in Fianna Fáil it always was. It is basically and fundamentally erroneous to think we can have some sort of super welfare state here simply by manipulating existing resources.  That sort of pernicious thinking seems to me to have firmly established itself in the minds of this Government.</P>

      <P>I will repeat what I said.  I said it is fundamentally erroneous to think you can create a welfare state simply by manipulating the existing resources.  I challenge contradiction on that.  That seems to me to be the sort of mentality which has got a grip of this Government and it reached the high water mark when the Minister for Finance boasted in Killarney that we had the highest paid unemployed in Europe.  I believe the situation in regard to employment at present is starkly clear and uncompromising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 100,000 persons unemployed.  The annual addition to our work force is about 50,000.  In normal times, about 25,000 of that additional 50,000 has been absorbed into the institutional framework. That leaves us with at least 25,000 additional people to be catered for each year &mdash; 25,000 new jobs must be created every year if the situation is not to deteriorate, apart from the job losses that have become a feature of recent months.  We are faced with 100,000 unemployed now and the inevitable prospect, if present trends <Col N="2139" /> continue, and taking the most optimistic view of those trends, of 200,000 persons being unemployed in this country in three or four years' time.</P>
    <P>There is no economist who can point to any way in which that situation will not arise with the present trends and that is taking an optimistic view.  It is in the light of that threatening, intimidating and frightening situation that this Government's proposals are inadequate and can be seen clearly to be inadequate.  In the package outlined by the Minister yesterday there is no serious attempts to come to grips with that employment reality.</P>
    <P>The particularly pitiable aspect of the proposals is their failure to hold out any hope for the school leavers of this year, next year and the year after.  In so far as the employment premium will have any impact, it will result in taking people off the live register but it will have no benefit for school leavers.  Far from taking any positive and comprehensive series of measures to provide employment the Government's approach yesterday was to put employment on one side, to put aside the provision of new jobs for further discussion at a later date.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement contains the extraordinary dictum &ldquo;that unemployment which is a chronic and corrosive evil with deplorable social effects is an inevitable consequence of inflation&rdquo;.  It is difficult for me or for anybody else to make sense of that statement.  That is not an <i>ex tempor</i> statement made by one of us here in the course of a speech.  It is a considered statement which is included in the Minister's solemn prepared pronouncement to the House yesterday.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is not and should never be accepted to be chronic.  It might be corrosive but no Government worth their salt would ever accept it as being chronic.  Neither is it an inevitable consequence of inflation. At certain times it is legitimate and orthodox to take some inflationary measures in order to stimulate employment.  Perhaps it is true that in this current unprecedented situation in which we find ourselves inflation is a contributory factor to the <Col N="2140" /> high level of unemployment but that is no justification for this sweeping generalisation of the Minister's.  If that is the sort of thinking in the mind of the Minister and of the Department, the outlook is bleak.  This is the sort of error of judgment that is giving rise to the Minister's failure to take any positive action to create employment. It is one of the major inadequacies of his proposals which contain nothing that is directed to the physical creation of as much as one new job.  Because of that the Government have failed to confront the situation in its reality.  The Minister for Finance, too, is wrong fundamentally in his refusal to attempt any sort of planning.  He reiterated that attitude yesterday.  It is precisely because the situation is bad, is so difficult and intimidating that some sort of planning is needed, some attempt to peer into the future and to plot some sort of path for the economy and to try to force the pace in some way.</P>
    <P>The present economic crisis is the most deep-seated and fundamental that this country has ever faced. Allied to our massive unemployment figures is the problem of inflation. This is not a sort of situation that can be met by tinkering, by minor adjustments or by adding a bit here and taking it off there.  It is no time for horse trading between different sections of the community or even between different sections of the Government. It is not a time for soaking the rich in order to get an agreement to moderate income demands.  It is a time for inspired leadership, for radical sweeping measures and for major initiatives on the part of the Government. It is not a time for the Government to think they are fulfilling their duty by creating conditions.  There are times, perhaps, when that would be sufficient but this is not one of those times.</P>
    <P>These proposals of the Government lack the breadth, the pace and the comprehensiveness which the present situation requires.  Among the measures required is a major thrust in the field of employment possibly on a three-, four- or five-year basis.  What we need is a plan for that period <Col N="2141" /> for the physical creation of employment. There are no fiscal arguments of which I am aware against such a direct course being taken by the Government at this time.  Perhaps there are times when such a programme could not be contemplated on fiscal grounds but this is not such a time. If we recognise the broad elements in the situation and take a courageous view, such a programme of physical job creation by the Government would recommend itself to any competent administration.  Fortunately, the balance of payments situation does not inhibit any such programme.  It is the type of programme that could be undertaken within the framework of the existing internal financial situation, perhaps by a remarshalling and a redirection of existing expenditures.</P>
    <P>As this is an unprecedented situation, let us take unprecedented measures to deal with it.  If necessary, let us be a little unorthodox and if the demand is not there in these conditions of recession for the products which our economy is capable of producing, let us look on the next two-year period as a time when we should divert the productive potential of our economy into a vast programme of reconstruction, of re-equipment and of infrastructure development.  It is preferable to do that than to have those productive capacities lying idle.</P>
    <P>As we all know, our community lacks infrastructure over a wide area, both social and economic.  Should we not designate the next two-year period, when there is general agreement that there will not be the upswing in world demand which would enable us to reengage in production for the market place, as a period of reconstruction? A programme of that sort would make far better social and economic sense. I should like to see allied to it a comprehensive grant-aided programme of re-equipment, product-development, reorganisation and research.</P>
    <P>The grants for such a programme would have to be substantial if they were to be meaningful and adequate. Perhaps I could illustrate best the sort of thinking which I have in this present situation by just taking the case <Col N="2142" /> of a factory, one unit of industrial production which finds in present circumstances it cannot produce for sale, that the demand is not there for its products.  Should not such a factory be encouraged to turn its attention inward, to look at its own internal structures and organisations?  Is there any factory in this country or any other country which could not usefully avail, if it had the resources to do it, of a six-month period to regroup, reorganise and devote its activities to re-equipment, reorganisation, and to product-development and activities of that sort?</P>
    <P>I believe those are the lines along which we should be thinking.  The Government should embark on a programme of infrastructural development. We are not in the situation where we have no need for additional infrastructures.  There are areas everywhere crying out for the provision of such amenities and facilities.  Each production unit could be encouraged by a grant-aided programme to put this period to use, not just close down and throw the workers on to the unemployment live register, but to examine its internal structures and see if it could not, with assistance from the Government, treat this period as a respite, gear itself and equip itself for better times.</P>
    <P>One of the elements in the package which the Government put before us yesterday was a programme of subsidies. We must all recognise that subsidies are a blunt, non-selective and expensive economic instrument.  On this side of the House we have recommended a very limited use of subsidies to meet a very particular occasion, namely the introduction of the green £.  There is no doubt that in certain circumstances the use of the subsidy in that careful, judicious, limited way is fully justified.  But these subsidies which are now proposed are in my view too late.  If we had subsidies proposed at this level 12 months ago there might be no need for any subsidies now.  In the meantime, inflation has galloped on, unemployment has risen and the level of subsidies now put before us is in my view too small and too late.  They will <Col N="2143" /> be expensive because, as I said, subsidies are a blunt instrument and they are availed of by the whole community.</P>
    <P>I believe there is every likelihood that they will not alone be expensive but they will be an expensive failure. If so, I believe it is a totally nugatory exercise.  Subsidies are such a blunt instrument and are so expensive that when you introduce them you must be reasonably certain, so far as any economic projections can have certainty, that they will be successful. One important factor in our current economic planning and management must be our membership of the European Economic Community.  The Government propaganda machine has been busily at work endeavouring to prove to us that we have had a wonderful success during our period of presidency of the Community.  That is total nonsense.  There has not been a period in which Ireland's interests in Community affairs were so badly mismanaged and in which our interests were so seriously neglected as during the first six months of this year, whether on the agricultural or the industrial front.</P>

      <P>In particular there is the decline which was permitted to take place in the clothing and textile industries.  Admittedly, belatedly, the Minister for Finance indicated yesterday that some action will be taken at Community level in regard to the footwear industry.  I am not saying this particularly in criticism of the Government.  I would perhaps, on the side, like to debunk the idea that Ireland has had a tremendous success during its presidency of the Community, but I am more concerned with the realities of membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we cannot permit ourselves to be left in a situation where Community policies and regulations force a valuable employment-giving Irish industry to die.  That is what is happening in the case of our footwear and textile industries.  It is perfectly legitimate for us as a member State <Col N="2144" /> to say to the Commission or to the Council: &ldquo;If you wish to have the powers which you have then they bring with them a corollary responsibility.&rdquo; The Community after all exists to promote prosperity and economic and social development.  It is totally illogical for us as a member State to find ourselves prevented by Community policy from coming to the aid of two vital industries.</P>
    <P>I believe one of two things must happen.  The Community must either give us permission to deal with the situation ourselves or alternatively if they want to retain their policies and powers they must come to the aid of these industries.  This is a fundamental and crucial question and something we will have to come to grips with.  If we are to have a central economic management in Brussels then that central economic management must be prepared to undertake the responsibilities that go with it.  We have had this experience with out footwear and textile industries and there is no guarantee we will not have it with other major, important industries.</P>
    <P>This package, in my view, is a major act of political irresponsibility. It saddened me beyond measure to see Coalition Deputies stand up and applaud something yesterday which will send this country plunging further and perhaps irretrievably down the road to bankruptcy and ruin.  Perhaps they do not know what is really involved in this manoeuvre by the Government, but the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach know. Quite a few people commented yesterday on how depressed and downcast the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach seemed.  I believe they were depressed because they knew more than anyone else in the House the enormity of what was happening.  The Minister for Finance has to face the financial institutions and the lending agencies and admit to them that he is not getting the finances of the nation under control and that the country is being pushed irretrievably into financial chaos.  I want to give it as my opinion, for what it is worth, that the Minister for Finance wished yesterday and sought to bring forward <Col N="2145" /> a package of measures that would get to grips with the situation. He wished to make a realistic attempt to get public expenditures and the economic situation under control.</P>
    <P>There is every sign of that.  There is every indication of it in phrase after phrase in the Minister's speech.  I believe that what happened was that he came forward with the package, and the remains of what was brought before us yesterday proves this, he went to the Government with a comprehensive realistic package but somewhere there was a failure of will, a failure of determination, and we were left with a soft package without the tough measures the situation calls for.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance had his way yesterday I believe we would have had a package which would have enabled him to go before the financial institutions and the lending agencies with some degree of confidence and credibility so that his prospects of borrowing this massive £276 million abroad that he needs would not be completely hopeless.  The Minister, and the more responsible elements of the Government, were defeated and the Government as a whole would not face reality and would not accept what was necessary.  The result is that we are left with half of the package, a half which in itself is meaningless and ineffectual and will not work. That is why I believe the Minister for Finance, and the Taoiseach, looked glum and discouraged yesterday.  They knew that what was happening was not what should be happening.</P>
    <P>The management of this nation's finances, our national budgeting process, has been reduced to a farce.  To call the proposals which the Government put before this House yesterday a budget is simply to misuse words.  A budget involves a balance; it is a process of relating income to expenditure and, from that point of view, the exercises of the Minister for Finance to which we have been subjected in this House in recent times have become utterly meaningless.  They have degenerated into a process whereby the Minister outlines his spending measures, measures almost exclusively composed of items of a nice popular <Col N="2146" /> give-away nature, and then, at the end, he simply says: that means that the deficit is so much.  It is a simple straight forward process and it attracts fairly general public approval at the time and there is only one drawback to it &mdash; it leads ultimately to ruin.</P>
    <P>It is all right if one can get out before the ruin engulfs one, just as in the case of the individual spendthrift. Unfortunately, just as in the case of the individual spendthrift who refuses to balance his income with his expenditure, it is an accelerating process and ruin very often engulfs one much more quickly than one can anticipate. Let there be no misunderstanding about the cold hard reality of yesterday's performance.  The central inescapable fact of that set of proposals which the Minister put before us yesterday is that the outcome is going to be a short fall, a deficit, a staggering, frightening, unprecedented deficit of £241 million this year and this community will be plunged that much further into debt when 1975 is over.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has come in.  The Taoiseach is wont to lecture us about the institutions of the State and he has sought to appoint himself as the protector and the guardian of those institutions.  But there is one institution of the State which, if it is weakened or debauched, can turn all the rest into hollow symbols, and that institution is our currency.  It is a cruel fraud to talk about improving the lot of the poor and the weak if the very budgetary policies one follows to do that in themselves ensure that the coin with which one pays the poor and the weak is debased and worthless.  That may well be history's judgment on the stewardship of Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach.  He failed to protect the one institution on which all others depend.  He committed the historic crime of incompetent leaders down the ages, he debased the coin of the realm.</P>

      <P>This debate mainly centres on two problems and also deals with three aspects of these problems &mdash; inflation, unemployment and the efforts to reduce the prices of essential commodities and reduce the <Col N="2147" /> cost of living by the introduction of the subsidies announced yesterday by the Minister for Finance.  In considering these matters we have to look at their causes and examine the extent of our capacity as a nation to deal with them and the way in which each of the groups within the community can make a contribution to solving these problems.  It is necessary to emphasise our dependence on external markets.  I do this not to shirk responsibility or to imply that the Government are not taking or cannot take adequate measures but to get the facts established.  One of the convenient things the Opposition consistently ignore are the facts of the situation. We can direct our attack on these problems if we know the facts.</P>
      <P>Last year we sold goods to other countries equivalent in value to almost two-fifths of all we produced.  What we bought abroad was equivalent to between one-half and three-fifths of our gross national product.  We can compare that with what happened in either the United Kingdom or France where total exports were about one-third of national output, and in the case of Germany about one-fifth, and less &mdash; probably one-tenth &mdash; in the United States.  In other words, the value of what we buy and sell abroad is up to twice as high a proportion of our total output as the corresponding figures for the major countries with which we trade.  These are not abstract figures which can be dismissed as irrelevant to our condition.  They bring home to everyone our vulnerability and the reasons why the Keynesian remedies so often advocated here just cannot work.</P>
      <P>We are vulnerable for two reasons. Firstly, if external markets are depressed we cannot sell to them, and we depend on our sales to them for our prosperity.  This is reflected and influenced by the cost and the level of employment in our factories.  There can be no jobs, and it is idle to talk about increased employment, if the goods or services produced cannot be sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason is the way in which external conditions affect our <Col N="2148" /> prosperity as was shown by the massive increase in oil prices in the last 18 months.  It added last year more than £140 million to our import bill.  That cannot be whisked away by a phrase or comment by any critic inside or outside the House.  It is a fact of life, an inescapable burden this country had to meet.  The combination of depressed external markets, making for a decline in the amount of money flowing into the economy and large increases in the prices of essential fuels, meaning a correspondingly large outflow, combined to slow our growth dramatically and send our economy into what has been one of the worst recessions we have ever experienced.</P>
    <P>That is why the Government place such emphasis on a recovery in world trade.  It is not sufficient to say: reorganise, regroup our factories and put money into them.  Put money into them for what?  To sell goods they cannot produce, to sell goods the current price of which makes them uncompetitive abroad?  Of course, everyone wants &mdash; it is one of the objectives of our policy, one of the aims of our whole economic and financial approach to this &mdash; to get industry reequipped, to facilitate and encourage reinvestment.  But, unless industry can sell the goods they produce &mdash; unless they can sell them either on the home market or abroad &mdash; there is no use producing them.</P>
    <P>That is why I and my colleagues, in the course of discussions we had at Heads of Governments meetings and elsewhere, advocated the reflation of world trade because we recognised that, as a very small country on the very edge of Europe with comparatively little influence, it did not matter a great deal what we said or did.  What matters is what the great countries in Europe and those such as the United States and others do.  When we look at their economies; when we see that the United States has eight or nine million unemployed; when we see that, for the first time in 30 years, since the end of the war, Japan will have not merely no growth rate this year but a decline: when we see Germany with the largest number unemployed <Col N="2149" /> outside the days of the Weimar Republic &mdash; and then can Deputies and others in this House say we should have a solution, or that they have a plan that will settle and solve our problem?  What was the record of their plans when they were in Government? The first was abandoned half-way through; the second was never produced. I do not know whether some Deputies who spoke here today were in or out of Government during that time &mdash; some of them were in for part of the time and some were out for the rest of the time.  But, whether they were in or out, the plan produced did not work.  The plan that was to be produced was not because they recognised in conditions in which economic climates inside and outside the country were much more stable; when there was no oil crisis: when the rate of inflation was 4 per cent or 5 per cent only, compared with 20 per cent, and up to 25 per cent in a number of countries in the world, their plan could not and did not work, and they abandoned it.</P>
    <P>Now, when conditions are so dramatic that the greatest economies of the world are experiencing difficulties&mdash; one of which I mentioned, Japan does not expect to have a growth rate this year but is itself planning and expecting a decline &mdash; we are told by some Deputies opposite who spoke to produce a plan to spend more money, and, by others, to spend less; by some to spend more and, by others, not to spend.  On which side are they in this? Is it like their policies in other areas &mdash; one policy is all right when one is talking to that crowd and the other is all right when one is talking to this crowd, provided both do not hear one at the same time?</P>

      <P>We have increased the capital budget from a total of £248 million in 1972-73 to £460 million this year.  The deficit on the current budget, as introduced last January, was £125 million compared with £35 million in the 1972-73 budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there are circumstances in which deficit financing can be criticised. But, in the circumstances in <Col N="2150" /> which this economy and those of Europe have found themselves in the last 18 months, is it not obvious that had the Government not spent this money on expanding and developing the capital programme the employment situation here would have been far worse?  How is that money being spent?  It is being spent on helping industry and agriculture, in getting houses and roads built, in improving the telephone and transport systems, in increasing our generating capacity in electricity, in helping to sustain employment and provide conditions in which both employment and investment can flourish.</P>
    <P>We have been criticised for not providing more money for housing.  In the last two and a half years we have built more houses than in any five-year period of our predecessors' term in office; built more houses at a time when housing costs rose by 58 per cent between May, 1973, and May of this year.  In fact, inflation in respect of building costs was even greater here than elsewhere.  That is the situation we have had to face over the last 18 months and that is how the Government has acted in order to cope with it.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the current deficit derived, in part, from our efforts to improve social services, to make life better for the sick, the old, the infirm, the unemployed and deprived in society.  Spending on social services has risen from a total of £475 million in 1972-73 to £968 million this year.  In that area it is indeed obvious that compassion has been the keynote of our policy.  But these efforts on the capital programme have succeeded in keeping unemployment at a lower level than it might have been otherwise. We have managed to keep the percentage increase in the numbers unemployed better than in many other countries I have mentioned, though the rate of unemployment here, in so far as it is comparable, is higher.</P>
    <P>But the scope for further action to increase both employment and social benefits is subject to two clear limitations. The first of those is the obvious one referred to here yesterday and again this morning, the amount that can be raised by way of taxation <Col N="2151" /> and borrowing.  In respect of the yield from additional taxes, the increase in yield from the taxes imposed in the January budget is small in comparison with the capital needs to sustain and increase employment.  Our borrowing now &mdash; and nobody denies it &mdash; is uncomfortably high and needs careful management.  Indeed, I need only point out to the House that the total amount to be paid to service the debt this year, at £235 million, would exceed the total capital budget in 1971-72. A great deal of the expenditure that has had to be met by this Government was to deal with the legacy of problems we inherited and we are expected to deal with and overcome these problems in a space of a little over two years, with an unprecedented economic depression affecting the whole world, even the strongest economies.</P>
    <P>The second obvious limitation in respect of public expenditure is that it is at the point at which it, in itself, is causing inflation; it arises from the very nature of public expenditure. The Government must raise money with which to finance its services.  Of course, if the public were willing to accept that the Government would spend money on their behalf and forego a corresponding amount of spending themselves, then the decision to increase Government expenditure obviously would not increase the total amount of demand or spending within the economy.  Of course, this does not happen.  What happens is that both public and private expenditure press on the same volume of resources, without either giving way to the other and when the capacity of our economy to supply the variety and quantity of goods people require is limited, the consequence is either inflation or an insupportable increase in the balance of payments deficit.  Of course public expenditure contributes in a more direct and measurable way to inflation.  Increases in indirect taxation tend to increase the consumer price index which, in turn, causes wage and salary increases or expectations, and increases in direct taxation work in a similar way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" /> There is no source of funds on which the State or anyone else can draw inexhaustibly.  To take an example of this, one suggestion has been made that somehow we should use the banks' profits.  The banks have made and are making a substantial contribution to the financing and management of State programmes. They are taking the initiatives in relation to housing which the Minister for Finance has dealt with yesterday in his opening speech.  They provide finance for agriculture, industry and trade.  It is important that everyone should be aware of the contribution the banks are making to the running of the State, and in fairness this should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>What they are dealing with is the money which the people of this State and of other States have left with them, no more and no less.  Like other institutions here and elsewhere they make a certain level of profit from their business.  That profit is subject to the same rules, more or less, and the same requirements in respect of taxation as the profits of other businesses and I may say, erosion by inflation as the surpluses of any other concern.  And these profits are just as necessary, as in other businesses, to the health and well-being of the system, which, so far as the banks are concerned, must safeguard the accounts of tens of thousands of ordinary individuals throughout the State.</P>
    <P>Another illusion we must rid ourselves of is that profits may somehow provide the funds for further public expenditure, or, alternatively, that somehow they are inimical to progress. For us, the reverse is true.  I say this not in any provocative spirit, but simply to get the facts established. This country depends to a critical extent on the quality and the quantity of the investment it can attract.  We must have new factories and new machinery in old factories.  We must have farms which are better stocked and better equipped.  We must have hotels and offices and shops which are efficient and give value.  These things can come about only if industry and agriculture make a profit sufficient to finance new investment and they are <Col N="2153" /> left a fair amount of surplus in this way.  They can only reinvest and re-equip if the surplus they are left with is adequate to attract and encourage investment and those who have money to invest with them.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised and not disputed that this country cannot provide all the capital it needs.  We have legitimate aspirations on all sides of the House and outside it to a higher standard of living, to better economic and social conditions.  We aspire to conditions which much wealthier countries have, even conditions which some neighbouring countries have. We have not the same resources or the same natural raw materials.  We must therefore attract investment from outside. If we do not provide the right conditions &mdash; and these conditions include the ability to get a return on investment &mdash; the world is full of countries, some of them emerging countries who will be only too glad to do so.  I need not emphasise how employment would suffer if the investment we seek was attracted or diverted elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Again, employment here will suffer even in existing industry if the level of profit is insufficient.  Nowadays a firm must re-equip almost continuously to survive.  It must have within itself the money to pay for this re-equipment and must have the ability, because of its past record, to raise this money.  In both ways, it is dependent on its profit record and prospects; and both are endangered by present levels of inflation.  It is the firms who did not or could not accumulate a sufficient surplus who are now finding conditions most difficult, and it is the workers in those firms who are suffering as much as, if not more than, anyone from these inadequacies.  Profits are an essential precondition of employment. Excessive profits are, of course, different from fair profits which provide a reasonable return, ensure economic progress, increase employment and provide better jobs and a better economy.</P>
    <P>But over and above arguments as to the efficacy of public expenditure to get us out of our present difficulties is the incontrovertible fact that this <Col N="2154" /> expenditure and Government activity are only part of the picture.  Just as trends in international markets can influence this country's future almost as surely as any decision or action taken domestically, so, what we do as a people, the expectations we have and the action we take to realise them, can influence our future more directly than action taken by the Government alone.</P>
    <P>Some figures will prove this fact. The total amount of public expenditure with which the Government dealt at budget time earlier this year was of the order of £1,800 million. This includes the current budget, the capital budget, and central and extra budgetary funds.  It is a large amount of money by any standard, and it is as good a measure as any other of the influence the Government can exercise on the economy.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the total amount of wages and salaries in the country this year will probably be of the order of £2,000 million.  What happens to wages and salaries generally can exercise as big an influence on prices, and employment, and on the whole future of the country, as the sum total of public expenditure with which the Government deals at budget time &mdash; or perhaps even a bigger influence.</P>
    <P>Last year most of the rise in prices was due to the increase in the price of goods we imported whether they were finished goods or raw materials for further processing.  The quintupling of oil prices and the steep rise in the price of food and of many basic materials are examples of this inflationary trend.  This year we cannot so easily evade the blame.  Most of the inflation, as has been repeatedly said by the Minister for Finance and by commentators, is due to price rises generated domestically.  Our rate of income increase is, in itself, now the biggest single cause of our inflation. The rise in prices is, in turn, generating pressure for further wage and salary increases.  These, if granted, make firms uncompetitive in comparison with firms in other countries producing competing goods and services and faced with lower rates of cost increases.  The net effect is unemployment on the scale <Col N="2155" /> we now see, and the purpose and the single major objective of this supplementary budget is to break the vicious spiral of wage pushing price and price pushing wage ever upwards, to the point where our products find themselves priced out of their markets; and the workers, who should be producing them, priced out of their jobs.</P>
    <P>These considerations are crucial to the strategy of the package of proposals which the measures introduced yesterday have been worked out to deal with as a contribution towards a solution of our present difficulties. With a home market of three million people&mdash;the population of a mediumsized town in a European context&mdash; we cannot ourselves provide the conditions for the establishment here and growth of the type of modern industry on which high wages and good living standards depend.  We must sell abroad.  This means that, as a matter of simple fact, we cannot allow our costs to grow more rapidly than those of the countries with which we compete and in which we must sell.</P>
    <P>On this, there are again a number of illusions.  It has been argued that we all have an entitlement to income increases that compensate fully for the rising cost of living.  That may be so, but an entitlement is useless if the attempt to achieve it destroys the means to realise it.  All the entitlements in the world will not reopen a factory which has closed because its costs are too high.</P>
    <P>I have put the facts bluntly because they are harsh.  As too many people now know only too well, we cannot talk ourselves into jobs or create employment by referring to claims which nobody can meet.  The money to pay all of them comes from the willingness of the people to buy what we produce, either the people at home or those to whom we sell abroad.</P>
    <P>This same message has been put across in the <i>Report on Inflation</i> issued by the National Economic and Social Council.  It says:</P>
    <P>All the information which is available indicates that exporters are finding it increasingly difficult <Col N="2156" /> to sell abroad at present prices, that the price increases that will follow the increases in money incomes under the 1975 National Agreement will increase the difficulties being faced by exporters, and that investment (domestic and foreign) in export industries is tending to decline.</P>
    <P>That is a point, the Report emphasises, that has not been fully stressed or sufficiently emphasised.  Inflation destroys employment and, whatever about the merits of some abstract concept of justice, the attempt at all times to keep pace with it, at its existing level, on the part of those in jobs will destroy not only their own jobs but the employment prospects of many thousands of their fellow workers and of their children.</P>
    <P>It is a further illusion that higher increases in income mean higher rewards for the recipient.  It does not matter to the individual's purchasing power if he gets a pay increase of 5 per cent if prices rise by 5 per cent or a pay increase of 24 per cent if prices rise by 24 per cent.  It does matter, however, to the firm employing him and to the country in which he lives.  It matters to the firm employing him trying to sell on the export market because other firms, whose wage costs are lower will undersell both at home and abroad what that firm can produce.  Other countries whose industries are more efficient and who are more cost conscious will accumulate the wealth that the investment and the talents should be creating at home.  The difference for the individual may well be that, with the higher percentage, he loses his job.  I can give a further example.</P>
    <P>In Germany money wages in manufacturing industry increased by 49 per cent between 1970 and 1974.  Prices went up there by 27 per cent leaving workers better off, in real terms, to the extent of 17 per cent.  Germany has a massive balance of payments surplus and considerably more freedom to tackle the problems it has.  Its rate of unemployment, though high by German standards, is about a quarter of the corresponding rate here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2157" /> In this country in the same period earnings in manufacturing went up by 91 per cent and prices by 54 per cent, yielding an increase of 24 per cent in real income.  The effect on the real earnings of workers here and in Germany was little different but, partly because of the higher percentage at which agreement was reached, our position is not as healthy or competitive as that of the Germans.  We have been protected from the worst features of our falling competitiveness by the depreciation in the value of our currency which, in turn, has added to the price we must pay for imports from countries other than Britain, so giving another twist, if you like, to the vicious spiral of inflation. This obviously is a process which cannot continue.</P>
    <P>That conviction is, I believe, increasingly shared now by people in all sections in our community.  They can see clearly now the destructive impact of inflation, not only on the cost of what they have to buy but on their jobs and job prospects, on savings, on the value of their pensions and welfare benefits, on confidence and on the whole social and economic fabric of our society.</P>
    <P>We all know that it is vital in the national interest to turn inflation back. However, people are now caught on the treadmill of inflationary expectations. Experience tells them that large increases in wages are eaten up by correspondingly large increases in prices.  There seems no reason to expect that prices will not continue to climb and they fear that moderation on their part or on the part of their group will only leave them worse off, and so they press for higher incomes in salaries and wages and these, in turn, generate further price rises: to this extent inflationary expectations are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>It was in this serious economic and financial situation that the Government introduced its package yesterday to break the cycle.  That is the basic purpose of the Government. The measure we propose will have a significant direct effect in moderating the rate of price increases by about <Col N="2158" /> 4 per cent.  Even more important, I believe, is the indirect effect they can have, if they are reciprocated in the way we seek, in combating the psychology of inflation.</P>
    <P>Our measures can lead to substantial reductions in the price of basic goods and services which loom large in the weekly budget of everybody and especially of the less well-off sections, of our community.  For example, CIE fares will be reduced by an average of 25 per cent, butter by about 20 per cent, milk by 25 per cent and bread by about the same amount. The Government's objective is to show that prices can go down as well as up, that we can stop inflation gathering more and more momentum.  But Government action alone, as I said, cannot restore health to the economy.  Within the country we can help by making positive moves to get the rate of price increases down.  In order to do this we must have a positive contribution from others whose interest in maintaining employment and living standards is no less real and no less immediate than that of the Government. The beneficial psychological effect of this demonstration can be and, indeed, must be made more potent by a contribution on the part of the various parties to the current national agreement.  This can be done in a way which preserves the spirit of the agreement and, in line with the illustrations I gave, involves no change in the real incomes and purchasing power of those to whom it applies.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that the Government should have acted earlier.  The national agreement was signed in April.  Is it suggested we should have taken action before the agreement was signed?  Is it suggested we should have interfered before the agreement was negotiated?  Is it suggested we should have interfered with a system that has operated up to now? There was only one occasion in the last 12 or 14 years in which a Government interfered with a national wage agreement.  What was the effect of that intervention?  The effect of that intervention in 1963 was twofold. The occasion was deliberately used to give an increase greater than <Col N="2159" /> was warranted at the time, and that sparked off the first inflationary spiral which has enveloped the country ever since.  That action was taken by Fianna Fáil in order to win two byelections. That was the reason, and that was the only time.  No Government since has ever intervened and the Opposition now suggest we should intervene, conveniently forgetting all the appalling circumstances and consequences following on their intervention on that occasion, not for economic or financial purposes but solely for political purposes.</P>
    <P>Our aim must be to reduce the rate of inflation to a single-digit figure within a reasonably short period and thus to bring about a situation where subsidies will no longer be necessary. No one believes that subsidies are a desirable method of dealing with a situation.  They are justified in very exceptional and limited circumstances. It has been repeatedly said that they have many and substantial drawbacks. They are a wasteful way of helping those in need because they apply equally to everyone.  They involve a substantial increase in public expenditure when its size and financing are already exerting their own inflationary pressures.  They increase the proportion of public expenditure devoted to current consumption rather than to investment.  In this way, they are, in the long term, inimical to employment.  But in the conditions of today, which are unique in our country's history, the Government are convinced that subsidies are essential to begin to get the rate of price increases down.</P>
    <P>The measures we announced to stimulate employment were taken in the belief that they can contribute most effectively and speedily where Government action can have the most beneficial and lasting effect.  We are providing an extra £31 million for the public capital programme, bringing the total for this year to little short of £500 million, an increase of £100 million on the rate of expenditure in the financial period ended last December.  The bulk of the increased capital spending being authorised will <Col N="2160" /> be on housing and telephone development, where the effect of maintaining and increasing employment should be felt reasonably quickly.</P>
    <P>The extra money for housing is additional to the arrangements which are also being made whereby the banks are proposing to advance substantial sums for the industry over two years.  In addition, as indicated by the Minister for Finance, the inflow of funds to the building societies is showing a marked improvement and they will be in a position this year greatly to increase their advances to house buyers.  I am confident that the unprecedented injections of funds in prospect and the revival of confidence among those thinking of buying a house which the Government's measures will promote, will lead to a significant improvement in the employment position in the industry, and have significant multiplier effect on other industries.</P>
    <P>Despite the rapid inflationary increase in building prices in the last two years, the building programme has gone ahead with extraordinary rapidity. This is an area in which there are valuable spin-off effects.  Houses are needed to provide for social needs and to overtake the backlog that was there from the past.  In addition, as was announced yesterday, the Government are providing an employment premiums scheme on the basis that it is better to spend money to support increases in employment and re-employment than to sustain people in unemployment. It is better for the economy and for those who are affected by unemployment. As the Minister and others said, it is difficult to gauge in advance what the response to the scheme will be.  We are hopeful that with the spur to confidence and revival which our package will give, a significant number of persons currently unemployed will be taken into employment.  By mid-1976, as a result of all the measures being taken gross national product could be about 2 per cent greater than it otherwise would be: jobs could be generated for 20,000 people in 1975 and 1976.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in the course of comments by Deputy Lynch, Leader of the Opposition&mdash;and I <Col N="2161" /> would like to acknowledge the constructive approach he had to the suggestions we made and the support he gave for a revision of the national wage agreement&mdash;and other Opposition Deputies, that something extra could be done, while, at the same time, criticising the amount of borrowing and the rate of taxation.  We believe we have undertaken the largest amount of borrowing sustainable.  We believe also that, in present circumstances, we are raising as much as is fair and reasonable from the taxpayer. The figures which I and the Minister for Finance gave indicate that the taxes which were imposed last January produced less than anticipated. In other words, the increase in revenue from the old reliables was not as great as had been anticipated.</P>
    <P>So far as the building industry is concerned, the money already included in the capital programme, the extra money being provided by the banks and announced in the course of yesterday's budget speech, the extra money invested with the building societies, all must have a very significant effect on the extent and the increase in the generation of extra activity.  Our proposals will provide extra funds for building.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has been obvious not merely in recent weeks but in recent months is the numerous suggestions every week from the Opposition to spend more money on this, that and the other service.  There have been demands for more money for an extension of the health services, additional medical cards, demands by way of motion to add extra diseases to the list of diseases entitled to treatment under the Health Acts. All these are desirable in themselves. All are areas in which the Minister for Health and the Government would like to go further.  When we look at what has been provided by this Government, how extensive, and indeed reformist, have been the improvements in respect of health and social services, it does not lie in the mouths of the Opposition to criticise it.  All they ask in every motion that has been taken, week in and week out, is spend more money on health <Col N="2162" /> services and provide more money for housing and amenity grants.</P>
    <P>The only change which has been made in the reform of Dáil procedure is that the Opposition are now allowed three hours a week, every week for the whole year, in which they can advocate increased expenditure. Never once has there been a suggestion as to how the money is to be raised.  Every time they have spoken here they said we were borrowing too much; that we were raising too much through taxation.  Deputy after Deputy stood up yesterday and said that we should provide a subsidy on this, that and the other, everything from bottled gas to blankets.  The only thing they did not suggest a subsidy on was beer.</P>
    <P>One group in the Opposition are saying we should spend more, reorganise, regroup.  Every outworn cliché and phrase that can be used is presented here as original thinking, as a plan which was never produced before. We have to wait until Fianna Fáil are in Opposition to produce it. When they were in Government they produced a plan that did not work. They did not produce a second plan because they recognised it was too bad to be produced even at a comhcomhairle lunch.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with a few remaining matters which were discussed in the course of this debate. We recognise that our aims cannot be settled by any simple or unqualified theoretical formula.</P>
    <P>It will depend on a variety of things.  It will depend, as a number of Deputies including Deputy Colley said, on confidence.  It will depend on the confidence of consumers, of house buyers, of builders, of manufacturers, of lenders of funds to finance the public capital programme.  It will depend, in turn, on people's assessment of the prospects for prices and costs.  This is where we see the vital importance of the contribution I mentioned of the parties to the national wage agreement. Success in getting employment really moving depends largely on what we do to keep our costs competitive, on investment in new plant and <Col N="2163" /> machinery, as well as what happens in world trade.</P>
    <P>We hear criticisms, both by those inside the House and some critics outside the House who have no responsibility except to comment and no authority or experience to express views except again to criticise from the easy position of looking on without being directly involved.  The suggestions are that we should have acted earlier.  The suggestions are that the problems which affect this country are in some way or other peculiar to this country.  The fact is that they are common to every country in the world.  The fact is that they have affected the greatest economies in the world.  The fact, of course, is that some of them have taken much more harsh action.  What did that harsh action result in?  It resulted in a massive increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>Is it suggested that we should take dramatic, drastic, action, that we should curb or cut Government expenditure to put other people out of work?  Of course, it is easy to suggest this if you are in work.  It is easy to suggest drastic action provided it does not affect you, to cut Government services, to put people out of work, to dispense with those who are in public employment.  The fact is that economies do not work that way.  The fact is that we have inherited difficulties built up over generations.  Whatever difficulties we have, on top of them we have inherited the legacy of Fianna Fáil mismanagement.  We are expected in two years and three months to solve the result of their neglect and to try to solve it in a situation in which the economic climate of the world is the worst not merely since the 1930s but in the history of economic, financial and social affairs.</P>
    <P>That is the situation in which we are told by critics in the House and by some outside it that we should have acted earlier, more speedily, more drastically, more dramatically.  What do all those critics mean?  What do they mean in reality?  They mean, but they do not say, that we should cut Government expenditure and put those <Col N="2164" /> employed in Government services out of work.  They mean we should give less to housing, that we should give less to the Post Office, that we should give less to social services.  At the same time, when they think other people are not listening, they advocate here or elsewhere that more should be provided for social services and health services.  If they cannot think up enough diseases they go to a medical dictionary and put a list into a motion before the Dáil.  If a medical dictionary is not exhaustive enough, they get a natural history one and put down questions about animals which have never been heard of on this side of the globe.</P>
    <P>We want our proposals to be accepted for what they are, as the Government's contribution towards dealing with the situation.  We want them, as I believe they will be, to be accepted by the trade unions and other elements in the community as a responsible, reasonable and positive contribution to a solution of the problems which affect this country.  That inevitably means some modification of the subsequent phases of the national wage agreement or some equivalent adjustment.  This which can be achieved under our proposals without any reduction of living standards will, in turn, reduce the rate of price increases and help to provide employment for thousands of workers now without jobs.</P>
    <P>It will mean more.  It will preserve the jobs of thousands who are now working.  As surely as the sun rises they will lose their jobs if costs continue to escalate.  The package which the Government have devised puts considerable strains on the Exchequer. If this package is not acceptable, naturally the Government will have to review the position and consider what alternative action can be taken and, indeed, to consider withdrawing some of the benefits.</P>
    <P>This is the difference between the Government and the Opposition.  The Opposition did not think we could act to deal with this situation, but we have taken action and we will continue to take the necessary action to bring economic health to this country. <Col N="2165" /> Even the potential benefits of these measures, significant as they are, probably fall short of what is necessary to get employment and output growing. As I emphasised, success here depends on renewed growth in the world economy and on our putting ourselves in a position to avail of the opportunities this would afford.  Here we have considerable strengths on which to build.</P>
    <P>Our external reserves this year provide us with a cushion against international uncertainties and unforeseen events.  These reserves were markedly higher at the end of April than they were a year previously.  Despite the difficulties they faced, our exporters continue to win new markets.  In the first five months of this year, our exports expanded by 25 per cent. That is not a phrase about confidence. That is a fact.  This compares with an increase in imports of only 3 per cent.  Some of this improvement in our payments balance is due to the depression in the demand elsewhere as well as the demand here for imported goods and some to the improved prices being secured for agricultural exports. A great deal of it is due to the efforts of producers and salesmen in producing and selling against competition from all comers.  Our exports of manufactured goods are, perhaps, especially vulnerable to recession in markets abroad.  Despite that they went up almost 20 per cent in the first five months of this year.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, we can keep our costs competitive, we are well set to expand and continue this drive.  Confidence is a word which is glibly thrown around. I want to give some financial facts, facts in £s, that display confidence. In 1971-72, the total value of planned investment in industrial projects approved for assistance by the Industrial Development Authority was £60.5 million.  In 1972-73 it was £135.4 million.  The following year it doubled to £302 million.  In the calendar year, 1974, it reached the figure of £510 million.  In four years the value of this investment went up eight-fold.  These figures represent investments or intended investments by companies of world repute, technologically <Col N="2166" /> advanced export-oriented industry, coming or proposing to come here, providing employment and prosperity for whole communities and many thousands of workers.</P>
    <P>We should realise that many of these projects, especially those approved for grants more recently, are not yet irrevocably committed to Ireland and that failure to control or reduce our inflation might lose us some of this enormous potential capacity.  This potential, added to that of our agriculture, and our existing industrial capacity, provides a base on which we can build when world circumstances permit.  We can make the choice, therefore, of high income increases and high prices and price the products of industry out of the markets we have to sell to, or we can break the vicious spiral in which wage follows price and price follows wage ever upwards.  If we can moderate the rate of income increase and let our increased competitiveness work its way back through industry in increased employment, we will provide better prospects for all our people.</P>
    <P>Of this we must all be sure.  The problems with which we are faced are not easy to solve.  Despite criticism either inside or outside the House they cannot be got rid of quickly or by any magic formula.  They are not capable of solution painlessly or simply, by the wave of a theory, a wand or a pen.  The Government have provided the opportunity for the choice to be made between a society in which employment can flourish, or its alternative, where not stagnation but decline is the inevitable consequence. I have enough faith in the goodwill and good sense of the Irish people to believe they will make the right decision.</P>
    <P>The contribution we seek is small and temporary, and while the consequences of failure are grievous the rewards of success are great.  I believe we have the capacity and the will and we have given the necessary leadership to achieve that success.</P>

      <P>We have had from the Taoiseach in the past hour a <Col N="2167" /> long litany of the usual economic clichés about the evils of inflation. It is very hard to believe that a man who has delivered himself of all these exhortations in which, presumably, he believes, could yesterday have presided over the second budget of 1975, the second official budget in six months, in the course of which a proposed budget deficit of £125 million in January is now increased to £241 million, an increase of about 95 per cent. Anybody who ever makes the slightest study of economics will find on almost the first page of the most elementary or fundamental textbook that if one wants to create inflation, one way is to budget for a deficit and the bigger the deficit you budget for the more inflation you will encourage.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to believe that the man who made all these exhortations approved of a deficit of £241 million which is to be paid for by borrowing and, for the most part, by foreign borrowing.  The Minister for Finance came back after a week in Arab countries with his cap in his hand looking for money and stood up here yesterday, again with his cap in hand, to ask the trade unions and employers of this country to do their bit to help the Government to help the country out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach this morning was making the suggestion that the foreign borrowing which the present Government specialise in and carry on at a greater rate than any other European country&mdash;and, as far as one can see, any other OECD country&mdash;has nothing to do with the taxpayer.  On two occasions in his speech this morning the Taoiseach said that we could meet these difficulties either by going to the taxpayer or by borrowing, the suggestion being that what was borrowed had nothing to do with the taxpayer, did not matter to the taxpayer. Is anybody naïve enough to think that all this borrowing can continue without having an effect on the Irish taxpayer?  Is there anybody who does not believe that the purpose of this borrowing is to enable this Government to stagger on as long as they can <Col N="2168" /> and that the real problem will then be met by a Government that will have to come in and pay the cost and pick up the tabs for all this?</P>
    <P>It is no harm to reiterate some aspects of the economic consequences of foreign borrowing, particularly borrowing this Government are going on with at present.  In earlier years if a Government here wanted to borrow £5 million or £10 million abroad&mdash; that was usually about the limit of any foreign borrowing in the years when it took place, and that was not every year&mdash;they went to Britain and borrowed in sterling and what they borrowed they repaid precisely.  Now there is no sterling to be borrowed; we are borrowing in European units of account, in Kuwaiti dinars and in various other Arab units of currency. Those units of currency are tied to the &ldquo;snake&rdquo; arrangement that was made in Montreal in December, 1971.  Since then&mdash;only three-and-a-half years ago &mdash;the £1 sterling has devalued against those consolidated currencies by 26½ per cent and the net effect in terms of this foreign borrowing is that if we borrowed £1 million in December, 1971, in a non-sterling currency, in addition to paying back the £1 million we also pay back 26½ per cent more or £265,000 on top of the interest. Even if we were borrowing in sterling and did not have to pay the devaluation element in everything we borrow now, foreign borrowing on basic economic terms is very bad business for this reason; when we borrow from our own citizens we are paying a rate of interest less the standard rate of tax and the effective rate of interest paid by the Government on domestic borrowing is two-thirds of the nominal rate.  With foreign borrowing there is no reduction of tax&mdash;there cannot be because we could not borrow money if we were to deduct Irish income tax from it&mdash;and immediately the nominal rate at which we borrow is effectively one-third more.  Also, the interest payable on domestic borrowing recirculates in this country for the benefit of our economy.  With foreign borrowing the direct opposite happens.</P>
    <P>We now have a deficit that is unbelieveable. When we were in Government only a few years ago I remember <Col N="2169" /> seeing figures indicating that the service of public debt was beginning to cost nearly £50 million.  Today we are informed by the Taoiseach that this year the service of the public debt is costing £235 million and it is rapidly increasing.  The service of that debt, instead of coming back into our economy, because of all this foreign borrowing is, for the most part, going out of it.  The £235 million debt means that before one civil servant is paid by the Government or before one penny is invested in our economy by the Government through its public capital programme or otherwise, £235 million must be raised by the taxpayers. At the rate this borrowing is going on and at the rate these deficits are being created, because they can only be financed by borrowing, the figure of £235 million, which is apparently the current figure, will assuredly be over £300 million by this time next year.</P>
    <P>We have seen in six months a disimprovement of almost 100 per cent in the deficit in regard to the current budget.  This is almost incredible.  I should like to recall what Deputy Colley quoted yesterday in regard to the remarks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 1972 budget when Deputy Colley, in an effort to keep the economy stimulated and maintain the high level of activity there then was decided to budget for a deficit of £22 million.  Total horror at the recklessness of that was expressed by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs. The deficit of £22 million budgeted for in 1972 was less than one-eleventh of the figure that we have before us today.  A very significant thing that Deputy Colley may have overlooked was that when the 1972/73 financial year ended on 31st March, 1973 and the present Government were in power they found that not only did they not have to deal with a £22 million deficit but they actually had a surplus on the current budget at the end of that year.  We heard the Taoiseach today say that they could not be expected to clean up the economic mess that Fianna Fáil left when this Government were only in power for two-and-a-quarter years.  That was the economic mess Fianna Fáil left&mdash;a <Col N="2170" /> balanced budget, a budget that was actually in surplus because the economy was progressing so well at that stage and revenue was so buoyant because of increasing employment and increasing investment.  They had budgeted for a small deficit and, as it turned out, it brought in a small surplus.</P>
    <P>Where were the problems there? What was the problem the Government were faced with in March, 1973?  The problems were nil.  The economic problems at that time were nil and the growth rate in real terms in the calendar year 1973 was 6 per cent.  That was a matter which I remember at the end of 1973 the Minister for Finance used to boast about &mdash;that he had waved his wand and that our growth rate in real terms that year was 6 per cent.  It was, because he had not yet put a stop or a halt to the progress that was being made up to March, 1973.  We do not hear any boasting about the growth rate in 1974 and we were told, in the Minister's own speech here yesterday that there will be a decline in growth in this country in 1975.</P>
    <P>The hypocrisy&mdash;in all honesty I can only describe it as that&mdash;that we have heard from the Taoiseach here today is pretty disgusting.  Nevertheless, it is not surprising, because in this House within the past month or so we have had two debates on aspects of industry in Ireland, one of them on the footwear industry on 10th and 11th June and the other one on ESB and CIE increases in fares and rates, on 13th and 14th May&mdash;two debates within the last week.  We advocated in the debate on footwear the use of Articles 108 and 109 of the Rome Treaty to protect our footwear industry and, failing that, the use of Article 135 of the Treaty of Accession.</P>
    <P>We were told both by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by his Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and I will give the precise references: by the Minister at Volume 282, columns 168-9 and by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bruton, at Volume 281, column 2252&mdash;that these things <Col N="2171" /> which we were advocating were not on, that the use of Article 135 was not open to us and that their view and the view of the Government was that even if that were open to us, the artificial protection of industry by the imposition of import quotas or tariffs was wrong and not in the interest of this country, that we were basically an exporting country and that we should never resort to the use of devices like Article 135 of the Treaty of Accesssion.</P>
    <P>That took place in this House on 10th and 11th June, 1975, and the Minister for Finance stood up here yesterday and boasted about the great good he was now doing by virtue of the fact that he was going out to Brussels to invoke Article 135 of the Treaty of Accession.</P>
    <P>We found it very difficult at the time of that debate to get proper figures in relation to footwear from the Government.  Our experience is that when you are looking for statistics you find it very difficult to get them, even by way of parliamentary question, if they are not the sort of statistics the Government would wish to go out.  We were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there was no evidence that imports were having the serious effect which we stated they were having and which the whole footwear industry unanimously told us in letters and telephone calls and everything else that they were having.</P>
    <P>We finally got figures in relation to the Irish footwear industry from the EEC, having failed to obtain them elsewhere.  The significance of imports on the footwear industry in this country is borne out very fully and the truth of what we stated and what the industry, both employers and the trade union side, stated continuously is borne out by the fact that in the year 1967 the Irish share of the home market in footwear.  which happily is an increasing market all the time, was then 95 per cent and that since then it has been gradually dropping and that in 1974 the Irish share of the home market was 42 per cent and that the share which is met by imports <Col N="2172" /> is therefore 58 per cent.  Instead of, as in 1967, meeting virtually the entire Irish market by home produced footwear, we are now in the situation that considerably less than half the Irish market is met by home produced footwear.  But as recently as 11th June the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that there was no evidence of these facts and that he could not use Article 135 and that in any event he was against the principle of that sort of protection for industry.</P>
    <P>We advocated this in another Private Members' Motion in December, 1974.  Since December, 1974, when, of course we were told exactly the same as we have been told in June, 1975, thousands and thousands of Irish workers in the footwear industry have lost their employment and unfortunately in most cases will never get it back.  The use of Article 135 now will save what remains of the footwear industry but what remains of the footwear industry is a small fraction of what was once a thriving and prosperous industry giving tremendous employment.</P>
    <P>The very same considerations as apply to the Irish footwear industry apply to the textile industry.  The very same arguments apply and the very same solutions are the necessary solutions; but we heard not one word yesterday about the textile industry from the Minister for Finance.  I venture to think&mdash;I am quite sure&mdash; that the only reason we heard it in relation to the footwear industry was that a fortnight ago this party put down a Private Members' Motion in relation to the footwear industry and had it debated.  I hope next week we can have one on the textile industry and that after that debate we will have the Minister for Industry and Commerce, admittedly against his will, but nonetheless in the national interest, going to Europe to invoke Article 135 of the Accession Treaty in relation to the textile industry because day after day and week after week for the past six months we have heard of factories in every part of the country closing down, workers going out of employment in circumstances that their prospects of ever being re-employed <Col N="2173" /> in those industries are very small. Their only hope of future employment lies in some new type of employment at some future time for which they will have to be retrained.  Still, we were told only a fortnight ago by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the whole principle of protecting industry is wrong, that we should not do it, that it is not in our own interest to do it because we are an export-oriented country.  Two weeks later, as a result of public pressure, and nothing else, we have the Minister for Finance making the announcement he made last night.</P>
    <P>The situation was even more interesting in relation to the ESB charge increases and the CIE fares increases because they were debated in this House, again on a Private Members' Motion, on 13th and 14th May, 1975, and we had the Minister for Transport and Power and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce telling us there could be no question of subsidising CIE or the ESB, that it was wrong in principle, that it should not be done, that the Government had considered it but would not do it and that they had made the right decision.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to refer precisely to what was said on that occasion in relation to both CIE and ESB subsidisation. Deputy Bruton, the Parliamentary Secretary, argued at some length against subsidisation.  He said in the House on 14th May last that an extra £27 million would have to be raised by the taxpayers and that it had been estimated it would involve an increase in the basic rates of income tax of almost 3p in the £.  He said that in his estimation the extra subsidy to CIE would have been £11 million and £16 million to the ESB. Speaking about options, he went on:</P>
    <P>I do not believe either of those two options were acceptable.  The option chosen by the Government was a courageous one, and in reality, it was the only one that could be taken.  They decided to allow increases in prices for the ESB and increases in fares for CIE.</P>
    <P>He finished up by saying subsidisation <Col N="2174" /> could lead to distortion and in the long run was bad economically for the country.  That was last month. This month it can be done.  Fianna Fáil were criticised then, as they were criticised last October, as they were criticised last December, for advocating reductions in VAT for certain things and the abolition of VAT on certain things.  We were told it could not be done, that it was careless and reckless talk by an irresponsible Opposition.  It is now being done and the tragedy is that it is nine months too late.  In the meantime tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs because it was not done earlier.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Barry, was sent in here on 13th May last and he is reported at column 1697, Volume 280 of the Dáil Official Report:</P>
    <P>The Government decided that the subsidy of £17 million given to CIE should, as far as possible, be adhered to in this financial year and that the fare increases were justified.</P>
    <P>Six weeks later there is a complete turnabout.  A subsidy is introduced. The fares which went up in May are to come down in July by the same amount.  What is the point of the Government sending in the Minister for Transport and Power to say a thing like that?  That was Government policy six weeks ago, and look what happened last night.  What happened last night is what we advocated&mdash;the fares went up in May and they are to come down in July.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder there is no confidence in this country not only on the part of investors but of employers and workers who are frightened they will not have jobs to go to in the morning? Is it any wonder that investors, domestic and foreign, are holding back because they do not know what the prospects are.  In six weeks there has been the most total about turn you could get in relation to the whole question of subsidy, and in two weeks there has been an equal about turn in relation to the use of Article 135 of the Treaty of Accession and two Articles of the Rome Treaty.  It took <Col N="2175" /> two weeks to have a total change of policy.  It is not just a gradual movement away from the original position but a total reversal.  Is it any wonder there is no confidence in the economy of a country which allegedly is being controlled or governed by a group of men who make such decisions and then equally rapidly change them?</P>
    <P>In this country we have the worst of both worlds.  We have a budget deficit after the second budget of this year of £241.64 million.  We have the highest unemployment rate in the EEC or possibly in the whole of Europe.  I asked for figures in the House three weeks ago and I was told they could not be given because the available figures were not comparable. I was refused figures about the rate of unemployment in the EEC countries. They were published last night in <i>The Evening Press</i> from which I will now quote them, having been released yesterday by the Dublin office of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The Government were right: they are not strictly comparable because in the other eight countries the total unemployment is shown but in this country only those on the live register are shown.  In the last two weeks we have had 52,000 young people leaving school.  Very few have yet got jobs or are likely to get jobs in the near future.  A high proportion of school leavers, therefore, are unemployed although they are eminently employable.</P>
    <P>School leavers and others of that kind are included in the unemployment figures of other countries.  They are not included here.  Even allowing for that, and that therefore the figures are not strictly comparable, the position is that our unemployment rate is 8.5 per cent.  In Britain it is 4 per cent; in West Germany, 4.7; in France, 4.5; in Belgium, 6.2; in the Netherlands, 4.8 and in Italy, 5.7.  We are double what most of them are without counting all the unemployed who are not on the live register: if they are counted we are probably treble.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as well as having an appalling unemployment problem, we also have an appalling inflation crisis caused above all else by the totally <Col N="2176" /> reckless deficit budget we got yesterday. Even with a deficit budget it strikes one, when the explanatory table is read, that an important element in the capital programme is Road Fund payments.  They are down.  It was proposed in last January's budget to expend £19.10 million on the Road Fund. Yesterday's budget proposes to spend £18.44 million.  That may seem to be a small decrease, but inflation in construction costs is running at 25 per cent per annum.  To have kept the figures the same would have meant an effective decrease in road building activity of 25 per cent, but to have decreased the figure is to decrease the actual work by much more than 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that the Government should spend paltry sums in a terribly necessary sphere like that but seem quite able to spend vast sums on much less important things and to give vast increases to much less important things.  Some play was made today about the help allegedly being given in official budget No. 2 of 1975 &mdash;we have had virtually a monthly budget&mdash;to the building industry.  It is £10.5 million extra out of the capital budget that has an allocation for local authority loans and payment of local authority grants.</P>
    <P>My experience, and that of many others, is that at the moment most local authorities do not need additional money.  In most cases their allocations for private house loans are sufficient but the problem is that they cannot get enough qualified people to apply for what is available.  This is because of the ridiculous and outdated limit of £4,500.  This limit is so inadequate that people who would be prepared to build houses cannot make up the several thousand pounds that is usually needed to bridge the gap between the local authority loan and the cost of housing.  If the Government wished genuinely to give any help to housing what they could and should have done in the short term, as we have been advocating for almost two years, was to increase the loan maximum figure of £4,500.  However for some extraordinary reason which eludes me they did not do that.  The whole construction industry know well that that is <Col N="2177" /> what needs to be done but it was refused. The £10.5 million is of very little use.  It may be of some use in some counties where the applications for loans were being used up, but in many local authority areas this is not the case.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the present national agreement wages are increasing by 30 per cent.  The income limit in respect of loans has been allowed to remain at £2,350 for several years despite the fact that a high proportion of the population and of potential house builders are earning in excess of that amount, although they are by no means well-off and in many cases would be slow to take up loans from sources other than the local authorities. The most important aspect of what was done yesterday in relation to housing seems to have been overlooked by most commentators, that is, that the rate of interest on new local authority loans has been increased from 10½ to 11½ per cent and that the repayment period has been reduced from 35 to 30 years.  The net result of that is that it is now 10 per cent dearer to borrow £4,500 from a local authority.  No move could have been more calculated than this to slow down the construction of private houses.  Does the Minister seriously think that by this increase of 10 per cent in the cost of a local authority loan, building will be stimulated, that he will get the industry back into the prosperous state it was up to two years ago?</P>
    <P>So far as the local authorities are concerned the increase of 10 per cent in the cost of repayment applies only to new loans, but in many ways they are the most important because they are the only ones which affect directly the progress of growth of the building industry.  People getting their money this morning from a local authority, be it county council or corporation, will pay 10 per cent more in every week or every month when they make their repayments than if they had got their money yesterday. People who are in the process of building their houses are the ones who will be affected.  It stands to reason, then, that the industry as a whole must <Col N="2178" /> be affected by this huge further increase in costs at this time.  What is important also, particularly from the point of view of consumer prices generally, is that there is an increase of a quarter per cent on all building societies' mortgage repayments.  That amounts to approximately 2½ per cent or 3 per cent on weekly repayments. The rate has increased from 11¼ to 11½ per cent.  What is significant about this increase&mdash;and this has scarcely been adverted to here today &mdash;is that it applies to all mortgages so that regardless of whether one raised a loan 20 years ago or much more recently, he will be subject to an increase of from 2½ per cent to 3 per cent on repayments.</P>
    <P>These factors have been omitted by the Minister in his compilation of the effects of the subsidies on the consumer price index.  But for families who are building houses and who are put to the pin of their collar to make their weekly repayments an increase of 10 per cent in mortgage repayments has a significant effect on their weekly budget.  I cannot calculate what will be the overall effect on the consumer price index.  Perhaps it will not be all that great, because the number of families concerned may be only about 50,000 during the next few years and possibly the figure is weighted low in the compilation of the index.  However for a very large number of families involved this is a very sore blow and many of them may not be aware of what lies in store for them in this regard.</P>
    <P>There has been talk of the associated banks agreeing in principle to make available for house purchase loans a sum of £40 million during the next two years.  We are told that when the details have been settled a further announcement will be made.  Is it not significant that the details could not have been given to us yesterday?  I would hazard a guess that the reason is that the banks do not want to give this money but that they are being forced to give it because of the Central Bank being instructed by the Government to so regulate matters that the banks must make this money available.  It runs against the whole tradition of Irish banking to make <Col N="2179" /> available long-term loans to the private sector in this manner.  Traditionally the only money that was ever got for housing from the commercial banks was by way of bridging loans at excessively high interest rates.  I wonder whether the banks are seeking to maintain that approach to housing finance and if they will insist that the £20 million which they will make available this year will be on a bridging-loan basis only where it is of little or no value from any long-term point of view in financing any increase in the housing programme?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the banks are unhappy about their arm being twisted in this regard.  Unless this money can be made available on a long-term basis of, say, 25 or 30 years, at reasonable interest rates, it will be of no value and it would be better not to bother about it.</P>
    <P>While I am on the question of banks, there is one aspect of their activities to which I would like to advert briefly while the Minister is present, that is, that our major banks trade in Britain and in Northern Ireland, that they have a large number of branches in Northern Ireland and that two of them have eight or ten branches each in England also. Their branches that are trading in those places obey the rules that apply there.  In other words, they obey the rules about freedom of competition. They obey the procedure which obtains in Britain, for example, whereby all the major clearing banks make no bank charges to customers whose current accounts remain in credit.</P>
    <P>If the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks can afford to do that in Britain&mdash;and it appears that they do very well there and are expanding their network very rapidly&mdash;why can they not afford to do it here?  Why should the Irish public have all this money squeezed from them for no apparent reason when in Britain the banks can afford to compete on that basis?</P>
    <P>There are various aspects of the banking system here to which one would like to advert but the budget debate is not necessarily the <Col N="2180" /> appropriate one on which to do so. I would hope to avail of an opportunity on some future occasion to do so in more detail.  Deputies will have noticed that, in recent months particularly, there has been a great deal of disquiet about certain aspects of the banking system here.  There may well be a basis for at least some of that expressed disquiet.</P>
    <P>The so-called package delivered here last afternoon by the Minister for Finance is patently dependent, in the last resort, on the goodwill of the trade unions.  It seems to me&mdash;and I think it has been commented on already&mdash;that the Minister for Finance and the Government generally have abdicated their responsibility for the ultimate control of our economy and have handed it over to other people. To my mind perhaps the most significant sentence of the Minister's fairly lengthy speech of yesterday was that reading as follows:</P>
    <P>If on the other hand modifications of the national pay agreement should be refused or if they should be inadequate, the Government would be reluctantly obliged to consider revoking the price reliefs which are a significant feature of this budget.</P>
    <P>I do not think that sentence has been picked up by many of the people who have commented in the short time that has elapsed since the introduction of this budget.  Were I a trade unionist or a trade union official, I would regard that sentence as a fairly naked threat&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so naked either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what would be my attitude when I read that &mdash;if I did not make substantial modifications in an agreement freely entered into the inducements would be withdrawn immediately.  Elsewhere in his speech the Minister referred to the fact that action by the trade unions to modify the national wage agreement will have to be made fairly quickly&mdash;and he is talking of a matter of weeks.  Therefore, presumably, if those modifications are not made within a matter of weeks, that sentence <Col N="2181" /> I have quoted will come into effect; or one might well ask, having seen them fail to face up to so many other problems, will the Government have the guts to put it into effect?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made great play of the fact that the recent national wage agreement was one freely entered into and that the Government deliberately did not take any part in it.  But the Government must have been aware, from both sides negotiating in that agreement, what was its likely result. They must have known that very large figures were being spoken about and that there was a probability, as it happened, of a 30 per cent wage increase in a year.  They must have known in April, as apparently they now know in June, that that was an extraordinarily high rate of increase in incomes, far beyond any possible increase there might be in production in this country.  If it is all right for the Government now, in the month of June, to interfere and tell the trade unions&mdash; go back and re-negotiate it; reduce the increases to be granted in that agreement&mdash;why was it not all right in the month of April?  If the Government can come now with this package designed to reduce the consumer price index by 3½ per cent, what was there to stop them coming along in April with a similar package?  Would not it have been easier to modify an agreement they knew would be harmful to the economy as a whole before that agreement was signed rather than come back two months later, after it had been implemented in relation to tens of thousands of workers all over the country, and ask them to give back something which in effect they had already?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it at this stage only that the Government are beginning to wake up to the realities of the situation, that they now feel they must endeavour to do something?  Is it only now they are endeavouring to give guidance and leadership?  Whether or not they are endeavouring to do so I do not believe they are succeeding because the whole thing has been handed back on a plate today to the trade union movement of this country.  That movement will decide within the next few weeks <Col N="2182" /> whether it wants to modify the national wage agreement and, if it says it does not, there is nothing the Government can do about it notwithstanding the partially veiled threat in the Minister's speech of yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had the good news to convey in his speech of yesterday, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Before these measures, the prospects were for a price rise of the order of 24 per cent by the end of the year; now, provided there are no untoward developments in external prices, we can hope that prices will not rise by more than 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>As far as the general public are concerned, that is the nett result of all the ballyhoo that culminated in yesterday's fiscal measures.  Instead of prices rising by 24 per cent in 1975, thanks to the courageous action of the National Coalition Government, in fact they will now rise by 20 per cent only.  Of course, even there a proviso had to be inserted&mdash;&ldquo;provided there are no untowards developments in external prices&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>And we, in a Common Market with a country like Germany, which has half our unemployment and one-fifth of our inflation rate, are expected to compete with them.  We are expected to sell to a country and in a market with an inflation rate of 5.8 per cent. After these tremendous efforts on the part of our Government it is expected now that our price rise this year will not be 24 per cent but 20 per cent that is if everything works out well, everybody plays ball and foreigners and others do not mess us up. It is pathetic that a huge song and dance is made about measures which, if they work&mdash;and there is a very big &ldquo;if&rdquo; about it&mdash;will actually reduce our inflation rate or price rises this year, to 20 per cent, four times that of our biggest competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, Sir, puts the whole situation into perspective.  It is a depressing picture.  One almost hesitates to refer <Col N="2183" /> to some of its aspects because it makes one feel that the prospects of the country in the foreseeable future are far from good.  But, nonetheless, that appears to be the situation.  And the reason we find ourselves today in that situation at the end of June, 1975, cannot be attributed to the Arabs, to the inflation rate of other countries or to any of the long litany of reasons recited to us over the last two years as things continued to deteriorate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that over 80 per cent of our inflationary pressures this year are matters within our own control and, by definition, within the control of the Government of this country.  We have reached, in June, 1975, the situation that I have described here and which has been summed up in the budgetary tables distributed last night, which show this appalling borrowing and this appalling deficit, which is 20 per cent of the budget.</P>
    <P>The use of the term budget is no longer appropriate because it is not a budget.  A budget is something which balances.  This is just some form of paper accountancy.  Budgeting has finished in this country.  It is just bankruptcy now.  The figures disclosed by the tables and the situation which exists today, 27th June, 1975, should be contrasted by anybody who is interested with the situation which existed on the 15th March, 1973, when the Government took over a country where the growth rate in real terms was 6 per cent, inflation was less than 10 per cent and where not alone was the budget balanced but it was actually in surplus.</P>
    <P>It is hardly possible to believe that this country could have declined so far in such a short time.  The only hope I can see for our economy is that when the people who caused that decline get out the improvement could be nearly as rapid if the people who are making that improvement are allowed to go back to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want very briefly to support the Minister for Finance in his budget proposals and to urge all sections of the community <Col N="2184" /> to respond to his call and give full support to the determined effort to break the cycle of rising prices and bring about a curb on inflation. I have listened for some time to Opposition speakers, particularly Deputy O'Malley, talk about the various things affecting our economy.  It is difficult after listening to Deputy O'Malley to visualise that until two and a half years ago his party were in office for over 16 years.  It is difficult to imagine why during all those years Fianna Fáil did not implement many of the things they are advocating now.</P>
      <P>I did not like to interrupt the Deputy when he spoke about unemployment figures, but I also read the Press release from the Commission. If we look at the figures of our partners in the Community, look at the size of those countries and also remember that under no stretch of the imagination should anyone compare our figures with those of countries like the Federal Republic of Germany, France or any of the big strong economies we can see that we are not the very bottom of the table. Denmark, which must be recognised as a stronger economy than ours and possibly with the Netherlands would be closer to our type of economy, having large agricultural exports, has a higher rate of unemployment at 12.2 per cent than we have at 8.5 per cent.  This is not something which we should be complacent about, and I only mention it in order to put the record straight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EEC figures, as published, can be taken as a guide.  We must remember, although we are partners of the same Community, one is not really comparing like with like in many spheres.  I should like to compliment the Government on the laudable proposals they have introduced to encourage industrialists to employ more people.  This is the first time this kind of proposal has been tried.  It merits consideration and I hope employers, manufacturers and industrialists will be able to respond to this incentive.  Our manufacturers should be asked to embark, with the help of Córas Tráchtála and with the leadership <Col N="2185" /> of the Government, on a determined sell Irish campaign not alone on the home market but throughout the world.  We should look very closely at the signatories to the Lomé Convention, the ACP countries, where we have quite a number of developing nations in all of which the standing of our country is reasonably high.  In the vast majority of those countries there is a strong demand for consumer products.</P>
    <P>When exporting to these countries we need to produce quality products, and package and present them in an attractive way to meet the demands of that particular market, which is different from that of any other country. In this new area, which comprises one-sixth of the world population, there must be unlimited scope for astute Irish businessmen to get an amount of merchandise into circulation.  Before we tackle that it is necessary to send out some of our industrialists and sales people to organise trade missions to these countries where there is any possibility of developing trade links.  I ask Córas Tráchtála to redouble their efforts in this direction.  Never before in our history has there been a greater wave of recognition for us.  A lot of this is as a result of the very excellent job our Ministers did during the past six months in their onerous role while we held Presidency of the European Community.  At last we have carved in a definite way an identity for our country.  We should follow up that period of hard work and tremendous leadership by our Ministers in Europe by a redoubling of our efforts with CTT and the semi-State bodies to sell our products to every possible market, the market in the TCP countries in particular.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Haughey castigating the efforts of our Ministers in Europe in the past six months.  It has been generally acknowledged by many leading politicians and personalities in Europe that during the term of our presidency of the EEC there was leadership and new hope, a clarity of view and fresh thought brought to bear on many problems.  Deputy Gibbons is laughing at that comment <Col N="2186" /> but he must agree that the summit conference in Dublin was the most successful of the last three EEC summit conferences.  It was successful not only because more was achieved during it but also because of the physical arrangements.  This is a tremendous tribute to the Government and those responsible for the arrangements for that conference.</P>
    <P>In view of the success of the last six months every effort should be made to build up the markets and outlets for our produce.  We are all anxious to see an expansion in our industries and an increase in employment. In regard to the creation of employment I should like to see local authorities playing a greater role.  The Departments of Finance and Local Government should give preference to financing labour intensive schemes whether they are housing or roads&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Labour intensive sewerage and forestry schemes should also be considered.  The Department of Lands should make an effort in that direction also having regard to the fact that since the increase in the price of oil there has been an increase in the demand for timber of all kinds. We should endeavour to revamp the areas of economic activity that require intensive labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was brave in going outside the traditional hardy annuals for raising money.  I am glad he did not have to rely on increasing the price of petrol, beer, wine or cigarettes. It is important that we should maintain our competitiveness as far as the tourist industry is concerned. Many do not regard that as one which provides employment but we should recognise the employment being given to our people in hotels and at the various tourist resorts.  I am glad the Minister did not increase the price of the items I have referred to because of their importance to the tourist industry.  They are regarded as luxuries but we must maintain our competitiveness in the tourist market. I hope that it will not be too long <Col N="2187" /> before we return to the position we enjoyed in this industry a few years ago.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to remove VAT from clothing, textiles and other items.  It sounds rather hollow coming from the Opposition to hear them say that the removal of VAT from these items is too little too late.  A prominent Fianna Fáil spokesman last year put his name to a proposal before the European Parliament to take from the national governments the facility to zero rate items such as foodstuffs and those referred to by the Minister for Finance yesterday. It is difficult to understand the Opposition when they say that the efforts by this Government are coming too late.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Ministers concerned in securing the support of their European colleagues in using the various articles to help specific industries here.  Deputy O'Malley wondered how this could be done when it was not possible to do it five or six weeks ago.  In my view it shows the hard work our Ministers have put into this.  It shows that our Ministers have been able to get an amount of agreement with their colleagues and sell to their European partners the necessity to introduce these measures in order to curb the dastardly trends in our economy.  I hope there will be a positive response from the areas and the industries concerned.</P>
    <P>The proposal to encourage industrialists to take on new employees from the unemployment register is a significant breakthrough in Government policy.  It is a new area.  After six months if the scheme has proved its worth then I would ask that the Government would seriously consider extending this type of scheme to the agricultural sector.  There are a number of reasons why I suggest this but mainly because there is in the agricultural sector a number of categories of farmers such as widows who find it uneconomic to employ adequate labour on their holdings.  If such a scheme were introduced only for a trial period and even if it applied only to certain categories of farmers, <Col N="2188" /> it would be worth trying to see what it would mean in terms of increasing not only employment but production and export earnings.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to support the Government in the dynamic steps they have taken yesterday and to express the hope that every section of the community will respond and give the proposals a fair trial.  With such co-operation we should be able to get our economy working more efficiently and keep inflation in check so that our figures will be more competitive with those of our partners in the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my brief remarks on this budget I will try to be as constructive as I can.  I am astonished at Deputy McDonald, a man for whom I have great respect, saying that there was need for fresh thinking.  There should have been fresh thinking eight or nine months ago.  When the Minister brought in the budget last January it was obvious to anybody even with schoolboy intelligence that inflation would continue.  A national pay agreement was negotiated and the Government never said a word.  While we agree with the reductions proposed in the budget, they are too late.  The trade unions and the workers will now be asked to forego what they are justly entitled to under the national wage agreement, which was arrived at taking inflation into account.</P>
      <P>What way will these reductions balance out?  The reductions in CIE fares will benefit the workers in the Dublin city area, but in the rural areas these reductions will not reduce the overheads of the worker who has to use a car travelling, say, 30 miles to work in a city like Galway because CIE transport does not suit him.  These workers had to face a 15p increase in the price of petrol and nothing has been done to relieve that impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those within certain salary ranges will have to agree to further income tax as well as a reduction under the national pay agreement.  However, as I speak for the lower income group, small farmers, I will not dwell too much on that.  I am not so worried about ourselves being brought into these proposals.  If you want <Col N="2189" /> people to accept reductions in income you must start at the top.  If we were to be exempted we could not sell the package to people outside.  Such reductions in income should apply to everybody, from the President down, who can afford it.</P>
    <P>However, I am worried about the people who are just coming into the income tax bracket and who will have to pay income tax and suffer a reduction of income as well.  The fresh thinking to which Deputy McDonald referred and which I thought was being undertaken by this Government from the beginning does not seem to have materialised.  It was obvious that the national pay agreement would be very hard to implement but why was it allowed to go on? It would have been easy enough to introduce these measures before an agreement was entered into, but when people are told they are entitled to a certain amount it is very hard to say to them and make it a kind of a threat: &ldquo;It is over to you.  If you disagree you will be the cause of the downfall of the country.&rdquo;  It is tough for a trade unionist to have to make such a decision.  However, in the interests of the country I hope they will agree.</P>
    <P>I have come to a section of the community that was not even mentioned in this budget&mdash;and I want to be very tough about this&mdash;that is, the farming community.  There is mention of a subsidy for employment in industry. This is worth a try, but I do not know whether it will appeal to industrialists or not.  Deputy Haughey suggested that we should reconstruct our industry so that when markets become available abroad we shall be ready to avail of them.  In commenting on that suggestion the Taoiseach said there was not much point in gearing industries to produce goods that you could not sell.  There is no point either in asking industry to employ more men even though they will get £12 per worker.  The wages will be £30 anyway, plus £4 social welfare.  Do you think any of them will do it?  I would like the farming community to have been included, so that any week a farmer could take a man off the dole <Col N="2190" /> and pay him the agricultural wage.</P>
    <P>The agricultural wage is not, of course, as high as the industrial wage and it is therefore harder to put people on the land than it is into industry. If that suggestion were adopted there would be no loss because the man would be taken off the dole queue and would no longer be drawing social welfare.  It is often argued that people do not want to work.  That is not true. Every public representative knows the majority would rather work than draw social welfare.  Deputy McDonald said there would be some difficulties. I believe any difficulties that might exist would easily be overcome.</P>
    <P>Something will have to be done to help the finances of local authorities. There is work that could be provided if local authorities had the money. In my own county the county manager was asked what the position would be where roadworkers were concerned and the answer was that the situation would be reviewed in September but it looked as if the permanent workers would be kept on, temporary workers would not be kept on and those who retired would not be replaced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer in my county was that the same number would be kept on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the answer in my county.  Could this £12 not also be made available to local authorities?  They would, of course, need another injection apart from the £12.  There was a question yesterday about an application made by Galway last year; a sum of £26,000 was sanctioned but that £26,000 never came. It was wanted for small schemes.  We put in an application then this year for £74,000 plus the £26,000 we did not get last year.  We received sanction for £30,000.  We did not expect to get the £100,000, but getting £30,000 for two years' work is absurd. That is the progression at the moment in local authorities.  I would have liked some injection in this budget for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsidy of £12 will not help industry to employ a great many extra people if there is no sale for what is <Col N="2191" /> produced.  I have a strong fear this will not work.  If it does work, I shall be very happy.</P>
    <P>Housing was mentioned and a sum of £20 million from the banks.  Over how many years will this sum be spread?  Housing has increased by at least 58 per cent but the grants have remained at the same figure, a figure fixed ten years ago.  The maximum grant is something in the region of £920.  Houses costing £4,500 some years back are now costing £9,000.  How are young couples to buy a house or build a house under present conditions?  How could they possibly save £3,000 or £4,000 to help buy a house?  They must lodge the deeds with the local authority and, as far as I know, they cannot get money from any other source.  Something will have to be done to help young couples.</P>
    <P>Everybody is very annoyed that something was not done before this to help the footwear industry.  I am glad arrangements are now being made in Brussels to do something about this industry.  Apparently it is only now people have discovered there is a clause in the Treaty of Rome under which something can be done.  The difficulty is we wait until it is too late.  I believe we will have a tough job now saving the footwear industry because things have gone too far.  Steps should have been taken six months ago.  The Government seem unable to make a decision. I do not like to be harsh, but I wonder is that what is wrong?  They wait until the writing is on the wall. They cannot see what is coming.  This is where I disagree with Deputy McDonald on the fresh thinking.  If there were fresh thinking and forward planning it should have been possible to see there was a clause in the Treaty of Rome under which something could be done to help the footwear industry. Why is it only now this discovery has been made?</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to farming. When we are at the end of the road we can do something but there is a danger that it will then be too late to put the industry back on its feet.  Why not try to help the industry when it is starting to decline.  I should like the Minister to answer that point because <Col N="2192" /> I, for one am fed up being told that nothing can be done because it is outside the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with a section of the community which was not even mentioned on either side of the House, and that is, the small farmers. As I said before, there are very few Deputies who give a damn about the small farmer.  Many of them know nothing about the farmers and care less.  I represent small farmers.  There is £3 million provided for agriculture in this package.  We are not told just where it will be spent.  Let us look at what the ordinary small farmer lost last winter.  I am sorry to have to say that the Almighty has not been as kind to the Minister as He was last year.  If last winter had not been good for the farmer, we would have lost a great deal of stock.  If the present fine spell continues, there will be a serious shortage of fodder.  The cattle trade is very bad at the moment.  Last winter the small farmer had to sell his calf at £5 a cwt because he could not feed it. All of a sudden in the spring cattle prices rose.  That small farmer had to buy dear, £110.  He sells those cattle now, and what happens?  &mdash;prices fall again.</P>
    <P>Milk production is down by 50 per cent because of the weather.  Last winter the dairy man could not sell his calf and he gambled him.  Some years ago this farmer would have got £30 to £40 for the calf.  What is this man's income now?</P>
    <P>There are very few Members in this House to listen to me telling about the plight of the small farmer today. Most Members do not realise just how hard it is to make a living when one has to depend on the weather.  This year the farmer had to pay a very high price for his cattle.  One of the reasons for this was the strike, which should never have occurred.  Negotiations are going on at the moment and I hope they will be successful. Negotiations should have been started before the strike began.  The strike caused a serious drop in the price of younger cattle because the stronger cattle were not moving out.</P>
    <P>Unless there is a break in the fine weather, as I already said, milk will be down 50 per cent.  I do not know <Col N="2193" /> what will happen to the potato crop, but I would say there will be a reduction of about 50 per cent; and the yield of corn will definitely be down. All these things mean that the farmer's income will be down again this year.</P>
    <P>The hay crop is down by 50 per cent.  People are first-cutting silage at the moment but unless the weather breaks there will be no second-cut silage.  There will be no growth.  I am not blaming the Government for this.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;various aspects of the budget, I must say that very few people in this House pay much attention to the farmers.  What will their incomes be like at the end of this year?  Nothing was done for them last November when they were in a serious situation.  There is a 50 per cent decrease in milk production.  The potato crop is reduced by about 50 per cent.  The production of fruit crops and corn will be reduced this year and the farmers' profits will be reduced accordingly.  This will be the second year in succession that farmers have to suffer such a drastic reduction in their incomes.  This will destroy their confidence.  Mention was made of £3 million but we were not told how it will be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment meted out to the <Col N="2194" /> sheep trade by the French was contrary to the principles of the Treaty of Rome.  I know there is no common agricultural policy for sheep but surely there is a principle involved here and what the French Government did was contrary to that principle.  The strike, which should not have taken place, did untold damage to the lamb trade. If you rang up a factory during the strike and asked them would they take lambs from you they said they could not and they did not.  Some people do not know what it means to have a lamb ready after fattening.  When the lamb is ready for the factory he must be sent straight away, or he will get too heavy or, if you have not enough feed for him, he will have too much bone, too much wool, his head will be too big, and he will not be a suitable factory lamb.  The farmers' income from sheep will be down this year.</P>
    <P>The Government should have given a direct payment last year for small cattle.  We are afraid small cattle will be bad again this year.  As chairman of the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture I met the manure merchants and we suggested to the Minister that something should be done; there was a reduction of 40 per cent in fertilisers.  I am speaking about potash and phosphate.  There was plenty of nitrogen.  If you continue to put nitrogen on your land without potash and phosphate you damage the land.  I appealed for something to be done early this year. Fodder vouchers were given out last year for feedingstuffs.  Because of a reduction in the amount of potash and phosphate there is a reduction in the first cut of silage and, if the land is not manured now, there will be no second cut.  People have not got the money.  I suggest to the Government they should subsidise fertilisers.</P>
    <P>Nobody seems to worry about the unfortunate farmer.  Unless there is a break in the weather very quickly people will be worried about fodder. I am not blaming the Government for the weather, but I blame them for doing nothing about small cattle.  The weather was very good to the Government last winter.  Some of our <Col N="2195" /> prophecies were not fulfilled because we had the grandest winter in living memory and no fodder was needed. Everybody knows that under the EEC directive the small farmer will not be considered.  He is told to get subsidiary employment.  We are not able to give employment to people who are not farmers.  We are doing nothing to keep the family farmer on the farm.  He will get a grant all right but there is no farm plan.  The people are losing confidence.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this package about a subsidy for fertilisers.  The price of small cattle may be down again this year.  Will the Government come to the aid of the small farmers if it happens again?  We do not want Government aid if we get even a reasonable price.  The wool trade is not good.  That is not the fault of the Government.  Apparently the farmers' income will be down by 50 per cent this year and nobody in this House gives a Highland damn.  This type of person has been the backbone of the country down through the years together with the ordinary workingman.</P>
    <P>The CIE subsidy is no good to the workingman in rural Ireland.  He cannot use CIE transport.  Last year he had to pay an extra 15p for a gallon of petrol.  This 4p is of benefit to the city worker who uses CIE transport. We all welcome a reduction in the cost of living but I cannot understand why it had to be from six to nine months too late.  I give the Minister credit for being a more intelligent man than I am but in my own tinpot way I knew last January that the national wage agreement which was being negotiated could not be implemented.  Why did the Minister not say at that time: &ldquo;We will do something to prove to you that your real income will be protected.&rdquo;  If last January they did what they are doing now we would not have this agreement.  I understand that it was accepted that the increase had to be given because of the increased cost of living.  Now the Government are saying: &ldquo;If you do not conduct yourself, and accept that you are not getting your increase, we will withdraw the package.&rdquo;<Col N="2196" /> That is going too far, and if I were a trade union member I would be very sore about it.</P>
    <P>The package goes reasonably far. If you were running a business and your income was £100,000 and if you found at the end of the year it was costing £120,000 to keep the business going without any expansion and you did nothing to expand production but spent the £20,000 extra, while I am not an economist I think that would be going in the wrong direction. I believe if I continued to do that somebody else would soon have the business.  That is what is happening here.</P>
    <P>This is not a budget at all.  There is no talk of balancing budgets but I cannot see how we can survive if there is not a windfall from somewhere. I hope for the sake of the country there will be.  It would not be good for any side of the House if the country were not going well. If I am borrowing money every year to keep things going I cannot see myself surviving.  I have always advocated borrowing money for productive purposes which would bring in money at a later date but if you have to continue to borrow to keep any business going it cannot exist for long.  I should like some economist or financial expert to tell me how it can be done: perhaps the whole attitude to finance has changed.</P>
    <P>This is not an impossible budget. People in the country will say that they will get bread and butter a little cheaper and that things are all right at present but unless the gamble the Government are taking comes off&mdash;I hope it does in the interests of the country; it is a gamble the Government had to take&mdash;we shall be in a very serious situation.  I blame the Government for not looking ahead and for not knowing what was in store when anybody down the country could tell you that this situation would arise.  People knew there would have to be some type of package but apparently the Government neglected to bring in the package until it was too late.  It is too late in that people have been promised an increase to which they are justly entitled on the <Col N="2197" /> grounds of inflation and now they are not going to get it or, if they do, the package will be withdrawn and we do not know where we are.</P>
    <P>I am worried because we are borrowing too much money and I am also worried about the fact that the £12 premium applies only to industry.  If an industry cannot sell what it produces I doubt if they will employ a man to whom they will have to pay about £30 per week plus £4 social welfare, even with the £12 subsidy.  This £12 does not apply to farmers or local authorities.  I think the scheme will be very costly, not from the Government's point of view because they will save on social welfare, but from the point of view of the company or whoever receives the £12.  I fear that unless they need the man very badly they will not employ him.  However, I hope the scheme will help to relieve the unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>If the Government want to restore confidence they should face up to the situation, as they are doing now, but when they were warned during the year about such things as the footwear industry, nothing could be done. When we spoke about housing we were told that everything was fine.  As Deputy Colley said, I do not know what this £20 million from the banks is required for when we were told there was no scarcity of money for housing.  We knew damn well there was.  We also knew there was plenty of unemployment but we were told that everything in the garden was rosy.</P>
    <P>My advice to the Government is to have common sense.  Tell the truth to the people.  Tell them we are in a serious situation and ask them to accept the package.  There is no use in trying to cod the people.  You may continue to do that until the Exchequer runs out; and I warn the Government that if they continue with this type of set-up the Exchequer will run dry and then I do not know who will save the situation.  Even if Fianna Fáil get back I do not know what they can do.  Nobody can run a country or a business without money.  While I never had much money I found that it spoke all kinds of languages.  If you are without <Col N="2198" /> money nobody wants you.  Whoever takes over the country if all the money is gone, will have a very difficult job.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government package will be accepted and that the trade unions will do what I think would be a very patriotic thing, having been granted increases to which they were entitled, and, say that in the interests of the country they will forego their just claim.  Irrespective of one's politics it can do nobody good if the country is not doing well.  Anybody who would make a speech here that would damage the country we all know would be a bad Irishman.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is about time that somebody warned the Government that you can cod the people for a time but you cannot cod them all the time.  The people are no fools; we have an educated electorate who will not easily be deceived.  Long ago they did not know much about high finance and a few pence here and a few pence there went a long way.  Now there is scarcely a house where there is not at least one intelligent person who is capable of going into figures and you cannot cod them for very long.  My advice to the Government is to give up codding, get down to work and try to pull the country out of the present mess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean to provoke Deputy Lalor opposite when I say that 20 minutes ago it was possible to come into this Chamber and see Deputy Callanan on one side and myself on the other and not another Member in the House, either Government or Opposition.  The Opposition Front Bench was completely unmanned for about half an hour and there was no one on my side of the House except myself for nearly the same length of time.  I say that, not to score a political point but because I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this is supposed to be one of the major debates of the year, certainly one of the major economic debates of the year.  It is on a motion in which the principal speaker who started this morning a few short hours ago was Deputy Jack Lynch, ex-Taoiseach and within a few short hours of Deputy <Col N="2199" /> Lynch speaking and within an even smaller number of hours of the Taoiseach speaking this House was emptier than it normally is for some question about a telephone kiosk.</P>
      <P>This is the kind of thing which attracts a certain amount of censorious attention from the Press and from commentators who will say: &ldquo;Here are these people elected to do a certain job and who spend half their lives trying to get into Dáil Éireann and when they get there they have not the patience to sit in it and take part in debates and to watch what is going on.&rdquo; I wish the energy and, no doubt, sincerity behind that censoriousness on the part of the Press and of commentators could divert itself into exploring the reasons why for a debate like this, the quorum bell has to be rung before 20 Government Deputies come in and in which the Opposition almost to a man has taken to the hills and a rescue squad or fire brigade in the shape of their own Whip has to come in and man the benches.  I do not think he expected to speak today at all but is now ready to speak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  There is no doubt that the vast majority of Deputies on both sides have gone home and the reason for that&mdash;and I want to make it highly relevant to the budget debate&mdash;is that everybody inside and outside the House is sick and tired of budget debates.  We have them in this House almost every single week.  I can count offhand, without going back to the records at <Col N="2200" /> all, that this is the second budget this year or, third, if you like to count the petrol impost in December as a budget and since the amount of money is large I will not quibble at that term being applied to it.  That was in the last calendar year, shortly before Christmas.  I can count at least six full dress debates which assumed the character of budget debates. There was the debate on the Second Stage of last year's Finance Bill, the debate which followed the imposition of the petrol tax, a full-scale debate to which two or three days were given by the Government on the economic situation and there were the Second Stage debates on the Wealth Tax Bill and the Capital Gains Tax Bill each of which was developed by the Opposition&mdash;and I suppose we may have patted the ball back&mdash;into what was a full-scale economic debate and any member of the public wandering in here would have heard Deputy Joe Dowling giving out about one thing and Deputy Callanan giving out about another thing, all no doubt with their eyes on the ball and their minds on the job but all essentially saying the same thing over and over again.</P>
      <P>I recognise, as everybody must recognise, the total sincerity and dedication of Deputy Callanan, in particular to the interest which he so very well represents, the small farmer, particularly the small western farmer, but I think I know Deputy Callanan's case by heart.  I could make it for him myself even though I know very little about farming.  I have learned more from Deputy Callanan about silage in the last three years than I ever learned before but it is from hearing him saying it over and over again.  I have heard Deputy Joe Dowling saying things about the Government and about the economy and about unemployment over and over again.  Even the best case becomes wearisome and tedious after a while and the reason why this House empties its benches when this kind of debate starts is that we are tired of these debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the six full-dress debates I have mentioned, the sixth of which is going on today and we can see how full dress it is&mdash;apart from these we <Col N="2201" /> have miniature budget debates week in week out in Private Members' Time from 6 to 7.30 p.m., the peak viewing time from the point of view of the Press.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The best of luck.  Go n-eirigh an bóthar leat.  Week in week out we have miniature budget debates at peak viewing time for the weekly columnists who are just beginning to assemble their material about that time &mdash;6-7.30 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Question Time three days a week here has been developed by the extraordinarily gentlemanly and lenient behaviour of the Chair&mdash;I intend that in no way as a reflection&mdash;in such a way that every question is turned into a miniature Private Members' hour. The number of questions answered has dropped and dropped and day to day there are exchanges filling two or three columns representing supplementary questions, all no doubt on what is a very important point but all centred around the same line of country.</P>
      <P>The people inside and outside the House are tired of this.  There is such a thing as being bored to death even by things that are important.  That is the reason why this House is empty. The Press and those who take an interest in such things ought to realise that it is fantastic to expect that 20 grown men or women will sit around here just for the sake of appearances listening to Deputy Dowling or Deputy Callanan or Deputy Lalor or any other Deputy on the Opposition side or on this side just for the sake of appearances. It is not reasonable.  It is a waste of their time.  It would not happen in a business or in a public authority or anywhere except in an assembly founded on the supposition that what it was doing from hour to hour or minute to minute was exciting and important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That cannot be said about the doings of the Dáil and the reason is that the state of the economy and of various sectors of the economy are over-debated here, repetitiously debated, boringly debated and absolutely no self-discipline is applied.  I <Col N="2202" /> am afraid I must fault the Opposition more than ourselves for that.  There is no self-discipline applied in regard to the length of speeches, the number of speeches, the relevance of speeches and if I may say so, with the greatest respect and affection to the Chair, that situation is contributed to by an extraordinary leniency and generosity on the part of the Chair which reduces into the position of being a bare insult the criticism which the Chair occasionally has to sustain&mdash;although I am glad that there has been less of it in the last month or so&mdash;from the far side, that they are being muzzled. They are not being muzzled.  They are running off at the mouth week in and week out and no muzzle of any kind is applied to them.  If the Chair does attempt to put any kind of order or manners on them, he is accused of being a tyrant or a jackbooter or has to tolerate some other outrageous insults of that kind.  It is in these conditions that the Dáil has become a bore for most Deputies who even now are at home in their constituencies doing what their constituents think is important work for them.</P>
    <P>We are all working horrible hours. The Dáil is doing a double shift.  I realise that it is harder on some than on others.  It is particularly hard on the staff who have to be here in all winds and seasons, in all kinds of Governments, good and bad, who have to listen to talking for talking's sake and have to record it as though it were important.  That is the reason why benches are empty, not because Deputies are lazy or not doing their job but because they have better things to do than listening to Deputies saying the same thing over and over again as though anyone will take any interest in it after he has reached his boredom threshold.</P>
    <P>I hope if my words are listened to we will have a little less in future of censoriousness about Deputies and empty benches.  I should like to see exploration of the reasons why the benches are empty, an interesting and exciting debate on a topic not previously explored and on which there is something more than ritualistic speeches.  Then we would not have <Col N="2203" /> to go around the House flogging people in.  It is not because Deputies are not doing their job; they are doing their job more effectively somewhere else.</P>
    <P>I read the newspapers this morning and I listened to some of the contributions from the Opposition in regard to the Minister's budget.  The one note I did not hear being struck which I want to strike now is this: the burden on the Minister for Finance as a human being is impossible to describe and the courage and the simple guts he has brought to bear to this appalling job require commendation.  If he occasionally loses his temper or something of that kind it is highly venial in my view compared with the work he puts into his job.  I have no doubt the same is just as true of many other Ministers. He has a horrible job.  He is the man on whose desk all the bucks stop, or most of them, and he has brought to them in less than two-and-a-half years an extraordinary resilience and physical stamina which is matched only by one or two other Ministers, may be exceeded by one or two, but certainly is that of a very unusual man.  Whatever political differences may exist it is time somebody said that and it was recognised.</P>
    <P>Having said that I want to move to a point I noticed being made by the Opposition and by the Press in regard to the so-called &ldquo;Government of all the talents&rdquo;.  The Press, or commentators, whether professional journalists or even be the mere writers to the editors in the correspondence columns of the papers, when they wish to take a waspish swipe at the Government say: &ldquo;And this is the best that can be done by the Government of all the talents&rdquo;.  Anybody would swear that this Government had advertised themselves as such.  The truth is that it is the commentators who have put this name on the Government.  They were kind enough to do so in the glow of favourable enthusiasm they displayed towards us&mdash;and which, I suppose, many of them still feel for us&mdash;when we were elected.  But it was not we who so christened ourselves.  It may be difficult to live up to one's own expectations <Col N="2204" /> of oneself; it is harder still to live up to the expectations of others. When I experience that among old pals, as can happen in the best of societies, or amongst people who in the end are not perhaps hostile to one but just endeavouring to flog one to better efforts, I have to say to myself: &ldquo;You are the people who called us the Government of all the talents and, having set up a kind of a plastacine-image of the Government, you are now trying to smash it into pieces when you find that the plaster is really flesh and blood; it is flesh and blood which can be tired, which can be mistaken, which can have &lsquo;off-moments&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;on moments&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope nobody will think that is an apology because my feelings about the Government are quite the opposite.  It is the proudest thing that has ever happened to me, or I suppose ever will, to work&mdash;in a rather sweaty kind of job&mdash;in the Government which now runs this country.  I am proud of them collectively and individually.  I admire their courage, their energy and their talents.  But they are not saints, they are not geniuses and never pretended to be.  If others have called them that, it is intensely flattering.  I appreciate the friendly thought but in moments of national or international difficulty it only intensifies that difficulty if people show exasperation at your not having realised, not yours but their expectations.</P>
    <P>In regard to the content of yesterday's budget statement and the comments made about it, I noted a theme running through some of the speeches and Press comment, which was to the effect that the Government had it within their power to take by the throat the economic factors which determine inflation or recession in this country, as distinct from those outside our control, and force them into the posture of resisting wage demands, and in that way keeping prices down so that, as the Taoiseach said this morning our goods will remain competitive, because we live by selling them to other people.</P>
    <P>Some commentators said: &ldquo;Let the real Minister for Finance now step forward.&rdquo; I know what is meant by <Col N="2205" /> that&mdash;that the real Minister for Finance is envisaged, graphically, as being a sort of personification of the trade unions on whom now so much depends if we are to pull out of the inflation and recession upon us.  Reading those and other comments along the same lines I was reminded of a speech I heard given by Deputy Jack Lynch when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce approximately ten years ago.  It was on a university occasion and I think it was on a legal point in regard to the control of trade unions.  From memory, I think it was around the time of a Supreme Court judgment in regard to trade union rights.  He made an excellent speech on that occasion.  In reply to demands that this, that or the other thing be done to curb the power of a trade union or of organised labour to bring enterprise to a standstill, he said in his quiet way that in a country like this&mdash;and everybody there knew what he was talking about&mdash;there were limits to what one could do by way of pushing people around, no matter what their behaviour was like, no matter how unreasonable it might be, no matter how nationally damaging it might be.  There were limits in a country like this&mdash;and that was the operative phrase&mdash;to what could be done by way of coercing them, of making them abandon a course of conduct which was perhaps selfish or irresponsible in the eyes of others or which was not in conformity with the progress of an economic situation as one would like to see it develop.</P>
    <P>What he meant by saying &ldquo;in a country like this&rdquo; we all understood very well.  It is a country in which people exercise a certain amount of respect for one another.  I know there is a buried 1 per cent or 2 per cent of people&mdash;the friendless, shiftless, the chronically unable to help themselves or even make themselves heard&mdash;who are perhaps forgotten.  These have powerful and effective advocates amongst the media, and it is right that they should have.  These are people who perhaps have no political muscle, the drop-outs and so on.  It is right that in the media, if not among politicians&mdash;because their voting <Col N="2206" /> strength is not sufficient to make politicians have regard to them&mdash;they should have friends who raise a voice on their behalf.  But, apart from that buried 1 per cent or 2 per cent, the rest of us exercise a certain respect towards one and other.  There are limits beyond which we are unwilling to go.  Perhaps even in the prosecution of serious crimes there are bounds over which we will not step and it is right that that should be so.  It is right that there should be restraint in dealing with behaviour which the governing influence, the Government, in the strict sense or in a wider sense, may feel at any particular time to be antisocial or contrary to the national interest.  There is a limit to what one can do with regard to pushing people around.</P>
    <P>When the Government are accused of not doing something but of merely creating an atmosphere, of merely laying the ground, of merely creating the climate or conditions in which others would behave in a certain way, the Government are responding to an inarticulate understanding of what the Irish people are all about.  They will respond to persuasion, to leadership. They will not respond, and no section of them will, to coercion.  That has been demonstrated time and time again.  If this constitutional entity depended on anything else than the people's will, regularly tested, no problem could possibly arise.  We do not hear in Eastern Europe about the resisting of wage claims, about strikes, about difficulties in inflation rates, because there the Government does not have to worry about the unions or anything else.  It does not have to put itself up for election among the people it governs, or for whom it is responsible, over whom God has put it in control.  It does not do these things.  It simply determines what is going to be the supply of consumer goods, determines what people will be paid and lets economic forces take their course. If the result of that is that a factory worker may have to work for two months to earn the price of a pair of shoes or a suit of clothing for himself, let alone his family, that is simply too bad.  He has no effective political <Col N="2207" /> means of expressing his dissatisfaction. He has no means of publicity for trying to recruit political support or for joining the annoyance of others to his.  He merely has to put up with it.</P>
    <P>Tourists from this country who fly to the Black Sea, who spend a fortnight in Mamaia, Varna, Burgas, or wherever it may be in Bulgaria or Romania will see the skyscrapers on the glittering white beaches and are very well fed themselves.  But if they went five miles back into the countryside they would find the ordinary worker or farmer there cannot buy the simplest range of consumer articles because the Government does not simply provide them for him. One day there may be sausage available; another day there may be a bit of mutton; the next day there may be a sausage again.  But even the most limited choice which the Irish worker, farmer or citizen has in regard to consumer goods simply does not exist in Eastern Europe because it does not suit the Government for one reason or another to so provide.  Everything is directed towards the acquisition of foreign currency.  All other things, including the comfort and standard of living of citizens, is subordinate.  The fact that the citizen may be uncomfortable or dissatisfied with that way of doing things does not worry the Government because it does not have to concern itself with it.  It does not have to go back for election; it does not have to exercise any form of coaxing or persuasion; it does not have to bother itself about creating a climate, conditions, or anything else for, let us say, the renegotiation of a national wage agreement or anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>Those problems do not exist if there is an authoritarian government but we do not have such government. The people would not stand for such. There are tendencies nowadays which lead me to suppose that we might find ourselves under an authoritarian government one fine morning and that the people would not have the means of organising themselves to resist it.  It is right that the people would not accept authoritarianism. <Col N="2208" /> Accordingly, a government trying to steer economic forces that are very powerful and in respect of the nature of which even economists disagree, but forces which are spread throughout the civilised western world, must rely on coaxing and persuasion and on creating an atmosphere in which the hoped-for situation will result by agreement.</P>
    <P>If we did not have to go to the country in, as Deputy Lalor says, a month or in a year or two or three, we would have no problems about wage agreements or anything else. But we are a democratic Government and I must concede that we have a democratic Opposition.  If and when that Opposition replace us, their attitude would be exactly the same. There is no way that any democratic Government in the west can think of to cure the problems that we face because the kind of life we live in is one in which people expect that a limit will be observed and recognised beyond which a Government will not go for the achievement of the national benefit.  That restraint on Governments demands reciprocity. Unless the people being governed respect the restraints which the Government show and meet them half way, the very conditions of Government which we enjoy living under are threatened because once it can be shown that an economy has been ruined by the failure of any section, employer or the employee, to meet the Government half way, that government will be under political pressure from one source or another to change their tune towards the function of government generally.  I should be sorry to see that happen but I am convinced that it will not happen.  This budget is a step along the lines of the expectations which the Government have laid down and which will be reciprocated because I am sure that the various sections will respond.</P>
    <P>The expectations that one has of being able to go a good distance without being pushed around by the Government although the Government may think that one's behaviour is not necessarily beneficial to the <Col N="2209" /> economy, is one matter but the expectations which one may have in regard to the material side of life are ones which need to be examined here. When saying something like this, it is easy to fall into the posture of being a hateful, priggish moraliser.  I have no wish to be regarded in that light.  I like the soft life as much as anybody else and far be it from me to condemn it.  However, it is only fair to say that anyone who emigrated from Ireland in 1950 would not recognise the country on returning to it now, 25 years later.  It is not only that the towns are brighter, that the children are dressed and fed better&mdash;all of which are marvellous changes&mdash;but, equally that there are other signs of increased prosperity which are altogether unmeasured.  The concrete result of these expectations can be seen in the figures for expenditure on drink and not only on gross intake of drink but on the kinds of drink consumed and which people accept as being normal to consume.</P>
    <P>I was brought up in a middle-class family in Dublin and I realise the limitations of experience and knowledge that that would impose on me. I have never known any kind of hardship but my parents and the parents of everybody like me would have regarded brandy or whiskey as something to be put on the sideboard and taken out at Christmas or on an occasion of rejoicing or of bereavement. The idea which my own generation has grown into the habit of&mdash;and I do not claim to be an exception in this regard&mdash;is different.  Any Deputy who has had to stand a round of drinks after a branch meeting will know what I mean by that.  In other words, many people who are not in jobs anywhere near the top have expectations which rival the expectations of those, say, in the very top jobs.  This is a predictable and obvious human consequence of increased prosperity but it is worth pointing out.  The ceiling of expectations of ordinary people has risen very fast.</P>
    <P>Twenty-five years ago a dinner jacket was still the mark of a privileged minority.  This is no longer so.  It may be that the occasions for wearing <Col N="2210" /> dinner jackets has decreased because of the increasing informality in dress but if one were to expect in 1975 that he would be regarded as a toff because he wore a black tie and dinner jacket, he would be mistaken.  That form of elegance is a normal part of the ordinary person's expectations nowadays.</P>
    <P>The same goes for foreign holidays, even very distant ones such as those to which I referred earlier.  This is due to the cut-throat competition of airlines and travel agents.  This is very good and it is possible for people now who are only in a middling condition of life by reference to the importance of their jobs to travel to the Black Sea. Middleclass people in Ireland, 25 years ago, would be hard put to it to tell you where the Black Sea was.  The idea of going there on holidays would not have formed part of their wildest dreams. Perhaps the upper stratum of the middle class might go as far as France or Belgium on honeymoon, or, in the Holy Year, 1925, a few thousand people might have saved for months in order to go to Rome but the idea of an ordinary family with no social pretentions to be better than their neighbours flying to the Black Sea and enjoying glittering beaches for a fortnight would have been unheard of.  I am not condemning this activity today. It is marvellous that the privileges and the elegances of life would no longer be the preserve of a very small exclusive minority, but at the same time, it must be said that the expectations of which these are only symptoms are part of the reason for the economic difficulties of the whole western world.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that once one becomes used to a certain standard of living, it is difficult to cut back on it and for the man who has only recently pulled himself out of conditions of poverty it is difficult to listen to politicians or to employers say that some of this improvement must be foregone. At the same time, it behoves the leaders of society, whether in the strictly social or political sense, to show some kind of example&mdash;at any rate, not to refrain from showing example. Their style of life should be modest <Col N="2211" /> and reasonable and should not be such as to engender envy among others.</P>
    <P>Much of the trouble that is catching up with us now started in the high days of 1963, 1964 and 1965.  I am not saying that because Fianna Fáil were in office in those days.  The same could have happened had we been in government.  In those days with increasing prosperity there was increased ostentation and this had a lot of very disagreeable concomitants with which I shall not bore the House now.  This ostentation was represented on television and in the newspapers and, of course, it engendered envy, emulation and competitiveness on the part of people who did not yet have these advantages.  The in word became the &ldquo;executive.&rdquo;  This has now reached a stage where we have &ldquo;executive&rdquo; washbasins, &ldquo;executive&rdquo; towel sets and &ldquo;executive&rdquo; electric razors.  The word has become a symbol not only for a man in a white collar but a white collar that is changed twice a day.  It is totally inappropriate to the people of this country, all of whose grandparents, apart from a vanishing fraction, were poor people compared with the standards of Britain, France and Germany.</P>
    <P>While I am delighted that we should be poverty stricken no longer and while I do not think we should assume the béal bocht if we are not bocht any more ourselves, it would be decent for us and decent for those who lead our society to have some restraint in our own manner of life and not to engender among others the idea that in order to be with it, they must have this, that or the other.  Nobody will grudge anybody extra comfort for himself and his family but when this develops into a competition to have more and more it results in the situation in which we are now. It is easy for people like ourselves who, for the most part, are very comfortable compared with those who are poor yet, to talk in such a way as to be understood to have better expectations. I do not mean that, but, being only flesh and blood there may be a little of that in my conduct.  Nobody can be exempt from it but it <Col N="2212" /> would be good if the people who lead our country, politically, socially or economically, behaved with a restraint and reserve appropriate to the conditions of the difficulty we are now in, in a modern decent way, some progress could be made.</P>
    <P>There are only two more things I want to say.  Part of the package the Minister announced yesterday is the removal of VAT from certain commodities which have been particularly hard hit.  This is a sensible measure which I wholeheartedly and sincerely welcome.  About two years ago the present trend began to show itself throughout all the countries in the west.  This Government were being blamed by the Opposition at that time for having taken VAT off food in Deputy Ryan's first budget.  We were told it was insane, we were castigated for doing it.  What would the cost of living be today if VAT were still on food?  What would be the Minister's position yesterday if we had not taken VAT off food&mdash;where would we have found the money to do what the Minister did yesterday in relation to food prices?</P>
    <P>As long as I have been here I have listened to the Opposition criticising us for this, that and the other but I have never heard them say: &ldquo;If we change places with you we will undo this or that measure.&rdquo;  Not one of them, with the possible exception of Deputy Seán Flanagan, has said that if they were to change places they would repeal this or that measure taken by the Government.  We heard what they said when farmers were first brought into the income tax net. We heard every possible type of abuse from the Opposition.  They said we were a Dublin-based Government, among other things, but not one of them said they would repeal that tax if and when they got back to power.  It was all right for us to take the odium for having done that but if and when they get back to office they will have it there for them.</P>
    <P>The same goes for the packet of capital taxation legislation which at this moment is sweating its way through the House in this hot summer. I am still waiting for an Opposition <Col N="2213" /> spokesman to say it will come off again if they get back to power.  I am still waiting for them to say that if Fianna Fáil get back to power next year there will be no capital gains tax, no capital acquisitions tax and no wealth tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We still have the Offences Against the State Act which the Government when in Opposition said they would repeal at the first opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt, sooner or later they will get back to power&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Still, I must give them the honour of not making promises which they have no intention of keeping. We are now taking the revolutionary measure of introducing a new system of taxes in substitution for the death duties.  Are the Opposition saying that when they get back to office they will repeal these taxes and reimpose the inequitable death duty legislation?  When I get documents from the Save Ireland's Economy group and others, whose sincerity I do not doubt, I am inclined to say: &ldquo;Look here, go to the Opposition and extract from them the undertaking that as soon as they get back to power there will be no capital gains tax, no wealth tax and no capital acquisitions tax.  Go to them and extract from them an undertaking that farmers will be released from the income tax net.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the Save Ireland's Economy group and others like them should be doing if they are serious about politics and politicians.  It is the Opposition they should be lobbying. They should try to get the Opposition behind them and extract promises from them.  I honour the Opposition for not making any promises. They are delighted because we are giving them a modern fiscal structure which can be stood over, <Col N="2214" /> which can be understood and which they will have there when the people return them either as a coalition or as a single party Government.  They are delighted to see us doing all these hard things that were left undone for so long.  Sooner or later they will get the benefits of them.  It would be more honourable of them to pipe down and not keep on saying the things which Deputies like Joe Dowling and Seán Moore have been trotting out week after week and get along with trying to make the Dáil a more interesting place for its Members and for the public instead of this incessant and wearying bombardment, unbelieved cliches and unconvincing jargon which has not convinced them about the economy.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say, which is not politically meant at all, is in regard to the revolutionary in this country&mdash;although it is not in the world&mdash;employment subsidy.  There will now be a subsidy on work rather than on idleness.  I say that in no sense of anything but sympathy for those who have idleness enforced on them by redundancy, not because of unwillingness to work but because of the hard conditions of the industry in which they find themselves.  I meet cases of that every week in my little clinic and very often they are heart-breaking cases.  I hope those people will be the ones this subsidy will now help.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has done it in so many words but I would like to lend my voice to appeal to employers who are not in a situation of desperate difficulty to come to the aid of the community, not just of the Government, by employing people whereever they can.  I do not expect this to be done by companies who have serious problems about their cash flow, who find it hard to meet existing wage arrangements apart from the prospect of further ones, who find competition increasingly difficult and whose raw material bill is going up because of the sinking value of the pound.  I am not saying this to them but to the employers who are still in a strong position. I ask them to look around and see if there is any way they can ease the lot of the community by employing men, many of whom are emotionally <Col N="2215" /> broken or are on the way to it, who are for the first time in their lives idle, who are ashamed of being idle and dependent on the State or some member of their families to support them.</P>
    <P>I say to those employers who are still in a fortunate position, no doubt in most cases due to their own thrift and good management, let them be Fianna Fáil employers or others, to do their best for the community in a situation of difficulty and indirectly also for themselves.  As Deputy Lalor's late leader, Seán Lemass, used to say: &ldquo;A rising tide lifts all boats&rdquo;.  I appeal to those, even small employers, to cast their eyes around and see if they could not take even one person off the live register, see if the Government subsidy will make it easier for them to do so and try to restore self-respect to that man and his family.  They could thus ease the burden which unemployment creates for the individual and for society generally.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say.  I hope my opening remarks about the empty benches will not be misunderstood.  I hope those people present who are not Members of the Dáil whether in the Press Gallery or in the Public Gallery, who are depressed at the sight of these empty benches in the middle of a very important economic debate, will take to heart what I said about the public service those Deputies are rendering, if they explore the reason for the benches being empty.  I can assure them it is not because of lethargy or anything else on the part of Deputies. They work away outside of the House. Many of them work harder than men should work and harder than is good for their health or their families.  They have been driven out of the Dáil by the repetitious, boring, predictable nature of so much of the debate here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just listened for three-quarters of an hour to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I have to say, either listening to him or from what I have learned about the man over the past two years, he is an extremely sincere man.  He has got across to me in the House and outside it that he believes what he says.  I accept that fully but he always <Col N="2216" /> annoys men in the Chamber when he decides he wants to lecture the House. Deputy Kelly is a professor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>When he looked into his heart he knew what he was talking about.  I will not go into the question of Deputies being in the House.  A lot of good work was done for 16 years without the necessity of having Deputies here on a Friday.  We are being brought in on a Friday now in order to try to pick up the pieces and to do the covering up job, which the Parliamentary Secretary has been trying to do for the last three-quarters of an hour.  This is done in the full knowledge that we have not to vote here today.</P>
      <P>I accept a lot of what the Parliamentary Secretary said but the situation is that he orders business for a Friday.  It is business which cannot culminate in a vote so that his Deputies can go down the country. There is a tradition in the House that the Government are responsible for maintaining a House and I intend to help the Parliamentary Secretary maintain that tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came into the House to try to deal with the dreadful position we are in after two-and-a-half years of Coalition Government.  I want to deal with a number of matters to which the Minister for Finance referred yesterday. The Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2217" /> gave a number of quotations and made a number of attacks on the Opposition which I feel cannot be let go without some comment from me on them.  It appears he has the very same way of dealing with his constituents as he deals with us in the House.  He mentioned his constituents &mdash;the out of job people who are rushing into his clinics on Saturdays in ever increasing numbers, not because of his popularity but because of the growing number of people who are losing their jobs and the thousands of circulars he is sending out to them. Those people are being told to go and see what the Opposition will do for them whenever they get back into power.  This is what the people who go to complain about the capital gains tax or the wealth tax are told.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what the Government have been doing during the past two and a half years and arising from what they are proposing to do if they are successful, we will have the situation where somebody will have to pick up the pieces after the overspending of £240 million this year.  How could any Opposition spokesman or leader make any promise in that situation?</P>
      <P>I expect that after we recess this summer this Dáil will never reassemble. During the course of the summer we will have a General election, an election which Deputy Colley asked the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to declare yesterday.  He asked the Taoiseach to throw in the sponge and hand over the Government to the people who can handle it, much maligned though we are.  Even the Parliamentary Secretary accepted that we were much maligned by the media prior to the last General election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary accepted that the members of the Government never described themselves as the &ldquo;Government of all the talents&rdquo;. This was a description given to the Government by friendly scribes, something which I accept.  Over the past two years it was possible to cover for <Col N="2218" /> the failures of the Government but the end of the line has been reached and despite the brilliance of those friendly scribes they are not able to cover up for the failures of the Government of all these imaginary talents. The performance of the Minister for Labour was despicable this morning. The only answer he had to the complaints, the problems and the enormous taxation the Government are imposing was to have a chat with the Opposition to see if they would promise to do away with certain Bills if they are put back into office.  We told the Government where they were going wrong during the course of the daily economic debates we have had here but the Ministers got so bored they left the Government benches.  I was guilty of having the quorum bells rung fairly often to bring the Government back-benchers, and the Ministers, to hear the facts from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Had the Ministers come in to listen to these economic debates in the last two years we would not have had the embarrassing situation of our spokesman on Finance saying to the Government &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; He was able to quote from speeches he had made during the past two years where he had told the Minister for Finance, and the Government, where they were going wrong but, unfortunately, they found it very boring.  The Minister for Labour asked how could a man who had made a show of himself, had lost the last general election for Fianna Fáil, had been such an abject failure before the brilliant Minister for Foreign Affairs, criticise the Government. The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that the present Minister for Finance was overworked and this is something I accept but every Minister if he does his job properly will be hard worked.  The fact that the present Minister for Finance is making a mess of the economy is something I do not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to have said. Deputy Colley while doing his job as Minister for Finance efficiently also directed Fianna Fáil's last election campaign.  His opposite number on that occasion, the present Minister <Col N="2219" /> for Foreign Affairs, spent years serving his time on the media being projected as a Member of this House and as an expert university man.  We had a confrontation between Deputy Colley and the present Minister for Foreign Affairs on television during that campaign.</P>
    <P>I accept, on behalf of Deputy Colley, that the then Deputy FitzGerald, Coalition spokesman and financial wizard, won the battle on television and succeeded in fooling the people and creating the impression that there were 15 talented men&mdash;God help us&mdash;who could bring us out of the morass into which Deputy Jack Lynch and Deputy Colley had plunged this country.  He suceeded in fooling the people that the National Coalition would bring the country out of the mess and on to the top of the heap in Europe.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must listen to the facts and I am not lecturing him.  I am endeavouring to show the change that has taken place in the last two years due to the incompetence of a group of individuals who impressed the people in television appearances.  The people were impressed by the forerunner of the computer.  I concede that the present Minister for Foreign Affairs who, if he was not described as a walking computer, could be described as such.</P>

      <P>I have heard people remark that the Minister for Labour is not as hard working as other members of the Cabinet but he puts on the appearance and the polish.  That Minister told us that one good thing in the set of proposals put forward by the Minister for Finance was the provision whereby industrialists would be given a grant to employ additional people. That is a good idea and I join in complimenting the Minister on that.  However, the Minister for Labour did not elaborate on the proposal although we were told he would.  He told us of the extra money that was being spent on training but we all know that the extra money being spent by AnCO is coming from Europe.  Many small industrialists are interested in this offer made by the Minister for Finance but the Minister for Labour did not give us any details.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary complained that we had too many economic debates in this House but that not enough people were interested in them.  These debates arose from the budget and the additional taxation measures imposed during the last 12 months.  The remedies suggested by our spokesman on Finance were never listened to by the Government although the Minister for Finance yesterday accepted that Deputy Colley had been endeavouring to tell him in the past two years that the situation was serious.  What we had yesterday was only the glosssy paper.</P>
