      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the agreement establishing an international energy programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This agreement is the outcome of intensive international consultations which were initiated following the oil crisis of late 1973 and early 1974.  The events of that time, starting with the serious supply crisis and followed later <Col N="1920" /> by the fourfold increase in crude oil prices, exposed the vulnerability of many countries whose economies had become over-dependent on a single primary energy source.  The effect on Ireland was and continues to be particularly severe.  The economic progress which we have achieved in recent years involved a rapid increase in oil consumption and, in the absence of large-scale alternative sources, we became highly dependent on imported oil to meet our energy needs.</P>
    <P>There was clearly a need for international co-operation to deal with the consequences of the 1973 crisis and to prepare the way for a more equitable and stable international energy relationship. It was in this context that the Washington Energy Conference took place in February, 1974.  This conference, which was convened by the United States and attended by nine member states of the EEC, Canada, Japan and Norway, analysed the international energy situation and its implications.  The conference recognised that the solution to the world's energy problems should be sought in consultation with producer countries and other consumers and agreed on specific steps to provide for continuing international co-operation on energy matters.</P>
    <P>The principal decisions of the Conference were to agree on a comprehensive action programme for international co-operation on energy and to establish an Energy Co-ordinating Group headed by senior governmental officials to direct and co-ordinate action in this sphere.  Negotiations within the group led to the successful conclusion of an agreement on an international energy programme, copies of which were placed in the Dáil Library for the convenience of Deputies on 13th November, 1974.</P>
    <P>This agreement involves a charge upon public funds and consequently Dáil approval of its terms is necessary in accordance with Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution before it may become definitively binding on the State.  This country's contribution for 1975 to the budget of the agency will be of the order of 0.3 per cent of the total, or £7,000 approximately, to be <Col N="1921" /> borne on the Vote of the Department of Foreign Affairs on International Co-operation.</P>
    <P>The agreement was signed in Paris on behalf of the Government on 18th November, 1974, subject to Dáil Éireann approving its terms.  Other Governments which signed the agreement provisionally were the other members of the European Community with the exception of France as well as Austria, Canada, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States.  New Zealand subsequently acceded to the agreement on a similar basis and, in addition, Norway has become an associate member.  Thus 18 of the 24 member countries of the OECD are now participating in the work of the International Energy Agency.</P>
    <P>The Agreement provides for a governing board, a management committee and various standing groups charged with the examination of particular problems.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and my Department, together with the Departments of Finance and Industry and Commerce as appropriate, are responsible for servicing these organs of the Agency. A special feature of an agreement of this type is that the voting system was devised so that certain decisions within the agency may be taken by unanimity or by majority.  The voting weights assigned to each country for the purpose of those decisions which the agreement specifies are to be taken by majority are designed to ensure an overall balance between the interests of the various groups of member countries.</P>
    <P>18th November, 1974, is the date from which the agreement applies provisionally to the participating countries to the extent that it is not inconsistent with their domestic legislation. Signatory states are required to notify their consent to be bound fully by the agreement by 1st May, 1975.  Upon such notification of consent the agreement will enter definitively into force for that state.  The duration of the agreement will be for ten years and a general review is to take place after five years.  There is <Col N="1922" /> provision for any participating country to cease to be a party to the agreement by giving 12 months' notice after it has been in operation for three years.</P>
    <P>The agreement establishes a programme whose main features include co-ordinated efforts to develop emergency supply reserves, a scheme for restraining energy demand and sharing oil in a supply crisis, arrangement for gathering information on the international oil market, long-term co-operation aimed at conserving energy and developing alternative energy supplies and the promotion of a co-operative dialogue between oil-producing and oil-consuming countries, including those of the developing world.</P>
    <P>The immediate benefit of the programme is the establishment of a scheme for oil sharing in times of crisis.  Under the scheme the allocation of oil in a crisis is linked to certain commitments by participants to have emergency plans ready to reduce energy demand by means of restraint measures, and to maintain a certain minimum level of emergency oil reserves.  The scheme will be activated whenever the participating countries as a whole or an individual participating country experiences interruptions in its oil supply to the extent of 7 per cent or more.  In such event, the country or countries affected must first reduce their own consumption by a specified proportion, as provided for in the agreement, and the other member countries will make up the balance of requirement on the basis of a predetermined formula based on each country's permissible level of consumption and other relevant factors.</P>
    <P>It is a pre-condition of the oil-sharing scheme that each participating country must maintain emergency reserves of oil supplies sufficient to sustain consumption for 60 days with no net oil imports.  This requirement will be increased in due course to 90 days and the governing board of the IEA will decide in the next few months on the date from which the higher requirement will apply.  Apart from the maintenance of reserve <Col N="1923" /> stocks, the necessary self-sufficiency in oil can be met by alternative means such as fuel switching capacity and stand-by oil production capacity. The agency is developing a refined method for the determination of such alternatives.  There are already requirements on member states of the EEC to maintain minimum oil reserves and I am pursuing with the various interests concerned the arrangements by which these requirements can best be met.</P>
    <P>While the emergency oil sharing scheme is the most valuable short term benefit of IEA membership, the agency's programme also provides for various other activities which in the long term will be of great value to participating countries.  These include co-operative efforts on conservation of energy, accelerated development of alternative sources of energy, research and development and uranium enrichment. On energy conservation, the agency has adopted a short term objective of reducing oil imports by 2 million barrels a day by the end of 1975.  This is a target for the group as a whole and there are at this stage no individual targets for the participating countries.  Each country will, however, be expected to make its due contribution to the achievement of the group target, taking account of its own circumstances and possibilities. The measures taken by each country will be subject to review by its fellow members of the agency.  As the House is already aware, a conservation programme has been in operation here for some time, involving a publicity programme addressed to the community as a whole and the domestic sector in particular, as well as technical assistance and financial assistance towards the adoption of energy conservation measures in industry. While the current IEA conservation target relates to 1975 only, the agency proposes to adopt further targets for 1976 and future years.  In addition, there will be a programme of research and exchange of information on means of conserving energy.</P>
    <P>I mentioned also the question of development of alternative sources of <Col N="1924" /> energy.  It is recognised that in furtherance of the objective of reducing imports of oil, a policy should be developed to promote the accelerated development of alternative sources to oil.  The higher oil prices now obtaining have provided an incentive for investment in new energy supplies but there is recognition of the possibility that market forces may not provide an adequate or enduring incentive to ensure sufficient reduction in the dependence on oil.  While there may be no immediate signs of a substantial fall in oil prices, one cannot exclude altogether the possibility of such a development in the future.  A significant reduction in oil prices might seem <i>prima facie</i> to be a welcome development, in view of the crippling economic effect of the increases that have taken place, but it must be borne in mind that such a reduction could endanger investment in alternative sources and thus frustrate efforts to reduce dependence on imported oil.</P>
    <P>The governing board of the IEA has therefore agreed in principle on a policy concept designed to encourage and safeguard investment in alternative sources of energy.  Subject to further studies, it is contemplated that this would include the establishment of a common minimum price level below which they would not allow imported oil to be sold within their economies.  The level of such a price would be worked out through further analysis of the cost of developing energy sources other than oil.  It is envisaged that the level of any such price would probably be significantly lower than existing prices but higher than prices obtaining before October, 1973.  The agreement in principle that has been adopted on this question represents a broad policy commitment; the means by which each country would proceed would be left largely to the discretion of the administration concerned.</P>
    <P>Parallel with these arrangements, it is proposed to establish a framework for financial and technological co-operation between countries interested in joint projects for the development of higher cost energy forms.  Similar <Col N="1925" /> arrangements are being developed for co-operation in energy research and development.</P>
    <P>The successful implementation of the various elements of the International Energy Programme requires close co-operation with the oil industry.  For this purpose the IEA is developing a comprehensive international information system and a permanent framework for consultation with the oil companies. This will be designed to ensure greater transparency of the oil market and of the activities of the oil companies.  It proposes the establishment of a data system on the activities of oil companies both international and national and will gather information relating to corporate structures, financial structures, production rates, costs and other associated matters.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words now about the role of the European Community within the agency.  The Government have been particularly anxious to promote Community solidarity on international energy policy.  Deputies will be aware that France did not participate in the work of the Energy Co-ordinating Group and has not indicated a willingness to become a party to the agreement nor to join the agency at this stage.  The agreement explicitly provides that it shall be open for accession by the European Communities and that it shall not in any way impede the further implementation of the treaties establishing the European Communities.  The Commission, which since December participates in all meetings of the agency, has stated that provided Community member states when implementing the programme take account of the Community's rules on the free movement of goods and the common commercial policy the accession by member states to the agreement would assist the development of Community energy policy.  And at its meeting on 20th January, 1975, the Council agreed that Community member states would seek a common position on the important problems under discussion within the agency.  I am glad to be able to state that this procedure has operated satisfactorily during the period of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>During the negotiations which led to the agreement the participating <Col N="1926" /> countries agreed that international co-operation to deal effectively with world energy problems requires the promotion of a co-operative dialogue between oil producing countries and oil consuming countries, including those of the developing world.  In this regard, the agreement is not envisaged as a device or an attempt to co-ordinate an economic strategy directed against the legitimate interests of others; on the contrary, we see the work being carried out by the agency as a first step towards wider co-operation between the participating countries and the oil producers having regard also to the interests of those developing countries whose economies have been profoundly and particularly affected by the energy problem.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, discussions were held during the past fortnight between producers, consumers and developing countries to prepare an agenda and procedures for a producer/ consumer conference on substantive issues to be convened at an appropriate time in the future.  At these discussions, which were held in Paris on the invitation of the French President, the interests of consumer countries were represented by the European Community, Japan and the US.  There were four oil producing countries&mdash;Algeria, Iran, Saudia Arabia and Venezuela&mdash; and three developing countries&mdash;Brazil, India and Zaire.  The UN, OECD and IEA were represented in an observer capacity.  The Community has been represented at the preparatory meeting by a delegation consisting of the member states and the Commission. The Community delegation was headed by a representative of the Irish Presidency and a representative of the Commission who together expressed the Community view point throughout. This first round of talks has, unfortunately, failed to produce full agreement on all aspects of the agenda but I have no doubt that there will be continuing efforts to establish a basis for the resumption of a constructive dialogue between producer, consumer and developing countries.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to give the House a general review of the main objectives and activities of the International <Col N="1927" /> Energy Agency since the signing of the agreement on an international energy programme last November.  In fact, significant progress has been made in a relatively short space of time on such matters as the emergency oil-sharing scheme, the general policy for long-term co-operation and the framework for consultation and co-operation with the oil companies.  As a country which is greatly dependent on imported sources of energy, Ireland, by being party to the agreement, can reduce very substantially the risk of damage to its rate of economic growth and social progress through future restrictions of oil supplies or other crises in the energy sphere.</P>
    <P>The oil-consuming industrial nations who are parties to the agreement have undertaken to develop long-term energy policies and, above all, to promote co-operative relations with oil-producing countries and other consuming countries.  This offers hope that the reality of economic interdependence will be recognised by all countries and that concrete steps may be taken to reach an equitable solution to one of the world's major economic problems at the present time.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the oil crisis in October, 1973, it was only right that every effort should have been made at national and international level to solve this problem so vital to the economic life of oil-importing countries.  We have had a number of debates on this problem in an effort to find some solution.  The first step to deal with this on-going crisis should be taken at home.  On examining how effective our efforts have been in dealing with this problem it is regrettable to find that little effective action was taken.  At the time of the crisis it was admitted by the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that we were completely in the hands of the multi-national oil companies. This is the situation in which we still find ourselves, and it is not a very <Col N="1928" /> pleasant one.  Our economy is virtually controlled by these multi-nationals who are pretty ruthless.  We should take steps to get from under the umbrella of these multi-national concerns.  There is no evidence of effective action having been taken in this regard and we are as subject to the whims of the boards of these companies as we were in October, 1973.  It is unfortunate that we are now hit by an oil crisis due to a strike. We hope it will be of short duration.</P>
      <P>The multi-national concerns still control our oil supplies with the exception of the ESB who have an agreement with Russia for their supply.  I cannot see anything in this agreement which will release us from this control by these oil companies. We should recognise that oil supplies are not scarce; what affects us is the control of the supplies and their cost. We should have been attacking these two sectors in the last 18 months.  At the time of the 1973 oil crisis we were only refining 50 per cent of our total oil requirements, which left us completely dependent on the oil companies for the other 50 per cent of products we required.  We are still in the same position.  One way in which we could have some control over our oil supplies would be by being self-sufficient in refining capacity.</P>
      <P>It takes approximately three years from the time work commences on an oil refinery until it becomes operational. We have lost 18 months and we are still no nearer to being self-sufficient in refining capacity than we were in October, 1973.  This is an undeniable fact.  There were at least three proposals then for the construction of oil refineries but they have not progressed further.  If we had an oil refinery, and assuming the position will not improve we could buy our own crude oil at less than we have been paying the multi-national companies.  It is possible to do this.  We pointed out on a previous occasion in this House that this was the way to go about reducing the £200 million oil bill.  Even if we were to start construction of an oil refinery immediately we are still three years behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1929" /> Our refining capacity will be of great importance if, as we hope, oil is found in large quantities off our south coast.  Without our own refining facilities we will have to export our oil to have it refined and then have it reimported.  This is a ludicrous situation.  Even if we did not find any oil off our coast, by having our full oil refining capacity we could buy our crude oil and have it refined.  This would get over the distribution problem. There are refineries on the Continent not working to full capacity and it would be possible to initiate this action without having our own refinery in an effort to reduce our oil bills.  I believe it would be possible, and I would be prepared to produce figures to prove the point, to cut 20 per cent off the £200 million oil bill.  First, if we bought it at market value and not at what the multi-nationals say it costs them.  The tankers, a vital consideration to oil supplies, are plentiful and can be chartered at a reasonable figure.  One company got into serious difficulties because of over-investment in tankers.  There is no problem about chartering tankers at good rates. There is no reason why we should not make the necessary arrangements to refine oil on the continent and distribute here.  I am not thinking merely of petrol which is only a percentage of our total oil needs.  I am thinking of fuel oil and all the other oils so necessary to industry for generating power and so on.  We could reduce such bills by up to 20 per cent if we adapted a business-like approach to the whole matter.  In the meantime, we should have our own refining capacity under construction.  If we were lucky enough to find sufficient quantities we would find ourselves in a fairly healthy position with complete control of our energy.</P>
    <P>With regard to this agreement, it was only to be expected that the oil-consuming nations could come together and try and hammer out some form of agreement or action that would help alleviate the problems affecting them. Naturally, we would expect that EEC countries would be united on this.  With regard to the participating countries, <Col N="1930" /> the first thing we ask ourselves is: why France is not involved.  They are showing no interest in it.  Obviously, they cannot see any future for them in participation in an agreement like this. Norway, being an associate member, is not a full member of this agency. Neither do they see any future in involving themselves fully in such an agreement.  Countries which are taking part&mdash;apart from the other EEC countries&mdash;are all totally dependent on imported oil with the exception of Britain, whose position will be improving because of the North Sea, and the USA. The USA imports 20 per cent of its oil needs and produces 80 per cent.  In an emergency, it is well known that the USA could produce 100 per cent of its requirements.  I suppose it is good business to be saving your own and using up Arab or somebody else's oil.  Of course we know who controls the oil industry in America.  By any stretch of the imagination it is not the Government. It is the multi-national oil companies and they also exercise complete power over it.  We have this country which will be the major influence in this agreement among nations totally dependent on imports of oil, like ourselves and Japan and the other nations involved.  According to our reading of this agreement, they are going to be completely influenced by the multi-national oil companies that manipulated the oil crisis&mdash;as we have said often over the past 18 months&mdash;for their own gain and did so quite blatantly and were allowed to get away with it by our Government, in matters such as stock profits to the extent of millions of pounds which should never have been permitted.  They always did and are still getting away with it.</P>
    <P>They are included in this agency. They will continue to influence the whole oil business as far as we and other nations are concerned under this international agreement.  In our opinion, participation in this group will achieve nothing in ensuring that our power supplies will be available at an acceptable or any kind of reasonable cost.  This agreement will place too many burdens on present consumers who will remain, if you like, hostages under its structure.  If we could see <Col N="1931" /> clearly the real implications arising from participation in this agreement, we believe the Government would not have given a moment's thought to participation.  Even at this late hour we suggest that the closest further examination should be given to the consequences of associating ourselves with the undertakings involved in this agreement.</P>
    <P>During the past 18 months we have become fully aware of the importance of energy for our economy.  We have had different Government Ministers admitting themselves to be powerless with regard to supply and in so far as the control of price was concerned. Then we found ourselves linked with the outer UK zone since 12th December, 1973.  We all know what this has meant for us.  It has meant that, at seven days' notice, these multi-national oil companies were able to impose any price increases they wished which they did not even have to justify, leaving the consumer public powerless.  Multi-nationals go on publishing and bragging about their huge profits.  One company brags about 175 million stock profits in the past year. We form part of these stock profits and we permit that to happen.  Attaching ourselves to the outer UK zone has been a disaster since December, 1973, and it seems as if it will continue.</P>
    <P>The outrageous price increases which have been permitted under this outer UK zone and the profits of the multi-nationals, published profits, are proof of this.  We are still in the same position.  We are still 50 per cent behind being self-sufficient in refining capacity or in any immediate plans to ensure that we become self-sufficient. But we are still tied to the outer UK zone and the whims of the multi-national oil companies, being subject to any price increases they feel like imposing, at seven days' notice, as has obtained since last year's oil crisis.</P>
    <P>We should examine the cost, in detail, of each part of a refined barrel of crude oil.  We should tackle the problem at its very root, when we would see that our overall oil-product prices could possibly be reduced by 20 per cent but which is not happening. In our opinion the proposal before <Col N="1932" /> us today&mdash;instead of making us part of the outer UK zone will make us part of the outer zone USA, substitute USA for UK.  As a result of this agreement that is the way we will be situated.  We all know that would not be very acceptable and should not be accepted by us.</P>
    <P>Some of the technicalities of this agreement should be examined.  The technicalities of the voting strengths, in the agreement, constitute a very serious matter and are something about which the Government must have been unaware when they agreed to this last September, November or whenever it occurred.  Under the voting arrangements in the agreement. Under this voting arrangement, under the agreement, it is possible for the United States, Canada and we will say Holland to control the whole policy and majority decisions of this international agency.  They have sufficient votes in excess of 40 per cent to exercise complete control of the agency and what happens within this agency.  There is no need for me to give any reasons as to why they should not be in that position. Canada whose economy and geography are closely connected with the USA, will be allied in outlook. They are both involved in the oil business.  I mention Holland, the Netherlands, as a third one because that is the base, of course, of the multi-national Dutch Shell.  These are the three countries where the multi-national outlets are based and controlled.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves under the voting arrangements of this agreement completely at the mercy of these three countries.  So what is the use in setting up a voting arrangement that only puts us further and further into the grip of the multi-national oil companies through their respective countries of origin and the head offices from which they are controlled?  This is exactly what the voting arrangements under this agreement will do.  In our opinion we have nothing to gain of any consequence.</P>
    <P>There are a few things we would praise and which are praiseworthy, which my colleague, Deputy <Col N="1933" /> O'Kennedy, will be dealing with.  The overall picture is that we have nothing to gain but we have a lot to lose.</P>
    <P>The cost of entry is another thing. The Minister mentioned something like £7,000.  It would appear that that is the cost of entry.  That is not the cost of entry, of course, if you look at the agreement.  We have to build up our storage facilities to 60 days and, in due course, they will have to be built up to 90 days.  We had questions and debates about this matter before and it was agreed by Government Ministers at one time that, if we were to build up our storage to the 60 days required under the Ministerial order it would cost us £35 million between the cost of the storage tanks, which as far as I remember was £12 million, and the wherewithal to fill the storage tanks which was to be £23 million.</P>
    <P>There is no sign of these tanks appearing anywhere, and no definite financial arrangements with regard to the cost.  As far as I know, the companies were not prepared to bear this cost.  They had the audacity to expect the consumers to be saddled with this cost.  That is a bill of £35 million to start with to bring us to the 60 days, and it is possible, if we were to build ourselves up to the 90 days, that it would be nearer £100 million to furnish the cost of this storage clause and to fulfil it.  It would be wrong to assume that £7,000 would be our total contribution. It would not.  It would be far in excess of that if we were to comply with the Articles of this agreement with regard to the storage which these countries should have.  If we are to do this I do not know how the consumers can be extra careful with regard to paying for these storage facilities.  We are just putting ourselves further into the grip of these major oil companies.</P>
    <P>Another factor under this agreement is that over 60 per cent of our requirements come as refined products from Russia and from the refineries in the United Kingdom.  There seem to be no details within this agreement to cover our reserves.  There is no mention of our having any storage capacity in those countries from which we get our oil.  The priorities of the United States of America, at whose initiative this <Col N="1934" /> committee came into being, are totally different from our needs, as we well know.  Our Government have already, in the past 12 months or six months, established new links in some parts of the Arab world through accredited ambassadors.  What are really needed are agreements between the consumer countries and the producing countries but not, we suggest, by establishing a big buying bloc such as this which will be dominated by the United States who could be self-sufficient from the point of view of energy, if they so desired.  Norway and France have seen the implications involved and are not participating as we are.  France is not interested in participation at all.</P>
    <P>We look forward to the day when we will be producers of oil.  We hope that is not in the too far distant future.  Then we should follow the example of Norway and France in not participating or in getting out of this agreement.  We could examine the case again under the OECD if the occasion required it.  Association with this group where the predominant view is likely to be dictated by USA thinking on these matters which, in connection with energy, has shown itself to be contradictory in the past is not in our strategic or economic interest.</P>
    <P>How can the Government seriously expect to support a policy which provides for keeping the price of crude oil at a particular level?  This agreement was not very long in being when the Americans started the next exercise to put a floor price under crude oil.  We were all crying about the cost of crude oil, and this was the next thing attempted by the Americans.  Surely it could not be in our interests in the short-term or the long-term to ensure a definite minimum floor price for crude oil just because the USA felt like it in order to guarantee the further profits and the future profits of these multi-national oil companies which we know are such highly profitable concerns.  Like other countries we were screaming for lower prices for the past year and a half. This action about floor prices means that we are being asked by the USA and the countries involved in this <Col N="1935" /> agreement to plead for lower prices, but not too low&mdash;there has to be a certain minimum.</P>
    <P>I remember the Minister for Industry and Commerce in December, 1973, telling the House that every element in our day-to-day living was affected by the cost of oil.  Every sector of our economy had some element of energy input and we were reminded of this and we know it to be true. The collapse of the recent Assembly in Paris is a definite indication of how fraught with danger the concept of groupings can be.  They did not get very far.  They could not even agree on an agenda and, instead of wasting time on this kind of carry on we should be out doing our own thing, trying to get to the base of the problem by reducing this £200 million which our economy can ill afford to bear now or in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no case, in our opinion, for belonging to a group which seeks to preserve this floor price.  It is not in our interest, and we fail to see how it could be in our interest. If we should be fortunate enough to become self-sufficient through our own discoveries off our south coast then the quickest and greatest overall benefits can accrue to our economy by utilising the oil for our own energy purposes to meet our industrial and agricultural requirements.  If we in the future can use this advantage then we can see no limit to the economic development of our country and our economy with all the resulting benefits to every man, woman and child.  We look forward to this but we see no future for our country or our economy in being involved in this agreement.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this agreement is putting us further into the grip of these multi-national oil companies.  What they have been doing in the past year-and-a-half should have been ample proof that they were not people with whom we should allow ourselves to be involved and influenced by and this is all this agreement will do.  The voting arrangements are all wrong.  They are completely in their favour.  The consultation <Col N="1936" /> arrangements seem to be wrong.  Whom do they consult with? The multi-national oil companies? Who have we been consulting over the last year-and-a-half at the very height of the crisis?  The multi-national oil companies?  These are the people we have been consulting and these are the people who will be offering advice to this agency.  What good has their advice been to us? They are not the people from whom to get advice.  We should not tie ourselves up in an international situation where not alone will they be in control of the agency but they will go on being the only people offering advice.</P>
    <P>There is one striking aspect to this agreement; there is no way in which one can extract the real profits of the multi-national oil companies.  There is no way by which our Exchequer can get any further taxation than we have been getting, which has been negligible down through the years. There is no way of getting at them in this respect.  They are still completely covered to go on manipulating the world oil situation for their own devastating profit, as they have been doing down through the years.  They will go on causing further price increases under the seven-day notice system, as they have been doing here to our consumers, and they will now be supported by this international sharing agreement in doing that.  If anything, they will be in a more influential position than they were in a year-and-a-half ago as a result of this agreement.</P>
    <P>We should be making arrangements and agreement with the oil-producing countries in the Gulf.  We have set up new embassies or established diplomatic arrangements with countries in that part of the world.  Two of the countries with which we have done this are Israel and Egypt.  Those two countries have no oil to offer us.  We should be down in the Gulf establishing a proper business relationship with the people who have the oil in large quantity and we should be doing a deal there instead of setting up an international sharing arrangement with countries like Japan which has nothing to share.  Like ourselves they <Col N="1937" /> are over 90 per cent dependent on oil. We are going to share oil supplies with a country that has no oil.  That is only one of the countries with no oil involved in this agreement.  My colleagues will have something further to say about these diplomatic arrangements. We should have started these in the oil-producing countries where we could consolidate our position with regard to supplies until such time as we might be able to come up with our own supplies.</P>
    <P>If the Government insist on this proposal we want to put it on the record of this House that Fianna Fáil, given the opportunity, will resign from the grouping in its present form, with its stated objectives and under its present domination by the multi-nationals. As we can see from the agreement, this will mean a year's notice.  We want to go on record now as having expressed that approach.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the leading speaker for Fianna Fáil and I was interested to note that the Fianna Fáil Party will resign from the agreement.  I was also interested to note Deputy Barrett's interest in the multi-nationals.  I gathered from his speech&mdash;I do not know whether I am right or wrong&mdash; that he would either (a) nationalise the present oil companies operating in the country or (b) set up a State organisation whose policy would be to undercut the existing oil distributing companies in Ireland.  Either approach is very interesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the existence of multi-nationals.  I have read Anthony Sampson's book, <i>The Secret History of ITT</i> and I certainly believe our Government should be very watchful in regard to the prices we have to pay for crude and also the prices at which these crudes are distributed. The question arises as to how best we can get this information as to the price the companies are charging and the profits distributors are getting. The only way we can get this is by being a party to international agreements and by having our Government participating in conferences and discussions. The arrangements under the present agreement seem very flexible as far as the institutionalisation of the agreement is concerned.  I would like to point out that under article 49 we have a number of organs, a governing board, a management committee and various standing committees on the emergency question, the oil market, long term co-operation and a group on relations with producer and other consumer countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is, and we may as well face it, that in this small country of ours the only way we can find out this information is by benefiting from the experience of others. The only way we can benefit from the experience of others is by going to international meetings of the sort envisaged in this agreement and coming <Col N="1939" /> back with as much information as we can possibly gather.</P>
    <P>The isolationist policy, as suggested by Fianna Fáil, is an absolutely negative one, I do not care what anyone on the far side says, it has overtones of &ldquo;let us nationalise the whole lot of them.&rdquo;  I reject an isolationist approach to the problem and I am definitely in favour of the international approach.</P>
    <P>I know we are very active in our participation within the EEC on a joint policy, an EEC group policy, in relation to the energy crisis and future energy needs.  Indeed I read with great interest the Bulletin of the European Communities, Supplement 4/74 entitled &ldquo;Toward a New Energy Policy&rdquo; strategy for the European Community, introduced by the Commission of the European Communities. That was a very enlightening document, very easy to read, and dealt with a problem which we all admit in this House did not have very much national importance for this country up to the Autumn of 1973. The Suez War crisis, was very short term and this crisis is medium term. I will not say it has long-term implications for this country but it certainly has medium term implications. It is only by participating in the international forum that we can see what is going on, we can see our way forward better and we can best use the information that is available.</P>
    <P>The energy crisis has been and will be for some time to come a very interesting test for the European Economic Community.  It will be a test on its will and on its wishes to be a strong, virile forward looking group of countries knit together by common problems.  I was disappointed to note that the French Government decided not to participate in this.  I believe, from what I heard speaking to other people on the Continent, that the French were wrong and that the common approach which is being adopted by the EEC, is more beneficial to the European countries as a bloc.  The bilateral agreement entered into by France was something that we should note because the French Government, as far as I am concerned, are <Col N="1940" /> to be condemned in so far as part of the bilateral agreement entered into for the supply of oil was the supply by France of armaments.  That is an unfortunate approach to the subject.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the supply of arms to Middle East countries is to be welcomed, especially in view of the Middle East conflict which is of an on-going nature.  England also has some type of bilateral agreement which involves the supply of arms to the Middle East countries.  I am against any such bilateral agreements. The significance of what I am saying is that if we or any country entered into a bilateral agreement with Arab nations it would obviously, by and large, involve the supply of arms from the European countries to the Arab nations.  This is a policy which I am against and indeed I am sure it is a policy which the whole House is against.</P>
    <P>The question of the Middle East is not directly related to what I am speaking about, but the House should note that bilateral agreements will inevitably be weaker than agreements concluded by such a large monopoly as the European Economic Community if and when they can come to a common approach on the policy. Certainly by being a member of this programme we will be more powerful than if we were on our own.  I reject the isolationist approach to the problem as suggested by the Fianna Fáil spokesmen.</P>
    <P>I note in the Minister's speech that this is a ten-year agreement.  The question arises as to how long term is the oil crisis.  There are two developments which indicate to me that the question of ten years is a faint indication of the length of time this crisis will really affect us.  The development of alternative sources of energy is now, because of the high price of oil, to the fore in nearly all countries. The document which I referred to, &ldquo;Toward a New Energy Policy&rdquo;, gives great strength to the development of nuclear facilities in Europe.  This is now more viable because of the cost of oil.</P>
    <P>The development of the use of solid fuel must give an increased lease of life to the coalmines in England and <Col N="1941" /> in Germany.  The development of natural gas is now of great interest to us.  The great finds of oil and gas in the North Sea and indeed off our coast are something which should be noted and something to which we should allocate money ensuring that these oil and gas finds are developed as soon as possible, that the finds are harnessed and that the supply of oil and gas comes into our country as soon as possible.  Obviously these must be at a lower price, then, than the oil from the Middle East, and it is a question which must be examined by the Minister.  It has been said in the English papers that the prices of oil and gas from the North Sea finds have not been finalised.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will announce very shortly the terms for the development of our own finds.  I hope that the negotiations in connection with this are satisfactory all round.  We must satisfy the people who are involved in exploration which costs millions of pounds which the Irish Government could not finance. They must be given attractive returns for the capital invested to ensure that they stay and develop these resources. It is up to us then to control the prices and development.</P>
    <P>When I speak of controlling the development we should ensure that these oil rigs and refining plant are located in Ireland to ensure maximum employment and maximum value.  I am glad to see that a group is studying the problem of oil rigs and the most beneficial place to site them.  We have not got many site with sufficient depth of water or facilities to establish these oil rigs.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to the problem is an intelligent one and they should send our experts to see the most unfortunate developments in Scotland which resulted from the uncontrolled development of oil rigs in the north of that country.  This development ruined the countryside and has led to many social inequalities, lack of housing, and lack of facilities. We should tackle the problem before rather than after the event.  We should be able to allocate sites for an <Col N="1942" /> oil rig building firm and refineries and the Government should provide houses and other facilities required by the community such as roads, hospitals and schools.</P>
    <P>This is an intelligent and constructive approach to a problem which will have long-term significance for us.  The use of gas has cropped up and I was interested to read in the document I mentioned of the optimum economic use of natural gas. That document stated that the use of natural gas in new thermal power stations should be made subject to arrangements requiring prior authorisation in order to keep fuel for applications where it is used to better advantage.  It went on to state that likewise its consumption in existing stations should be progressively reduced.</P>
    <P>This is an interesting statement which was obviously prepared by experts. It indicates that the reservation of gas for use in power stations may not be the best and most optimum use to which the gas can be put.  I should like to see some other statements for or against that, but time is on our side in so far as it is going to take time to develop these gas and oil finds.  The Government can sit back for a while, introduce a proper policy on State participation and a proper structure for royalties.  The Government can also produce a report on the proper siting of oil rig firms, the service industries involved with the oil finds, and ensure they are placed to the best advantage for the Irish people and that the maximum employment is got from the development.</P>
    <P>I would say ten years is a fair time to get the oil and gas finds on tap and, indeed, with the policy being pursued by the oil consuming countries which is geared in the short term towards a reduction in oil consumption, the oil companies are not in as strong a position as they were two years ago. I read in some magazines that they are worried about the surplus of oil that is piling up in tankers and on site in Arab countries.  I do not think they can continue to dictate to us as they did in the last few years.  They were <Col N="1943" /> wrong to dictate to us and they used the oil price weapon as a bargain stick in relation to the Middle East conflict which was remote from us. We have suffered but I do not think we will for too long.</P>
    <P>Ten years is a fair figure to put on it.  I am not happy with the Fianna Fáil prophesies of doom.  Their prophesies are negative and unconstructive and I do not believe our people will fall for them.  Policies enshrined in the agreement are intelligent, constructive, and are of a nature that this Government should participate in.  The opposition who are going to vote against this agreement are sticking their heads in the sand.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Agreement establishes a programme whose main features include co-ordinated efforts to develop emergency supply reserves.</P>
    <P>That is interesting.  The present 60-day reserve requirement will be increased to 90 days.  I do not know what our capacity is at present but we should have a 90 day reserve.  The Minister added:</P>
    <P>... a scheme for restraining energy demand and sharing oil in a supply crisis.</P>
    <P>This, again, is a rational approach to what is a practical problem.  It is generally recognised that we are inefficient in our use of oil and our use of energy and that we should economise.  However, yesterday I heard irresponsible statements from the Opposition which I found difficult to understand.  Arrangements for gathering information on the international oil market is a sound proposition which must be of benefit to any policy-maker in any country.  The question of nuclear energy which was given prominence in the booklet I referred to is of interest.  That booklet states that in view of these restrictions, it appears reasonable for the community to set targets for the next few years.  On the supply side nuclear facilities would be increased and could cover half the production of electricity from the middle of the next decade. That is a starting statement and one <Col N="1944" /> which I would like an elaboration on. If it is possible at lower prices than our existing electricity the economy benefits from it.</P>
    <P>The question of a nuclear power station is under consideration under the aegis of the Electricity Supply Board.  There are objections to the siting of the plant in Wexford.  I do not know if the objections are valid or not but surely there is enough expertise, especially in America and in England, to ensure the safety of such a plant.  We should not delay too long in deciding where we are going to put the plant.  The matter should be cleared as soon as possible and a decision taken on it.  Before decisions are taken on it the public are entitled to a full explanation concerning the benefit of establishing such a plant in ensuring that electricity which would flow from it would be cheaper than the present cost.  We should make more progress than we are making at present.  I do not know at what stage it is envisaged establishing a nuclear plant in Ireland. Certainly if we have not got one by 1985, on the assumption that such a plant would be viable we will be dragging our heels unnecessarily in a vital area affecting the country.</P>
    <P>In ten years' time we will not be affected by the Arab-Israeli conflict. We will have more control over our own destiny in relation to energy supply and consumption.  It raises a substantial issue for the Government in so far as that the whole policy of pricing of newly-found oil and gas resources must come to the fore.  It is essential that we have a public discussion concerning the pricing policy which the Government will adopt with the exploration companies; we must be careful not to adopt a a price which would discourage them. We must be careful also not to adopt a price which would make the whole project unnecessary and undesirable from the Irish Government's point of view, if the resulting price structure were less advantageous for us than the present one imposed by the Arabs. I do not know what steps the Government are taking in relation to the price structure, but perhaps there <Col N="1945" /> could be more public discussion of it, based on English experience which is relatively new and which is I think, still the subject of House of Commons legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from page 17 of this Bulletin of the European Communities which refers to the problems I have just been discussing:</P>
    <P>If the Community is to clear the way towards implementing its policy it must state its position unequivocally as regards prices and indirect taxation in this field.  Thus one of the cornerstones to be erected appears to be a price policy which offers conditions for the adequate long-term profitability of investments which are designed to attain the objective set.  Such a policy would have to provide, where necessary, for incentives to speed up investments which would not otherwise be made or for measures of a fiscal nature to ensure among other things that energy sources with a low initial cost do not receive an undue financial benefit.  In addition, the size of investments in question will necessarily lead firms to call on the international capital market, and it is thus important that the Community should facilitate their obtaining such finance.</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of the problem quite clearly stated.  It will take quite an amount of expertise.  This is a problem which has hit us suddenly.  The Minister must carry out an examination, in depth, of the new complex problem we call the energy crisis.  He is backed up by an efficient Department. But he should also have the right to call on as much expertise as possible and should have a cabinet of experts under him&mdash;who may or may not be full-time&mdash;but who will help him to formulate sound policies.  This is not the usual method under present Government structures here.  Usually a Minister is advised by senior officials of his Department.  Rarely, unless there is a public inquiry or something similar, does one find outsiders influencing State policies.</P>
    <P>We are in a different era; our commitment to Europe should force <Col N="1946" /> upon us a change in the method of decision-making.  Our excellent Civil Service should be augmented by a Minister having the right to establish a cabinet under his aegis to advise him on any matter on which he seeks it.  The cabinet should be of his choice, be expert in nature, and be sufficiently empowered to get whatever information he may require.  We have an obligation to modernise our style of Government in order to make it more flexible.  Nobody would deny that there is a need for more flexibility because of the major problems which can arise suddenly resulting from our entry into Europe.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for us to pursue a policy of isolation proposed by Fianna Fáil.  It is a negative policy which would not benefit this country. We are aware of the existence of the multi-nationals.  We are a small but sound nation, sound in its approach to many problems.  We have the will and ability to control these multi-nationals. Control of the activities of the multi-nationals is essential to any developing country.  They have financial resources and expertise which we, as a small nation, do not possess.  The problem in a nutshell is that we cannot control them.  We should be flexible enough to control them and I am satisfied that we can do so.  The policy of isolation proposed by Fianna Fáil is negative, one with which I do not agree and at which I am surprised.  I should be very grateful if a Fianna Fáil speaker would suggest an alternative in the event of our choking the multi-nationals, or in the event of us nationalising them, which has been implicit in their speeches here today. They are all very interesting questions. But I am afraid the policies required should be more forward-looking, more international in perspective and require that we, as a nation, be amongest nations with a similar outlook in seeking a solution to the problem which would not result in a crisis, or which would minimise any crisis that might arise. Membership of this programme is a sound policy and one which would benefit this nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>For 18 months or more we have lived with the energy problem; almost anything that has happened in Irish society since then has been blamed on the energy problem that arose then.  We have this present recession which is affecting our country and we are gliding through it absolutely rudderless, like a rudderless boat, going in no positive direction. Every time a Government Minister or Government spokesman stands up to explain any difficulties that are being experienced by the people of the country, somewhere along the line the energy crisis is introduced as an excuse.</P>
      <P>We have listened to this for so long that we would expect at this stage that positive steps would have been taken to investigate and to explore the possibilities of some type of independent line of action.  I was interested to hear the last speaker cite the case, and support the case, of the multi-national oil companies.  I was surprised that that speaker, being a member of a Coalition Government which boasts of having a socialist wing, pleaded the cause of the multi-national oil companies and how we should accept them as a fact of life. This certainly was interesting coming from the Government of which he happens to be a member.  If we start with reference to these companies and say that, unfortunately, we are to a large extent dependent on them and their activities, that does not mean, as Deputy Collins seemed to point out, that we should continue to accept that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, every effort by all of us as a combined body of this House and by the people in this country should be directed at finding ways and means to give these people less control over our economy, less control over our industrial development.  I believe these people have made immense profits, from which country we are not sure, and if these are the companies Deputy Collins and his Government like to support, where these outlandish profits are made in some oil somewhere&mdash; some of it may be in our own soil&mdash; then Deputy Collins and his Government <Col N="1948" /> are welcome to support and to continue to support the multi-national oil companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They still continue to do it.  I am sorry the Minister is not here to hear me express these sentiments but he would tell us of the problems he has experienced.  It happens in the Deputy's constituency, in fact, with the petrol retailers' association, with the business people in his city and county.  He will find that from time to time they have been affected by the ring operated by the multi-national oil companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is being suggested to us is that we should form an association with a group of countries, all consumer countries, for the purpose of <Col N="1949" /> having a common energy policy for a period of ten years.  I cannot see any advantages to be gained, and certainly none were spelled out by the Minister this morning, nor by Deputy Collins in his continued references to the document he had before him. I can see no advantage from an industrial economy point of view, no steps being taken through which we would have more readily available to us a cheaper oil product that would possibly create more jobs, that would create a new confidence in industry and in factory floor employment. With the unemployment figures as they are, with the potential employment figures being rather serious looking, it is understandable that confidence at that level is dropping and dropping rapidly.  For that reason the Government of the day have a responsibility and the Minister has a responsibility to act positively and not negatively and not look at consumer countries who, basically, have nothing to offer us because they do not produce the product we need so badly.  Deputy Barrett spelled out suggestions this morning.</P>

    <P>There is the valid point that this <Col N="1950" /> consumer group is inspired by America.  It seems strange to me, in many ways, that a country like America should be the inspiration and the guide in getting this group organised.  I would have grave doubts as to whether America intended this to be for America's benefit or for the benefit of those who are now becoming her allies in that agreement.</P>
    <P>I wonder if all the Government Members, particularly the Members of the vacant Labour Party benches, are aware that this country which they have for so long dubbed as the imperialist capitalistic society is now guiding the destiny of our Minister for Transport and Power.  Are those so-called socialistic Labour Party members aware that they are now supporting an agreement which we maintain does nothing for the benefit of the economy of this country?  I hope it has been spelled out to them. I look forward to seeing what side they will take when a division is called for in this House.</P>
    <P>Talking about our own resources or our possible resources the previous speaker said time is on our side.  I am sorry I must disagree with the speaker on that point.  I would say that time is running out, and running out fast. We on this side of the House are concerned that no positive statement has been made&mdash;although promised, and still being promised, and we wonder for how long more it will be promised&mdash;by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the conditions to be attached to the announcements he will make regarding the expected and hoped for finds off our south coast.</P>

      <P>The previous speaker is, in fact, so unfamiliar with the situation that he want on to waffle about certain aspects of it and read from the document he had with him without any reference to the facts of the situation.  He asked for dialogue.  I agree with him on this point; dialogue is important, as he <Col N="1951" /> suggested, on the pricing structure.  I believe that the Department of Transport and Power, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Cork County Council, Cork Corporation, Cork Harbour Board and possibly the adjacent local authorities should be well informed about the situation. People must be guided.  You have inquiries as to what is happening, what is the potential, what kind of job opportunities will there be, what steps are AnCO taking to train and provide the necessary labour force, the necessary expertise and the necessary technological knowledge required in this development work in offshore gas and oil.  This, we sincerely hope, as I am sure the Minister does, will be the greatest injection this country could get in the not too distant future.  Let us hope that the people who say there are substantial finds there are right.  Let us also hope that the Department will stop this dragging of feet and communicate with the people concerned.</P>
      <P>I am not at all too happy with the situation at the moment.  You have a delegation from a Department going to Aberdeen to see what is happening there.  You have delegations from local authorities going to see what is happening there.  They are all going in their own different ways without enough contact between people in this major potential development. Dialogue should be going on with officials in all the areas I have mentioned, keeping a very close eye on what is happening, what will be happening and what the correct steps are to give our economy the greatest advantage.  The Department officials would have been far better employed in this over the past 18 months than directing their attention to an agreement with people in the same predicament as ourselves, guided by America and encouraged by America to join this association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Still on the offshore development situation, the uncertainty as to what is happening there must be an indictment on any serious views the present Government have on the energy situation.  Deputy Barrett, our <Col N="1952" /> spokesman on Transport and Power, went to pains this morning to point out where he saw savings, where he saw improvements on the existing situation.  Among them was, of course, pressing ahead rapidly with developments off our south coast. What is the position?  Would it not be great news for all of us if we were told tomorrow that a huge find had been made there, or even next week or the week after&mdash;so good a find that steps would be taken immediately to make the find productive at the earliest possible opportunity?  Should the supply be so big we might, instead of being an importing country, as we are now, find ourselves an exporting country.  What then would be our position under this agreement? People may say the possibility is remote but the possibility is always there.  Let us hope it will be more than a possibility.</P>
    <P>Offshore development in our energy situation is to be desired.  Plans have to be made but there is indecision, inactivity and lack of direction on the part of the Government.  That was evidenced very clearly within the last two days.  What appeared to me to be an unprecedented step was taken by a body set up to encourage investment in industry.  I refer, of course, to the Industrial Development Authority.  It was strange to see this body adopting the new role of appealing against a planning permission awarded by Cork County Council to a firm which intended building oil rigs on Bere Island, a firm which, I believe, intended going ahead with rig development, at no cost to the State, and intended providing houses for many of the employees involved in it.  This development related to the energy production off our south coast, the building of oil rigs for the oil fields. An appeal has been lodged by that body against this development.  This, in my opinion, is an indication of the lack of Government direction in this important field of development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept, but I take it I am entitled to refer to the development of our energy resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred to how the natural gas found there should be used.  This is an aspect that should be examined in minute detail.  Whether or not the supply should be funnelled into the Electricity Supply Board is very doubtful and it is something that should be examined very closely.  Our control of supply and our control of price is non-existent.  If we are to achieve any result from energy resources surely we must direct our attention to where they are produced. I have already said that we should press ahead with our finds off our <Col N="1954" /> coast, co-operating in any way we can with the companies involved, getting as much State participation and involvement as we can and above all to protect the employment and the employment interests of our people and ensure that jobs are retained for them.</P>
    <P>The next thing we have to look at, in the short-term I hope, is the prices we are paying to outside producing countries.  Deputy Barrett spelled out clearly the fields in which we could save costs.  The points he made on the refining situation were very valid.  The increase in our refining capacity is a welcome development.  The extension of our refinery at Whitegate is something that, not alone in the short-term will provide employment in the area, but will in the long-term, at least, give us control over our own refining to a larger extent than exists at present. He also suggested to the Minister ways and means by which spare capacity refining is available even in a temporary way.  I believe the Department have not adequately studied all the alternatives in this situation.  I also believe that when a motion like this is put before the House and the agreement placed in the Library that more information about the different areas which were examined and why some were rejected, should be given.  I do not think it is enough for any Minister or any Government, in a field so vital to our economy, just to bring in an agreement and place it in the Library. This agreement is for the most part technical.  The Minister just spelt out the reasons he believes we should go ahead with this agreement.  On an occasion like this the alternatives should also be placed before the House.</P>
    <P>I know there are members of the Government parties who will have grave reservations about this agreement. I am sure some of the Labour Party Members are very anxious to read why this line of action was selected above other lines of action.  I would like to know what other fields the Departments explored.  Did they explore the fields suggested by Deputy Barrett?  One is inclined to suspect they did not.  This is a general observation <Col N="1955" /> I have about Minister of the Government and their European commitment. While we agree with the European situation in its context one expects a little more leadership from Ireland.  Our Ministers are too inclined to adopt the role of just tagging along and being led by somebody else.  When Fianna Fáil return to power this is something we will have changed.</P>
    <P>It was not explained this morning why France has not and will not sign this agreement.  What are they doing about supplies?  They are obviously going their own way.  They are adopting the isolationists' policy that Deputy Collins criticised.  The French people must believe that they are doing the right thing, the correct step from their economy's point of view.  How closely have we examined the steps France is taking?  Can we prove or can we give figures to substantiate that the steps France is taking are not the correct ones and that the steps we are taking in this agreement are the right ones?  I do not believe we can substantiate that because our voting strength in that group of nations has already been referred to by Deputy Barrett as being insignificant.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps hard to visualise Japan and Ireland in such a situation, one common denominator, one common interest, both oil consuming nations. That is not enough.  There must be something greater.  I believe that the steps pointed out this morning by Deputy Barrett are very sensible.  I would like to hear the Minister or some spokesman outline how many of his Department officials visited the oil producing countries, where they went in those countries, whom they met, what discussions they had, did they move down to the oil fields, was there a smokescreen presented to them that prevented them from seeing the exact situation, what knowledge have they of how France is handling its supplies?  All these are relevant points which should be laid before the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also referred to the fact that a figure of £7,000 was mentioned here this morning.  I am surprised at the Minister, whom I believe <Col N="1956" /> to be a gentleman, adopting that kind of role that is typical of his colleagues, of understating a cost factor by such a huge amount.  Obviously £7,000 is an insignificant part of the cost for us in this agreement.  Naturally we welcome the increase in storage.  Again it is regrettable that we are not aware that any positive steps have been taken to increase this storage which was called for by our spokesman on Transport and Power, Deputy Barrett, 18 months ago in this House.  At that time he appealed for this storage.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that we are, in a big way at present, dependent on the multi-national oil companies.  Our efforts should be directed at getting away as far as possible from that situation, not becoming one of a bigger conglomorate and involving ourselves more deeply with this group. We know only too well the way their Irush companies have, in a dictatorial way, kicked around Irish Industry, the retail trade and so on, from time to time.  We know only too well the ring that was formed by these people within the country, the huge profits they have made, the profits they made during the oil crisis at the expense of the ordinary working people, the farming people and business people of Ireland and of other countries.  Deputy Barrett outlined in detail the steps that we intend to take on this. Our approach would be a positive one. It would be directed at going out and doing a good deal for this country with a business-like approach, with a bit on initiative and with the one thing that is lacking, a bit of guts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this motion.  It is important that consuming nations come together and work as a group because the producing nations have indeed formulated such a policy.  We have heard criticism from the Opposition that we are not doing enough to cope with our energy problems.  This agreement is a constructive approach by all the nations that are concerned to come together to ensure that if one country is in trouble they will receive help and oil. We are dependent on oil and our whole economy is bound up in oil.  We <Col N="1957" /> have seen that in the last couple of years.  We are probably the most dependent country in western Europe on that type of energy.  It is in our best interest to see that we are involved with other countries because we are for our own interest.</P>
      <P>I am surprised to see the Opposition adopting a negative role now, a role of isolation, and of possibly doing nothing.  If that is their contribution, so be it.  We are in Government, we have got to produce the goods and ensure that there is a flow of oil coming in.  One does not know when there would be an eruption of hostilities in producing countries which might leave us again in an isolated position.  We have got to protect our interests as far as we can in such a situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett said the £7,000 referred to by the Minister was not a correct figure in regard to storage tanks and what goes into them.  The last speaker said Deputy Barrett called for this 18 months ago.  In my view it is necessary that we have proper storage and oil in the tanks.  I do not think we can put it as a charge against this particular motion.  Whether we were debating this motion or entering into this agreement with other nations we would still have to provide a better storage capacity than we have.</P>
      <P>I would like to see, as a positive step within a grouping like this, that as we have oil potential off our coasts the Government would have as large a stake in it as possible.  This is important. If countries who signed the agreement are interested in having a good supply of oil they may look at this country with a view to investing money as a group in explorations for oil.  If we had this in the agreement it would be a more positive approach. The other is purely talking about getting supplies from producing countries but as we are a potential producer we should invest as a Government and, through some international monetary fund set up by the countries who signed this agreement, carry out this development.  That would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard much about multi-nationals from the Opposition and I got the impression that we were discussing <Col N="1958" /> a Bill on controlling multi-nationals. When Fianna Fáil were in Government they showed no concern about taking on multi-nationals or doing anything about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but the implications all morning were that we were running away from multi-nationals. I am making the point that as a Government we have not done this.  We must face the fact that this agreement is one by consumers and the people who control it are the multi-national oil companies.  We cannot just <Col N="1959" /> turn our backs on them because they are the people who supply oil.  We must talk to them but that is not the end of the day.  That is why I am making the point that we should set up some sort of monetary fund to find our own oil.  This could be done effectively by these other countries joining us, and they would reap the benefits and reward of such a policy.  There is a great need that we come up with a positive policy on our oil refining and make decisions.  It is important that we refine what we require to keep our costs down so that when we find oil we can get the maximum profit from it by being able to refine and redistribute it.  That aspect of our development needs scrutiny and decisions.</P>
      <P>We should have positive plans for off-shore oil development.  I know the Minister is working on agreements and I hope such agreements will come to fruition soon so that we will know where we are going in that field and what we can hope to get.  In this regard also the record of the last Government was not good.  They tended to hand over vast areas for little or nothing and now we have the problem of trying to renegotiate a better deal for our natural off-shore resources.  I have no doubt that this will be done but the sooner we get down to operating this the better.  The sooner we formulate this type of policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy cannot comprehend that, so be it, but that is the charge.  Everybody knows that. It is an embarrassment to Fianna Fáil, just as is the mining situation.  We are speaking now about energy.  Obviously there is a little heat being generated on the far side.  We must have an oil refinery; where it is to be built is a question for the experts. But we should not delay too long in <Col N="1961" /> making our decision.  Greater emphasis should be placed on other sources of energy within our country. The ESB had plans for a nuclear station but they have been put back on the shelf.  I should like to know why.  It is always best to have more than one source of supply from which to draw in the event of problems arising.</P>
      <P>We must study also potential finds of gas and a positive examination carried out as to how this gas may be used to the best advantage, so that it would not be used in a wasteful way&mdash;whether it be used for generating electricity or as domestic or industrial gas.  But we must ensure that we have our plans well prepared when such an energy source becomes available to us.  Competition between the ESB and gas companies is wasteful. There should be co-ordination between them; particularly in the domestic use of electricity and gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely making the point that it was important to put our own house in order.  In the international agreement it states quite clearly that the obligations are on countries to conserve energy and use it to best advantage.  That was in the agreement on the international energy programme.  But if the Ceann Comhairle rules this out of order, so be it, but, I see it as part of the overall picture which cannot be divorced from this.  It behoves every country to ensure it is making maximum use of its sources of energy to best advantage. Any country that does not do that is playing a very small part within a group of countries working towards the goal of best distribution and conservation of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we have international agreements.  Possibly this is a start.  Also I feel we should go directly to the producers with further dialogue. Our six months' term of presidency of the EEC is an opportune time for us to use our influence, where we <Col N="1962" /> can with producer-countries for a better deal and ensure that the energy situation will not revert to the position that arose some years ago; that there would be complete liaison and harmony in the overall producer/ consumer situation.  The whole western world has been turned almost upside down over the past couple of years.  One speaker said we tend to blame everything on the energy/oil crisis.  But energy does affect most things.  Whether we use the argument for political or other reasons we cannot escape the fact that the question of oil and energy influences almost everything in our daily lives.  When this vast increase in price took place it affected our whole programme. As can be seen, Germany, England, France and Italy all have inflationary problems as a result.  It is important that we get together, as nations, to ensure that we limit the effects of such an upheaval were it to recur.</P>
    <P>I am rather surprised at the Opposition adopting a negative attitude. Consultation, leading to agreement, is very important.  If the Community is not concerned with helping its members it is not very worth while.  We did not join the Community merely to take everything from it.  We have a contribution to make.  I know it is an enlarged Community in this agreement. But the EEC is involved.  One country, France, has opted out&mdash;that is a matter for France.  But it is important that we participate internationally. The EEC is not a club for &ldquo;taking&rdquo;; it is a Community of development. The way we develop will depend on how well we work together. The Opposition should reconsider their attitude.  They should accept responsibility here and support this motion.  In the long run it is in our best interests.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House much longer except to say that we have had complaints from the Opposition that we were not doing enough over the last couple of years about the energy crisis.  This is a proper step.  We can do more within our own country.  I know they are working at this.  We should take first things first.  We should put our own house in order and make sure that we were maximising the whole <Col N="1963" /> energy situation.  That is our contribution. If we have problems in the future, we can get oil.  We will be in a grouping which will ensure that we can get energy, and that as a country more vulnerable than any country in Europe, we will have this source of supply.  I support this motion wholeheartedly and I ask the Opposition to do the same.</P>

      <P>The agreement which we are asked to debate this morning was first of all effected in September of last year, on a provisional basis.  Subsequently it was presented here in October.  On that occasion apparently the Government thought we had to have an immediate debate so that the Dáil could, in accordance with its constitutional right and obligation, pass a motion enabling the Government to accede to this agreement.  We pointed out to the Government at that time that they were clearly entitled under the agreement to sign this agreement provisionally and that the obligation of final acceptance did not arise under the agreement until 1st May.  This, in fact, is written into the agreement so the apparent urgency then was certainly not such as would have warranted the Government in introducing it in the short term, as they intended to do.  We are glad that did not happen because we brought it to their attention.  It has enabled us on this side of the House, and I hope the Government too, to consider it in greater detail in the meantime.  Now we have to say that having apparently wished to act too precipitately in the first instance, the Government have now left it almost to the very last minute, because this House and the Government will have to decide our position on this agreement by 1st May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now find ourselves in the position that an agreement which will have far-reaching consequences for us literally has to be rushed through the House today, and possibly with some time to spare next week, and the Government will tell us again that we are being obstructionist.  They have financial legislation which is important. Of course the Finance Bill must go through.  One is entitled to <Col N="1964" /> ask once again, if an international agreement of this sort, which is of such vital importance&mdash;and as I go through it in some detail, I hope to explain why it is&mdash;why the Government in the intervening few months did not at least revise the programme of the business of the House.  There are many things that could be left aside for the moment&mdash;which have not inspired confidence&mdash;such as the wealth tax and capital gains tax proposals, this famous tax package.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister can.  When I go through the points in detail in this agreement which the Minister has not referred to at all and when I ask questions, I do not know whether the House will be satisfied with the Minister's reply in the time now available to us.  The Minister did not refer in any detail to the provisions of this agreement, and they are very detailed and, from a legal point of view, contractually binding, using expressions which, in fact, are not quite consistent with a contractually binding agreement but which nonetheless do impose international contractual obligations on us.  That is the first point I should like to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I should like to make is the absence of anyone from those benches, the socialist partners in the Coalition contract.  Whatever Deputy O'Brien has to say on this, the issues involved in this agreement relate to the influence which the multi-national companies have over the international community of nations.  We are very much in favour of agreements between Governments on international obligations which we will honour wherever we are asked to do so, but when doing so we want to be assured that the agreements into which we enter with them will be of a character and nature that will not allow the multi-nationals, in this instance, the freedom to operate as they have done.  It is quite clear from this agreement that there is no effecttive control over the operations of the multi-national companies in the implementation of this agreement.  The <Col N="1966" /> gentlemen who should be concerned, because they had enough time to look at this agreement, are not even here to raise a voice about it.  Perhaps somebody will come in at some stage in this debate to reply to some of the queries we raise on this matter.</P>
    <P>The provisional agreement as drawn up was signed by the present countries to this agreement excluding Norway.  Norway initially, on a provisional basis, as we did, signified their intention to the members of this international agency and then subsequently withdrew from the membership of the agreement.  They are on the list I have here of the agreement dated September; and the Minister I presume will accept that; Norway are there with the voting rates for them.  Subsequently other countries that were not in the original list, notably Austria, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and New Zealand, at a very late stage signified their intention to join.  Obviously that, in itself, indicates&mdash;that was between September or October and the present time&mdash;that many countries have been looking at this agreement in many ways, weighing up for themselves whether they should opt in or opt out, some of them waiting till the last moment and one at least pulling out.</P>
    <P>The Minister casually mentioned this morning in his opening speech that Norway are now an associate member of this international agency.  If the Minister for Foreign Affairs has any doubt about it I had better read the relevant extract for him.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Other Governments which signed the Agreement provisionally were the other Members of the European Community with the exception of France as well as Austria, Canada, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States.  New Zealand subsequently acceded to the Agreement on a similar basis and in addition Norway has become an associate member.  Thus 18&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and this includes Norway</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the 24 member countries of the OECD are now participating in the work of the International Energy Agency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1967" /> I want to know what, in effect, is an associate member of this agency? There is no definition of associate membership.  We are not talking about a golf club.  We are talking about an international agency with very specific powers on the part of its governing body, its board of management and its various subsidiary elements.  The Minister blandly tells us Norway is an associate member.  What does that mean?  If Norway can be an associate member, have our Government considered whether or not we can be an associate member, whatever that means, because there is either membership or there is not.  I did not find in the whole agreement any reference to associate membership or what obligations or rights it involves.  Surely this is something which should have been explored by the Government.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked about France.  It may not be inaccurate that France, to a very considerable extent, has its own State distribution agency for oil to the extent of something over 50 per cent.  It is not a significant base for the multi-nationals, such as Holland, the United Kingdom and the United States.  It is significant that France, which must be just as concerned for its energy programme, guarantees and co-operation to achieve common ends with other partners, has opted out of this agreement. These questions must be asked.  The fact that France is not so dependent on the multi-nationals may have a considerable bearing on their decision in relation to this agreement.  Now that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is present I hope he will clarify the matter for me.</P>
    <P>I must admit I am totally at sea as to how this will be co-ordinated with our membership of the European Community.  Unfortunately, the European Community has not taken up a position in advance on the international energy crisis.  Before attending a meeting of the Heads of State 12 months ago I asked the Taoiseach what proposals he intended to make in this area and I got no reply, no <Col N="1968" /> indication of what the Taoiseach would have to say on that particular summit meeting despite the fact that I referred him at the time to a quotation from the former West German Chancellor, Herr Willy Brandt, to the effect that, if the Community could not take up a common position on energy at that particular summit meeting, then it was not a community in any real sense.  Our Taoiseach, I think, attended the summit without a fixed notion of what our stated attitude would be to contribute this unified view; he attended rather, as far as I can see, to react to what might happen.  If the others attended on the same basis, then there was no united approach.  Consequently the Community was in a very vulnerable position. Subsequently the Washington talks took place, activated to a very considerable degree by Secretary of State, Dr. Kissinger.</P>
    <P>Obviously there is every reason for co-operation and consultation between the Community and other international partners.  We will always support this, but if it is as a result of Community failure to have for themselves a common policy on a matter as vital as energy, which leaves them vulnerable to influences by other countries, then this is something we greatly regret.  Now we have the position where the European Community is producing instruments towards a common energy policy.  We are being given recommendations as to what the position within the Community is and we have this international energy agency, which includes many countries outside the European Community but excludes one significant partner.  What I should like to hear from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this connection is how do our obligations under this particular agency agreement and our European Community membership coinside?  Is there any inconsistency or any clash?  I believe there must be some inconsistency.  How can a community without one of its members operate fully under an agreement of this nature which can impose binding contractual obligations?  The board of governors established under this <Col N="1969" /> agency will have more power than the Council of Ministers of the European Community.  This can be seen from the agency agreement.  When the decision is taken, certain things &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be done by the member States of the agency.  I want to know, if this agency comes to a certain agreement which is not acceptable to one or two members of the Community, where do we go from there?</P>
    <P>There have been some suggestions from the other side this morning that we, in this debate, are advocating a policy of isolation.  That could not be further from the truth.  We want to co-operate and to work together in our own interests and in the interests of other consuming countries in the whole community of nations, including the under-developed nations.  There is not very much for them in this agreement. There are many pious platitudes but very little commitment.  We want to work in conjuction with the oil producing countries, the OPEC countries. Let no one on the other side of the House say that by expressing our opposition to this agency agreement we are being isolationist.  Our opposition is on the basis thas this is not just an agreement between sovereign nations; it is an agreement which is very much subject to and qualified by the role, function, authority and muscle of the multi-nationals.  That kind of agreement is one we do not readily accede to on this side of the House without having absolute guarantees of what our soverign and international rights are as part of an international community.</P>
    <P>What does this agreement contain to control the multi-nationals?  I just mention this as a heading.  I shall point to the areas when I come to them. What is the reaction of the oil producing countries to this agency?  We have seen enough confrontation from time to time between the various power and economic blocs.  There seems to me to be an element in this agreement which would indicate, if you like, a muscle confrontation with the OPEC countries in particular because there is no provision in this agreement for agreements with the OPEC countries. There is no provision for involving them in decisions.  They are outside <Col N="1970" /> OECD.  But why pick that convenient grouping?  There are so many groupings in the world&mdash;the United Nations and so on.  Why should the terms of membership of such an agency be limited to members of the OECD?</P>
    <P>For instance, the members of OECD are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark&mdash;Finland is not&mdash; France, Germany&mdash;Greece is not&mdash; Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway&mdash;Portugal is not&mdash;Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States; specialist status country, Yugoslavia is not. That is not a full representative list of all the interests involved.  The Middle East oil producing countries are not members of OECD.  The Third World nations are not members of OECD.  What place have they got in an international agency agreement of this nature?</P>
    <P>I know an element of protection is necessary for every country, particularly for consumer countries, but can it not see a little further than that.  Is this to be an exclusive club that will use its muscle power to bring down the prices charged by the oil-producing countries.  As Deputy Barrett rightly pointed out, time and time again this morning, it is not the price that they are getting that is at issue, it is the cream off the price that the multi-nationals are getting&mdash; I am inclined to point to the Labour benches because each time I think of the multi-nationals I must think of them and their significant absence here&mdash;that is the major issue.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that at this stage, when we are talking in terms of the recycling of petrol dollars and our common interest with the Middle-East oil-producing countries, that there would have been some scope in this agreement for actually involving them.  Certainly I would have thought that at a time when we recognise particularly&mdash;the European Community has stated this quite clearly&mdash;that the Third World countries are suffering more (a) because of inflation to which the whole energy problem is very central and (b) because of the actual cost of energy itself <Col N="1971" /> to them in any event, not being primary producers themselves, that surely there should have been some place for them in this agreement.</P>
    <P>Are we really thinking in terms of cold war?  The days of Foster Dulles have gone.  Can we not think now in terms of opening out to include the common interest that we all have? Whatever protections there may be, and whatever co-operation there may be between the nations under this agency, will all go for nought unless we can reach real accord with the OPEC countries.  I regret to say that the signs are that the reaction of the OPEC countries to this agency, to say the least of it, is unfavourable. If anyone can tell me of any indication that any of the oil producing countries are happy about the establishment of this agency I would be very gratified indeed to hear it.  That being so&mdash;realities must be faced&mdash; we have a situation where they will look on this as just being muscle power against their power.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has shown a very liberal attitude in this and many things, would recognise that we should be a little futuristic in our thinking rather than adhering to the old styles of almost confrontation and then reluctant agreements.  God knows, there have not been many agreements in the last 12 months in the energy field, reluctant or otherwise. Many of the widely publicised initiatives of the United States Secretary of State seem to have bitten the dust in recent times in particular.</P>
    <P>We must look then to what our opportunity is as a small nation.  We do have at least goodwill with the Middle-Eastern countries and with the developing countries.  We have it for the simple reason that they recognise that we are not one of those who have exercised or developed our economy at their expense.  Being a small nation, they recognise too that our history is to a very considerable extent co-incidental with theirs.  Being a small nation who have asserted our independence in comparatively recent times, I think it is fair to say that we <Col N="1972" /> enjoy their goodwill.  We should certainly have a concern for them, whether we talk in terms of the OPEC countries or the Third World.</P>
    <P>This agreement, in my view, does little to enable us as a nation&mdash;if anything it does nothing&mdash;to use that goodwill not just to our own selfish national interest but indeed to the interest of the international community, to which we belong in every sense.  Who represented us when this agreement, such as it is, was drawn up?  Who represented us when the various provisions of allocations, conservations and of majority voting were drawn up?  Who represented us then? Who was the master-mind behind this agreement?  Was it, in fact, as I suspect it was, the well-qualified and very clearly determined members of, for instance, the United States administration? Were they the master-minds behind this agreement we are discussing this morning?  Who presented the draft to the various Governments? What opportunity did the Governments have of examining it?  I know we signify our final acceptance by notifying the Government of Belgium, but that may be just a formula.  I wonder if, in fact, the Government of Belgium were the master-minds behind it.  I also wonder to what extent, if at all, our Government or their representatives were involved in the actual preparation and drawing-up of this agreement or were we presented with it as a take it or leave it?</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will do so when he is replying. He is trying to give the impression that Ireland is on the move, Ireland is doing this, that and the other thing, Ireland is making disproportionate contributions abroad.  I would like to see the practical evidence of what this contribution was.  It is not just enough to say that in this, as in other areas, we have been making significant contributions and exerting great influence. That gloss is beginning to wear a bit thin.  We now look for performance rather than presentation.  There will be more of that in other areas at a later stage.  Self praise is very little praise indeed, and until we get the evidence to indicate what the contribution was I reserve my right to criticise what has been presented here this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What, as I said, is the position and the attitude of the developing nations to this?  We have seen an attempt within the last week, which has in fact, as the Minister referred to this morning in his opening speech, fallen apart, to get representatives of the developing nations, the European Community and the OPEC countries together in Paris.  That fell apart completely because I believe there were not proper consultations, there was not proper interest, there was not a proper acceptance on the part&mdash;there could not be in my view&mdash;of the OPEC countries or the Third World, the developing nations, that the other oil consuming nations, the wealthy nations of the western world, really had their interests in mind in coming to such an agreement.  We gather that some of our officials, because of our presidency of the council at the moment, spent a long time over the <Col N="1974" /> last few days working literally to exhaustion. Why?  Is there any indication that the community they represent, and particularly the international wealthy communities, have really the sympathy of the developing countries and the OPEC countries?</P>
    <P>There are signs of a new awareness in the community&mdash;I am glad to see it&mdash;with regard to development aid to the Third World, but not such as will help them to overcome what is for them even a much more serious problem than it is for us.  These are the tests by which one judges any agreement.  What will its effect be on those who control the oil supplies? I think this agreement will not be in our interest in view of the manner in which it was born, in view of the representations involved and, more important, in view of those that have been excluded.  What will its effects be on the multi-nationals who control the whole thing?  I think, unfortunately, it will have little or no effect. As has been rightly pointed out, the budget of any one of these companies would dwarf the budgets of most of the member states in this agency and it certainly would dwarf ours.  What effect will this new agency have on them?  They can thumb their noses at it if they wish and I see nothing in this agreement that will deal with them.  What effect will it have on the European Community which, in fact, could have and should have found a common ground in energy which could be a strengthening base to develop the aims of that Community? However, this agency will, possibly, have the effect on the Community of doing the very opposite and undermining whatever moves towards unity and co-operation there might have been.  The effect of it on the developing nations I have mentioned cannot be one that will arouse their support and admiration.</P>
    <P>The actual agreement is as detailed as any Bill that ever came before this House.  Unfortunately, we will not have an opportunity of having a Committee Stage debate on this agreement although it warrants it.  I will have to roll up the Second Stage and the Committee <Col N="1975" /> Stage in one on this agreement and ask some pertinent questions of the Ministers involved as to the effect of many of these provisions.</P>
    <P>This is an agreement we are proposing to sign in ignorance of what our own potential resources may be. We do not know&mdash;and Deputy Barrett rightly pointed this out&mdash;what our resources may be.  The Government have given little indication as to what their programme for the development of these oil resources may be.  We know what they are against; I wish we knew what they are for.</P>
    <P>In the light of that we are signing an agreement which involves, to a certain extent, obligations to share whatever resources we would have. Equally, of course, it involves obligations or rights to a share in allocation of the resources which the other member countries may have.  We are doing that with a blindfold over our eyes.  To a certain extent this may indicate the Norwegian position, which I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs will explain in his reply.  It is possible we could follow their example by becoming associate members although the agreement does not provide for associate membership.</P>
    <P>The agreement refers to the various Governments desiring to promote and secure oil supplies on reasonable and equitable terms.  That hits out immediately at the first fundamental purpose of this.  It is understandable, but that is what caused the reaction of the OPEC countries to this agency. The agreement goes on to say that it desires to take common effective measures to meet oil supply emergencies by developing an emergency self-efficiency in oil supplies.  It then goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Desiring to promote...</P>
    <P>A beautiful cliché which can be found through this agreement.</P>
    <P>... co-operative relations with oil producing countries and with other oil consuming countries,</P>
    <P>That is a lovely bland statement of the type we have heard frequently in the European Community.  When one goes through this agreement one will find that there is very little in it that <Col N="1976" /> enables these co-operative relations to be effective.  There is little in it that enables the OPEC and developing countries to be involved in decisions which will arise under this agency. The agreement also states:</P>
    <P>Desiring to play a more active role in relation to the oil industry by establishing a comprehensive international information system and...</P>
    <P>Listen to this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>... a permanent framework for consultation with oil companies,</P>
    <P>Let us be frank, who is it who has made the bonaza out of the supply of oil over the last ten to 40 years? The Arabs or the multi-national oil companies?  Who, in recent times, was involved in the more significant increases?  What does this agreement provide for?  It desires to establish a permanent framework for consultation with these oil companies many of whom are more powerful by far economically than the people who desire to consult with them.  If the multi-nationals do not want to consult what can this agreement do about it?</P>
    <P>In my reading of it and in my guess, there is absolutely nothing they can do about it.  It is fine but that seems to be the way it is.</P>
    <P>The agreement, while it is contractually binding in international law, I would say it must be in terms of the expressions it uses, the phraseology, to say the least of it, the loosest I have ever seen in any agreement, in agreements even for a tenancy of the smallest property here. There are doubts and questions that arise in relation to the actual meaning of the obligations referred to in it. It seems to be a very strange basis of proceeding with a serious topic.</P>
    <P>One reads through it before one realises that most of the definitions are contained in the end rather than the beginning, but that is only a matter of difficulty in interpretation. As I go through it I find that if I start with Article 2 I have to refer to Article 73 and so on each time to explain what it is precisely, where reservations are, but if I come to the <Col N="1977" /> institutional arrangements I find, in Chapter IX that this new agency shall have: a Governing Board, a Management Committee, and Standing Groups on Emergency Questions, the Oil Market, Long Term Co-operation and relations with Producer and other Consumer Countries.</P>
    <P>Article 49, subparagraph 2, reads:</P>
    <P>The Governing Board or the Management Committee may, acting by majority, establish any other organ necessary for the implementation of this Programme.</P>
    <P>What exactly is referred to there, and what limitation is there on the Governing Board or the Management Committee in establishing whatever organ it is we are talking about?  There is no way of having any idea beyond guessing what it is they would want to establish.  Another organ which can impose binding obligations on us as members of it?</P>
    <P>Article 50 tells us about the governing board which under this agreement will have more authority than the Council of Ministers of the European Community.  In subparagraph 1 we read:</P>
    <P>The Governing Board shall be composed of one or more ministers or their delegates from each Participating Country.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell me what precisely that means?  Does it mean that some countries will have more than one minister on the governing board, because it says that it shall be composed of one or more ministers or their delegates from each participating country? Does it mean, for instance, that the United States could be represented by three ministers while we would have one?  I doubt if this is the intention, but it is not clear from this agreement. Article 50 is clear.</P>
    <P>Have the Government asked, and if they have have they been told, about this?  If they are told later, after they have signed it, that this enables the United Kingdom to have three men to our one because they are a more powerful country it would be a bit late to start complaining about something which, on any legal interpretation of it, <Col N="1978" /> would allow other countries&mdash;or our country for that matter&mdash;to have more than one.  Why did they, in fact, say one at all?  Why they did not say that it shall be composed of ministers or their delegates from each participating country is something that I cannot clearly understand.  In article 51 it says:</P>
    <P>In its activities concerning economic and monetary implications of developments in the international energy situation, the Governing Board shall take into account the competence and activities of international institutions responsible for overall economic and monetary questions.</P>
    <P>What do they mean by saying that &ldquo;the governing board shall take into account the competence and activities of international institutions responsible for overall economic and monetary questions&rdquo;?  Does this cut across in any way the competence and activities of these international institutions? Does this agency have powers which can conflict with the other international institutions, whatever they may be, which will enable that governing board to take decisions against the interests of these international institutions?  I hope we will be given a clear indication of what that is intended to mean.  By any standards it is loose language&mdash;for instance, in an agreement that would be drawn up between Deputy Barrett and myself as to our contractual rights one with another, over the usage of anything.  Here it is enshrined in an international agreement.</P>
    <P>We come to Article 52:</P>
    <P>Subject to Article 61, paragraph 2, and Article 65, decisions adopted pursuant to this Agreement by the Governing Board or by any other organ by delegation from the Board shall be binding on the Participating Countries.</P>
    <P>Remember the governing board can establish organs not merely those mentioned in this agreement but any other organ necessary for implementation of the programme, any organ not even in existence at present.  A decision by it, if it is on delegation <Col N="1979" /> from the governing board, shall be binding on the participating countries. That is a power we have not faced in any international agreement to which we are party at present.  We have faced it to a limited extent in the European Community.  We have had enough talk here from those absent benches over there about national sovereignty, what the European Community meant by diminution of national sovereignty.  Here is one agreement that really cuts across national sovereignty and there is no one here to raise even a squeak against it.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to explain what is meant, or how far-reaching may be those decisions.  It does say &ldquo;subject to Article 61&rdquo; which says:</P>
    <P>The Governing Board shall adopt decisions and recommendations for which no express voting provision is made in this Agreement, as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  by majority:</P>
    <P>&mdash;decisions on the management of the Programme, including decisions applying provisions of this Agreement which already impose specific obligations on Participating Countries</P>
    <P>&mdash;decisions on procedural questions</P>
    <P>&mdash;recommendations</P>
    <P>(b)  by unanimity:</P>
    <P>&mdash;all other decisions, including in particular decisions which impose on Participating Countries new obligations not already specified in this Agreement.</P>
    <P>Therefore, any new obligations, not specified in this agreement, will have to be taken by unanimous decision. They say also &ldquo;all other decision&rdquo;. I am wondering what precisely that means.  &ldquo;By majority decisions are reached on the management of the programme.&rdquo;  Management is not defined in this agreement.  &ldquo;Including decisions applying provisions of this agreement which already impose specific obligations on participating countries.&rdquo; seems to me to mean that, for all effective decisions which we will be bound to follow, the criterion <Col N="1980" /> is &ldquo;majority decision&rdquo;.  Then there are &ldquo;decisions on procedural questions&rdquo; and &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo;. Whatever are the others they are to be taken by unanimity.  The others are not defined, except that is says &ldquo;including in particular decisions which impose on participating countries new obligations&rdquo;, which are not specified.  It goes on to say in Article 61, 2 (b):</P>
    <P>Decisions mentioned in paragraph 2 (b) may provide... which are those to be taken by unanimity.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that they shall be binding only under certain conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is impossible to understand from this which are and are not binding, which can and cannot be taken by &ldquo;majority decision&rdquo; or by &ldquo;unanimity&rdquo;. I hope that the Ministers who have recommended this to us this morning, and who propose to do so, can tell us&mdash;and I hope it is not something they are going to be consulting about now at the last minute in response to my queries; I hope it is something on which they and their civil servants have informed themselves long ago because the questions are so obvious that they should not have had to await my raising them in the House at this moment.</P>
    <P>In regard to this &ldquo;majority&rdquo; voting, could the Minister tell me that if he refers to Article 62 of the old agreement&mdash;the original provisional agreement&mdash;where he will see that Ireland was provided with three general voting weights, as indeed was every country which acceded to this agency.  There is then another qualification&mdash;&ldquo;Oil Consumption Voting Weights&rdquo;.  On that occasion we, in conjunction with Denmark&mdash;of those who signed then&mdash; were given one oil consumption voting weight.  But when the new agreement was drawn up&mdash;and that is the one that was first presented in this House &mdash;giving us a total, under the original proposal, of three and one, four, out of a maximum of 136, to accommodate the other members about to join, notably Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and New Zealand, what happened to Ireland?  Denmark retained its one oil consumption voting weight.  But where does <Col N="1981" /> Ireland stand?  With Luxembourg, we have none.  They take the vote from us we were meant to have, under the oil consumption voting weight, and the result is that, under the new agreement, we have three votes instead of four, three out of a greater number.  Whereas originally we had four out of 136, we wind up now with three out of approximately 155 or 156 or 160.  That is some tribute to the negotiating strength of our Ministers, or representatives, whoever was involved in the interim between this original draft and the final draft; we dropped one out of a greater number in our interests.  Was this something we even thought about? The Minister did not even refer to this this morning.  He must have known that we had got copies of the original draft also.  Ireland now stands with a total of three votes out of approximately 155, when originally we had four votes out of a total of 136. So much for the Irish interest.  I adopt entirely what Deputy Barrett, our spokesman on energy Transport and Power, said this morning&mdash;that even allowing for this weighted voting system one finds there are many occasions on which, allowing for the votes as they are provided&mdash;for instance, the United States with 51; Holland with 5; Japan with 18&mdash;they are the next biggest on the basis of oil consumption.  Those two alone, between them, could effectively with the help of one other country literally in many cases outvote the others.</P>
    <P>If I might just give an example, USA and Japan together make up 69; Germany 11; that makes 80.  Those three alone can immediately outvote by a majority all the other members together and we think we have our international rights and self interest protected in this agreement.  That table of voting strength is there in Article 62, page 79 of the agreement and we are happy with that arrangement. We are not a major consumer.</P>
    <P>In our own conditions we are consumers at the moment but, by comparison with the consumption of the great powers, the great industrial nations like Japan and the United States, we hardly rate at all and, for <Col N="1982" /> that reason their rights under this agreement and their voting strength are much stronger than ours.  Would it not have been possibly more appropriate to have some criterion such as percentage importation of each country concerned?  After all, the United States is to a very considerable extent self-sufficient in its oil production, to the extent of about 80 per cent.  We are totally dependent.  A country that is 80 per cent self-sufficient has all this authority and muscle power under this agreement because the determination for voting strength is oil consumption and their 20 per cent dwarfs our 100 per cent.  They have all this muscle power and we and others like us who are basically exclusively importers of oil, have so little.  Would it not have been possible to introduce some criterion like that to balance the voting weights, so that the percentage importation, for instance, would be taken into account? If so, then we would qualify 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the procedure here is; whether the Minister for Transport and Power will be replying but I hope it will be noted that I am raising this query.  Possibly the Minister for Foreign Affairs can deal with it in the interim.  Will one or other of them tell me what attitude we adopted in relation to these voting weights, what alternatives we proposed, what reaction to them was, and finally how effectively we fought against losing the one little vote we had?  So far as this agency is concerned, we are not a consumer at all.  We have not got a vote as a consumer&mdash;a country which is totally dependent on imports of oil has no vote as a consumer.  That is a farce by any standards.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, was very anxious, when we were negotiating membership of the European Community and when our Minister for Foreign Affairs was out there fighting for us and our rights, to assert our position.  Here they are now throwing it away in an agreement that can impose binding contractual obligations.  I should like to know the answers to those questions and what opportunity we may have of qualifying what has been done up to the present, and whether or not this agreement as it <Col N="1983" /> stands is capable of being amended in any event.</P>
    <P>I come now to Article 53 which deals with the next organ of the communities after the governing body. Remember that the decisions of the governing body are binding.  That is my major concern.  Article 54 talks about the management committee. Listen to this for precise language for an international agreement!  Subparagraph (1) provides that the management committee shall be composed of one or more senior representatives of the Government of each participating country.  What do the words &ldquo;senior representatives&rdquo; mean?  I have never seen that in an international agreement in my life and I am wondering what precisely it means.</P>
    <P>It gives an impression that we will be out there at top level but does it, in fact, mean a member of the Government, a senior civil servant, or what is a senior representative?  What do they mean by one or more?  You would not put it into the constitution of a local hurling club, much less into the constitution of an international agency.  There would be a row at every annual general meeting as to what it meant.  If it does mean something, it is about time it was clearly spelled out.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The standing groups shall be composed of one or more representatives.&rdquo; This time apparently there is a distinction between the standing groups and the management committee.  The management committee are composed of one or more senior representatives. For the standing groups one or more representatives will do.  How do we distinguish between a representative and a senior representative in an international agreement?  We may have an impression that we know what it means.  But an agreement is an agreement and must be read on its face value.  I want to refer back to what I was dealing with before I came to the institutions.  I thought it was important first of all to get to that section to indicate the agencies and the institutions of this Community.</P>
    <P>With regard to the voting in Articles 61 and 62, it is important to put on <Col N="1984" /> the record of the House, although I suppose the agreement is on the record of the House, some indication as to the voting strengths of the various countries.  I will refer to them quickly and give the total because each country has a general voting weight of three, whether the country is big or small.  The real crux arises with the oil consumption voting weight which is determined by the amount of oil consumed.  The combined voting weights are as follows: Austria, 4; Belgium, 5; Canada, 8; Denmark, 4; Germany, 11; Ireland, 3; Italy, 9; Japan, 18; Luxembourg, 3.  Have we lost our capacity for tangling completely?  Where do we rate with Luxembourg?</P>
    <P>I am all for Luxembourg as a small country enjoying its place.  Indeed, it has played a major role in the international communities to which it has belonged and I want to make it quite clear that I do not want to see any diminution of its position, but surely as between Ireland and Luxembourg we do not just measure on the basis of consumption.  If Belgium warrants two votes more than us I would have thought that we might just warrant one more than Luxembourg.  Be that as it may, apparently we do not.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the voting weights are: Netherlands, 5; Spain, 5; Sweden, 5; Switzerland, 4; Turkey, 4; UK, 9; United States, 51.  It is easy to know who will be the big boy provided it is a fellow member of an international community.  My concern is that the big boys are not in the agreement at all, the boys we are supposed to consult with, the multi-nationals.  I do not know about New Zealand because they apparently have joined since that last copy was presented.</P>
    <P>Article 63&mdash;Relations with other Entities&mdash;in order to achieve the objectives of the programme, the agency may establish appropriate relations with non-participating countries, international organisations, whether governmental or non-governmental, other entities and individuals.  Did you ever see anything as broad as that in your life?  They can establish appropriate relations with everybody and anybody and it is possibly under that magnificently <Col N="1985" /> vague Article 63 that this latest creature which is not mentioned in the agreement&mdash;associate membership of Norway&mdash;has been developed.</P>
    <P>I wonder what kind of appropriate relations the agency is talking about in Article 63.  What do they mean? With whom do they mean and for what purpose?  To achieve the objecttives of the programme?  These things would not even have to be said in the agreement.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting point in regard to the financial arrangements. The agreement says:</P>
    <P>The Executive Director shall, in accordance with the financial regulations adopted by the Governing Board...</P>
    <P>Think of that first&mdash;&ldquo;adopted by the Governing Board&rdquo;</P>
    <P>... and not later than 1st October each year, submit to the Governing Board a draft budget including personnel requirements.</P>
    <P>The executive director does that at the request of the governing board. Then it says: &ldquo;The Governing Board, acting by majority, shall adopt the budget&rdquo;.  Supposing the governing board, by a majority, decided not to adopt the budget would that conflict with their obligations under this agreement because here in Article 64, subparagraph 3, it says:</P>
    <P>... acting by majority, shall adopt the budget.</P>
    <P>How they can anticipate this, I do not know.  If they do not adopt the budget, what happens?  It is not explained here.  The agreement is both imprecise and vague.  Remember, that a majority in that situation in regard to the budget can be affected by three or four of the major powers taking a common view which might or might not be in the interests of smaller powers who, unlike them, are totally oil-importing countries.  The United States, for instance, is 80 per cent self-sufficient in oil.</P>
    <P>Article 65 says:</P>
    <P>Any two or more Participating Countries may decide to carry out within the scope of this Agreement <Col N="1986" /> special activities, other than activities which are required to be carried out by all Participating Countries under Chapters I to V.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Special activities&rdquo;, whatever they are, are not even attempted to be defined in this agreement.  What do they mean by &ldquo;special activities within the scope of this agreement&rdquo;? I cannot even hazard a guess.  Have our Government given any thought to this?  &ldquo;Any two or more of the countries may, within the scope of the agreement, carry out special activities other than those which are required to be carried out by all participating countries under Chapters I to V.&rdquo; Could some of these special activities involve agreements with the major multi-national companies?  They are not specified under Chapters I to V. If they are special activities they are certainly more significant than anything that is specified in Chapters I to V.  Again, I hope that those who have considered this agreement before signing our name to it and who had an opportunity of considering it subsequently when it is revised have the answers to these points and can let us have them here.</P>
    <P>I shall go back now to the beginning of the agreement.  Many of the questions I am raising in relation to the agreement are simply asking for clear definitions.  We, on this side of the House, have no objection to entering into international obligations, subject to the criteria I mentioned and there are many provisions in this particular agreement we would obviously welcome, such as the provisions for demand restraint, the provisions for allocation between member states and the agency in the event of one country falling below a certain minimum reserve and the provisions for maintaining reserves.  We welcome these provisions as things that should be done, provided the agreement in its terms of reference is quite clear. But there should be an opportunity for involving so many others who are not at present involved and for controlling others who, in my view, are in no way controlled by this agreement.</P>
    <P>All the provisions on demand restraint <Col N="1987" /> are desirable.  In Article 5 it says:</P>
    <P>Each Participating Country shall at all times have ready a programme of contingent oil demand restraint measures enabling it to reduce its rate of final consumption in accordance with Chapter IV.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Transport and Power if this country has a &ldquo;programme of contingent oil demand restraint measures enabling it to reduce its rate of final consumption in accordance with Chapter IV&rdquo;.  If we have not, we have to have it before 1st May under this agreement. If we have it, I should like to hear about it from the Minister when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I do not think he has studied this agreement at all.  He told us the history of the energy problem.  We all know about that.  He spoke about what the intentions were but he did not, in fact, get down to the bones of this agreement at all.  He told us about the European Community and the common energy policy which they are hoping to achieve but this does not quite square up with this from the point of view of the French.  He spoke of events in Paris last week.  Any of us who are interested should know all about these things from reading the newspapers and we do know them.  His speech is merely a summary of energy crisis throughout the world.  It is not even an attempt to define our obligations under this agency agreement, much less explain them.  I hope that information which we did not get in the opening speech will be given to us when the Minister is closing the debate but I have my doubts.  I think many of the questions being asked now will have to be considered for the very first time.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House. I am going through an agreement of over 80 or 90 Articles and I have to combine the technique of Second Stage and Committee Stage debate.  There are many points I noted when going through the Agreement some months ago.  I do not want to go into them in too much detail; I prefer to concentrate on the major issues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1988" /> Article 7, subparagraph 3, dealing with the general area of allocation, says:</P>
    <P>A Participating Country in which the sum of normal domestic production and actual net imports available during an emergency exceeds its supply right shall have an allocation obligation which requires it to supply, directly or indirectly, the quantity of oil equal to that excess to other Participating Countries...</P>
    <P>I presume this means &ldquo;supply to the agency&rdquo;.  It does not specifically say so; it merely says &ldquo;other participating countries&rdquo;.  To which country or countries?  I presume it would have to be done through the Governing Board.  I do not want to make a big issue of this.  The article goes on to say:</P>
    <P>... This would not preclude any Participating Country from maintaining exports of oil to non-participating countries.</P>
    <P>Can this be done, for instance, before they have discharged their obligations to participating countries?  It does not preclude them from maintaining exports of oil to non-participating countries, and that may be to a certain extent very significant for the Americans. I do not know but certainly, as it reads to me, it is not by any means clear as to what exactly is the limitation on their right to maintain exports of oil to non-participating countries.  Maybe such could be there for us as a friendly non-participating country or else an associate member such as Norway is.  Have these avenues been explored by our Government in view of the obligations which membership of the agency will draw?</P>
    <P>Now we come to Article 11.  It says:</P>
    <P>It is not an objective of the programme to seek to increase, in an emergency, the share of world oil supply that the group had under normal market conditions.</P>
    <P>The objective seems to be just to maintain your share of oil under normal market conditions.  We are not in such conditions any more.  It also states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1989" /> Historical oil patterns should be preserved as far as is reasonable</P>
    <P>Here is the cliché and the platitude:</P>
    <P>And due account should be taken of the position of individual non-participating countries.</P>
    <P>What do they mean by: &ldquo;Due account should be taken of the position of individual non-participating&rdquo;? Is that some way of making a passing reference to developing countries?  Is it a reference to other countries who are in a stronger position than these countries?  What does &ldquo;due account&rdquo;, to be taken of all these things mean?</P>
    <P>Someone sometime along the line, this governing body with its voting procedure, will decide what this &ldquo;due account&rdquo; is.  Before we commit this House to giving our support we must have a clear impression of what this means.  Deputy Barrett and Deputy Fitzgerald were quite right when they said this agreement, what it means and what it implies, should have been explained in great detail to this House by way of special committee, by way of explanatory memorandum and everything else of this nature.  We have explanatory memorandum in this House for legislation which is not technical, and which is not as detailed as this, and this one was lying there and we really have no way of knowing except those of us who might have some little experience in going through sections of a contractual agreement to ask what these things mean.  Even then finally we come up with no answer.  We can only raise the queries.</P>
    <P>Take activation, Article 12, which is when the whole machine starts to roll, when demand restraint is imposed, when allocation comes into being and how do things activate.  It states:</P>
    <P>Whenever the group as a whole or any participating country sustains or can reasonably be expected to sustain a reduction in its oil supplies, the emergency measures, which are the mandatory demand restraint referred to in Chapter II and the allocation of available oil referred to in Chapter III, shall be <Col N="1990" /> activated in accordance with this Chapter.</P>
    <P>I do not know what precisely is meant by &ldquo;can reasonably be expected to sustain a reduction in its oil supplies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I must beg your indulgence and that of the House in raising all these queries.  I am not just doing it for the sake of being difficult.  I am not doing it for the sake of showing that had I or some other group on this side of the House or in some other profession been asked to draw up this Agreement we would have done a better job.  I must consider this agreement as it is and all these questions present themelves to me, these and more besides. I have to ask these questions so that we will have a clear picture of where we are if and when we decide to participate in this agency.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister know, for instance, that under Article 19 within 48 hours of receiving a management committee's report the governing board shall meet to review the finding of the secretariat in the light of that report &ldquo;Within two days of receiving the management committee's report the governing board shall meet.&rdquo;  That seems to me that this Minister sitting opposite, maybe, or the Minister for Transport and Power, sitting opposite, shall within two days of receiving the management committee's report meet somewhere, somehow.</P>
    <P>Let us look at it from a practical point of view.  I can begin to consider the burdens which must rest on the present Minister both in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs of this nation and in his capacity as President of the Council of Ministers and Community, and the other Ministers of this small nation.  Here we find that within two days they will be required, after the management committee's report, to meet, unless the governing board is to be interpreted differently from what I see it.  It says: &ldquo;One or more Minister of the participating countries shall meet within two days.&rdquo; Has the Minister considered what this involves?  How much time will he and his staff or whatever Minister is involved have?  Have they been advised on what is necessary under this?</P>
    <P>It could mean going to Japan.  I <Col N="1991" /> cannot quite indicate where the governing board are to meet.  It could mean going to New Zealand.  It might mean going to Brussels.  That might be convenient.  I doubt that it will mean staying at home in Dublin, but that is another day's work That is another practical objection that I have to this energy agreement because we are finding more and more that we are becoming members of international organisations, many of which are aiming to do the same thing through different agencies.  The European Community, after all, should have a common stand on energy.  All their commitments seem to be in that direction.  It should be sufficient as far as our international associations are concerned but now we find ourselves involved in another one to be serviced by the Minister and his hard working staff.  Let us take the environment.  The Council of Europe are concerned about that.  We service that.  The European Community are concerned about it.  We service that. The United Nations are concerned about it.  We service that.  No trouble to a small nation like us.</P>

      <P>It is just as well that we are not members of NATO, because they are concerned about the environment as well.  That may be fine for the major powers that can trip around everywhere.  I am not surprised that in the heel of the hunt our officials, some of them, are suffering from exhaustion.  Let us face it frankly.  The same can apply to our Ministers and the same can apply to the Deputies of this House.  We are not too worried about our physical or mental capacity to stay the course although the record is not that good.  I say that we have to be rational before jumping into every new international agreement or agency that involves us, in the knowledge that if we do jump in we may be expected to hike off to the other end of the world, to Japan or some other place with two days' notice and that our Civil Service will be getting late night calls telling them: &ldquo;I want this tommorrow.  Be in the office.  Have it ready.  This thing has just come <Col N="1992" /> through from the management committee and I have to be out there and know something about it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The present Government are the men charged with the responsibility for the moment.  They have to recognise and suffer from the problems at the moment.  I am concerned that when we come to taking up the responsibility again in the near future that we will not have inherited a system that is too demanding but a system that will allow us to fulfil our international obligations in a particular way, having regard to our personal resources.</P>

      <P>We have seen a lot of emergency situations within the last few years, in the European Community, in particular.  Who is to say that in the field of energy we will not have an emergency situation arising maybe twice a year?  Nothing seems to require that kind of haste unless all the data has been presented and processed beforehand.  I am not quite sure that that is the case under this agreement.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on the section dealing with the international oil market.  Article 25 says:</P>
      <P>Participating countries shall establish an information system consisting of two sections: a general section on the situation in the international oil market and activities of oil companies,</P>
      <P>This seems to mean information from the OPEC countries and the oil companies.</P>
      <P>A special section designed to ensure the efficient operation of the measures described in Chapters I to IV.</P>
      <P>While these provisions are there the question remains of what are our rights to get this information.  Article 27 says:</P>

    <P>Each participating country shall <Col N="1993" /> provide information on a non-proprietary basis and on a company and/or country basis as appropriate, and in such a manner and degree as will not prejudice competition or conflict with the legal requirements of any Participating Country relating to competition.</P>
    <P>Had we been members of this agency, would that Article oblige, for instance, the British Government to let us know well in advance of their intention to designate 52,000 sq. miles of the Continental Shelf area contiguous to their coast, as they claim, as being within their rights to explore under the former Geneva Convention? It does not say what it involves.  It simply says: &ldquo;shall provide information on a non-proprietary basis&rdquo;. Somebody must know what it means but there is nothing in the agreement to indicate its meaning.  If it means that this claim jumping by the British Government which we witnessed in recent times would be stopped or at least that we would be notified in advance so that we could take some steps to stop them or impede their jump it would be helpful.  I cannot be satisfied that Article 27 means that. Paragraph 4 of that Article 4 says&mdash; and this is important:</P>
    <P>No participating country shall be entitled to obtain, through the general section, any information on the activities of a company operating within its jurisdiction which could not be obtained by it from that company by application of its laws</P>
    <P>In other words, there is no way that the participating countries can get or demand the information they require for their programmes from the oil companies referred to.  If that is the case, what are we talking about in terms of conserving, controlling or allocating?  The people who should be involved in this agreement on a contractual and control basis are left free of the whole situation.  If they do not wish to consult where do we stand? Having regard to their influence, authority and power they would be in a strong position if they do not wish to consult.</P>
    <P>Chapter VI, Articles 37 to 40, is the <Col N="1994" /> portion of the agreement which provides the framework for consultation with the oil companies.  There is nothing here which in any way controls, binds, or directs the oil companies in a way that the participating countries can be controlled, directed or bound.  This is flying in the face of what the reality of the present international oil scarcity is.  There is no obligation contained in those Articles, they are all consultation.  If there is no obligation self-interest can arise and when it does we must be concerned with the outcome from our point of view.</P>
    <P>We have relations with producer countries.  Everyone knows that the attitude of producer countries, to a considerable extent, is the key to the whole energy supply situation.  Article 44, the first article relating to this matter, says:</P>
    <P>The participating countries will endeavour to promote co-operative relations with oil producing countries and with other oil consuming countries, including developing countries.  They will keep under review developments in the energy field with a view to identifying opportunities for, and promoting a purposeful dialogue, as well as other forms of co-operation, with producer countries and with other consumer countries.</P>
    <P>In other words they will talk to them. Article 45 says that to achieve these objectives the participating countries will give full consideration to the needs and interests of other oil-consuming countries, particularly those of the developing countries.  That is a fine platitude.  That is what all Ministers, and the Civil Service, say when they want to postpone something without showing they are not concerned.  It is a standard phrase.  That is what is laid down under Article 45 in order to achieve the objectives of Article 44 which seem to me to be very vague.</P>
    <P>Article 46 says:</P>
    <P>The participating countries will, in the context of the programme, exchange views on their relations with oil producing countries.</P>
    <P>That is a nice vague term, &ldquo;exchange <Col N="1995" /> views&rdquo; with them.  They should exchange a little more than views.  That Article continues:</P>
    <P>To this end, the participating countries should inform each other of co-operative action on their part with producer countries which is relevant to the objectives of the programme.</P>
    <P>That is fine if it will work.  That is as far as the consultation with the OPEC countries go.  There is nothing there with a view to suggesting that they could in any way be incorporated on a contractual or other basis within the framework of this or a broader agreement.</P>
    <P>Article 71 says:</P>
    <P>This agreement shall be open for accession by any Member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is confined to the countries who happen to be willy-nilly members of OECD.  What is the idea?  Why should it be confined to members of OECD and not others? The only members of the OECD countries not included are Finland, Greece and Portugal.  There are other countries who could be involved.  Why should this be confined to OECD, a group which might, to some of the developing countries and the OPEC countries, create a certain impression that they would not be allowed to participate in this international agency?  I have said enough.  I know I have taken some time.  I could take considerably more because, while I have raised a number of queries, I thought it would not be necessary to raise some others that I had marked out in detail because I hope that the consequences of my raising these queries will be that the Ministers and their staff will read through this agreement, fine-comb it, in a way I suspect has not been done at present.</P>
    <P>We do not like this agreement as it stands.  Deputy Barrett has indicated our intention.  I want to state the reason again.  It is not because we want to be isolationist.  That is nonsense. We do not wish to be isolationist, though Deputy Barrett has indicated <Col N="1996" /> that there are certain steps we could have taken, in our own right, that would have improved our position.  It is because we would like to see some control over those who control the international energy situation.  This agreement does not provide for that. This agreement provides for control over us by those who have the weighting power under it.  We do not see any particular advantage in that.  If the Government can come back to us with something a little different from this, which provides the control for which we ask, they will get a different response. But in the meantime, for the reasons that we have both expressed here, our position on this is one of opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the speech of Deputy O'Kennedy on this subject.  I compliment him on the intensity of his study of the agreement and the very many points he has raised on it.  However, what I find striking is that, given the obviously very careful study of the agreement evident from his speech, as I think indeed from the speeches of his predecessors on the Opposition benches, he omitted, as did they, to relate his remarks at all to the main purpose or function of the agreement.  It was a speech which, in that respect, lacked a centre or a core.  He skirted around the whole question of oil sharing, the reason for an oil sharing agreement, and concentrated on peripheral issues.  The other striking thing about the Opposition speeches, of course, has been the extent of their concentration on the question of the multi-nationals, a concentration which has gone so far as to stand the agreement on its head and to say they will reject the agreement because it does not control multi-nationals when the agreement does, for the first time, provide a basis for getting the information necessary to ensure that they operate in the general public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask myself why the Opposition criticism should take this from?  The answer is fairly evident.  With respect the Opposition have a very bad conscience on the question of multi-nationals <Col N="1997" /> because, as has been pointed out by this side of the House, it was they who sold the rights to such a large section of the Celtic Sea for £500; they who gave away Bantry Bay to Gulf Oil for no return.  However, I do not think that the tactic of trying to distract attention from their record in this area, by raising the question of multi-nationals in this debate, will work because, in fact, all it will do is remind people, and enable the Government to remind people, of their very poor record in this area when the criticisms of the agreement, on these grounds, are so obviously upside down and topsy-turvy that they cannot carry much weight.  Given that the agreement does, for the first time, make provision to ensure the sharing of information, without which it is impossible to being to consider what action might need to be taken in respect of these companies; given that this is the most striking feature of the agreement, to criticise the agreement because it does not tackle the multi-nationals is so inherently absurd it demonstrates the weakness of the Opposition's line of argument.  Had I been in Opposition and wished to attack the agreement I would, I think, have taken a somewhat different line.  But each Opposition, each party, must choose its own tactics.  In this instance I think they have been badly chosen from the Opposition's point of view.  So much by way of political comment to which I think one is entitled when the matters have been raised politically.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words first about the background to the agreement, not to dwell at length on it because it is ground we have been over before.  What has not emerged at all from the Opposition's speeches is that the agreement is designed to cope with the situation that can arise if there is either a general boycott, and reduction in supplies, or a discriminatory boycott against particular countries because producer countries dislike their politics, or dislike what they conceive to be their politics or their views.  I would have thought the need for that was evident.</P>
    <P>It is not difficult to recall, because it was only 18 months ago all this <Col N="1998" /> started, the circumstances of the end of 1973 when there was both a general reduction in supplies and discriminatory action directed against particular countries.  It is a fair criticism to say that the countries of the industrialised world should have been more conscious of their vulnerability, should have been more prepared for what then happened than they were.  All the countries concerned are equally to blame for this.  There was a lack of consciousness of our overall vulnerability and the vulnerability of individual countries to discriminatory action.  It would be a fair criticism of this agreement that it is belated, that something of the kind should have been thought about earlier without waiting for the crisis to arise. But, it is human enough to respond to crises when they happen and not always be prepared for them or to think out imaginatively all the things that might happen, and Governments have enough to do, dealing with their immediate problems, without spending a lot of time on hypothetical ones they hope will not arise.  But the fact is, the problem did arise in an acute form.  It was natural and understandable that the countries which had, in varying degrees, suffered at that time should consider what action they should take in order, first of all, to be able to face such a situation again, in better shape, and, secondly, how that action could take a form that was likely to make it improbable that the crisis would arise. The merit of this agreement may very well prove to be not that it is brought successfully into play from time to time but that it is never brought into play. It may very well be that the great success of the agreement, and one that will make it prove to have been worthwhile, is the fact that it becomes, in a sense, a dead letter&mdash;that it may never be needed.  Given the arrangement that has been made here, which significantly strengthens the position of the industrialised countries, faced with either a general or discriminatory boycott, the chances of such boycott recurring have been greatly reduced.  That, I think, is an aspect to which one should draw attention and one to which the Opposition have not adverted at all.</P>
    <P>However, despite the arrangements <Col N="1999" /> made, for reasons which might be emotional, might be related to political events rather than pure economic considerations, if such a general or discriminatory boycott does occur, then at least the countries which are so dependent on energy in the industrialised world have to hand a means of minimising the impact, spreading it equitably and of ensuring there can be no discrimination against individual countries because of their particular policy attitudes or what are conceived to be their particular policy attitudes.</P>
    <P>These are matters of vital importance to all the countries concerned, not least to us.  One does not need to think very far back, only a year to 18 months, to remember the crisis we then faced, to remember the uncertainty about our oil supplies, the uncertainty about whether countries like ourselves&mdash;dependent for such a high proportion of its energy on oil, all of its oil supplies imported&mdash;as to whether we could get sufficient supplies; the uncertainty as to whether neighbouring countries upon whom we had varying degrees of dependence for transhipment or refining, a degree of dependence which, as has properly been said, is excessive but which we inherited from the previous Government which left us in that position; the doubts that existed about whether we could rely on countries which supplied us directly, or indirectly, continuing to do so and not putting their own interests first to a degree that involved effectively cutting off supplies to here.  From our point of view that experience was a salutary one.  It is one from which we must learn, and what we have learned is that we must take steps, with other countries, to prevent it recurring and safeguard us in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, we came through, on that occasion without very extreme hardship; certainly the difficulties our economy faced at that time were much less than those in Britain but it was a warning as to what could happen and we had to respond to that warning. That is why we joined, with others, in making this agreement.  The circumstances <Col N="2000" /> in which the agreement was brought about were, of course, not entirely satisfactory.  I have spoken in this House before on the subject of the Washington Conference of February last year.  We would have wished that, at the meetings, the European Community would have shown the solidarity which must surely be its aim and objective and which gives its main value to us all.  That did not happen because of a rather shortsighted view, perhaps, of particular national interests.  We did our best, as I said before, to prevent that break occurring.  We worked to keep the Community together and try to ensure that the arrangements that are incorporated in this agreement would be ones in which all members of the Community would participate and ones which, we thought, should be undertaken within the framework of the OECD, rather than by establishing a separate agency for reasons, indeed, that Deputy O'Kennedy has said&mdash;we do not have inexhaustible supplies of people to send to conferences and organisations throughout the world. Small countries like ourselves are desperately over-stretched in manpower. Therefore, we would prefer to minimise the number of organisations to be served.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said within the framework of the OECD.  Do I take it from that&mdash; because it is not clear from the agreement nor certainly from what the Minister said, in opening&mdash;that this is going to be a subsidiary body of the OECD?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just about, in the next sentence, to make that point.  What we sought at the time was that it should be done within the OECD, within that framework.  Some Governments did not think it was desirable at the time, and there was a move to have a completely separate arrangement.  In fact, partly because of our efforts but because of those of other countries as well, the agency has been brought back within the general framework of the OECD but having a separate identity, the need for this deriving from the necessity to have a different kind of voting <Col N="2001" /> mechanism for certain purposes than the unanimity system of the OECD. Therefore on the one hand it is within the framework but separate.</P>

      <P>It is closely linked with the OECD in terms of the physical arrangements made for it. It can be seen and in fact it is an emanation of the OECD, but with separate voting arrangements.  I am not saying that I am satisfied that this is the perfect way of doing it.  I am only saying that we wanted it to take this form, to be within the OECD. That was not agreed at the time and we have had some success in bringing it back in that direction in the period in between as one of the points of Irish policy on which some measure of success has been achieved, although it is not in this form, exactly the way we wanted it.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that he has given similar replies to questions regarding this advance factory.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the steps he is taking to protect the jobs of workers in the motor assembly industry in view of the large numbers recently laid off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The present position of the car assembly industry is that a number of firms have either laid-off workers or have gone on short-time.  This situation has resulted from a decline in the market demand for motor vehicles, and, in the case of one firm, from the cancellation of a franchise for the assembly and distribution of vehicles.</P>
      <P>The safeguarding of employment of workers in the assembly industry has both short-term and longer-term aspects.  As to the short-term position, I have made it clear to all parties concerned that I will not permit vehicles to be imported in fully-built-up condition at the expense of a loss of jobs in the assembly of those vehicles here. My Department have also initiated discussions with the assembly firms with a view to securing their voluntary co-operation in the present difficult situation through the exercise of restraint in the use of their rights to import assembled vehicles under the special scheme for the motor assembly industry, as modified by the terms of our accession to the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2004" /> As regards the longer-term position, I would refer the Deputies to the reply given on 28th November, 1974 to Question No. 63 as reported in the Official Report, Volume 276, columns 577 to 579.  That reply had reference, among other matters, to the setting up of manufacturing operations which will provide alternative employment for workers engaged in assembly firms.  I am happy to say that one such project has commenced production and is exporting, and another project is expected to commence production in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state how many jobs the two projects he mentioned have provided or will provide in the immediate future?  There have been three closures in motor assembly firms in Dublin and the total number of redundant workers is between 1,300 and 1,400 in Brittains, McCairns and Reg Armstrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mixing separate matters.  With regard to his question about the number of people, by mid-September, 1975 in one of the projects 200 people will be employed and, when full production is reached in 1977, 500 people will be employed. In regard to the second diversification project, the number envisaged is 130 new jobs, making a total for the two projects of 630 jobs at full production. The first 200 are being recruited at the moment.  The reason I wanted to separate the two categories is that one category of unemployment is because of short-time working due to a downturn in the market.  The category that has arisen from a dispute between a manufacturing company and an assembler here is quite another category of unemployment.  It is occurring because of that dispute, in circumstances where in the past the products in question have enjoyed a very substantial market here, at one point more than one-third of the Irish market.  That is a separate problem. Hopefully the dispute can be resolved and then there is no threat to the jobs of the workers.  It is a question of a dispute between firms and efforts are being made to resolve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister <Col N="2005" /> will agree that the difficulty that has arisen between Brittains and British Leyland in England about the supply of components, as was reported, is because Brittain (Ireland) Limited are unable to pay for parts they are importing. Their financial difficulty is, in turn, caused by the general downturn that has affected McCairns and Armstrong.  Basically it is the same problem and there is no immediate prospect of re-employment for the 900 men from Brittains unless the Minister can come up with something.  Has he anything for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy genuinely misunderstands the position. He has said the basis of the dispute is money that is owing because of a downturn in the market.  I do not want to offer a judgment on the relations between the two firms, but it is much more complicated and is of longer origin than the present downturn of the market.  It is not primarily based on the non-marketability of the end product. That is the first point.  Since the Deputy is mistaken about the basis of the dispute, the second point I should like to make is that it is more desirable to try to get a resolution of that dispute so that the products which in the recent past enjoyed more than one-third of the Irish market should be widely available.  That is the desirable outcome and it is the outcome being pursued at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seeking to imply that the 900 men who have been let go by Brittain (Ireland) Limited will be taken on again by another company to whom British Leyland may give a franchise?  Can the Minister guarantee that the 900 men will go back?  If British Leyland can negotiate a franchise with another group in this country, is it not likely that the labour force taken on will be much smaller than the existing labour force?</P>

      <P>The volume of investment from industrial proposals received from home and overseas industries has been at a record level in the past two years and this will result in a substantial level of new job creation both this year and in the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to stimulate further investment the Government have substantially increased the financial allocation of the Industrial Development Authority for this year.  The authority will give speedy consideration to industrial <Col N="2007" /> proposals received from home sources and will give special consideration to the development of small industry. The authority are also intensifying their overseas promotional activities and are reviewing their regional industrial plans in order to expand total manufacturing employment in the State.</P>

      <P>In the past six months there has been a serious net job loss, and what the IDA are trying to do is totally inadequate when foreign capital is apparently very loath to come into the country as is evident from Du Pont in Cork Harbour and Alcan at Foynes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is malicious glee of a profoundly inaccurate kind in the Deputy's allegation that foreign capital is not willing to come into the country.  There has indeed been a serious net loss but the potential when at full production&mdash;not the job creation element&mdash;of new industrial projects approved in the financial year 1972-73 was 14,000; in the financial year 1973-74 it was 23,000; and in the nine months April to December, 1974 it was 19,800, the 12-month equivalent of which would be 26,400, a rising plane, a dramatic rising plane, double in the period of this Government of new job potential in industrial projects approved.  One could go on with other figures.  The fixed asset investment for the past three years is more than £800 million as against £206 million in the preceding three years.  There is a great deal of evidence of an inflow of capital and of interest in the potential of Ireland as a location for industry. The increase in unemployment in Ireland in the period of the present economic difficulties has been one-tenth of the percentage increase in Denmark, a comparable country undergoing comparable difficulties, having entered the EEC at the same time.  There is a malicious glee in pulling down the efforts of this Government, but in trying to damage the Government they are also damagng the country and the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that it was somewhat easier in Britain to deal with this problem because of the fact that they have not got a written Constitution. I am advised that some of the powers which the Minister might wish to take under legislation here could cause difficulty because of the fact that we have a written Constitution. The Minister decided that legislation should be prepared and accordingly, with Government approval, a draft Bill was obtained from the Parliamentary Draftsman in September, 1974.  On examination in the Department, however, it appeared that the Bill as drafted would apply to quite legitimate trading relationships which have nothing to do with pyramid selling.  The basic characteristic of pyramid selling is that one recruits other people to sell something to somebody else.  This situation could occur in quite legitimate trading relationships <Col N="2013" /> as well as in the type of pyramid selling which would be objectionable. The Department are concerned to ensure that whatever legislation is introduced does not interfere with legitimate trading relationships while dealing with the specific causes for complaint which have been referred to over a time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make a statement on the progress which has been made to remove technical barriers to international trade, for example in the area of merchandise marks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The new round of multilateral trade negotiations which has just commenced, within the framework of GATT, will deal with all barriers to international trade.  A special sub-group has been set up to deal with technical barriers to trade such as those arising in the areas of standards, packaging and labelling and marks of origin.  This sub-group will have its first meeting next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2014" /> The EEC, while having its own policy of eliminating internal barriers to trade, is prepared to subscribe to any international procedures which may be worked out in the multilateral negotiations to avoid or minimise the adverse effects which national laws could have on international trade. EEC policy in this matter is being evolved in the form of directives, about 200 in all, of which 160 deal with industrial products and about 40 cover foodstuffs.  These directives are based on the principle of optional harmonisation and have effect by making it obligatory for each member country to admit goods which comply with the provisions of the directive. In other words, member states may if they wish insist on standards&mdash;applying equally to home-produced goods and imports from other Community countries&mdash;up to the level provided for by the directives, but not up to a higher level.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are three general directives dealing, respectively with prepacked liquid goods, with pre-packed solid goods and with a harmonised range of sizes of packs.  The liquids directive was adopted by Council on 19th December, 1974, with 18 months for implementation&mdash;and up to five years of a derogation granted to Ireland&mdash;and the solids directive is at an advanced stage in Council and is expected to be adopted shortly.  The directive providing for a harmonised range of pack sizes is at an earlier stage of preparation by the Commission.</P>
    <P>Progress with both product directives and the general directives tends to be slow but these matters are of considerable complexity.  Under the Council programme for work on removal of technical barriers to trade for the period ending 1st January, 1978, the objective is, however, to complete a very large number of them, including the two remaining general ones, well within that period.</P>
    <P>Ireland is also a member of OECD which has undertaken a number of studies in the field of consumer policy. Recommendations, which are not binding, are made with a view to <Col N="2015" /> the elimination of abuses and progress reports are called for periodically. These findings are also taken into account in the formulation of EEC policy.</P>

It is open to them to do so again in relation to any other complaints they may have.  By virtue of the fact that there are many different sorts of relationships between oil companies and retailers, ranging from company-owned stations to independently owned stations, there can be quite a variety of complaints.

      <P>In relation to the price of sugar, is it not a fact that the recent increase of 42 per cent in the price of sugar was attributed to the higher price which will have to be paid for beet this year?  But the beet is <Col N="2020" /> not yet sown, or only just sown, in many cases; it will not be harvested until October and it will not be processed until round about December. On that basis, plus the fact that the world prices of sugar have fallen considerably in the last two months, how does the Parliamentary Secretary account for the fact that he or his Minister have now increased the price of sugar by 42 per cent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Prices Commission have in fact already done a considerable amount of work in this area.</P>
      <P>With regard to the particular commodities mentioned in the Deputy's question, information is already publicly available as follows:</P>
      <P>Frozen foods, including fish fingers &mdash;certain aspects of these prices were included in the January, 1974, National Prices Commission report.</P>
      <P>Egg Prices are dealt with in the July, 1974, National Prices Commission report.  An occasional paper on the egg industry was published in September, 1974.</P>
      <P>Sausage Prices are dealt with in the January, 1974, National Prices Commission report.</P>
      <P>Meat Prices are dealt with in the August/September, 1974, and October, 1974, National Prices Commission reports.  The Meat Prices Advisory Body Report of Inquiry into the domestic meat trade was published in January, 1975.</P>
      <P>Pig meat products are dealt with in the May, 1974, and August/September, 1974, National Prices Commission reports.</P>
      <P>Animal feeding stuffs are dealt with in the June, 1974, National Prices Commission report.  An occasional paper on the animal feedstuffs industry was published in December, 1973.</P>
      <P>With regard to white fish, a lengthy study has recently been made by consultants on fish distribution and marketing in Ireland and it is expected that a summary will be published in a forthcoming National Prices Commission monthly report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had those reports but would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the general public still do not know exactly what they are getting in the package?  Will he also agree that we have the peculiar situation that if somebody sells an inferior quality sausage, for instance, <Col N="2023" /> the retailer and not the manufacturer is prosecuted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter part of the question is a matter for consumer protection legislation.  In relation to the former matter I can tell the Deputy that the National Prices Commission have examined the question of a consumer prices guide which would give the price range of a commodity or service and thus serve as a guideline for housewives.  A prices guide was suggested by the Consumer Association of Ireland but the commission in their report for June, 1974 did not recommend it.  They said:</P>
      <P>While fully understanding the objective of the Association's proposal, we see considerable practical difficulties in implementing it.</P>
      <P>First.  It would be very difficult to avoid a significant time lag between the collection of price data and their publication.  From our experience, it would be very difficult to reduce the lag between the collection of prices and their wide publication below two to three weeks.</P>
      <P>Second.  The proposed consumers' prices guide would need frequent revision.  This could not be avoided given the importance of import prices in determining the prices of goods sold in Ireland, and the fact that increases under the national pay agreement apply at different dates in different firms and industries and are well above, in almost all cases, any increases in productivity and efficiency that could be obtained over the period to which the agreement relates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third.  There would be difficulties in determining the price range of a commodity or service that would serve as a guideline.  There are considerable variations in the prices of individual commodities between categories of retail outlet and between outlets within the same category even before account is taken of special offers.  The mere publication of a price range could be interpreted to mean approval or acceptance of all the prices within <Col N="2024" /> the range and create a tendency for prices at the lower end of the range to be raised towards the level of those at the upper end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Prices Commission report in 1974 with reference to pigmeat but when the housewife goes in to buy sausages she does not know if she is buying flavoured bread or she is actually getting pigmeat.  It is not necessarily the most expensive sausage that has got the biggest content of meat.  Can anything be done about that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether fish fingers are a more expensive form of protein than beef; and, if so, if he will have the matter examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to this question depends on the relative prices of fish fingers and beef.  There have been considerable fluctuations in beef prices in recent years and, furthermore, the price of beef at any given time can vary considerably depending on such factors as the particular cut, the quality, and the margin taken by the retailer.  Similarly, fish prices are also liable to vary from time to time. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it would not be feasible to make any general pronouncement on whether fish fingers are a more expensive form of protein than beef nor do I consider that it would be useful to have the matter examined.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in the context of consumer legislation, he will make provision for the compulsory labelling of meat which will give the name of the cut, the amount in the packet, the total price and the price per 1b.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the terms of the Deputy's question that he is referring to pre-packed uncooked meat.  Two of the Deputy's four suggestions have already been required by law for some time.  An order under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1970, which came into effect on 1st February, 1974, requires that all packs of meat for retail sale must be marked with the quantity.  An order under the Prices Acts requires that since June, 1973, shops selling meat must display the unit price on a list.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult, if possible at all, to require the name of the cut to be shown on packs; these names are to some extent a matter of local custom and could be varied for purposes of evasion and they are not legally defined so as to be enforceable in the courts.</P>
      <P>As to total price, this is already displayed on many packs of meat.  The question of requiring the showing of price and unit price on packs is under consideration in the context of the National Consumer Advisory Council's report.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question would imply that there should be a fundamental departure from our existing primary education system, which is one of State-aided schools rather than State schools.  Under the present system State grants are provided towards the cost of building, equipping and maintaining primary schools which have been established by the local initiative, are vested in local trustees and are under the direct government of a local management authority.</P>
      <P>It would be my desire that local ownership and control of the schools should be maintained.  This, of course, implies that some proportion of the cost of building, maintenance and equipment must be met otherwise than by State grants.</P>

      <P>That is a stupid answer, if you will excuse the expression. It is ridiculous.  I asked the number of schools about to be closed.  The Minister has twisted it round.  This is what I call playing the old game but the Minister is not going to get away with it.  What are the names of the schools I asked about?  The Minister stated, in his reply, that they are not closed for economic reasons.  If they are not being closed for economic reasons, then what are the reasons?

      <P>I believe that I have already dispelled any disquiet felt by the parents of final year students in the National College of Physical Education, <Col N="2041" /> Limerick, by my statement of February, 18th, 1974, to the council of the NCEA.</P>
      <P>In that statement I said that the NCEA were being empowered to award degrees in physical education to students of the NCPE who were successful in their examinations in 1975.  I also stated that the Government had agreed to empower the NCEA to award degrees in respect of degree-level courses, already under way, which it was found that the universities were not at present in a position to validate.  I added that this power to award degrees will remain with the council until the universities are prepared to undertake such validation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the steps being taken by his Department to provide for cases in which young people who, having appeared before the Children's Court, Dublin, are remanded on bail, find themselves without accommodation and may be easy prey for criminal elements in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons who are remanded on bail are free members of the community.  If, exceptionally, a person on bail is in need of accommodation, his position is similar to that of others in need of accommodation. Accordingly, the question of accommodation for any person on bail who may need accommodation is not one for my Department but for the agencies concerned in the ordinary way with the provision of accommodation for persons in need of it.  This might be a matter of housing for an entire family or temporary accommodation in a residential institution of some kind for the particular person immediately concerned.</P>
      <P>While the question relates to young persons on bail, perhaps I may add for information that, even in relation to persons sentenced by the court, my Department are not responsible for the provision of residential or custodial institutions for young persons under the age of 16 years.</P>

Anything could happen to those boys.  No Government can wash their hands of this problem in the city.  I would appeal to the Minister at least to get in touch with the Minister for Education to see if accommodation cannot be provided for children on bail and not to have them turned loose in the city.  If they do not do that, children should not be charged and dragged before courts and then turned out on the streets with nowhere to sleep, and possibly set fire to a bookstore.</P>

I would go further and say that the type of person to whom Deputy Moore referred and with whom I have sympathy&mdash;I am well aware of the size of the problem &mdash;does not come within the scope of the Department.  That is not to say that the problem is being ignored.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have replied to a number of Parliamentary Questions in recent times in the matter of teenage drinking, the most recent being on the 13th March last&mdash;Volume 279, columns 590 and 591.  It is my belief &mdash;and I am not alone in this&mdash;that the problem of drinking by young persons is a social one related to the drinking habits of the community generally.  I have pointed out that legislative changes or police action can at best have a marginal effect in dealing with this problem, and I have requested the co-operation of the community in bringing to the notice of the gardaí information concerning those who may be deliberately selling intoxicating liquor to underage persons.</P>
      <P>These are inherent difficulties in enforcing a law which hinges on an age limit.  A system of identity cards has been advocated by some, but not everybody may realise that in order to be effective its introduction would have to be linked with the creation of what is called an &ldquo;absolute offence&rdquo;, namely, that of serving drink to a person under the legal age irrespective of whether or not the licensee or his agent genuinely believed, on any evidence short of an official identity card, that the person served was above that age.  In that kind of situation, persons in an age group of 18 to possibly somewhere in the middle twenties would have to hold identity cards in order to be able to satisfy licensees that they could be served.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I talked to the Licensed Vintners' Association and to the Licensed Vintners Assistants' Union as well about this towards the end of the second half of last year. We discussed this problem.  Since then I gave a lot of thought to identity cards but we would have to rule them out as being impractical and not <Col N="2058" /> meeting the problem.  We agreed that it was essentially a matter for the community.  The vintners were not at all happy that they should be blamed for teenage drinking.  They were anxious to ensure that none of their members would break the law and they are anxious to ensure that any of their members who did break the law would be prosecuted for it.  This means that people who have knowledge of this abuse must come to the gardaí with hard information.  This is how this problem will be solved.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 80 and 81 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fire precaution arrangements in hospitals are primarily a matter for the hospital authorities concerned, whether these be health boards or voluntary bodies.  My Department have issued circulars to each hospital authority, including voluntary hospitals, <Col N="2061" /> private hospitals and nursing homes, drawing their attention to a number of measures that should be undertaken to ensure that fire precautions are adequate.  The circulars emphasised the importance of having a clear chain of responsibility and authority in regard to fire precautions and having a named person designated as clearly responsible for fire precautions. They also drew attention to the need to ensure compliance with the requirements of the local fire authority, to have fire fighting equipment inspected and tested regularly, regular fire drills carried out, buildings patrolled adequately at night, and records kept of all matters relating to fire precautions.</P>
    <P>Within the past two years, fire prevention officers have been appointed by each health board, with specific duties in regard to fire prevention in hospitals.  The combination of the work of these fire prevention officers with that of the local fire service is considered adequate to minimise the ever present risk of fire.  I do not think that a formal national survey of arrangements is called for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Each health board has prepared a major accident plan for its area and exercises have been carried out to prepare the health board and voluntary hospitals to meet the demands which might be placed upon them in the event of a major emergency.</P>
      <P>These arrangements have ensured in the past that hospitals coped satisfactorily with special urgent demands made on them and I would expect that the same position will obtain in the future.  However, the arrangements are kept constantly under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In the main, the group of drugs described as tranquillisers are available only on medical prescription and their availability is thus controllable by the prescribing doctor. The larger issue of the increased demand from the public on their doctors for help in times of stress is of course a complex one.</P>
      <P>The organised medical profession have indicated their awareness of this problem and their preparedness to tackle it so far as concerns their role. I agree in general with the views recently expressed on this issue by the president of the Irish Medical Association. Persons must be encouraged to cultivate more balanced attitudes to the problems of everyday living.  I would see the recently established Health Education Bureau playing an important role in this regard.</P>
      <P>I do not think that a formal inquiry on this issue is called for at present. The health authorities have knowledge available from the operation of the services on the use of these drugs which is sufficient to form a basis of policy.</P>

      <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2064" /> Rubella, or German measles, is generally a mild disease but it can cause abnormalities in children born to women who contract it in the early months of pregnancy.  An approved vaccination scheme against rubella has been in operation since August, 1971. This vaccination is available free of charge to girls aged 12 and 13 years, the object being to vaccinate girls prior to their reaching childbearing age.  There has been a good response to this scheme; in 1973, about 85 per cent of the girls in the age-group concerned were vaccinated.</P>
    <P>Women not vaccinated against rubella may, however, have achieved immunity as a result of having contracted the disease in childhood and thus having developed a natural immunity.  Most women have such immunity.  To achieve immunity by vaccination in women of childbearing years not naturally immune, it is necessary to carry out a blood test to establish whether or not vaccination is required and it is also essential to ensure that the woman does not become pregnant for a period of about two months following vaccination. Taking these points into consideration, the long-term advantages of a scheme aimed at the 12 and 13 years old age groups become obvious.</P>

      <P>It is available to all girls between the age of 12 and 13, irrespective of what school they are attending, and my information is that, in fact, 85 per cent were vaccinated in 1973.  That was, if you like, public vaccination.  There may have been private vaccinations as well, which would raise the percentage still higher.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the recommendations made in the 1968 Report on the Care of the Aged the approximate number of beds required for geriatric cases in County Donegal would be 220 in long-stay hospital units and 280 in welfare homes, of which 48 of the former and 63 of the latter would be for Inishowen.  These figures do not cover a small area in south Donegal which is assessed as part of the Sligo catchment area.</P>
      <P>There are 235 long-stay beds in St. Joseph's Home, Stranorlar, which, of course, caters for Inishowen also. Geriatric cases are also accommodated in the district hospitals and the health board have made arrangements with the Nazareth Home, Fahan, to reserve six of their 12 geriatric beds for health board patients.  Two 40-bed welfare homes are in planning, with the approval of my Department, for Ramelton and Falcarragh, and I understand that the board have approved in principle of the provision of three further 40-bed welfare homes at Buncrana, Glenties and Donegal.</P>
      <P>The major extension which is in planning for Letterkenny General Hospital will include geriatric assessment beds to cater for the area. When the extended hospital is completed the health board plans to reclassify district hospital accommodation now in use for acute purposes as geriatric accommodation.  With these various plans implemented the health board should satisfy the needs of the county, including Inishowen, for geriatric accommodation.</P>

      <P>It is my policy to develop community welfare services which, in conjunction with the health services, deal with cases that come to light but public awareness of the danger of this condition for old people is essential to ensure that full use is made of the services.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, the subsidised butter scheme was instituted by decision of the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of re-introducing the Butter Scheme, which under the previous authorisation ended on 31st December, 1974, was a matter for decision by the Council of Ministers of the EEC.  The scheme is being reintroduced with effect from 1st April, 1975.  There has been no delay on the part of my Department in implementing the EEC decision. Difficulties have been experienced with regard to the printing of the necessary vouchers but it is now expected that these will be available for issue by the end of the month.</P>
      <P>The categories of persons entitled to benefit under the scheme are recipients of:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Non-contributory old age and blind pension, non-contributory widow's and orphan's pension, unmarried mother's allowance, deserted wife's allowance, prisoner's wife's allowance, single woman's allowance, unemployment assistance, home assistance, health act allowances, special allowances under the Army Pensions Acts.</P>

    <P>Under the EEC authorisation each beneficiary will be entitled to one pound of butter per month for himself <Col N="2071" /> or herself and for each dependant during the period 1st April, 1975, to 31st January, 1976, at a reduced price equal to the normal amount charged by the butter retailer less 17p.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider, as well as the categories of people he enumerated in his reply, that parents of larger families should also be recipients of this service?  In many cases I think it will be found that such large families are people of rather small wages so the amount of money available for housekeeping might be less than that available to people in receipt of social welfare benefits.  Would the Minister consider this service in the case of households of seven and eight children?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not say I will consider it officially but I will as a person concerned about poor people. Unfortunately, the regulations say that this sort of subsidisation is only applicable to those in receipt of the assistance benefits.  That, of course, means that those in receipt of disability benefit or contributory old age pensions and widows' pensions would not, unfortunately, be eligible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have thought of that and I readily admit that our system of social insurance or any form of social assistance might be different but the letter of the law, as far as we are concerned, is that it should only be applied to those in receipt of assistance. As far as my bringing this up is concerned, this would not be possible because it is, in fact, a function within the EEC of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  We merely <Col N="2072" /> administer the scheme for him but I certainly will bring it to his notice.</P>

However, when the claim was transferred to the United Kingdom Department it transpired that he was already receiving a disablement pension and an unemployability supplement from that Department and, as unemployability supplement and sickness benefit cannot be paid concurrently, his claim for sickness benefit was disallowed by the United Kingdom.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>My sanction is not required to the acceptance of tenders for any of these schemes, none of which is of more than 60 houses.  As regards the provision of moneys for these schemes, I would refer the <Col N="2079" /> Deputy to my reply of 8th April, 1975 to his Question No. 40 in which I explained that I had increased the council's initial capital allocation for their 1975 local authority housing programme by £250,000, and that the position would be further reviewed later in the year.  I have been informed by the council that their increased allocation is sufficient to cover their housing starts in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept when contractors are asked to tender for houses by a local authority that after the closing date the tenders would be opened and the contract allotted?  In Kildare we are not in a position to give contractors this guarantee and schemes for which tenders have been received will now have to be listed in order of priority by us.  This never occurred before in the life of this council or the former council.  Would the Minister accept that they have not sufficient moneys to deal with schemes in hand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept what the Deputy has said in the light of the first part of the reply which notes the increase in the capital allocation of £250,000 and that the council have informed the Minister that the increased allocation is sufficient to cover their housing starts in the meantime. The reply also promises a further review later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the fact that his Department agreed to have a reappraisal of the situation within a few months is an indication that we are now working on a shoestring budget from day to day and that nobody building houses can plan when he does not know what will happen after two months?  A contractor needs to know at least a year in advance of when he is going to build houses.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government when he proposes to give effect to his verbal undertaking to the Donaghmede, Donaghies and Grangemore residents, County Dublin, that if they abandoned their mortgage strike he would replace their present building society loans with SDA loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give the undertaking mentioned in this question. While I have sympathy with the difficulties which the persons concerned have been experiencing as a result of the failure of the previous Government to make sufficient money available to local authorities for house-purchase loans schemes, I have no legal power to replace their present building society loans with local authority loans.</P>
      <P>I told representatives of the group that because of the background to their case, I would explore the possibility of making some special arrangements in their case.  I am examining this matter in conjunction with the other Ministers concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has obviously been misinterpreted by the deputation from the area who spoke to him about this mortgage strike because their understanding was that if they concluded the strike the Minister would give them SDA loans.  That was stated recently at their annual general meeting.  Would the Minister not agree that to say it is still being considered after this length of time&mdash;since the original meeting he had with the association&mdash;is absolutely unsatisfactory?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if an additional grant will be given to the members of the Ardcath group water scheme, County Meath or whether the local authority will pay the full cost of the additional pipes in view of the fact that his Department asked the group to fill in forms for a water grant from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in July 1974 and this grant was then no longer in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the position.  In September, 1973, Meath County Council had agreed to make a contribution of £2,507 towards the cost of providing a section of 6 inch main requested by them.  Subsequently, I directed that the question of the county council being asked to increase this contribution be considered, because the scheme was turning out to be much more costly than originally estimated. It was not possible to put a firm proposal to the county council until the results of a detailed examination of costings became available.  This did not become available until recently and as a consequence the county council were asked on 9th April if they would be prepared to increase their special contribution to £5,372 to meet the full cost of the 6-inch section. They were informed that the additional amount would qualify for loan and subsidy at the usual rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group were advised, while the examination of costs was proceeding, to see if assistance would be available from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries towards the cost of the scheme.  As the increased county council contribution would now bring <Col N="2089" /> the unit cost of the scheme below the limit applicable to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries scheme, resort to that scheme would not be appropriate.  Such assistance in any event would be relatively small in relation to that which the county council can give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to the Minister for his reply but he did not really answer the question.  Officials of his Department went to the farmers and got them to fill up forms.  The forms were held in the Department for a couple of months but when a query was made to the Department the forms were sent to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the next day they were returned to the farmers who were told they were out of date.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the Irish allocation from the EEC Regional Fund will be used to supplement national aid for projects as outlined in Article 4 of the fund regulations; or whether it will be used to reimburse his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A pre-condition of assistance from the Regional Fund is that public <Col N="2091" /> moneys of a member state must be expended on financing any project which qualifies for assistance from the fund.  The objective of the fund is to increase the volume of aid for regional development.  This aim will be promoted by the manner of application of the moneys which Ireland will receive from the regional fund.</P>
      <P>Article 4 of the Council Regulation of 18th March, 1975, establishing the fund provides that assistance from the fund &ldquo;may either supplement aid granted to the relevant investment by public authorities or remain credited to those authorities and considered as a partial repayment of such aid&rdquo;. Each member state has, therefore, the option of applying either of these systems.</P>
      <P>To enable the benefits of the fund to be equitably spread over the largest possible number of projects, it is intended to pool the fund assistance with Exchequer expenditure on state aids to industry and infrastructure. Fund moneys will thus augment the scarce capital resources available to finance future industrial and infrastructural development, rather than increase the level of aid granted to a limited number of projects.  This is the best way of ensuring that the fund's resources will provide additional industrial and infrastructural development. I understand that a similar approach will be adopted by most, if not all, of the other member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply and his statement in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last Tuesday, where, in justification for the use of the repayment system, he stated this will generate more industrial development, would the Minister indicate the nature of this development and where it will occur?  Further, will he state if the fund moneys will be allocated under Article 4 (1) (c) of the fund's regulations?  This is the section of the article dealing with infrastructure in disadvantaged and hill farming areas.  Finally, the Minister has stated the majority of member states will opt for the repayment clause.  Will he indicate those member states?</P>

      <P>I said our understanding is that most, if not all, of the member states will do that.  There has been a gross misinterpretation of the language of the Community regulation that governs this matter. This country either has a choice of taking a few limited projects and giving them grants far above what is available to anyone else&mdash;to do that there would have to be something like a lottery, where someone would get a bonanza and others would not get assistance&mdash;or else we can use the fund as we must sensibly use it, in order to increase the volume of aid so that more areas, more projects and more people will benefit.</P>
