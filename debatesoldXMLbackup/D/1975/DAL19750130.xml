    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about the advances in social welfare benefits which this budget will implement on 1st April, but another important factor is the removal over a period of four years of housing and health charges from rates.  In fact, we are talking in terms of an additional £4 in the £ if this procedure has not been adopted. From time to time we hear complaints from the Opposition that we have not adhered to our 14-point plan but one after the other these points have been, or are being implemented as is evident by another factor in this budget, the reduction in the qualifying age for old age pensions from 68 to 67.  These, the tax concessions and additional children's allowances all mean that the Government are aware of inflation and its consequences and are taking steps to ensure that the effects of inflation are cushioned as far as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister said, I think, that pay increase claims could be of the order of 25 per cent in the coming year.  That seems to be a terribly high demand and is possibly a result of the economic situation but I think it behoves everybody to ensure that we do not seek too much.  I am not speaking particularly of wage earners because right across the board we have an obligation as a people to show our concern regarding the problems we face and a tangible way of showing that concern is by not demanding more than our fair share of the GNP.  Responsibility rests on the trade unions, the employers' organisations, on agriculture and on all sectors of our economic life.  If we act responsibly the Government can&mdash; and did in this budget&mdash;encourage growth, soften the impact of rising inflation by incentives, by taxes, by children's allowances and by other means, but if industry and agriculture do not respond but want to take from the economy more than it can stand, ultimately it will mean that we go further into the inflationary spiral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other countries in the western world we are suffering <Col N="1390" /> because of inflation; but if we persist in this it could mean a major recession, something we all want to avoid because in recessions the weaker sections of a community suffer most.  As a Government of reform, something which has been demonstrated clearly in the last three budgets, it can be said without doubt that they are concerned. We must act now and ensure that the economy will be well stimulated to promote growth of industry, agriculture and wealth, so that we can have a higher GNP and, consequently, more to go around.</P>
    <P>With regard to the GNP, social welfare and other aspects of our economy, we seldom receive much statistical information on how we operate, how we decide that we will on the basis of GNP be able to pay out a certain amount to social welfare. If we achieve the situation that social welfare payments will be based on real terms of our growth rate we will have gone a long way towards relieving the poorer sections of our community. We must stimulate our growth rate because without any stimulus in that field we will continue to be in trouble balancing budgets. While it is important today to talk about deficit budgeting I believe the day of reckoning has to come, but I feel sure the Minister is aware and concerned about this.</P>
    <P>One of the alarming features about expenditure is the cost of Government services and the Minister for Finance, being the person also responsible for the public service, is aware of this. The Government services cost something in excess of £400 million.  The Minister stated that any further salary increases above what we might bear would mean a cutback in growth rate, a cutback in what we can give to social welfare recipients and a consequent cutback in the standard of living of a lot of people.  It is important that we look at this situation responsibly. We are going through a reasonably thin time and we can only overcome it if we have the will and determination to look to the future of the country as a viable unit.</P>
    <P>In the field of education a lot of the articulate groups have been marching <Col N="1391" /> for higher grants, but if one looks at the figures and examines the reality of the situation one will see that the people in the lower bracket who attend only primary school have less spent on them as against those who attend university.  This is something which must concern us all.  A lot of those who attend national schools do not go any further and that is to be regretted, but I hope this will be eliminated in time.  While we must be concerned about higher education we must also see that there is fair play in the allocation of capital. Basically only the middle class go to the university, but working class people pay taxes although they do not reap the benefits in this field.  It is true to say that those who seek increased grants for higher education are articulate and have a great lobby. Until I see something being done for those in the lower sector to ensure that the whole educational system is geared to encourage people to go further than national school I would be against allocating any more money to higher education.  We hear a lot about cherishing all our children equally but the figures for education are a complete contradiction of this ideal.</P>
    <P>The IDA are doing a good job and any money put into that field is well spent.  However, there is a void here. When industries are established we are told of the number who will be employed at the outset, the number who will be employed two years later and the expected figure when the industry is in full production.  We do not receive any information as to whether the projection was lived up to or if the industrialist reached his expected target.  If we are giving anybody vast sums of money they must be accounted for and it is important that the House is fed with such information.</P>
    <P>The IDA announced this morning that it is their intention to help with research and development, a laudable venture.  I suggest that the Minister set up a body as an adjunct to the IDA, to encourage people who have ideas.  We tend to be always waiting for other countries to develop ideas <Col N="1392" /> but the whole aspect of new development could be carried out by such a body.  We have to be courageous because we are in a very competitive world.  We have to seek markets and to ensure that we create new ideas.  We have to ensure that the researchers we have do not have to go elsewhere. The establishment of such a State body would have in the long-term a beneficial effect on Irish industry. Such a body would tend to ally itself to the technical age we hope to go into and drift slightly away from the academic age we have been caught up in.  It has been felt that unless one goes to a university one is a failure; if one goes to a college of technology that person is a second class citizen. There is no doubt that a change is coming and for this reason we have to ensure that we have a channel and an area of development to put our researchers into.  We must have an area in which their skills and talents can be developed for the overall good of the nation.  While budgets are important from the point of view of accounts they should be used also as an opportunity for exploring worthwhile ideas.  We must be prepared to give every opportunity to our people to develop their potential to the full.</P>
    <P>So far as inflation is concerned we should endeavour to get a breakdown of the causes of this problem.  If our entire inflation is imported there is very little we can do about it but, if, say, 20 or 30 per cent is imported, we could isolate that and take steps to deal with that which is domestic. However, there is no breakdown and, consequently, it is very difficult to know how best the problem should be tackled.  If it were itemised it might be possible to determine in which areas, government or otherwise, steps should be taken to deal with the situation. We must ask what the Government are doing to stem this raging inflation.  We must ask if it is being caused by wage increases and if we find the cause we must ask what we can do about it.  A certain amount has been done in this budget to offset the effects of inflation.  For instance, the Minister has ensured there will be additional income to the home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> However, we must continue at all times to come to grips with the situation because inflation tends to go over the threshold and into a situation of recession.</P>
    <P>In this budget a significant amount &mdash;£100 million&mdash;is being provided for housing.  One area to which we must give consideration is that of the building societies.  We must consider the area of private enterprise and ask whether we can encourage private enterprise particularly in the centre city area.  As chairman of the housing committee of the corporation I am in favour of private enterprise in the sense of housing development in this city.  At present developers consider office accommodation to be the field in which to be involved.  Being private entrepreneurs they will choose the area of greatest profit but it is for us to examine the ways in which we can encourage the investment of private capital in house building. Economically, it is sound policy to encourage greater investment in housing among the private sectors and, socially, this is good too.  A mixture of private and local authority houses in the city would make for a better city.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on this, his third budget.  It is an imaginative budget, a budget intended to help those who are being hit most by inflation and in view of the problems with which we are trying to cope, it is a courageous budget.  There is encouragement for industry and AnCO are to get additional money for industrial training.  However, a Government can do only so much. It is for each one of us to play his or her part and to adopt the right attitude at a time like this.  We must not seek more than we should be getting.  If there is this co-operation I have no doubt that within 12 to 18 months there will be an upturn in our economy.  History shows that there always have been upward and downward trends in the economic sector.  The various organisations, farmers, trade unions employers and all others, must co-operate in the efforts to deal with the problem.  In this way we can look forward, under this Government, to a very bright future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened not only to the Minister's speech but to the speeches of many Members on the Government benches and the only impression I get is that there is an air of unreality in all their contributions. It would seem as if somebody has brainwashed Members of the Government into believing that there is no crisis, that there are not these great problems which, we know, are not being dealt with.  Deputy O'Brien asked for a breakdown of the causes of inflation.  He said we should be made aware of how much of this evil is imported and how much is domestic. He mentioned 20 or 30 per cent but would he accept that, approximately 50 per cent of our inflation is imported and that the other 50 per cent has its origins here?  It is to the latter 50 per cent that we should apply ourselves. It would appear that Members in the Government benches either are not aware, or do not want to be aware, of the troubles that exist for us.  We must identify the problem, admit that it exists and then apply ourselves to considering how we will solve it before we have any hope of doing so. Therefore, I say that a Minister who gives a hand-out here and a hand-out there but who decides he will not pay his way this year either is not identifying the problem or applying himself to it.  If an individual acted as irresponsibly as the Minister and handed out cheques that would bounce he would probably be locked up.  But apparently when one does it on a grand scale it is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not pay our way last year. I criticised the Minister then as being a gambler.  Coming from a county where people like to engage in the odd bet, nobody minds a person gambling with something he can afford, or gambling with his own money.  But the Minister is guilty on both counts.  He is not gambling with his own money, he is gambling with the future of the country, gambling with something we cannot afford to gamble with.  The situation this year is even worse than last year and I can see no change in approach whatsoever from the Government. Were anybody to ask me: &ldquo;Where is there a sign of policy in <Col N="1395" /> this Budget?&rdquo; I would reply that there is no policy.  It is a stop-gap Budget. There is no overall or long-term policy being pursued.  Perhaps the Minister prefers not to think of the long-term when he is not paying his way.  Is not it unreal to come in and say: &ldquo;We will give £30 million extra to social welfare; we will give £12 million to the building industry; then, when it is all over, we will owe so much&rdquo;?  One could double or treble those amounts and owe more; what difference would it make?  There is something unreal about the whole situation and it appears that the Government are not paying their way and do not intend to do so.</P>
    <P>We have had three budgets in the term of office of the Government.  The first I would attribute solely to Fianna Fáil, even though the Minister brought it in.  In respect of the second budget, I would say that, like inflation, 50 per cent of it was imported from Fianna Fáil and the remainder would be the direct responsibility of the Government. But we shall allow the Minister full credit for this budget and the economic state of the country this year.  In passing, it might be no harm to mention that Deputy O'Brien said that trends in history have always shown that economic affairs in a country go up and down.  It is probably more than a coincidence that on the three occasions on which our economy went down they coincided with the terms of office of the Coalition Government.  Nobody will deny that when the Government took office the economy was in a healthy state.  Nobody can deny that to our party.  Their immediate economic aims, stated before the election, were to stabilise prices, halve redundancies and reduce unemployment under a programme of planned economic development. The elimination of poverty was also mentioned.  I say that on every one of those points they are proven to be guilty.  Can they see any evidence of how they have succeeded in those matters?  On every one of those five points the situation is worse than when they took up office and it continues to worsen every day.</P>
    <P>Let us deal with prices.  I need hardly <Col N="1396" /> mention that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, who promised to keep down prices, is a sick joke with people as far as prices are concerned.  Then there was mention of halting redundancies.  When they assumed office there were £3 million in the redundancy fund; that is rounding off the figures.  At one stage our economy was going so well we often criticised our Minister for allowing so much money to rest there.  We thought it should be used for some other purpose.  That has now dwindled to a trickle and if there were now £100,000 in the redundancy fund I would be surprised.  So much for what they have done about redundancies. During the term of office of the Fianna Fáil Government the only person likely to become redundant was the clerk in the redundancy office.</P>
    <P>With regard to planned development, put in a simple way, the Government have no money for planning. Yesterday we had the admission here that they could not give amenity grants.  There was not money for that; they had more important things to do with their money.  Then the excuse given by the Minister for Local Government was that those grants were so small they would have an insignificant effect on the recipients.  In Kildare, where we planned in the last few years since those grants became available, I can assure the Minister they would have a great effect.  In my own parish an application was being made by genuine people who hoped to profit this year from a scheme brought in by a Fianna Fáil Government but now, without warning, they find those grants have been withdrawn.  I can see no sign of a planned development there.</P>
    <P>I did make a statement to the effect that during the Fianna Fáil term of office only those who were frightfully unlucky or lazy experienced poverty. That is not so today, poverty does exist.  Perhaps it is not the fault of the Minister but I do not see that he is doing a lot to alleviate it.  Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned to the Minister for Social Welfare that the home assistance scheme was introduced into this country in 1847.  It was a significant year.  I see a <Col N="1397" /> great comparison between the year 1847 and the year 1975 because it was the black 1847 and I think that 1975 will be blacker still.  We have poverty in the midst of plenty, just as we had during the Great Famine.  People who had become used to a good income under the Fianna Fáil Administration &mdash;being sure of their future at that time, as they thought&mdash;entered into commitments with regard to house mortgages and repayments with which they hoped their salaries would keep pace but now find themselves unable to meet those commitments.  Therefore, the Government have been a dismal failure in so far as the points they hoped to implement are concerned.</P>
    <P>The unreality of this budget is apparent because we have not heard the full story.  All the cards have not been presented to us, face up, by the Minister.  There was then the peculiar system of accounting that surfaced yesterday when the report of the Public Accounts Committee was laid before the House and which possibly was the tip of an iceberg only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister laid great stress on the White Paper called &ldquo;A National Partnership&rdquo; and asked people to enter into a national partnership with him.  If I was looking for a partner I think I would look for honesty before ability or liquidity.  I say that the honesty of the partners offering themselves is not very apparent; the liquidity is very doubtful and, of course, the ability was reputed to be there in abundance two years ago but we have not seen many fruits of it in the meantime.  We had in the Labour/Fine Gael Administration 15 all-stars.  I heard a comment recently that many of these all-stars, and so many present Ministers, are very like a lighthouse in the Bog of Allen, very bright but useless.  I feel our final judgment in this world, and in this particular Dáil too, will be based on how we dealt with the material and talents at our disposal.  The Minister is the man responsible for the finances of this country.  I feel he will be judged a failure because he has done badly with the inherited healthy economy of two years ago.  He will make excuses, just as the bad workman will always blame his tools.  The Arabs will be blamed, the EEC teething pains will be blamed, decisions taken in Brussels will be blamed.  But the Minister's job was to overcome those and he has not done so.  Fifty per cent of the blame lies directly at his own doorstep.  This year we are facing a crisis worse than any we have experienced in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give the Minister credit for a very convincing performance here.  His lines were lengthy; I think his speech ran to the tune of 100 minutes.  That is a long time to hold the stage, quite a long monologue.  The good news he <Col N="1399" /> announced was nicely presented and fairly well packaged and the bad news glossed over and concealed.  This performance convinced many of his colleagues. They clapped at the end of his speech, as they did last year when he mentioned the wealth tax on farmers of £100 valuation.  When he made the statement that 10,000 farmers would be brought into the tax net he was congratulated by his Labour colleagues.  The year has proved that this was a sham.  This proved he was an excellent actor, a very convincing performer but hardly the ideal businessman with whom one would like to enter into a national partnership.  Indeed, many actors who have made a great deal of money have not invested their money very wisely.  The acid test of the Government is whether one would like to enter into even a private business partnership with them.</P>
    <P>The budget was presented in a lazy and thoughtless fashion.  I will give two instances.  Cigarettes and pipe tobacco went up by the same amount. Why not a little more on cigarettes and a little less on pipe tobacco?  As it is generally accepted that cigarettes are more harmful than pipe tobacco this could have been done.  Deputy Haughey pointed out on the night of the budget that 50p was put on any bottle of wine, no matter how cheap, and 50p on a bottle of champagne. The injustice of this can be seen straightaway.  He pointed out that this was the lazy way out.  Deputy Haughey also suggested an <i>ad valorem</i> tax.  A little more effort and concern would have been appreciated.  These two instances illustrate the hurried approach which permeates this budget. The idea seems to be to get the money any way but more homework should have been done.</P>
    <P>Unemployment in industry is our biggest worry today.  Rising prices are serious but not enough has been done in the budget to tackle this problem. The Minister warned workers about pay increases.  There is a veiled threat running through the budget here and there to show the maximum restraint.  Apparently the backbenchers <Col N="1400" /> have been told to carry the same message.  What has been done in this budget to encourage investment in industry and to provide jobs for our unemployed? I do not see any move to compel banks or financial institutions to invest.  As I see it, this budget provides £12 million for all industry.</P>
    <P>The building industry has not got the attention it deserves.  We should be anxious to get this industry back on its feet again.  We have our own workers and materials.  The private house building industry especially has been very badly hit.  House loans still stand at £4,500.  Anyone who gives any thought to this problem will realise that these loans should be increased to £6,000.  How does an ordinary person buy a site and build later? How do people hope to bridge the gap between the loan and the actual cost of the house?  Housing grants during the Fianna Fáil time were £325 for a new house&mdash;at a time when £325 meant something&mdash;and these grants are still the same today.  Water and sewerage grants remain at £50 and £25 and have not been increased although a committee is dealing with them.</P>

      <P>These questions have <Col N="1401" /> been on the Order Paper for some time and I hope they will be answered soon.  The Minister should apply his bright mind to the building societies and the mortgage interest rates.  Perhaps he could look at the situation where we have three building societies possibly duplicating their offices and buildings in the same street in the same small town.  The mortgage interest rates on houses were raised recently.  Was that necessary?  I have yet to be convinced it was.</P>
      <P>A good suggestion came from this side of the House&mdash;possibly because it came from this side it was not accepted&mdash;that the Minister should forego income tax charged on incomes from investment in building societies.  This could be used for two purposes: to bring down the interest rate which now stands at 11¼ per cent in most cases, to 9¼ per cent or ideally to 9 per cent, for those who borrowed at 9 per cent, or give more interest to depositors to encourage investment. Could he make some arrangement whereby people who are forced to go to building societies&mdash;because a loan of £4,500 is not enough they must borrow from the building societies&mdash; repay at the same interest rate at which they borrowed, as happens with local authority loans?  Has he made any move to have this changed?</P>
      <P>A man in my constituency told me last week that he built his house in 1971.  He borrowed £3,200 at 9 per cent.  He repaid £1,000 since but finds he has only really paid back £74 of the loan.  He is now being charged interest at 11¼ per cent.  These matters should appeal to the Minister's sense of honesty and I suggest he apply his mind to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is grave danger of loss of jobs and redundancies for 300 people in an industry in Newbridge.  No effort is being made by any member of the Government to help the people or the factory.  The management have produced a plan to prevent redundancies and people being laid off work.  This will have to get the blessing of the Government.  They suggested that workers would be paid for two days, draw social welfare for four days, and give one-and-a-third days free. <Col N="1402" /> This suggestion was turned down by the Department of Social Welfare. They were not prepared to pay the worker for the free day he would give to the factory.  In other words, workers will be paid social welfare to sit at home by the fire but if they show an interest in the firm and are prepared to give their day free, they will not be paid social welfare, for that day.  There is possibly a reason for this.  The Department may be afraid of a fiddle, but desperate situations demand desperate remedies. This problem should be given thought and any suggestions which might save jobs and money should be looked into.</P>
    <P>The directors of this foreign company are prepared to invest £500,000 in this industry.  They are prepared to ride out the storm, cut their prices, send their salesmen to the Continent and sell their yarn at 3p per lb. less than they are now charging.  But they need encouragement to do this.  I am afraid by the end of this month this factory will close down because a rule could not be bent or changed.  To my mind the present Administration are not applying themselves to the task, they are not even identifying it.  They will not admit it is there.</P>
    <P>Inflation is a headache to everybody and one of the reasons for many of our troubles.  It has made our goods less competitive abroad and our pay packets worth less in real money values here.  Nothing was done last year to halt this.  The Government even contributed to it during the year.  They increased postal charges.  Petrol increases were brought in under a subterfuge and it was only reluctantly that a debate was allowed on that.  Increases in Deputies' salaries were given and the next thing the Minister asked people to tighten their belts.</P>
    <P>Nothing has been done this year and now there is talk that the Government have decided to relax price control. This has been hurriedly denied but the impression is there that price control will gradually be relaxed.  Fine Gael came to power on a promise to stabilise prices and the Leader of the Labour Party promised that there was an alternative to rising prices.  That, in essence, is the reason why the present <Col N="1403" /> Government find themselves where they are today&mdash;they made a promise to the people about prices.  They fooled the people and now they should say: &ldquo;We promised to do this, we admit our inadequacy.&rdquo;  That is the least they might say at this stage.  I believe that during the year when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was approached in connection with car insurance not alone did he give the increase that was requested by firms but he even gave them a higher percentage increase.  He reminds me of the servant who knew he had to give an account of his stewardship and said: &ldquo;Take your pen quickly and write down fifty&rdquo;.  While the Lord may have commended him for his cuteness, I do not think that attitude is helpful in the running of a country.</P>
    <P>Plenty has been said here during the week with regard to farming, the frightful situation we now have.  It is remarkable that the members of the IFA who are dyed in the wool supporters of the party the Minister represents are at such loggerheads with the Government and have even blocked the roads as they did in our time.  It amazes me that the wheel should have turned a full circle in such a short time.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention one item with regard to farming and that is the glasshouse industry.  When our leader spoke here he referred to what was being given by the Minister as too little and too late.  No greater example of how little and how late can be given than the glasshouse industry. Some time in December I tabled a question to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries asking him what aids he proposed to give to the glasshouse industry.  I pointed out that December was the time when people should sow their seeds and propagate their plants and that it was unfair of anyone to expect them to sow a seed for which they did not know they would get support or whether they would have oil to bring it to maturity and to market the crop.  The Minister at that time said he would not say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or he would not say &ldquo;No&rdquo;. He said one could say those things if <Col N="1404" /> one had the money.  The announcement in the budget was of a 2p per gallon subsidy.  This is no way to carry on any industry or no way for anyone to run their budget.</P>
    <P>There is no planned policy here and it proves to me that it is just a stop gap arrangement, that the Cabinet responsibility we hear about is now a collective irresponsibility.  It possibly illustrates too the internal tug-of-war that must go on all the time in any Coalition Government between the party of great wealth on the one hand and the so-called party of the worker on the other.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance found it necessary to visit Cork recently and announced there that there was no split in the Cabinet. Such statements are usually made by film stars who say there is no split in their marriage and it is usually followed shortly afterwards by divorce. Will the subsidy of 2p give those people an equal chance with the Dutch and the French?  Does the Minister realise that our growers in the glasshouse industry are being placed at a disadvantage and that they will have to market their produce with people who are getting higher subsidies and greater incentives and whose Ministers for Agriculture have purse strings open to them that allows them to plan for a year in advance, something that is denied to our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries?  Is it not time we woke up and saw that we are not giving those people a fair crack of the whip?</P>
    <P>Much of the glamour has now begun to pall as far as the present Administration are concerned.  I see everywhere indications that the media that were very favourable towards them are not so favourable now.  Some papers though still persist in printing peculiar things.  On <i>The Sunday Independent</i> of the Sunday after the budget there was a big heading to the effect that disabled drivers were getting a better deal, that they were getting 14½ more back in tax than they ever got before.  When this petrol tax was first introduced and there was a debate on it early in December I mentioned that disabled drivers would <Col N="1405" /> now have to pay this extra tax and that there was no provision made to return it to them.  There was no mention of this by the Minister when he introduced the tax.  He probably did not think of it and the fact that this 14½p extra is now being paid to the disabled is not because the social conscience of the National Coalition has suddenly been awakened.  That is extra taxation that was imposed last December and the mistake has now been rectified.  That is nothing for the National Coalition Government or <i>The Sunday Independent</i> to glory in.</P>
    <P>The petrol price increase last December&mdash;an increase of £13 million I would presume in a year and that would be conservative&mdash;was a provisional budget before the official budget. I suggested on that occasion that the Minister would have done better if he had looked at drink and cigarettes as a source of tax rather than add the extra 15p per gallon to petrol.  I suggested that any increase in the price of petrol or oil would percolate down to industry and would have the effect of raising our eventual costs in every way and that it would have been better even in last year's budget that the increases should have been imposed on drink and cigarettes rather than petrol, that our thoughts should have been channelled towards anything that would keep down the price of petrol, not for those who are joy-riding as many people seem to think but for those who find it necessary to use petrol every day to get to work and those who are in businesses that mean a lot of driving.  The consequent increases will have to be passed on to the consumer.  The Minister has decided now to increase the price of drink and petrol and now we have the worst of both worlds.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer the Minister to an income tax anomaly that should be cleared up.  I believe he will have got a submission from the Association of Chartered Accountants regarding the registration of subcontractors.  It is now very difficult if not impossible to be registered as a subcontractor.  I can see the reason for this.  The Minister is anxious that those who were <Col N="1406" />&ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; before and managed to evade the tax net will now be brought into that net.  No matter what genuine case is brought forward by a tradesman or somebody in the building trade he will be told he has no established place of business or some other excuse and that he will not be registered as a subcontractor.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing is that this decision by the tax people is not subject to any appeal.  In any other walk of life nobody is so dictatorial that he can tell you something is right and that there can be no more discussion on it. Even the Minister for Education has relented somewhat on his proposals and they are now the subject of discussion. It appears that certain inspectors can decide that a subcontractor cannot be registered and that is that.  It is time to change that. Surely an appeal would give genuine cases registration?  As of now I am informed anyone who applies for registration as a subcontractor gets a blanket refusal.  People such as plasterers are told that they have no established place of business.</P>
    <P>They are asked where they keep their sand and gravel.  It is a well-known fact that they keep their sand, gravel and ladders on the site.  Even people with a yard, billheads, a phone and a place of business are being turned down.  This is having a bad effect all over the country where small contractors are being asked to come home, establish a contracting business and build small groups of houses or isolated cottages.  They now find they must pay 35p in every £.  I am informed that in County Mayo where the building system is geared towards this work many schemes had to be scrapped because those who came back to establish contracting businesses here found the taxation people were taking one out of every three houses and they were not getting paid for them unless they went to great trouble to prove their <i>bona fides.</i> The Minister should look into that.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the increase in social welfare benefits but I do not see any great increase in real value. An increase of 35 per cent in those <Col N="1407" /> benefits is needed to give the people who receive them the same purchasing power they had two years ago.  If inflation is up 20 per cent on last year and if that is followed by a 20 per cent increase this year this means that prices will increase in two years by 40 per cent.  I am only making a guess at the inflationary increase we are likely to have but we hope it will be no higher while the Government are in office.  The price of the ordinary necessities of life, such as bread, butter, milk, tea and sugar has been increased very frequently during the last year.  The old age pensioners are very hard hit by those increases.</P>
    <P>I have no objection whatever to increasing widows' and old age pensions but I am a bit worried about other social welfare increases.  Can we afford this?  Who will pay for it all? How much will the stamp cost?  We got no answer to this.  On the day the budget was introduced the Minister sat for a long time without answering this question asked by Deputy Joe Dowling.  It amazes me that a man who spoke for 100 minutes when he introduced the budget could not afford ten seconds to answer that question.  It reminds me of some lines from a poem by Father O'Brien, &ldquo;Tang-ma-lang-a-loo&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>But glum and dumb and undismayed through every bout he sat. He seemed to think that he was there but was not sure of that.</P>
    <P>I again ask the Minister what the price of a social welfare stamp will be this year.</P>
    <P>Last year I said he should beware of the day when it becomes too easy to remain idle and not to work in this country.  Some of the Minister's proposals are bringing that day nearer and nearer.  I spoke to a lady in Naas the morning after the budget who said: &ldquo;When you go up there tell the Minister to keep his penny a day because that is all he gave in increased children's allowances.  His proposals will have the effect of turning this country into a nation of idlers and the employer will be forced to pay for it all&rdquo;.  This is the everyday reaction to the budget.  Does the <Col N="1408" /> Minister not see the danger in the policy he is pursuing where there will be more of an incentive to people to stay at home and draw the dole rather than work?  What answer would the Minister have given to that lady in Naas?</P>
    <P>Many of the proposals in the budget are an effort to live up to the promises that were made before the election. They have since found them to be rash promises but the Government realise that, having broken faith with the people on so many of their promises, it is essential they keep some of them.  I feel the discussion which went on with the Cabinet before the budget was announced resulted in a decision that no matter how bad the economy was they had to bring down the qualifying age for the old age pension each year and if God spares them for another year, no matter how bad the economy is, they will have to bring it down another year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government promised us 25,000 houses last year. He pumped a huge amount of money into this.  This decision was taken as a face-saving operation no matter what it cost the country.  Statistics have shown there was a reversal last year in the amount of money available from building societies for building and the money available to local authority housing.  That probably explains why those engaged in private sector building now find themselves idle and all those involved in the ancillary trades are also idle.  The work on local authority houses went ahead and the target was reached.</P>
    <P>From April, 1973 to December, 1973 building societies approved of loans of £25 million and the local authorities during the same period approved of loans amounting to £31 million.  Only £13 million of that £31 million was paid out up to the end of 1973.  This means the other £18 million had to be found the following year.  There is a danger that the Government, in an effort to keep their promises, are likely to do more harm than good.  That is a sign of a weak Government who are not prepared to take decisions that might be for the good of the country but might be unpopular.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> I should like to deal with the betting tax proposals.  It has been suggested that this new tax, which is much higher than the English tax, will have the effect of sending money from this country to England and Scotland and illegal betting will mushroom.  Does the Minister feel that the increased tax of 10p in the pound on on course betting will cut down attendance at races?  Will the increase of 20p in the pound on off-course betting send people racing?  Those who wish to have a bet of £5 will now have to add 50p on for the Minister.  If the horse wins, he will get the odds on his 50p and if it loses he will still get his 50p.  The Government do not appreciate what the racing industry means.  The Minister should consult with the Taoiseach, although I realise that sometimes the thoughts of the Taoiseach do not find their way to the other members of his party as was seen here on one occasion.</P>
    <P>I would ask him not to look askance at racing.  Racing is not the preserve of the rich.  It is a big industry employing many, and one that is helping to keep our name high in the world, in the sale ring, on the racecourse, in the jumping arena and elsewhere.  It is also a big help towards our balance of payments.  I would advise the Government that if they cannot see their way to help racing at least they should not hinder it.  This is one industry which gets no grants or aids comparable to its size.  It would be happy to pay its way and work out its own destiny provided it was allowed to do so.  The Minister should realise that owners cannot stay in racing unless the prize money is increased in line with their costs.  If the amount of money the leading owners won is added up and if account is taken of the strings of horses they have and the cost of keeping those in training, together with the investment they have made in the industry it will possibly be found that they are out of pocket.</P>
    <P>I would quote France as an example of a healthy racing industry.  Here, all betting taxes are channelled back into racing.  There are no bookies I am told, but it is debatable whether <Col N="1410" /> that is a good thing or not.  I suppose the Minister often debates whether it would be better if there were no bookies on his own side of the House.  I have experience of going racing in Malmo in Sweden where there were no bookies, and while it was enjoyable enough, it did lack the atmosphere created by bookies, and I would not like it as much as the Curragh, Naas or Punchestown.</P>
    <P>I think the future of racing here depends on a State-controlled tote with a high percentage of tax being channelled back into racing.  On no account should this be used as further revenue for the Exchequer.  Something needs to be done even if it leads to the eventual phasing out of the bookies. May be that is the wrong approach, but the future of racing to me is important, and I do not see the Minister's tax proposals having any helpful effect.  The Minister's mention of wealth tax proposals last year frightened millions of pounds out of this country in a few weeks.  I have information that that happened.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of this Government is typified in a statement by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, in his book <i>The States of Ireland.</i> He devoted one particular page to Deputy Charles Haughey.  In an attempt to belittle Deputy Haughey, he says: &ldquo;He lives in an 18th century fashion in which horses play a conspicuous part&rdquo;.  That was an attempt to downgrade Deputy Haughey and indicate that anyone who lived in an atmosphere where horses played a conspicuous part was not quite a nice person to know.  The Taoiseach should know better than this.  He has an interest in racing and in hunting.  However, it appears the Taoiseach does not always impress his <Col N="1411" /> will on the Cabinet, although he did succeed in muzzling some for a time, and I must compliment him on that, in that they did not offer any more solutions on the Northern Ireland situation.</P>
    <P>I live in a constituency where horses play a conspicuous part, and I was born into a family where horses provided the bread and butter for our table.  There are hundreds of families like this in Kildare and the surrounding areas that are engaged in racing, on stud farms, and so on.  It is one industry that continues to hold its head above water.  The indications are that increased costs will make it more difficult for owners to stay in the racing business.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to clear up a misunderstanding that many members of the public have.  On-course betting tax goes into the Exchequer.  None of it finds its way back into racing.  Eventually the increased on-course betting will go to the Racing Board who will then be in a position to increase stakes.  There is much misinformed opinion concerning horse racing.  Mr. Wigmore in <i>The Sunday Independent</i> was very critical of this increased tax on racing.  He said he did not bother much with racing, and I think it would be better for Mr. Wigmore to study the facts before he rushes into print.</P>
    <P>In my constituency racing gives substantial employment for stable lads, jockeys, stud farm workers, farriers, saddlers and racecourse workers.  Others are employed indirectly in supplying farm produce. People supply the stud farms with hay, oats, straw and so on.  The industry does attract wealthy people to invest in it and this is something we should welcome rather than repel.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that this budget does not take account of the existing situation in the country.  There is no financial provision towards resolving the troubles in agriculture, troubles in regard to cattle prices, the fact that thousands of pounds that should be finding their way into the farmers' pockets are stopped halfway by the middle man.  Furthermore, farmers <Col N="1412" /> are faced with the dual penalty of paying tax and rates.  This is the reason why there is a dispute with the IFA and a critical situation in which our sugar and beet industry is in danger of being toppled overnight. What is being done about that?  There are 100,000 people out of work, and there is unrest in every area.  We can point to failures in the Department of every Minister over there.  The necessary moves have not been made &mdash;maybe the intention is not there&mdash; to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The Government should feel responsible for the sense of despondency and depression that is everywhere. There is no money or work in the country.  There is no confidence in the Government.  The National Coalition Government may have the numbers over there to defeat a no confidence motion in this House, but the state of the country and the feelings of the people indicate no confidence in the Minister who brought in this budget and no confidence in the mute leader who is not providing the leadership needed in a time of crisis.  There is no confidence in the parties that make up this Coalition Government. They conned their way to power. They promised the people policies they did not implement and the longer they stay in office the worse the situation will be.  The electorate are only waiting for a chance to pass judgement on them.  They will be judged as the greatest failures in Government the country ever had the misfortune to experience.</P>
    <P>Surely it is necessary to show some signs of planning, but apparently the Government have decided to play it by ear and wait for what happens. Do they believe it is realistic to keep on borrowing, to budget for a deficit? Is it not very dangerous?  In the present situation will it not lead to the bankruptcy of the country?  We must all pay our way sometime. Perhaps we sometimes may relax for a while and spend beyond our means. When will the sometime end as far as this Government are concerned?</P>
    <P>I always listened to Deputy Tom O'Higgins leading off for the Opposition on budget day.  He would invariably <Col N="1413" /> find an opportunity for referring to this country as a &ldquo;banana republic&rdquo;.  With the Minister's attitude of not paying his way today and waiting until tomorrow we are now coming nearer to being a &ldquo;mañana republic&rdquo;.  The Minister is Minister for Mañana; he will not do it today. He has neither the will for nor the intention of doing it today but, maybe, he will do it tomorrow.  The sands of time are running out.</P>
    <P>With regard to inflation, is there any hope of curbing it?  Was any attempt made in 1973 and 1974 to curb inflation?  We saw no such attempt.  Is there any hope of curbing inflation in 1975?  The response of the Government is to throw up their hands and say that, in an intricate situation like this with so many complex matters affecting the economy, it is difficult to make plans.  That statement was made on those benches over there by a Minister.  Surely, the more difficult and complex a situation is the greater the necessity to plan for the future.  But there is no plan at all and, as far as I can see, inflation will run unabated and uncontrolled.</P>
    <P>Our spokesmen pointed out different ways and means of curbing inflation.  I think the Government are too proud to take advice.  Deputy Barrett dealt with the situation with regard to the importation of petrol and oil.  He said we could go into the market ourselves and buy the petrol and oil in the open market, charter our own boats to bring it in and save £20 million a year.  That advice is ignored.  It is not worthy of the Minister's attention.  The Minister should remember that all the brains do not repose on those benches over there and no one would think any the less of the Minister if he took a leaf or two out of our book when helpful and hopeful suggestions are made.  No one would think badly of the Minister if he accepted those suggestions.</P>
    <P>Níl ag eirí go ró-olc le hAire na Gaeltachta.  B'fhéidir gur cóir don Aire Airgeadais sampla Aire na Gaeltachta a leanúint.  Tá mé cinnte go gcaithimíd a chur ina luí ar an Aire go mbíonn dea-chomhairle le fáil aige <Col N="1414" /> uaireanta ó na binsí seo agus is trua nach nglacann sé leis an gcomhairle sin fé mar ghlac Aire na Gaeltachta leis an bpolasaí a bhí ag Fianna Fáil don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>What have we to say for the future of the country as a result of this budget?  There is nothing in it designed to solve unemployment.  Unemployment should arouse a sense of urgency in the Minister.  The crisis is a major one and it is getting worse. Within the next week or two 300 more people will be added to the growing list of unemployed in the town of Newbridge.  We have offered a solution to the Minister dependent on a change in social welfare regulations. People who are unemployed could be brought back into this industry and it would not cost the Government a penny more.  The important thing is it would enable the industry to continue in operation.  Keeping the work force together, selling the wares produced at competitive prices on the Continent could result in a few months' time, when the indications are that markets will improve, in a viable industry, which cost a great deal, and encourage into the country another £500,000.  This is something to which the Minister should apply himself immediately.</P>
    <P>Does he realise how grave the unemployment situation is?  Does he realise it is getting worse?  Has that fact percolated through the Government benches at all?  The Deputies over there clapped the Minister when he finished his budget speech, but there was no indication that either the Minister or his colleagues realised the appalling situation that exists, a situation demanding urgent action from the Minister and the Government now.  I believe the Minister is sitting back waiting for something to happen. The present Government are not initiators.  They are a Government of reactors.  I would like to see some concrete proposals from the Minister demonstrating that he has an idea of the problems that beset us and that he is applying himself to the solution of these problems.

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on what I consider a good budget, remembering that one might have expected a fairly tough budget because of problems, many of which are outside our control. Anyone who reads the world Press must accept that.  There is a falling off in consumer demand here and in the United Kingdom.  There are global economic problems as a result of the oil crisis.  Britain is on the verge of collapse.  The White Paper, &ldquo;A National Partnership,&rdquo; emphasises the necessity for maintaining employment and creating new industry, keeping wages in line with the cost of living and increasing grants to bodies like the IDA and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  However, I believe that some short-term protection must be given to our younger and more viable industries in the light of our EEC membership and the limitations that exist.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Buy Irish campaign. That was initiated before Christmas. We have here a golden opportunity really to show our true mettle.  The first duty of every Irishman and woman is to support Irish products.  I am appalled when I see good products and shoddy products imported from abroad.  Of course, there are also exclusive products coming in.  There might be an excuse for the less well-off buying a second rate article but I see no excuse for those better circumstanced in life buying what they regard as more sophisticated articles merely because they are manufactured in Britain, Italy or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not enough emphasis is placed on the Buy Irish campaign.  Many of our unemployment problems could be solved if we all got down to it seriously. We all join in patriotic songs, and so on, but patriotism would show itself in a factual way if everybody got down to buying the home products.  I am directly involved in two small food enterprises.  One is a co-op and the other is a food processing factory. There is fantastic employment in that town but there are foreign products in the shops selling in competition with the products being manufactured <Col N="1416" /> in the town.  We do the packaging for some of our products and I know they are infinitely superior to the foreign products.  We must get the message across.  Why should people buy Danish cheese, even Danish blue cheese, when the Mitchelstown products and the Ballyclough products are infinitely superior to any overseas product?  If we succeeded in getting that message across many of our economic problems would be solved.</P>
    <P>We have a great market here by virtue of our growing population, but we are not cashing in on it.  It is the foreigner who is gaining from this increased market, and that is a great tragedy.  We cannot expect to have the best of both worlds.  We cannot have increased employment and a cheap product.  Our industries must face up to sharply rising production costs. There is a down-turn in domestic demand due to inflation, and there is a reduction in agricultual incomes.  There is a falling off in our export markets. We will have to fight harder for European markets.  We will have to go further and further into Europe to get the markets we are losing because of the economic crisis in the UK.  Industry must now face continuing pressure in a free-for-all situation for exports from abroad.  All is not gloom.  We hear a lot of doomsday talk from the Opposition. I suppose if we were over there we would be saying the same thing.</P>

      <P>Every effort should be made to get going with this industry. It is in its initial stages now but it should help to ease our energy supply position as well as providing material for our fertiliser and nitrogenous factories.  One of these industries is being provided in the harbour area.  It is imperative that we should get a move on in getting this gas piped <Col N="1417" /> in to Whitegate and in availing of this bonanza which is so necessary at the moment.  The unusual interest being shown by the multi-national oil corporations in our offshore developments is not merely an academic interest.  It proves to me that we have valuable reserves of oil and gas.  There is no doubt about that.  Whatever the cost, we should get on with the job and get them piped into our shores.</P>

We must ensure that in handling these resources our aim is to produce the maximum benefit for the country in as short a time as possible.  There is an urgent and pressing need to get on with this job of piping the gas which is so necessary for our fertiliser industry.

      <P>Many of the benefits by way of job opportunities will escape us if we do not take immediate steps to train our young people for jobs in the petro-chemical industry. One such industry has begun in my own area.  At a recent meeting people in that area were worried because very little preparation is being made by way of vocational education for the people.  They are afraid that, when this industry is in production, it will be taken over by foreigners and that, instead of giving employment to local people, all the cream jobs and all the technological jobs will be taken over by people from outside the country. Now is the time to prepare our people to play their part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very local and parochial about this.  The people in places like Whitegate and Midleton should get priority in the industry.  All the slack <Col N="1418" /> should be taken up there first.  Because of transport costs, and so on, it is only right that there should be some sort of strategy and order.  People from Youghal are going to Cork city and people from Cork city are going to Youghal.  I do not know whether this is a job for the Department of Labour or the trade unions but I should like to see some order provided.  Education would help.  If the vocational schools were geared to preparing our young people to play their part in this industry, they would be doing a great job.</P>
    <P>The budget provisions for social welfare are to be commended.  A serious effort is being made to bridge the inflation gap.  We have a duty to look after the old, the underprivileged and the handicapped, and we are doing just that.  I should like to raise one small point with regard to the free electricity scheme.  The provision about old people living alone is giving most rural Deputies a lot of headaches. I do not agree with that clause.</P>

      <P>I agree but when you hear me out I think you will agree that it is important that something should be done about it quickly.  It costs a great deal to find out whether or not they are living alone.  It would be much cheaper and much better if they all got it.  It would give old people a standing in their homes.  It would give them a feeling of being wanted.  As it were, they would be contributing towards the budget of the household.  It would not cost any more than it costs to administer the scheme at the moment if we gave this small concession to old people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to abuses with regard to the dole.  Despite these abuses, the dole is very necessary.  Perhaps with a little bit of diligence all round, many of these abuses could be eliminated. We who serve in county councils hear a good deal of cribbing <Col N="1419" /> about hedgerows meeting and about not having equipment to trim hedges. We know how expensive this equipment is.  I believe that all able-bodied men on the dole should be offered this type of employment which would be good for their health and would assist in making the countryside more beautiful.  It would probably mean less money would have to be found for the dole because undoubtedly there are people drawing dole and doing &ldquo;foxers&rdquo; also.  If they were employed by local authorities in rural areas it would not appear so wasteful. The same applies in our towns and cities.  Some streets are quite filthy and some towns have derelict sites. These people could be usefully employed by local authorities.  They could be paid good wages and at least they would earn them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increased investment in housing of £100 million, 30 per cent up.  That alone proves we are serious about our housing programme and that employment is maintained in the construction industry.  I hope there will be further relaxation of the rather stringent regulations imposed on rural development for people wishing to build their own houses.  If young people have the initiative and courage to borrow money to build their own home in a certain place, frequently on a site donated by a relative, every facility should be given to them.  The cost of a site is a big factor in the cost of a house.  I could see no justification for refusing permission in any case I met.  You can make excuses and you can concoct adequate technical reasons why permission should not be given but it really boils down to little or nothing. All the talk about national primary roads is bunkum.  Eventually the person must come out on the primary road wherever he builds and the fact that he builds on or near a primary road should not really matter.  This restriction has been going on for quite a number of years but since we came into power there has been considerable relaxation and I hope there will be still more.  Much of the problem is down the line rather than at Ministerial level.</P>

These young people are not competent to assess the viability of a builder or the man who undertakes to lay out and build a number of houses.

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries for his work on behalf of the Irish farming community.  His latest achievement regarding the hill scheme is most welcome.  It does not affect my constituency very much but it will be of great benefit to the areas where it will be implemented.  I also compliment him on the continuation of the seed voucher scheme.  This might seem small but recipients to whom I have spoken welcomed it very much.  We cannot overestimate the problems and difficulties of the Minister especially when trying to secure something over and above what is our entitlement under the Treaty of Rome.  The people in Brussels are tough and commercially-minded business people and the fact that we have problems here does not really register with them.  As a nation we are so dependent on exports, especially agricultural exports, for survival that we are very vulnerable in the present inflationary situation especially when our best customer is herself in extreme difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the regional fund we have a tangible way of making real contact with our people in the North.  The regional fund and the hill and under-priviledged <Col N="1421" /> areas scheme both lend themselves to this type of co-operation and I hope we will make full use of it.</P>
    <P>I am still very optimistic that a solution will be found to the impasse in the sugar beet situation.  Much of the problem is rooted in the operation of the intervention scheme.  It was the small man who produced the cattle and much of the money did not end up in his pocket but went into the pocket of the meat processors.  A solution must be found to this problem. If we are to have a successful cattle trade this scheme must be made work.  Everybody agrees that when a new system of taxation is imposed it is bound to be full of anomalies but with goodwill on all sides a fair system or systems will evolve.  Some farmers may prefer the 40 multiple and I think the option should be given to them.  It is very important that the present rumpus be sorted out quickly since, through our Minister's efforts we have secured a substantial improvement in our sugar quota and every day is important if we are to succeed in getting the extra sugar grown.</P>
    <P>Much depends on this industry which employs many people and it is very important to the nation.  I was directly involved in the industry for a few years and I was rather surprised when I learned the facts and figures regarding employment in it.  In the towns where these factories are built they can contribute very significantly to the economy.  Out of the beet industry grew what I consider&mdash;especially looking to the future&mdash;to be a still more valuable industry, Erin Foods.  Both industries are linked.</P>

In my view there is a big question mark about the future of some of these tillage crops and I would like to have more reassurance about them.  The EEC must realise that it is in everybody's interest to keep this balance.  To protect private enterprise we must not be seen to be killing off the initiative of men who are prepared to put a bit of effort into a small private enterprise, whether they buy a lorry or start a small business.

      <P>The Deputy should allow me to speak.  In spite of the fact that as an island we have difficult problems in getting our produce to the market place.  I believe that as a result of the budget ample opportunity will be given to all sectors to help them take their place and compete in the market places.  That is what counts in the final analysis. Nobody will disagree with the fact that everything has to be paid for, that the health service and other services must be paid for out of the national cake.  The Minister is endeavouring to create a bigger national cake and we have a golden opportunity now of doing this.  We are a comparatively young nation in the market place.  Our industries, built up over the years, ran into temporary difficulties and some ran into irrevocable difficulties but broadly speaking we will have to look more carefully at the type of industry that comes to this country to ensure that it will not need continual propping up.  Propping up is not on in a free enterprise situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now reached the situation where we have a choice of industries. We can afford to pick and choose and we should select the industries most likely to succeed.  I am more familiar with industries based on agriculture and despite all the talk about minerals the real wealth of this nation will always be the wealth from agricultural produce.  I am happy that this industry is moving ahead, that our dairy and meat products are capable of taking their place with the <Col N="1425" /> best in Europe.  I was proud to see some of our processed food products commanding the highest prices on the European market.  This is credit due to our industrialists.  We have nothing to fear while we have these people in control of our marketing and processing. I am not at all pessimistic about the future.  It stands to reason when one looks at the situation in Britain, with their three-day week and so on.  I have been over there and I have been told about their problems, their farming problems and others. When one sees a mighty empire like Britain experiencing such problems there is no doubt that times are difficult.  We are bound to feel the effect here and we have got to tighten our belts but perhaps that is a very good thing too.  There is no use living in a false world, and perhaps there was a certain amount of falsehood in the world in which we were living.</P>

      <P>The British budget was infinitely worse and Deputies know that.  Anyway, I am quite confident of the future, confident in the ability of our people to produce the goods.  That is the message that should go out from this budget. This is the type of budget that should encourage everybody to produce more. I think it is a budget that will set the economy right.  It is one which takes care of the old, the needy and the disabled which, indeed, it is one of the first duties of a civilised community to do whatever may be the cost involved and whoever may have to suffer.  It should be done and must be done and we make no apologies for so doing.  The only pity is that we could not do a little more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred briefly to education. Here we are on the right lines, progressing more and more and spending more money in the technological areas, which is necessary and desirable. With regard to agriculture generally, our Minister is doing a fantastic job with the resources at his disposal.  I should like to see the farm modernisation scheme continue to progress.  The benefits from it will be forthcoming in the very near future. <Col N="1426" /> In the Department of Lands the new farm retirement scheme is meeting with great success.  Indeed, with the additional capital at the Minister's disposal he will be able to do something for which I have wished for many a long year and that is that the Land Commission will be able to pay for land with money and not with pieces of paper, virtually useless in most cases, especially to old people who needed the money.  I am particularly pleased to note that, under the new farm retirement scheme, not only will people selling their land be entitled to money but they will be entitled to keep their homes also, something they have always dearly wished to do, and retain a little field adjoining their homes.  This was indeed a humane approach and something we have not experienced so far.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister for Industry and Commerce on what he is doing with the resources available to him, with particular emphasis on the Industrial Development Authority.  I have always found them very considerate in any of the approaches I have made to them and I compliment them on spending their money wisely.  Indeed, I could progress right across the board.  Some flippant remarks have been made about our Ministers.  I should like to take this opportunity of complimenting them individually and collectively. They are doing a good job and devoting all of their talents to their Ministries.  They deserve any small compliment a backbencher can give them.</P>

I realise only too well why he kept away from the subject of the budget, why he had to be reprimanded by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle so many times to keep to the terms of the budget.  He knew and was honest enough to admit to this House that the only thing good about this budget was that it was better than the British one.  At any stage he did not show insincerity.  He kept away from specific points.  He even ignored the improvements in the budget and <Col N="1427" /> covered what would normally be covered in an Estimate debate in this House.  His contribution was the final indictment of the failure of the Minister for Finance to produce anything like the budget needed by our economy.</P>
      <P>In my first contribution to a budget debate, in 1973, I said then that the Utopia that had been offered in February, by April or May had in fact become the &ldquo;Ryan-land&rdquo; of reality. However, I did not realise then the harsh reality it would become two years later, or in fact less than that. At present, when we have organised chaos in every one of the important sectors of our economy, with absolutely no concept of the problems by the Government, no concern being expressed for the welfare of the people, it is significant that budget day in this House has become a great window-dressing performance, well stage-managed, irrelevant.  In fact, we shall soon hear the trumpets blaring to announce the entry of the Minister for Finance with his bag and all it holds.</P>

      <P>Anyway, a rather significant paragraph.  This typifies the feeling of the ordinary people about the performance of the Minister for Finance.  The plight of the ordinary people is no longer of interest to him. All he is interested in, as is quoted there, is how to get the maximum publicity by magnifying the little benefits given on budget day and playing down the tax impositions being levied daily.  This game of bluff is becoming increasingly revolting to our honest, decent people.  A budget day in the past, as we knew it, or as the people expected it, was a day on which extra tax impositions were levied, extra concessions given.  On the one or two occasions on which Fianna Fáil Governments brought in mini-budgets in the autumn, the hue and cry of the present holders of office knew no bounds.  The publicity, the allegations of dishonesty that came from these benches at that time can be looked at retrospectively.</P>
      <P>If we look at the performance of the past two years, we see that not alone now is there one budget a year, not alone is there a possibility of a mini-budget occasionally, but from having a budget a month, we have progressed to having one almost every day.  Since the period immediately preceding Christmas there have been numerous tax impositions, the main one being that on petrol.  There was also the huge increase in post and telegraph charges, the removal of the butter subsidy and the increase in health charges.  A few days after the budget another round of price increases was announced.  The vast majority of the commodities involved in that increase carried increased VAT.  On the Sunday following the budget the Minister for Finance announced during a radio interview that we could expect another budget in the autumn.</P>

      <P>The cost of meat is prohibitive and sausages are now becoming a luxury.  Regardless of what world inflation there may be, the performance of this Government has led to much increased poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three prime problem areas of our economy at present and <Col N="1430" /> none of these has been given worthwhile consideration by the Minister in his budget.  These three areas are, first, the 100,000 unemployed, secondly, the situation in agriculture&mdash; this industry is in chaos; the small and averaged sized farmer is experiencing problems of a kind never experienced since before the war years &mdash;and, thirdly, the area of rising prices in respect of which there seems to be a total lack of control.  What has the Minister done to improve the situation in any one of these areas? He has given a mere pittance towards industry.  Can he guarantee that the move he made in this regard in the budget will result in saving as many as 10 jobs?  I do not believe it will save any jobs.  What effort has the Minister made to help those firms that have been experiencing difficulties? Many old and long-established firms have either gone out of business or have had to go on short time production because of the various difficulties they encountered.  They should have been assisted through this valley period.</P>
    <P>We must look, too, at the performance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Deputy Hegarty, among others, has referred to the Buy Irish campaign.  All my life I have been a firm believer in a policy of buying the home produced goods.  I have carried this belief to extremes on many occasions.  It has always been my contention that the Government of the day should support such a policy not only at times like this but at all times.  Somebody said that the campaign introduced before Christmas was doing too little, too late. That is very true.  The campaign should have been introduced early last spring when there were the first signs of a downturn in the textile and footwear industries.  Instead, we allowed a flood of goods to come from such places as Korea, Hong Kong and Portugal.  An example of the result of this has been the necessity for a very old established textile industry in Blarney to go on short time. Married women worked in that concern in order to earn some extra money to help towards running their <Col N="1431" /> homes.  There is no such opportunity for these people now.  Neither are there any prospects for the 45 to 50 year old man who has become redundant. My point is that these closures could have been avoided if those Third World countries had not been allowed dump their textile and footwear products here.  In shops one finds often transistor radios that were made in say, Korea or socks that were made in Hong Kong.  Is it not a disgrace that a Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce should have allowed this development?  The Minister made no move to deal with the situation until the months of November and December and this was done after extreme pressure had been brought to bear on him from this side of the House.  The steps he took then should have been taken in April of last year.  Indeed, nothing has happened yet and I am informed that even if tariffs were to be imposed tomorrow it would take a long time for those industries to be revitalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in agriculture is very serious for the small and medium-sized farmers.  I am disappointed that greater protection and benefits were not given in the budget to help these people. Deputy Hegarty spelled out clearly what he had hoped for in relation to this, our prime industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied regarding the farm modernisation scheme.  I hope all the people who voted last night with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries are happy that this scheme as it stands and the directives governing it, will be of benefit to Irish <Col N="1432" /> farmers.  In the short-term I cannot see them being of benefit in their present form.</P>
    <P>What do we do about rising prices? Taxation on all articles, except essential foodstuffs, is easier to impose to-day because of VAT.  Every increase on commodities, except foodstuffs, carries an increase in taxation.  You said earlier, Sir, that we would have the opportunity of mentioning the petrol price increase when we spoke on the budget.  The reasons given for the £27,500,000 were irresponsible, deceitful and insincere.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that as well as I.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I was not following the Deputy's train of thought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the reasons given by the Minister for Finance for the petrol price increases.  The Minister for Local Government said yesterday that the Government had no money.  He made this statement when he admitted he could not give a paltry figure to help amenity grants.  This is why the petrol tax imposition was made.  What has happened?  What is the result?  Again, this affects the employment situation. There has been short-time working in the motor and other industries. That is the reality and the situation is getting more serious by the week.</P>
      <P>I have been associated with the building industry for many years.  It has always been a barometer in the economic climate of the country.  The Minister for Local Government in this debate went to great pains to explain the details of the extra moneys allocated to housing&mdash;reasons which are hard to understand&mdash;and for the non-increase of SDA loans.  It might be worth mentioning that following closely on the heels of the Minister's announcement we had a Press release from the Construction Industry Federation, a body equally involved, responsible for and representative of the building sector here. They have taken the Minister to task and pointed out incorrect figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a genuine, strong Opposition with a good record in Government, we must <Col N="1433" /> be conscious of this and concerned for the welfare of our people.  When the figure given by the Minister for the number of houses built are questioned by a responsible body it must be a cause for concern.  People will eventually ask what kind of con-men are there in office today?  In the Press release they commented on the brick-making industry.</P>
    <P>I represent an area along the Lee Valley and the Bride Valley where much of the bricks, sand, gravel and blocks, which have gone to building the suburbs of Cork city and the other satellite cities were produced.  I know the employment situation and what has happened there in the past 12 months.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Creed say in this House that there was no problem in the building industry.  I will take him on a tour through his own constituency and into the building sites where once we had 65 to 70 men working and now we have 16 to 21.  I will take him to the builders' suppliers and providers and ask how many hours overtime they have this year as against this time two years ago.  I will shock him back to the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the Government Deputies&mdash;and I blame them&mdash;have not impressed on the Minister for Finance the present state of the country because I understand he is not aware of it. He is an intelligent man and despite the face he might put on the situation, I would not expect him deliberately to tell the people that he was happy with the situation that exists.</P>
    <P>The standard of living which these people enjoyed through the sound Fianna Fáil governing of the economy has been lost since the Government took office in 1973.  The live register for mid-November, 1974, showed that the number of unemployed building workers had increased by 3,009 compared with mid-November, 1973, despite the comments of the Minister in this House.</P>
    <P>The SDA loans could and should of necessity be rectified.  As weeks go by young married couples come to Deputies and say that their houses will cost £6,500.  They can get a loan of <Col N="1434" /> £4,500 but where will they get the rest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, I want to refer to a few points raised earlier, especially to the increase in taxation on beer, spirits and tobacco.  Think of the past.  Think of the revolution which nearly took place in this House and on the streets when we put 1d. on the pint.  What is it now? The continued imposition of substantial increases on tobacco and cigarettes could cause unemployment in vital sectors of our economy.  I am not promoting the sale of drink or tobacco but the cigarette factories and breweries provide a badly needed injection to the economy.  There is this danger of unemployment.  There is also the insincerity of a Government now introducing those measures when they think back on what they said in Opposition when budgets were introduced. For instance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1972 said he was expecting a revolution on the streets.  If he was sincere then, what is he expecting now?  One could talk for hours about the inadequacies of this budget and about the situation in the country with excessive borrowing and so on.  The highlight was when the Minister sat and listened as Deputy Dowling asked him by how much the social welfare stamp would increase, He did not answer.  We all know it will have to be a substantial increase.  More money out of the ordinary working man's pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for Transport and Power is considering cheaper petrol for tourists.  I want to see as many tourists as possible coming here but the Minister for Finance must also consider cheaper fuel for the ordinary working man to whom a car is essential.  Our spokesman on Transport and Power has pointed out that energy policies should be introduced.  We have hopes for the development of natural gas and oil off the south coast.  Deputy Hegarty referred to this at some length and his opinions coincide with ours.  He is a man who has his feet on the ground.  For those living along the south coast, particularly in <Col N="1436" /> County Cork, there will be a major change in living conditions and social standards.  Problems will accompany this development.  Our first aim would be to see maximum benefit to our own economy and if the Parliamentary Secretary refuses to buy Fota Island for us perhaps he would give the full benefit of the revenue from that to the southern region.</P>

      <P>It is a very interesting point in Cork.  This development off the South coast will bring its own problems.  I would like to see a working committee set up comprised of people from the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Transport and Power and, above all, local bodies such as Cork County Council, Cork Corporation and Cork Harbour Authority.  This is what we should be looking at instead of the non-event budget presented to us earlier this month.  The Minister will be remembered as the man who during his short period in office became the Finance Minister of the third Coalition Government since the war that set back the economy of this country.  The excuse in 1948-51 was the Korean War, in 1954-57 it was the Suez Canal and now it is the sheiks and the Arabs.  The greatest sheiks and <Col N="1437" /> arabs are housed in Merrion Street. The Government and the Minister should face up to a difficult situation and get the maximum benefit from the resources of the country for the people of the country.  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  Sin a bhfuil le rá agam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time like this it is inevitable that those of us on the Opposition benches would be very vociferous in relation to the state of the economy and that we would be taking to task the Minister in relation to various vital Departments.  It can be truly said that the overall economy is controlled by the Minister for Finance, by the type of headline he sets and by the type of budget he presents to this House.  The harshest criticism and the greatest rebuke that can be laid at the door of the Coalition Government is the sapping of public morale and confidence in our ability to maintain economic growth and prosperity.  I know that in this House the cut and thrust of political debate demands that an Opposition should continuously highlight the inadequacies and inefficiencies of the Government but at this time it should be clearly understood that our condemnation of the present Administration is not for the purpose of scoring cheap political points but because of a dismaying and fear-provoking perception of the wounding and, indeed, the ruin of our economy that daily accompany the Coalition's stay in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Ministers have claimed that outside influences have had this adverse effect on our economy and I suppose up to some degree that would be true.  Any Government can be forgiven for being the victim of outside economic depression or recession but I submit that when gross incompetence, in some cases ministerial ineptitude and warring factions within the Government, made up of punch-drunk socialists and pink-eyed conservatives, are all explained away by outside economic influences the time has come for the people to get rid of the political albatross we have and return a Fianna Fáil Government that will attend to the amelioration <Col N="1438" /> of our present difficulties and not to debate about outworn ideologies and academic gymnastics as we had exhibited in the statement of the Minister for Finance on the wealth tax.  That irresponsible statement alone caused a mass exodus of money from the country from which it will take us a long time to recover.</P>
    <P>We bemoan the fact that there are 100,000 people unemployed and that figure is likely to increase.  We have Ministers in the Government prepared to latch on to this outworn ideology and to call it the panacea that will cure all ills but it will have the opposite effect.  As Deputy Hegarty so rightly said we must protect the man who risks his own capital, borrows money to create employment and builds himself up from being very small, working in his own home with very often his wife doing secretarial work, into a small sized industry and gradually getting bigger and bigger until he becomes a big employer.  He is then labelled by the academic socialists as a speculator. The time has come to stop swaying in front of every ideological breeze that comes along and get down to protecting the man who is doing the mundane job of trying to make a profit from his enterprise.  There can be no profit without employment. There can be no re-investment into industry without profit.  The only thing that profitless companies attain is unemployment and emigration for the workers.</P>
    <P>Surely everybody realises that a Cabinet table was never intended for this type of academic twilighting by politicians more engrossed with the niceties of parliamentary debate than with solving the country's ills.  We need now an enunciation of virile policies that will attack unemployment, inflation and high prices.  In order to do that we must have the ability to convince the public we are serious.  One of the alarming things I find is the gradual erosion of public confidence and the legitimate fury of housewives at escalating prices and, worst of all, emasculation of the small farmer.  The people will take a lot of convincing that things can ever again be righted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> When the Government first came into power in 1973 the media heralded them as the saviours of the nation. As an Opposition we showed restraint and moderation in our approach to the Government because it was only fair that each Government Minister should get time to become familiar with his portfolio.  When we discovered that sniping and callow name calling were to be the substitute for mature and planned husbandry of our economy and that the resources of the industrial development carried out by Fianna Fáil were gradually being eroded we felt it was time to step in, to expose this for what it was and try to salvage something from the steady progress of 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>This drift towards economic decay and the subsequent blunting of public morale is very serious.  A Minister for Finance has the greatest opportunity of any Minister, when he introduces the budget, to give a boost to the morale, to business people, to investors and of continuity of employment to the workers.  The Minister failed to do this.</P>
    <P>The depression of our living standards over the past two years and the crippling of hard-won industries can be described as a tragedy.  The attempted stamping out of the small farmer and depriving him of his right to expect some rise in income and then have that turned into a loss is deplored by this side of the House. This is a public monument to the gross ineptitude of the Coalition Government.  If the Government took the people into their confidence and presented a planned attack on inflation, unemployment and the folding-up of industries it would go some way towards salvaging public confidence. It would bring about a reciprocal collaboration from the public and a restoration of confidence in the future of industry.  I know it will be hard to talk to hard-pressed housewives and economically crippled farmers and present policies to them.  This is the time to do it and this is the time to display the resilience of the economy. Why the Minister missed this opportunity <Col N="1440" /> in his budget I cannot understand. I fail to see why he, as the man who is responsible for the income and expenditure of Exchequer moneys, did not give example to people of how they should behave.  I mean a good example.  Of course, he gave the opposite by budgeting for such a massive deficit that it was a direct encouragement to live beyond our means.  As Deputy Power said earlier, it is the Government of mañana.</P>
    <P>It is also a small bit of cheating on his part because he knows, as Minister for Finance, that he has a direct interest in inflation, and up to a certain stage the more inflation there is the better it is for the Exchequer. Therefore he is a contributor towards inflation.  Maybe in normal economic circumstances that might be permissible, but I do not think it is permissible or right at a time when there is such economic depression.</P>
    <P>Our building industry is also in a very serious state.  The Minister could have taken this opportunity of encouraging direct investment in our building societies by allowing tax-free interest up to a certain figure.  I have no doubt whatever that the millions of pounds that left this country when the Minister made his ill-judged announcement on wealth tax would very quickly come back, together with a lot more money from Britain, and would lead to a dramatic drop in our unemployment figure and get our house building industry back on the scale on which it was.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the attitude of Ministers in the Coalition Government towards capital, towards property, towards private enterprise. Why has private enterprise become such a dirty word?  What is wrong with creating jobs, giving employment and trying to make a profit because you risked your own capital.  I wish one of the socialist Ministers would come into this House some time and explain to us what is wrong with doing just that.</P>
    <P>We have arrived at the anomalous situation where the banks seemingly have plenty of money to lend but (a) they cannot get enough enterprises <Col N="1441" /> in which they can trust their money and (b) those who want the money from the banks are not, in the opinion of the banks, worthwhile enterprises or are in danger of closing down.  There seems to be absolutely rudderless Government in relation to our economic affairs.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much in the Minister's statement to the House the increases for the under-privileged people in our community.  I suppose it would be a cliche to say I do not think it is enough, but I do not think it is.  I also welcome the extra investment in AnCO because that body can play a vital role in our economy.  We hope it can retrain enough workers to make them more skilled in the type of employment that might be available to them in the future.  Any amount of money invested in AnCO is a very sound investment.</P>
    <P>Again I must appeal to the Minister and the Government to look very seriously at the lot of the farmers and especially of the small farmers, and see if we can help them to attain a proper income.  We asked them to grow winter feed, but how can they do that if they cannot get nitrogen? They discover every time they go to their store that they cannot get it at any price, and yet we are exporting that very same commodity.  Surely this is an anomalous situation.  If we do not seriously look after the interests of the small farmer&mdash;and there is no attempt or very little attempt in this budget to do that&mdash; then there will be an even greater problem on our hands, because there will be emigration from the rural parts of Ireland into the cities, and we know what the conditions are there already.</P>
    <P>It is vital that all future industrial development be kept out of Dublin and that it be located as much as possible in the rural areas.  That is the one positive way in which we can help our small farmer to supplement his income, to bring it up to the level of the industrial worker.  I would say that any moneys the Minister allocates to the IDA, to CTT or any such body, again are moneys well invested. They may not bring immediate returns <Col N="1442" /> but certainly should bring returns in the future.  Therefore, proper industrialisation of the rural areas should become a priority.  The Government should do something, and do it quickly, about our building industry. One way in which the industry could be helped is by tax-free interest where the building societies are concerned.</P>
    <P>At this point in time the annual budget is becoming more and more irrelevant, especially when, with every week that passes, we have what can only be considered as mini budgets with occasionally a maxi budget. Nevertheless the budget provides a great opportunity for the Minister for Finance to set the pattern for the year that lies ahead.  The Minister had the audacity to come in here and tell us that because of economic circumstances or some other circumstances he could not make any forecasts and he could not have any planned programme of expansion for this year or for subsequent years. What a way to slide out of his responsibility to the country.  What a display of callous indifference to the plight of the country.  What a display of the white flag of surrender in the face of our economic circumstances. It is mandatory now that the people should have an opportunity at a very early date of returning a Fianna Fáil Government, which will not be divided by ideologies but which will, rather, have a positive approach to the economy and put the country once more back on its feet as a Fianna Fáil Government had to do and did in the 1950s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In our parliamentary system the budget has always been used as an opportunity for the Government, through the Minister for Finance, to review the performance of the economy in the year that has gone and set out the prospects for the economy in the current year together with general broad guidelines as to the direction in which the Government would like to see the economy move in the current year. That exercise in the context of this Coalition Government has been brought to naught.  The budget <Col N="1443" /> statement rambled on over 52 foolscap sheets.  In it there was not one comment, one suggestion or one proposal to combat the twin evils of inflation and unemployment.  Indeed what was included were proposals which would further exacerbate the situation in regard to both unemployment and inflation.</P>
      <P>We must now examine the record of the two parties comprising the Government.  I do not know if it is just two parties or more than two. When these parties were in Opposition the talk was of programmed planning and setting out, not just broad guidelines, but specific guidelines as to what the economy should be doing month by month, year by year and decade by decade.  In the Minister's own words, he does not know what will happen in one month's time, two months, three months or four months.  Everything is blamed on the oil situation.  The sheiks are supposed to be the cause of all the problems from which the country is suffering.  The Minister for Finance, who should be the director of progress, has washed his hands of the whole situation and said he can do nothing; it is in the hands of the oil sheiks.  He takes no blame.  We have 100,000 unemployed.  The Minister says that is the fault of the oil sheiks.  Raging inflation cannot be controlled.  It is the fault of the oil sheiks.  I question this mentality.  The Minister referred to various happenings beyond our shores.  In the modern cliché, which will become the obituary notice, I believe, of this Government, according to the Minister for Finance everything is an on-going situation.</P>

      <P>We were having a very civil debate until the Parliamentary Secretary arrived.  Everything is an on-going situation; it is so on-going that the Minister for Finance does not know what will happen tomorrow, next week or next year.  He does not know whether or not he will <Col N="1444" /> have to bring in another budget.  Of course he will have to bring in another budget.  There was not one line in the Minister's opening statement about any development of our own natural resources.  There was not one suggestion about the development of our mines or our off-shore oil and gas.  If these were developed and if there were a policy these developments could make a major inroad into the figure of 100,000 unemployed because some would be employed directly in these developments and others would be employed indirectly in servicing these developments.  What have we had?</P>
      <P>We have had Press conference after Press conference telling us a policy would be prepared before the summer, in the autumn, and definitely ready by Christmas.  We are nearly into February now and our unemployment figures are increasing every week.  In this area in which we could make an immediate cut in the number of unemployed what have we got?  We have a lack of decision.  This typifies the record of this regime.  They are incapable of making decisions as can be seen in the budget speech.  If they were capable of making a decision something concrete would have been included in the budget speech.  There would have been some concrete proposals to help to get our economy going again.  There would have been some encouragement for private enterprise. The only encouragement given was some minor tax concession when what was needed was to look at the economy in a big way, to be big about it, to make major decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are incapable of making major decisions.  I am not saying individual Ministers cannot see the problems but, because of the composition of the regime, it is impossible for them collectively to make decisions.  I am sure that, as individuals, many of them want to go forward and encourage private industry to develop and expand, rather than to have contraction which is the order of the day.  Because of the semi-socialist, half-socialist, half-private enterprise type of mentality in the Government, there is no definite philosophy.  At a <Col N="1445" /> time of serious crisis, when we need big men to make big decisions we have collectively a group who are incapable of crossing the road without assistance.</P>
    <P>Many general criticisms have been made of the budget, or lack of budget by speakers on this side of the House. Some of the speakers on the other side of the House were not too complimentary either.  I want to speak about two specific proposals or lack of proposals in the budget.  One is the question of the oil subsidy for horticulture. In his budget speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to continue to give an oil subsidy for horticulture up to 30th June, 1975. The purpose of the subsidy, which was introduced in July, 1974, is to help growers to adjust to higher costs for heating oil.  The rate of subsidy for the period 1st January to 30th June, 1975, will be 2p per gallon...</P>
    <P>This typifies the point I was attempting to make about big men making big decisions, instead of the trying to go a bit of the road with everybody mentality in this regime.</P>
    <P>In the constituency I represent, Dublin North County, the horticulture industry produces £12 million worth of tomatoes and mushrooms of which over £2½ million worth is exported.  In the last six months of last year the Government gave an oil subsidy of 5p per gallon to help growers compete against the highly subsidised Dutch growers and other growers on the Continent, to help them to continue the expansion in the export markets they had found, and to help them to compete on the home market against the highly subsidised Dutch producers. It would be wrong if I did not make the point that the six months during which the 5p per gallon was given, was the time when the horticulture industry used about 10 per cent of their annual consumption of oil.  It is obvious to anybody who thinks about the problem that the oil is needed when they are trying to get the early crop in.  During the first six months of the year about 90 per cent of the oil is used.</P>
    <P>When the Dáil reassembled in October I asked the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1446" /> and Fisheries was he prepared to continue the oil subsidy for the first six months of this year.  It was essential in October that the Minister should make a decision on the oil subsidy because it is in the October-November period that the growers have to decide whether they will grow a single or a dual crop in the coming season.  At that time they have to work out the economics of the situation and decide what is the most viable crop for them.  The answer I got was that no provision was made in the Estimates for it.  In January the harm was done, but some assistance could have been given similar to the 1974 figure of 5p.</P>
    <P>What was given?  Twopence. Although the cost of oil to the producer had gone up after Christmas.  Dr. Woods, chairman of the association of producer groups is reported in the <i>Fingal Independent</i> of Friday, 17th January, as saying that the net effect of the Government's proposal, on top of the oil companies' decision to increase the price of fuel oil to £3.85p per gallon, represented an overall increase of 70 per cent to the growers since Christmas.  He said it would also have an effect on early tomatoes, and that growers cutting down on heat would mean an increase in imported Dutch tomatoes and have an adverse effect on employment.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister gave a subsidy of 2p; during the last six months of last year, when it was not of great assistance to the growers, it was 5p; and the price of oil went up by 3p.  Instead of helping them he is pushing them further and further into the background, despite their efforts to keep up employment and their efforts on the export market.  He is destroying our balance of payments situation by making them incapable of competing on equal terms with their competitor growers in the remainder of the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>When M. Lardinois was here he said that the Government could increase the oil subsidy because other countries were doing so.  In typical fashion our Government went a little bit of the way.  They did not solve the problem.  I would appeal to them even at this late stage to make a decision <Col N="1447" /> to increase the subsidy to the growers to at least 7p or 8p to counteract the increase in the cost of oil.</P>
    <P>To bring in the human element, over 600 families are directly or indirectly engaged in the horticulture industry in my constituency.  That is a large number of people.  If their markets are ruined, as I foresee them being ruined because of the unfair competition they will face from the Dutch, they and their sons and daughters will be thrown out of employment and this will further exacerbate the unemployment problem. I appeal to the Minister to take some action which will help those growers.</P>
    <P>The other sphere in which the Minister failed miserably was in the sphere of housing.  In a 52-page speech the Minister could find room for only eight lines on investment in housing.  Everybody knows that the great criterion of the state of the economy is the health of the housing industry.  Using that criterion now, the economy is on the rocks.  The need for decision is obvious to everybody except the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government spoke in the budget debate about the marvellous record in housebuilding and quoted statistics about the number of houses being built and the great progress being made.  To typify the type of contribution made by the Minister I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 22nd January, 1975, reporting the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>The larger, more expensive houses had not been selling well since last summer and this had led to a reduction of employment in the brick-making industry.  He had now asked local authorities to use more bricks in local authority houses, and this, it was hoped, would relieve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The Construction Industry Federation on 24th January, 1975, in the same paper said&mdash;and nobody could say it better:</P>
    <P>We note the repetition of the statement, previously made, that the reduction of employment in the <Col N="1448" /> brick-making industry had been caused by the `larger, more expensive houses not selling well.' In common with the other statements referred to above, we can, at best, classify this statement as extraordinary.</P>
    <P>Bricks are used for any type of houses, whether low-priced or expensive, a fact which is plainly visible.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government is apparently unaware that bricks are used in all types of houses.  This is similar to the logic used by his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce when I questioned him a fortnight ago about the unemployment being created in a company in my constituency, Wavin Pipes of Balbriggan.  Over 60 men were laid off on one Friday and 14 had previously been let go, making a total of 74, and there was the possibility of more becoming unemployed; the situation is being reviewed monthly.</P>
    <P>I was told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he was unaware of any crisis in the building industry despite the fact that this is a company manufacturing sewerage and water pipes needed in all development work on private and other building sites.  The Minister could not understand why the products of this company were not being purchased.  I can tell him: any houses at present being built are being built on sites developed 12 months, 18 months or two years ago.  Very little development work is taking place at present and we shall rapidly reach a situation where the Minister's much-vaunted figures&mdash;much questioned by the building industry&mdash;will not continue rolling out.  Not even the Minister with all his juggling of statistics will be able to keep them up because no development work is taking place. And the situation is reaching crisis proportions.  Without the infrastructure of sewerage and water mains and roads it is impossible to build houses. This is the situation we are facing and this is why the company I mention are in their present predicament. However, two Ministers seem to be completely unaware that before you <Col N="1449" /> can build houses you must provide the necessary infrastructure.</P>
    <P>There is an utter lack of confidence in the present Government in the building industry&mdash;and for very good reason.  As a typical example of the present situation, take an average three-bedroom house in the Dublin region costing about £7,500 or £8,000. The maximum SDA loan available from the corporation or county council is £4,500, leaving a difference of £3,000 or £3,500.  To be eligible for the loan, the applicant must be earning less than £2,350.  How a young couple are supposed to save £3,000 or £3,500&mdash;the difference between the loan and the price of the house&mdash;and at the same time earn less than £2,350, beats me.  The Minister should accept the proposals made by Fianna Fáil, by the Construction Industry Federation and many other persons to increase the maximum loan available to £6,000.  The need for this is obvious; without it, the number of houses purchased is falling rapidly. Here, I can speak from personal experience. The Minister should increase the new loan limit to £6,000 and increase the income limit from £2,350 to £3,000.  We need at least a 50 per cent increase in new house grants, supplementary and other grants.</P>
    <P>There are other sources of house purchase finance and again they need Government encouragement and decisions. The proposal made by Fianna Fáil before the last local election, on which a decision was requested by many sectors but which has not been made, was to abolish liability to income tax on interest paid by building societies on deposits up to £5,000. This would increase the flow of money to the building societies and money would be available to lend to prospective home-buyers.  Promised but not yet introduced is the granting of trustee status to building societies. This, again, would increase income to building societies and provide money that could be reinvested and given to prospective house purchasers.</P>
    <P>We have also the suggestion of the charging of fixed interest rates by building societies on mortgages, something <Col N="1450" /> which is crying out to heaven to be done.  Again we have not a whisper from the Government, a Government which is comprised of some Members of the Labour Party who when in Opposition were loud in their pleas for such assistance to be given to the building societies.  We also have as a potential source of house purchase finance, the banks, who according to their accounts figures, have been making massive profits.  In my view they have a social commitment to reinvest a substantial percentage of their profits and revenue in the house finance sector.</P>
    <P>In my view it is wrong that they, unlike their counterparts in other countries, should be excluded from giving long-term money which young couples need to buy a home.  This Government should decide&mdash;they are incapable of making any decisions and this call is really a cry to the wind&mdash;to bring in regulations that would make it mandatory on banks to invest a percentage of their profits in housing.  Such a decision would be a substantial help to the housing market and to the building industry.</P>
    <P>We also have the situation of insurance companies.  Some of them have been making a contribution, small though it is, but many who have licences to operate here invest very little in the provision of money for private homes.  The Government have the power to change this situation, if they have the courage to do so, because they issue the licences to these companies to operate here.  If the Government were to make a decision about increases in SDA loans, assistance to the building societies and mandatory regulations on banks and insurance companies to invest their money in housing, it would go a long way towards getting the building industry going again.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows, with the exception of the Government, that building has almost come to a stop.  Building has always been a great barometer of how the economy is doing and it is doing very badly at present.  The building industry is a great male intensive labour sector <Col N="1451" /> and directly there are many people involved in the actual construction of houses.  However, indirectly there are many factories engaged in the manufacture of materials for houses.  There are factories producing pipes, bricks, joinery works, glass, felt and bathroom equipment.  When activity in the building industry drops these other units are in trouble as far as employment is concerned. That is what is happening at present.</P>
    <P>Builders' providers and hauliers of building materials to sites are also affected.  Even shopkeepers are in serious trouble as a result of the situation in the building industry.  This has risen because of the lack of decision on behalf of and by this Government. The Minister who made the comment that because the more expensive houses were not selling there was unemployment in the brick making industry typifies the type of mentality of this present regime.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong not to mention during the course of a debate on the budget the benefits given to the social welfare sector.  I welcome the increases in the various allowances but, without intending to make a carping criticism of the increases, it was too little too late.  Inflation had eaten into the allowances given to the people prior to the budget.  On the Saturday morning following the introduction of the budget the various newspapers carried advertisements from the National Prices Commission announcing a number of increases.  The list of price increases then announced more than eliminated the promised social welfare increases.</P>
    <P>I suggest that one way of reducing inflation would have been an across the board reduction in the VAT intake. This could have caused some minor financial problems but the Government were budgeting for a massive deficit anyway and it would have given the people a lead.  It would have shown them that the Government were serious about trying to cut down the rate of inflation.  What has happened here is that the people, the housewives in particular, have become punch drunk from continuous price <Col N="1452" /> increases.  There is no such a thing as hunting for bargains or shopping around to get the best price anymore. People are aware that the money in their pocket is worth nothing.  The article they wish to purchase today will have increased in price tomorrow. It used to be X plus but it is reaching the stage of multiplication now.  The Government should have been big about it, but of course they were not. They should have taken a decision to reduce the level of VAT across the board.  I am afraid, with the spiral in prices right across the board, the stage of diminishing returns will be reached because people will be unable to purchase goods.</P>
    <P>In his budget the Minister increased the price of beer, spirits, and so on.  Beer, in pre-decimal money, has now reached the price of 6s a pint.  Who would have believed that a few years ago?  The stage is being reached where people will be unable to consume the same number of drinks or smoke the same number of cigarettes with a consequent diminution of tax revenue therefrom.  Of course I will be told from a certain lobby that that is a very good thing; we will reach a situation in which the amount of alcohol being consumed will be reduced and the amount of cigarettes being smoked correspondingly reduced.  But let us face the facts of the situation: without the old reliables the social welfare system would grind to a halt because the tax on those items is the great provider of revenue for social welfare, whether or not we like to admit it.</P>
    <P>In his budget statement the Minister called for restraint in wage and salary demands and at the same time increased the very items on which the ordinary working man gauges his income. Most men, having given X amount of pounds to their wives for household needs, will have something left in their pockets for a pint after their work.  They gauge, from the amount of pocket money left in their pockets how many pints they can buy and how many packets of cigarettes. But they are now reaching the situation where that will be X minus, minus number of pints and packets of cigarettes.  There will be an increase <Col N="1453" /> in demand for wages and salaries.  The Minister is whistling in the wind if he thinks workers are prepared to accept his call for restraint in wage and salary demands while they have to face the prospect each week of their wives looking for extra money with which to buy the same amount of goods in the shop and while they themselves need extra money in their pockets with which to buy the same number of pints or cigarettes, while their mortgage interest rates rise, rent and rates increase and so on. With all these increases, the Minister calls for restraint.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister call for such restraint without demonstrating his own good faith?  And, in this budget, he failed miserably so to do.  He has budgeted for a massive deficit, which would be all right if the money was going to be used for productive purposes. But there is no suggestion in the 52 pages of his statement that one shilling of that amount of money will be so used.  If a budget is to have any meaning, it must balance one's books; it must point the way forward for the coming year; it must inject capital into an economy badly needing it.  But the Minister failed miserably in that respect.  His statement is comprised of 52 jumbled pages of phrases such as: &ldquo;I hope, I wish; I hope it does not happen; I hope it does happen&rdquo;, but not one suggestion of direction or of a programme of how to get people back to work.</P>
    <P>I might mention one other sector of the economy, the tourist industry, which is an area the Minister could have helped.  Long as was his statement, the Minister could have added an extra page of constructive proposals which would have helped.  As has been suggested by the Irish Hotels Federation, the Minister could have granted a concession to tourists in respect of petrol, as has been done in Italy and other countries.  There could have been a form of voucher provided at the entry points.  It would mean no loss of revenue because it would have been an encouragement to new business we would not have been getting anyway. The Minister could have eliminated the tax element of the price of petrol which <Col N="1454" /> would have encouraged more tourists at a time when that industry is going through a tough period of its history. Had the Minister done so we would have been in a unique situation in the European context, which would have placed our tourist industry and Bord Fáilte, in particular, in a position to compete on very favourable terms with their counterparts elsewhere.  It is not too late for the Minister to introduce such a concession in his Finance Bill and I would appeal to him again to do so, because anything that helps to change the present trend of the unemployment figures in however small a way is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I would make one last appeal to the Minister and the Government to do the honourable thing.  Having made and broken so many promises, having been handed the economy in such a healthy state, having ruined and brought it to its knees in a short two years, they should resign and allow a one-party, united Government take the reins, because there is no doubt but that the economy was built up by the efforts and direction of various Fianna Fáil Governments with the assistance, efforts and energy of the workers. Basically, it is sound but before it slides too far let the Taoiseach do what is honourable&mdash;declare a general election and give the people the opportunity to change the Government, an opportunity for which they have been crying out for some time.</P>

Perhaps one of the most important pledges they gave was in relation to the control of rising prices, but they have blamed conditions outside the country for all the <Col N="1455" /> inflation we are suffering.  There was, too, the great promise to remove VAT from foodstuffs but we know that in effect this did not lead to any improvement in food costs and that, since then, food prices have been increasing at an alarming rate.</P>
    <P>The rate of VAT that applied to foodstuffs was 5.26p in the £ but when this was removed it followed that this revenue had to be raised in some other way.  Consequently, VAT was increased on many commodities such as building materials and motor vehicles and on such services as transport costs with the result that there followed a level of unemployment far greater than what it might otherwise have been.  The latest confidence trick on the part of the Government has been the announcement of a sizeable increase in the youth and physical education section of the Department of Education.  In this regard there has been an announcement of a grant of £300,000 but almost simultaneously has been the announcement that the amenity grants given by the Department of Local Government has to be withdrawn.  Amenity grants are for such items as swimming pools and sporting facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by the Chair and would merely point out that moneys devoted by this Government to this aspect of youth have been cut back by £300,000 in the current year from £600,000 last year. This has not been made clear yet to the people, but when the various Estimates are before the House I assure the Chair that I shall indicate clearly <Col N="1456" /> how our young people in particular have been sold short by this Government.</P>
      <P>The numerous budgets that we have had since the main one have been an attempt by the Government to avoid admitting that the economy is being messed about.  Since the budget of 1974 there has been an increase in taxation of £50 million, £27 million of which was raised by way of the increase in the price of petrol.  There were the increased postal charges also.  We were told that in that regard there was a deficit of £4,500,000 which had to be met, but the increases were geared to raise more than £13 million.  We were not told the reason for the difference.  There were increases earlier in the year in the health stamp contributions.</P>
      <P>Taken together, these increases total £50 million and I am wondering what is to be the cost of the social welfare stamp, but we have not been given this information in the budget. We can expect further increases in taxation.</P>
      <P>We have been told that the social welfare increases were designed to bring the recipients into line with the increases in the cost of living.  According to the national wage agreement there was to be an increase in income for any increase of 10 per cent or more in the cost of living.  We all know that inflation has been running at 20 per cent and that workers are to get a 10 per cent increase in accordance with that clause of the agreement, but I should like to know when the social welfare recipients qualify for this 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>In July or August last I predicted that by Christmas the unemployment figure was likely to reach 100,000.  As has been proved, I was not far out in that estimate.  I am predicting now that, unless the Government take some positive action soon, this figure will be as high as 150,000.  I can only hope that this will not happen for it would bring about a state of revolution and that is something we do not ever want to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must inform the people of what is the true situation. <Col N="1457" /> If people are made aware of the difficulties they will be prepared to face up to them to a much greater degree than when they are being given pie-in-the-sky. The behaviour of this Government in almost all the legislation they introduced was worse than amateurism, it was deplorable.  When the free medical service was announced last year there had been no proper consultation with the doctors. Yet the Tánaiste, who is a member of a trade union, would have had consultations with the workers and their representatives if a factory had been involved.  But the medical profession were not consulted.  This Government underestimate the sense of anger and frustration of the public at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service the extent to which the Government have implemented the recommendations of the Devlin Report on public service reorganisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations of the public services organisation review group range over the <Col N="1458" /> whole field of public service organisation and practice and provide a long term programme for consideration by my Department.  The present position as to implementation is broadly as follows:</P>
      <P>The review group's recommendations for the setting up of a Department of the Public Service, separate from the Department of Finance, have been implemented by the establishment of this Department on 1st November, 1973.</P>
      <P>A public service advisory council to survey the progress of the reorganisation of the public service, as recommended by the review group, has been established and it will submit its first report before next May.</P>
      <P>The review group's recommendations for the separation of policy and execution proposed the creation in each Department of an Aireacht&mdash;the central core of the Department, grouped around the Minister, and responsible for policy formulation and overall direction and control&mdash;and a number of executive bodies which would be charged with the execution of settled policy.  It has been decided to see how this concept could be applied experimentally in four Departments &mdash; Health, Transport and Power, Industry and Commerce and Local Government. Task forces at official level were set up to consider the problems of implementation in each case.  In two Departments &mdash; Health and Transport and Power&mdash;clear lines of action have already been established and accepted by the Government and implementation is proceeding accordingly.</P>
      <P>The review group also recommended that the staff support functions of finance, planning, organisation, and personnel should be rationalised and specialist units for these functions established in all Departments.  Studies are now in hand to determine the most suitable method of implementation of this recommendation in Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A joint consultative council, <Col N="1459" /> composed of official and staff side interests concerned, has been considering the complex issues involved in the recommendations of the review group in regard to promotion by merit and the abolition of class barriers.</P>
    <P>Staff development, with particular reference to appreciation of the new structures and systems recommended, is being extended through the provision of training by the civil service training centre and the Institute of Public Administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> All the main public service groups, including civil servants, Defence Forces, Garda, teachers and local authority employees, receive, with effect from 1st July each year, pensions increases based on full parity with rates of pay in operation on that date.</P>
    <P>The initiative in granting increases to pensioners of State-sponsored bodies lies with the bodies themselves and/or the trustees of their superannuation schemes.  Where my approval is required under statute, such approval is granted for increases within the public service limits as to amounts and effective dates.  In cases where I have no statutory function in relation to a body's superannuation arrangements, the responsibility for the granting of pensions increases rests with the body concerned and/or the trustees of its superannuation scheme.</P>

In fixing staffing complement for each branch regard is had to the necessity for dealing with taxation proposals as well as administering existing taxes.</P>
      <P>Because the estate duty staff was already experienced in the technicalities of capital taxation the new proposals in that field were allocated to them.  No officers were transferred from the Estate Duty branch; on the contrary, at critical times, assistance was provided to the officers in it from other areas in the Revenue administration.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I can categorically assert that this is not a fact and I would point out to Deputy Colley, as he must be well aware, that when I was in Opposition I addressed questions from the Opposition benches about the delays in the Estate Duty Office so when I assumed responsibility in the Department of Finance I took steps to ensure that many of the previous delays would be eliminated and one of those steps was making arrangements as and from August, 1973 whereby all new inland revenue affidavits would be assessed provisionally on receipt, as a consequence of which many of the delays which previously arose and which could easily have been avoided have since been prevented.  If the Deputy is referring to some recent printed complaints, I would like to say that at least some of those are in respect of the administration of estates where the Estate Duty Office are awaiting information from the people who are making complaints and until such time as the corrective affidavits are filed the finalisation of the estates in question cannot be arranged.  The fault does not lie with the Estate Duty Office because the public are now getting a speedier service there than they used to receive.</P>

      <P>The Estate Duty Office completes its work usually within a matter of weeks after receipt of affidavits but where queries arise which require replies from the person who lodged the affidavits, obviously the length of time taken to deal with the matter will depend on the length of time taken by the people to reply to the queries which are presented to them.  Many of the complaints that have recently been voiced in public have been made by people who themselves are in default but there is no loss to any individual as a consequence of delays in the Estate Duty Office because interest does not run as long as the handling of a particular administration is in the hands of the Estate Duty Office.  It is only <Col N="1465" /> when it has left the Estate Duty Office and work requires to be done by others that interest runs.</P>

There can be ordinary human delays but the complexity of the death duty laws and the difficulties of valuation and so on can often lead to a situation where you have those lengthy periods of administration.  I share with the Deputy a desire to eliminate those and this is one of the reasons why we are eliminating death duties because of the delays and inconveniences and difficulties which are inevitable as long as we retain the old form of estate duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to a newspaper article (details supplied) concerning the principal value of property passing on death; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point made in the article is that difficulties can arise when share values fall between the date of a person's death and the date of payment of estate duty.  The difficulties referred to are, of course, not new, and as the Deputy will appreciate <Col N="1466" /> they could on a rising market operate in the opposite direction so far as the Exchequer is concerned.  I do not accept that delays in the Estate Duty Branch are responsible for, or contribute in any significant way to, the problem.  Since August, 1973 a new system was introduced whereby Inland Revenue affidavits are assessed provisionally on presentation.  I am, however, having all aspects of the matter examined as sympathetically as possible to see how cases of undoubted hardship can best be dealt with.  I might add that the replacement of death duties with other forms of capital taxation will lessen the possibility of the difficulties referred to in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will presumably appreciate that the elimination of death duties will not affect the hardships which have arisen in cases already or that may arise up to April next and since he appears to me to have accepted that there have been cases of hardship and I know, and I presume he does, that there have been cases of extreme hardship, could the Minister be a little bit more specific as to what he proposes to do having regard to the fact that it would appear on the face of it that to do anything about it might require some statutory change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot be any more specific than to say that we are going to get rid of the whole wretched system of death duties that has given rise to these complaints, to these hardships, to these delays, to these impositions on family fortunes and nothing could be more effective or of greater relief to people than to get rid of this iniquitous system which ought to have been got rid of long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that the cases to which I am referring&mdash;I have already said this&mdash;arise under the estate duty system so to talk about abolition of estate duty does not answer the question. Is the Minister aware that the real difficulty has arisen because of what has happened the economic situation and the catastrophic fall in the value of property, particularly <Col N="1467" /> shares, and that is why the position has become so acute?  It is no answer to talk about the abolition of estate duty.  Is the Minister saying that he will do something about the cases that have arisen under the estate duty system? If so, what does he propose to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I propose to do is to get rid of all the hardship that was caused by Fianna Fáil ignoring this problem for so long.  The difficulty to which Deputy Colley has drawn attention would not have arisen if death duties were abolished, as they ought to have been long ago.  Furthermore, I should like to point out that, notwithstanding the falling stock market, people who have certain Government securities are in the position to surrender those at par and so receive in payment of estate duty concessions and arrangements which are far above the value of the stock on the day on which the person died.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution of the Council of 22nd March, 1971, relating to the phased achievement of economic and monetary union embodied a commitment to achieve such a union in the Community by 1980.  This commitment was reaffirmed by the Conference of Heads of State or Government in Paris in October, 1972.  The Conference of Heads of Government held in Paris on 9-10 December of last year, while noting that internal and international difficulties did not permit as much progress towards economic and monetary union as had been expected, reaffirmed that their objective remains that which they set themselves on the occasion of the Paris Conference of October, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland subscribed fully to these reaffirmations on the basis that a <Col N="1470" /> more closely knit Community, of which economic and monetary union is a concrete expression and in which there is a concerted approach to the solution of Community problems, is in the interest of all the member states but particularly the smaller ones.</P>
    <P>Of course a necessary condition of progress towards EMU is parallel progress in the elimination of structural and regional imbalances occurring in the Community, entailing increased emphasis on regional, social and other policies which actively promote economic convergence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An engineering survey of the main channel of the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell canal within the State measuring approximately 30 miles has been in progress since 1973.  Some additional field work is necessary and it is hoped to have this done during the coming year.  The hydrology of the catchment is at present being studied in order to measure water inflows and to determine the type of controls necessary so as to reconcile as far as possible any conflicting interest of drainage and navigation.  A joint survey by the Northern and Southern <Col N="1475" /> authorities of the remaining seven mile stretch of the canal which runs along the Border would then be necessary. Until these surveys have been completed and the results assessed it would not be possible to say whether the restoration of the canal would be feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the position has now changed and the report of the Drainage Commission about 30 years ago is no longer relevant because, since then, up to 100,000 acres have been drained and this river could now be classified as an intermediate river?  Could the Parliamentary Secretary hold out any hope that the people in the area, particularly the people who reside in the town of Ennis, will be relieved of this flooding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to classify it as an intermediate catchment area he stands a worse chance than if it was classified as a major catchment area because, over the years, the minor catchment areas and the intermediate catchment areas have been completely cancelled out.  They were tried for a few years but it was found that it was unsuccessful to have three different categories of catchment areas at the same time.  The Office of Public Works are now concentrating on the major catchment areas only.  If the Deputy wants the Fergus classified as an intermediate catchment area, he is backing the wrong horse.  If he leaves it as a major catchment area he will have a better chance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> So long as ample supplies of Community beef continue to be available, and especially while the need for intervention purchases continue, abolition of the ban on beef imports from third countries could have serious adverse effects on this country's export trade.</P>
    <P>I emphasised this to the EEC Agricultural Commissioner during his recent visit here when he expressed the view that some relaxation of the ban, but not a very major one and not its total abolition, may have to be contemplated.</P>
    <P>A review of the Community's beef import system generally forms part of the Commission's proposals at present under discussion for 1975-76 and I and my Department will of course do everything possible at council and committee meetings to ensure that an adequate system will be applied at all times to protect the interests of Community producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the number of slaughter premiums that <Col N="1486" /> were paid to a factory (name supplied); the number of cattle and the tonnage of meat that were put into intervention in the period 1st August to 31st December, 1974, by that factory; and the percentages of their total kill in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice to disclose particulars of the business of an individual factory.  My Department do, however, publish weekly data for the total numbers of cattle qualifying for intervention and slaughter premiums at all factories combined, as well as the average overall factory percentage of the throughput of cattle sold into intervention and the average overall percentage of cattle qualifying for the slaughter premium.  The data published also indicates the number of factories whose individual percentages are above and below the overall averages.  I can say that the factory referred to by the Deputy generally sells to intervention more than the average for all factories and has less than the average for all factories certified for slaughter premium.  I take it that the Deputy got all that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he proposes to introduce any scheme in the near future to ensure that when beef prices and demand are depressed intervention prices or substitute aids <Col N="1487" /> for intervention prices will, in fact, reach the primary producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The intervention prices relate to sales of carcase beef to the intervention agency and the prices paid for this beef are widely known.  Over recent months beef sales to intervention and certification of other cattle for the present temporary slaughter premium have represented about two-thirds of total cattle slaughterings.  It is normally a function of the commercial market for cattle, which is largely between farmers themselves, to have the benefits afforded by the support payments passed back through trade channels to primary producers.  Trade competition does not, it has to be accepted, function with full effect in very weak national and international market conditions such as have prevailed for some time past.  It is not easy to see, however, what official action can be taken to enforce any specific levels of price for sales of various types of cattle at various stages between farmers themselves and between farmers and others.  Furthermore, some of these cattle will not ultimately be sold or be eligible for sale through the support systems at the slaughtering stage.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, I secured the agreement of the beef processing factories last October to announce minimum average prices for steer cattle on an increasing scale up to the end of January.  The position is being kept under continual review and I will be ready to take any suitable and practicable action that may be open to me at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, in fact, this is the nub of the whole difficulty which has arisen in the cattle trade over the past few months?  Will he also agree that it is absolutely essential that steps should be taken to see that if in future depressed markets arise the prices must get back to the producer?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary also agree that in many cases the producer is now going out of business and in two years time there will be a scarcity of beef? <Col N="1488" /> Will he agree that now is the time to make decisions on this so that, in the future, producer farmers will not be faced with this situation?  Irrespective of how difficult it is for the Minister and his Department to do so, it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the statements made by Deputy Gibbons will be closely and carefully examined.  Of course this is not a matter for the Department here.  It is a matter for the Community.  What the Deputy and others have in mind is to ensure that any other helps will find their way back to the producers but, in such cases, direct payment to the producers by the Department as the intervention agency would be possible only where intervention beef was purchased direct from producers by the Department.  This, however, is not the case.  The intervention arrangements provide for beef to be purchased by the Department in chilled or frozen carcase form which confines the system to purchases from meat factories.  That is the reason why the moneys cannot be passed directly back to producers. While direct payments to producers are not feasible, it has been accepted that the intervention system has, throughout a long continuous period, now 16 months, of depressed markets, prevented cattle prices from being far worse than they have been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that, on the face of it, it seems unrealistic that you are paying 35.4p intervention price to meet the supply figure while factories agreed to give 31p this month, 30p last month and 29p the previous month? With no change in cost, how could you agree to such a position, that they could vary by 1p per lb per month with no variation in the cost of production and as a result of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt with that question at some length here on Wednesday evening.  The changing of regulations is an on-going <Col N="1489" /> process but they must be changed in conjunction with the other members of the Community and unilateral action is not allowed.  The Minister has all these questions in mind and I can assure Deputies who are worried about the position posed in the question of Deputy Gibbons that any improvements or suggestions the Department think feasible will be made to the relevant authorities.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the EEC has fulfilled its obligation to the Community by providing an intervention price but that in fact, the breakdown has occurred from that point down to our producers?  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that this is an internal problem and it is not right to contend that it is the fault of our being in the EEC.  We agree with him that we would be worse off if we were not in the EEC but the Parliamentary Secretary must see that the obligation to get the intervention price back to the producers lies with our Government?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the negotiations, such <Col N="1498" /> as they are, have been rather protracted.  The main reason why the Minister allowed this to happen was his anxiety to get farmers to agree to an amicable arrangement.  The Minister did not want to force the hand of the local people of the Aghadown and Castletownbere creamery groups.  I am pleased to say that the negotiations have advanced very far and that it is hoped that the matter will be resolved by the end of March.</P>

With the approval of the milk producers in both those areas both creameries will unite.  That is a certainty.  It will be to the general advantage of both areas.  I can assure Deputy J.

      <P>When the 5p per gallon for the 1st July to 31st December was announced, it was not proposed to continue the subsidy beyond 31st December.  Taking all factors into account, the Government decided to continue a subsidy of 2p per gallon from 1st January to 30th June.  Mention was made in the course of supplementaries about what is happening in the two other countries which compete with us so far as tomatoes are concerned, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.  In the United Kingdom last year they gave 6p per gallon from 1st January to 30th June and 4p per gallon from 1st July to 31st December.  There is no oil subsidy being paid in the United Kingdom.  The subsidy being paid in the Netherlands at present is 5p per litre, about 3.9p per gallon.</P>

      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that the heating of glasshouses in Holland, for example, is done mostly by natural gas from the North Sea and consequently this is unfair competition for our glasshouse growers.  This industry is based mostly in my constituency in County Dublin and this is hitting the income of at least 600 families in the area.</P>

I take it the Parliamentary Secretary is now suggesting that the Land Project scheme is abolished, that there is nothing in its place, but that a modernisation farmer can avail of a drainage grant somewhat equivalent to the Land Project scheme.  Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy says somewhat equivalent to the Land Project scheme, that is correct.  A farmer under the farm modernisation scheme can carry out land project work on the one hand, farm buildings on another, some other desirable improvements as a third line of work and he can be paid separately for each. When he has one phase of the plan completed he is entitled to receive payment and that will enable him to move forward to phase two and phase three of his plan.</P>

      <P>This document which has been circulated to us classifies farmers as commercial farmers, development farmers, transitional farmers eligible for retirement pension, transitional farmers not eligible for retirement pension.  Are transitional farmers eligible for retirement pension entitled to a grant for drainage purposes somewhat equivalent to what the Land Project was before 1974?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is set down in the scheme that for commercial farmers the grant for land improvement is 40 per cent or 7 per cent interest subsidy over 15 years.  For development farmers the grant is 50 per cent or 9 per cent interest subsidy over a period of 15 years.  For transitional farmers not eligible for retirement pension the grant is 50 per cent or interest subsidy of 9 per cent over a period of 15 years.  In the case of a transitional farmer eligible for retirement pension the grant is 40 per cent or interest subsidy of 7 per cent over <Col N="1520" /> 15 years.  That is quite clear to everybody.</P>

      <P>A total of £3.25 million has been received to-date from FEOGA in respect of the denaturing of skim milk powder, wheat and sugar.  The vast bulk of the money received was in respect of skim milk powder, which was denatured for use as animal feed by the addition of lucerne meal or grass meal or by direct incorporation in compound feeding stuff.  Wheat was likewise denatured for use as animal feed by the application of colorants or by direct incorporation in animal feeding stuffs.  In the case of sugar small quantities were denatured by the <Col N="1528" /> addition of a chemical substance in order to make the sugar available to beekeepers at a reduced price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of the Government in relation to the fishing industry is to secure a balanced development of all sectors of the industry as quickly as possible.  To this end the Government are providing very generous financial aids, particularly in Gaeltacht areas, for those interested in establishing new fishery enterprises or expanding existing ones.  In addition technical <Col N="1530" /> advice is available to such persons from various bodies including An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Industrial Development Authority as well as from my Department.  I am satisfied that these facilities are adequate but it must be appreciated that the development of individual fishery projects is mainly a matter for private enterprise in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the answer I expected.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that of all the fish caught off our western coast, 8½ per cent is all that was landed here?  There are magnificent harbours and facilities here and raw material worth £100 million available off our coast.  Is there nobody in the Fisheries Division who can see the value of this raw material?  There are German firms interested in coming in, one prepared to put £1 million into processing there.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary say what it is intended to do to encourage this industry beyond the pitiful effort being made at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Department, BIM and myself are making a united effort to ensure that our fisheries are developed and that there will be general improvements all round in relation to those engaged in the industry, fishermen, fish processors and so on.  We have numerous aids which are set down for helping the industry, and I shall be only too glad to convey any further information to Deputy O'Connor because I am aware of his interest in this question, and he did ask me for information some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to convey further information to the Parliamentary Secretary.  The fishery exports of Norway, a small country like our own, are worth £300 million, and that must surely indicate to the Parliamentary Secretary the infantile effort we are putting into this industry.</P>

For some years the fishermen using the harbour have been making intermittent requests for dredging works to be carried out there.  Those requests have extended over 16 years and the most recent request was in August, 1974; the Fisheries Branch inspector said that, in his opinion, works would not be justified in view of the scale of fishing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that workers in the iron and steel industry are particularly exposed to the harmful effects of their environment, such as unbalanced or excessive muscular stress and adverse environmental influences which may be of a climatic origin, such as air temperature, air humidity, windspeed and heat but may also extend to lighting, noise, dust, smoke and gases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that various forms of irritant gases constitute a problem in the iron and steel industry, particularly during pickling and quenching and from smoke during rolling, flame scarfing, sintering and welding and during the spraying of emulsion, oils and paints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 72 and 73 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> Certain, but not all of the occupational hazards mentioned in the Deputy's questions are present in the Irish iron and steel industry.</P>
    <P>I had a special report prepared for me on the industry last year by the industrial inspectorate.  Equipment at present being installed by Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. should eliminate hazards to the workers caused by dust and metal fumes.  The company have at all times co-operated fully with the industrial inspectorate in all matters appertaining to the maintenance of optimum working conditions in the mills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I had some difficulty in hearing the Minister's reply, but I would ask him if on the occasion of the recent North-East Cork by-election he visited the Irish Steel Mills and if he would agree with me that noise pollution is becoming the most serious pollution problem facing workers now, far more serious than it was 12 months ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that arises under the next question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking about the excessive heat.  I understand that at one time the steel mills in Cobh provided beer for the workers, but that did not solve the problem.  I understand there is an environmental problem in the steel mills and I am asking the Minister if he will take any effective action to solve the problem, if not eliminate it altogether?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, compared with the major steel mills in other Community countries, the operations carried on in Haulbow-line are not on the same scale and many of the points raised by the Deputy do not, therefore, apply in that particular undertaking.  As I said in my first reply, equipment is being installed which should eliminate hazards caused by dust and fumes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister visited the steel mills?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the industrial inspectorate has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider visiting the mills and seeing <Col N="1537" /> the operations there and, perhaps, making a decision on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspectorate are aware of the problems and remedies are being provided.  New equipment is being installed and the inspectorate are in touch with the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour whether he accepts that employees are more exposed to air pollution, smell and noise at work than in their private lives; and if he intends to take any action in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Depending on the nature of the employment and also depending on the environment in which they spend their private lives, workers could, in particular instances, be more exposed to air pollution, smell and noise at work than in their private lives.</P>
      <P>Under the factories legislation it is the primary responsibility of the employer to take all practical measures to protect the workers against dust or fumes or other impurity likely to be injurious or offensive to the workers.  This responsibility is supplemented by statutory regulations related to various specific hazards in this area.</P>
      <P>I intend in the near future to promulgate a code of regulations dealing with noise.  The Minister for Local Government has made regulations controlling the pollution of the atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to hear the Minister say it is the intention to take certain measures in the near future, but will he not agree that the measures taken not only by the previous Government but so far by this Government have been inadequate in dealing with the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for the previous Government and what that Government did.  In <Col N="1538" /> reply to a question by the Deputy some time back I mentioned we had a survey proceeding and the results of that survey are now to hand and regulations will issue shortly.</P>
