    <Title>Wealth Tax Bill, 1975: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was beaten by the clock on the last occasion I was dealing with the overall principle of wealth tax and seeking to establish that the most objectionable aspect of it is in the main the fact that it is a new tax.  It is just another new tax, no matter how anybody may try to justify it and an effort has been made to justify it on the grounds that other countries have it.  This does not make it any the less another form of taxation. It may be a bit restricted in its application at the moment in the same way as every new tax is initially restricted <Col N="268" /> in order to sell it.  The vehicle for its collection has been established and that vehicle may be enlarged at any time in order to widen its scope.</P>
      <P>Any new tax in a country that has not yet reached development but has, on the contrary, reached a stage at which its development has had a serious setback should not at this time contemplate imposing a new tax of any kind.  There are those who talk about the social conscience and the redistribution of the national wealth.  I have repeated here time and again that the most important thing in redistributing national wealth is ensuring first of all that there is national wealth.  One must always keep a very watchful eye on the likelihood of anything happening which would injure the creation of wealth particularly its production and the concommitant development of the economy, which not only takes up the slack in unemployment but also takes up the growing population we hope to be able to maintain, and leaves more money actually available for redistribution. It is in that context one must view this wealth tax at this point of time as a tax brought in to milk the taxpayers of the last possible penny no matter how one may try to clothe it in the guise of something designed to help the weaker sections of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one looks at the domestic housekeeping generally one simply cannot agree with any member of the Government, least of all the Minister for Finance, that the economy or the domestic affairs of the country from the housekeeping point of view are being properly managed.  There is a growing deficit in the balance of trade about which we are doing nothing.  We tend to borrow more and more abroad against the advice of those who say we should not do it and in that borrowing we are further exacerbating what is already a serious problem.  We are mortgaging the future to such an extent that there is every likelihood that people will suffer once more the same gloom and despair they suffered under the previous Coalition Government.  A wealth tax introduced at a time when confidence is lacking, when there is great uncertainty, does nothing for that section which would be expected to <Col N="269" /> invest in order to develop the economy and create wealth along the lines on which we were moving in the last 15 or 20 years.  I see this wealth tax not as those who view it as if we had an inexhaustible pool of wealth on which we could continue drawing.  I believe, like Abraham Lincoln, that one does not help the poor by destroying the rich.  I do not believe this is the opportune time to bring in a tax of this kind.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the Bill and not to reintroduce it at least until such time as there is a greater degree of confidence in our economy.  By then it might be possible to have the people accept it in the knowledge that it would not have a crippling effect.  People are not being encouraged to invest in the economy and if company profits or the profits from any project or concern are not utilised for the expansion of that company or project the economy will sag.</P>
    <P>The Bill is ill-advised.  Perhaps it was brought in in desperation by a Government that are seeking to find money from any possible source. While there may be some effort to justify it on the grounds that other EEC countries operate such a tax system, I am very sceptical about it especially when I recall an examination that was carried out regarding VAT.  We were in Government at the time and we had available to us information regarding the operation of VAT in every other country. Consequently, we were in a position to decide on what was the best line to take.  My opinion was that we were somewhat premature with that tax, that people were not ready for it, but the advice at the time was that it was a new tax that would replace practically all other taxes, that it was the fairest type of tax because those who spent most paid most.  However, I was suspicious that it would not result in the removal of any form of tax that existed then.  My suspicions were proved right.  Not only are there many other forms of taxation but if the Government can think tomorrow of another one, it will be introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> While we look to other countries that are more developed than ours and which experience full employment except at occasional periods of recession, we are not in a comparable state and are not ready for taxes such as this.  Industry is not in a position to accept this tax.  There are already sufficient means of getting the money we require for redistribution from that dwindling section who are producing wealth.  We should begin to pay a little more attention to enabling them to continue to create the wealth which produces tax and which, also, enables them to expand.  The section at which this Bill is aimed is small in number while the number of people on the receiving side is great.</P>
    <P>The new national pay agreement will apply to about 500,000 people. There are another 100,000 in receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance. There are also the pensioners and those on other forms of State assistance.  In order to be able to maintain these benefits we must pay attention at some stage to the source from which these moneys come.  We must consider those who invest in the economy and we must encourage them in every way possible.  We must have regard, too, to the inflow of capital from abroad.  While present signs may not be too serious, they are pointing in the wrong direction. When I discuss the present state of the economy with people who are vital to the success of the country and with whom I had much contact in the past they recall that in 1957 everybody thought that this country had taken a nosedive from which it would never recover.  However, it did recover and this is the example that these people use when expressing confidence for the future.  They know that on that occasion there was a Fianna Fáil Government to take over and to manage the affairs of the State.  They know now, too, that there will be a Fianna Fáil Government to put the country back on the road once again. Anyone interested in investing here or in any country would have to look hard at the Opposition as well as at the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is this confidence that gives some hope for stability in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary in favour of wealth tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the people know that while they may suffer for a time in the present limbo, stability can be achieved in the future under Fianna Fáil.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is not keen on this tax either but he finds himself in the unfortunate position of living with a section who are, whether genuinely or otherwise, paying lip service to another ideology and who must show signs of having got their little bit here and there as the bandwagon moves on. This Bill is a contribution to the opposing ideologies of the two parties to the Coalition.  It is only by these means that the Coalition, comprised of opposing sections, can hang together. While they are able to give a bit here and there to the people and keep each other happy and so they can say to the people that they are getting on, that they can continue, but somebody suffers in the end.</P>
      <P>My view on the wealth tax is that it is premature and that it is being brought in at a time when there is a complete lack of confidence in the economy which does not justify it being brought in at all.  It is dangerous at any time.  We have enough means to claw back from the people who create wealth.  If it is not completely taken off the Statute Book this Bill should be withdrawn until the economic climate is more conducive to putting another tax on the people.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Bill from the Opposition side has proceeded largely on the basis, described now by Deputy Brennan, that it represents a surrender by one side of the National Coalition to the other, that it represents the outcome of what are nationally damaging tensions within the Government and so forth.  The <Col N="272" /> history of this Bill has been a very interesting exercise in democratic Government and has had some lessons to teach about democratic opposition also.  It is true that this Government, like any Government, contains a spectrum of opinion both in the Government strictly speaking and in the Government more loosely speaking consisting of the Deputies, Senators, county councillors and rank and file members who support the Government. In any Government the spectrum of opinion is condensed in our process into light of a constant strength.</P>
      <P>The difference between a one-party Government and a Coalition Government is that in a one-party Government that process of condensation takes place&mdash;to use that idiotic expression&mdash;behind closed doors as though doors fulfilled any function unless they could be closed.  In a Coalition Government the likelihood is that that process of condensation will take place more in public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been speaking for less than a minute and I have been interrupted about six times.  I do not think I have mentioned the words &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo; yet let alone said anything rude about that party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Parliamentary <Col N="273" /> Secretary to say that he was interrupted six times is about 500 per cent exaggeration; typical Coalition policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Bill has to some extent taken place in public and the public have been able to see the opinions presented to the Government because various interests on one side or the other, favourable to a tough wealth tax, unfavourable to any kind of wealth tax, have publicly brought their point of view to bear.  The existence of that pressure in one direction or another has been no secret.  It would be pointless and of no advantage, even if it were true, for me to pretend that the Minister and the Government in the history of the process which has led up to this debate have not been listening to and been influenced by the opinions of the people who elected them. I will not pretend that because it is not true.  I do not agree and I do not see that the Government could sustain any harm through that admission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that a public process like this is beneficial to the people at large, that the spectrum of opinion which exists within a Government if intensified by the addition to it of elements from any side is likely to result in legislation which is generally acceptable and generally right.  It is more likely to result in that than if the process which culminates in a Bill goes on inside a Government or inside a single Department and in which there is little consideration with outside interests.  When the White Paper was published a year ago I gave some instances, conspicuous instances which have now faded into history though I have not forgotten them, where Fianna Fáil when in Government produced proposals in Bill form which they either had to abandon completely because their own grassroots revolted as in the case of the Criminal Justice Bill or had to proceed with on a heavily modified basis because the revolt from the entire people was so strong, namely, in the case of the Succession Bill, 1965.  It is true that the wealth tax proposals now before the Dáil are nothing like as severe as the wealth tax proposals <Col N="274" /> contained in the White Paper a year ago.</P>
    <P>I noticed that a Labour Party Senator said the other day that the Wealth Tax Bill had been devitalised because of what he called pressure from big businessmen, affluent Fine Gael TDs and so on.  I would say to that Senator in a comradely spirit that he is wrong in thinking that the pressure came from affluent Fine Gael TDs or big businessmen.  I know he is wrong because I had the experience last year of attending constituency conventions and annual meetings of my own party at which not a single person could be described as an affluent or big businessman.  There were meetings in country constituencies which were largely attended by farmers, probably the bigger type of farmer but they were men who would not recognise themselves under the description implicitly given them by Senator Mullen.</P>
    <P>It was in part the opinion and the feelings of this section of the people &mdash;which is not a contemptible section and which I refuse to agree is in any way deserving of less consideration than anybody else&mdash;which led the Minister and the Government to do what they impliedly promised to do, to look again at the proposals in the light of representations which they received by the end of June last.  It was expressly stated in the White Paper that anybody who wished to comment on the proposals had three or four months to do so.  In the end the proposals were modified.</P>
    <P>These were not the only type of pressures we had to deal with or the only kind of comments made on the proposals.  When the White Paper was issued Deputy Haughey, who was then roosting on the back benches of the Opposition but who was generally regarded as being the final court of appeal in all matters financial and fiscal, was reported in the papers early in March of last year as saying that the wealth tax proposals amounted to the abolition of private property. Everyone is inclined to discount political criticism when it is of an exaggerated kind.  I may be over solemn in saying that everybody took Deputy <Col N="275" /> Haughey's words at their face value but there would have been a section in the community&mdash;again, by no means a contemptible section&mdash;which would have come to associate Deputy Haughey with experience in business and would have been very alarmed by that kind of language.</P>
    <P>I admit I have heard no more of that kind of language since the revised proposals were put forward and Deputy Colley abstained from using any such language in his Second Stage speech last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Haughey said was true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He abstained from using expressions of that kind.  That was the kind of deliberately alarmist atmosphere in which the Government were obliged to consider the proposals before announcing their modifications. At any rate they were modified and the Bill now before the House represents the result of the consideration the Government gave to the numerous representations made to them.</P>
      <P>This Wealth Tax Bill, line for line, is not something the Coalition parties undertook to produce before the last election, but this fact is lost sight of even though the Minister for Finance relentlessly reminds people of it.  In the nature of things a programme put forward at an election cannot spell out, line for line, all the points and the parties have not the time to work out, line for line, details of a proposal of this kind.  The 14-point programme which Fine Gael and Labour put before the people in February, 1973, undertook to do away with estate duties and to replace them with a different form of taxation.  What the 14-point programme actually said was: &ldquo;With a view to relieving the heavy and unjust burden on ordinary house purchasers and farmers, the National Coalition Government will abolish estate duties on property passing on death to windows and their children and replace them with taxation confined to the really wealthy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was set out in simple language and if ever a Government had a mandate <Col N="276" /> for doing this this Government had such a mandate.  I remember clearly that programme being put together, and I remember the unanimity with which Fine Gael Deputies, some of them from the constituencies where there was so much disquiet when the White Paper first emerged, attached terrific importance to this proposal. They said the then Government had delayed far too long in the abolition of estate duties or death duties and had allowed fearful hardship and injustice to develop, particularly after the rise in the value of agricultural land which was associated with our accession to the EEC.  Although our joining the Community made a difference to the prospective value of agricultural products, it had a much more pronounced difference in the capital value of land for which the widow of a farmer suddenly found herself liable to pay estate duty.  I recall the unanimity with which that proposal was greeted by Fine Gael Deputies and the Government are perfectly entitled to say that they are only doing what they said they would do.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I heard Deputy Dockrell say here last week that he was not sent here by the people to do something over and above that.  This is an important point and those who think this Bill is not going far enough might be reminded of it, in a comradely spirit.  I notice that Senator Mullen in the speech I mentioned a short time ago which was delivered in Mitchelstown and reported on 8th March&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Parliamentary Secretary but it is a convention of the House that we do not reflect on Members of the Upper House.  Reference to Senators, either by way of praise or blame, should not be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for having referred specifically to the Senator but his words fairly represent a point of view that exists in some circles of the Labour Party.  We have been hearing from the Opposition that the Bill will be a disaster because it will destroy something or other, but there is the other opinion that the Bill will be a <Col N="277" /> disaster because it does not go far enough.  This latter point of view, which I was about to cite because it had been put in a nutshell was to the effect that the Government now have an opportunity to break up the vast accumulations of wealth this country is supposed to contain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain people have taken the view that the Government were not availing of the opportunity. My reply, uttered in a friendly spirit, to criticism of that kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary on two occasions has referred to a comradely spirit&mdash;that is certainly more apt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply to such criticism from an ally in Government is that this Government did not go to the country on the platform of destroying private property or of breaking up accumulations of wealth.  The Government went to the country on the platform of replacing a particular form of taxation by another form of taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not replacing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be possible to convince the people that the right thing to do was to break up capital and redistribute it all.  That is a perfectly respectable, indeed an old-fashioned, political proposition.  It is within the law of the country to advance that proposition and to invite people to vote for it but that did not happen in February, 1973.  The people were not invited to vote for such a radical measure and to imply, merely because the last Government were replaced by the present Government, there is now an opportunity to put through a measure of this kind, while well-intentioned, takes no account of the political reality on which this Government is founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is any comfort to those who think the Bill is a threat to the productive and beneficial accumulation of capital, I do not mind being on record as saying that whatever may be the theoretical virtues of the idea <Col N="278" /> that wealth should be constantly redistributed and should never be accumulated in large quantities, this Government have no such mandate for that operation.  The Government never pretended to have such a mandate and this Bill does not present that operation.  In spite of what Deputy Haughey may have said originally about the White Paper, it does not aim at the abolition of private property.  If it did so it would mean the Government were doing something extremely radical, even revolutionary in its economic and social implications, for which they had not asked the people's permission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Government were doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point on which the Opposition and the Government disagree.  I do not read the Bill in that light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, it is open to the Opposition to represent it in that light.  I must say in fairness to Deputy Colley that he did not go that far in his Second Stage speech.  I know it has been said by supposedly responsible people on the other side that the Government, in obedience to the dictation of the Labour Party, are doing something for which they were not given permission by the people.  That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I heard Deputy Crinion say in this House that the Labour tail was wagging the Fine Gael dog.  That is not so.  The easiest way of proving him wrong is to confront him with the statements of the kind I tried to introduce here from people in the Labour Party&mdash;I think they are in a small minority&mdash;who believe the Government are not going far enough.  On the one hand the few gentlemen I have in mind&mdash;they might be regarded as being on the left&mdash;are saying the Labour Party have been submerged and, on the other hand, Deputy Crinion is saying that Fine Gael are being submerged. There could be no better proof that the Government's measure represents a fair and honest attempt to do what <Col N="279" /> the Government were elected to do&mdash; no more and no less.  To that extent, I suppose it could be described as a &ldquo;middle-of-the-road&rdquo; measure.  Such a measure always means that people on the outskirts, on either side of the spectrum, will be dissatisfied but that is unavoidable.  What gives me confidence that the Government are doing the right thing is when I observe the mutually, quite incompatible and contradictory criticisms the Government are encountering from various sides for doing what they are now trying to do.</P>
    <P>The death duties which the Government are in process of replacing with the wealth tax were and are a severe, erratic and unjust burden.  Although I have heard a good deal about the effect this Bill will have on the productive employment of capital, it is not without interest that I had a letter not long ago from a man I have not seen for a long time but whom I knew when I was a schoolboy, whose family own a business which naturally I will not identify in the House.  It is a very well-known business in one part of the country.  Perhaps it would be going too far to say that it is a household word; it is not that; but it is a well-known and very long established Irish business.  This man's father died some years ago and he and the rest of his family are faced with a crippling bill in death duties which they simply have not got the money to pay.  They have a business which employs a lot of people but they cannot raise the money to pay this sum in death duties.  This man, who is an industrialist, who is an employer, who is the kind of person on whose behalf tears have been wept from the Opposition benches since this debate began, said in the course of his letter to me, in referring to the condition in which his own family found itself through the incidence of death duties, that &ldquo;it is ironic that this injustice appears about to be put right next April&rdquo;.  That is an industrialist. He is not running out of the country because the wealth tax is on its way but he was damn nearly driven out of it on account of the way that death duties operated on himself and <Col N="280" /> his family and even now his situation is a critical one.</P>
    <P>Death duties and estate duties, in fact, whether we like it or not, are a form of wealth tax or property tax. They are a property tax which is collected only once in a generation and they are a property tax the incidence of which is erratic and unjust, for this reason, that careful accounting, careful planning, enabled one with perfect legality to avoid paying death duties at all or to avoid paying the better part of them.  I emphasise &ldquo;perfect legality&rdquo; because I do not want to be taken as throwing any scorn on people who have availed of the law, as was their 100 per cent right to do, to avoid the payment of death duty by making this, that or the other disposition which the law regarded as perfectly legitimate.  I do not criticise them at all but I do say that the thing was erratic and unjust because a family in which there were no unexpected or premature deaths and in which there was the level of foresight, prudence and education&mdash;it has got something to do with education&mdash; which in turn, in the past, has had something to do, I suppose, with relative privilege, was able to make and had the knowledge and the incentive to make provision for the perfectly lawful avoidance of this particular tax.  A family where perhaps youth and the neglect of the certainty of death, which is a characteristic of youth, prevented or inhibited such arrangements from being made, and which was subsequently deprived of the father who, I suppose, in most cases is the man who owns the property, might find itself literally on the street or on the road.  That was unjust and erratic.  There is no other word for it.  It was condemned often enough in this House from both sides.  Deputy Crowley knows that perfectly well. It was a property tax but it was a property tax of a hit-and-miss kind and this Government in replacing it, as they undertook to do before they were elected, by a tax which will have an impact only on the very wealthy are abolishing something which was erratic, which was an object of universal detestation, and are replacing it with something that is rational.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> We are, of course, under criticism from people who feel that a lot more should be done, that we have retreated in the face of pressure from the so-called affluent Fine Gael TDs, and the like, and that we should be doing something a good deal more drastic. As I say, that is a respectable political proposition.  It is a very old-fashioned one and is perfectly open for debate but I think every country is a separate case.  While I know that anyone arguing along the lines that I am going to argue must expect people to say that he is arguing the case of his own class or caste, or section, be that economic section, or whatever it is&mdash;I do not mind that&mdash;and while I realise that danger is there, I have to say that most of the people in this country who are well-off or rich&mdash;there is a distinction between the two&mdash;are not rich or well-off in consequence of wealth inherited through the operation of a closed caste system based on deliberate exclusion of one kind of person from the opportunities which life offered and the heaping of those opportunities on another kind of person.  They are not well-off for that reason; they are well-off for quite a different reason and it is a reason which does not have to be apologised for.  I would be sorry if the day should come that one did have to apologise for it.</P>
    <P>If anyone in this House cast his eyes around the range of people in this country who by Irish standards would be well-off, professional people, business people, the bigger farmers and so on, he will see that the parents or at most the grandparents of these people in nearly all cases were people of very simple, not to say humble origin and the thing which has made a difference over the space of one or two generations&mdash;not more, because we were all poor 100 years ago, or nearly all of us&mdash;has been a combination of certainly inherited &ldquo;what it takes&rdquo; and, I suppose, a measure of aggressiveness&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to come to that.  I quite agree.  These are God-given <Col N="282" /> attributes and carry with them the duty to help people who are not so gifted&mdash;I believe that as well&mdash; a combination of that with the very thing that Deputy Crowley mentioned, thrift, and hard work.</P>
      <P>In our parents' and grandparents' time hard work and thrift were held up to children from the moment they were able to understand such words as desirable approaches to life and a desirable way to live one's life.  One was taught to be hard working and thrifty.  There are many, many thousands of people in this country today who live in comfortable circumstances who in their turn for the most part are also hard working and thrifty but who got something of a start in life, not because they were Anglo-Irish, not because they were Protestants in a nation where the Catholics never got a chance and not for the reasons which may have operated in the eighteenth century.  They are where they are because their parents or grandparents worked, or both generations worked, and saved instead of idling and spending.</P>
      <P>That may be a displeasing point of view to push to the people who are anxious to break up accumulations of wealth but it is true, I believe.  I have seen too many examples of it in my personal vicinity among my own friends and acquaintances and every Deputy knows examples of this kind.</P>
      <P>It is wrong for the critics of this Government on the left, if I may put it that way, to leave that out of account because to use language about accumulations of wealth and about big business and so forth, is as much as to say that we ought to apologise for the fact that parents or grandparents exercised qualities which were held up to them as virtues and which I still believe are virtues.</P>

      <P>I cannot see that we owe any apology to anybody or that the generations that have gone before us owe an apology for having saved money instead of spending it prodigally or in forms of momentary enjoyment when it might have been kept, <Col N="283" /> as it was kept in a lot of cases, to make life easier for their children.</P>
      <P>You cannot eradicate this desire of parents.  Deputy Dockrell spoke last week about the squirrel instinct.  I would like to mention another instinct which is too often left out of account by the theorists.  You cannot destroy the wish of parents to make things better for their children than they had them themselves.  Nothing will destroy that.</P>
      <P>I read with the greatest interest a couple of years ago of a trial taking place in Moscow of professors in the Moscow Polytechnic.  They were being tried on a charge of taking bribes to pass students in the entrance examination to that polytechnic.  The significance of the bribes in the entrance examination is that the Moscow Polytechnic, for a wide range of people, is a certain route to a white-collar job.  Success or failure in that entrance examination meant the difference for the children of these parents between a white-collar as distinct from a blue-collar job.  It was alleged that the professors had a going rate of 100 roubles per subject&mdash;there were four subjects for the entrance examination and a student who failed all four of them could still get in via one of these corrupt professors if his parents could produce 400 roubles.  I do not know how the trial ended; that is not important. What is important is that despite two generations of revolution and indoctrination, despite two generations of official persuasion of something which in fact I believe to be true, that a man doing a blue-collar job is in no way inferior to a man doing a white-collar job&mdash;I believe that is true and I would never lend myself to any system or pretence that it was otherwise &mdash;in spite of that official line, which is driven home with the greatest severity and consistency in a communist country, the idea was still ineradicable with these Moscow parents 55 years later, who perhaps had to work in dirty manual jobs, that they would do their best, even if it meant bribing a professor, to make sure that their children would have a better deal than they had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> That may be very blameworthy in the eyes of the ideologist; it is all very sad and no doubt is a grave weakness and a grave departure from ideological rectitude on the part of these parents that they could not see that a tough manual job is just as good for their children as one in which they use their minds more than their hands. This is very blameworthy, but it is part of human nature and nothing can more clearly demonstrate how ineradicable it is than its survival in this acute form in a communist country 55 years after their revolution.  I will not judge whether or not we ought to be re-educating people along the lines of not caring what kind of job their children have.  It would be an insane thing to do.  It has demonstrably failed, as the example I have just given shows, in Russia and it cannot succeed here either.</P>
    <P>That leads me to think that so far from being a defect in the human being that should be apologised for and eradicated if possible it is a sign of something which is basic in a human being, namely affection for his children and a desire to do his best for them.  If that best is measured in terms of trying to give them a launching pad in life, without implying any exploitation of others, or any wish to exploit others, I cannot blame it.  I believe the majority of the wealth of this country&mdash;admittedly not all of it &mdash;is in the hands of people who, without any intention to exploit others, and without doing so&mdash;except on an interpretation of the economic process which I do not subscribe to&mdash;have built up over a couple of generations a situation where their offspring or descendants are in a more comfortable and secure condition than they themselves.  For a Government to overturn that way of doing things, that approach to life, if it can be overturned, which I do not believe, would be as much as any Government possibly could undertake to do.  In other words, there is no measure more far-reaching that I can think of except possibly the prohibition of religion or something of that kind, that any Government could possibly undertake than the destruction of, firstly, the instinct <Col N="285" /> of people to save and be thrifty and secondly, the instinct to pass the benefits of that to their children.</P>
    <P>I do not think that can be done, but if a Government were to attempt to do it, they would be attempting a measure as wide-ranging and as revolutionary as it is possible to conceive. A Government cannot do that kind of thing unless they have a clear popular mandate to do so.  Certainly if they do not have to rely on the people's votes they can do it.  A Government which relies merely on force can attempt anything, but a Government that know they have to go back to the people in a matter of months or years cannot and ought not undertake that kind of thing.  This Government, despite what has been said about them, are not undertaking that kind of thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should add as an appendix to that that the reverse process holds true.  The Irish seanfhocal &ldquo;trí ghlúin ó rí go ránn&rdquo;&mdash;three generations downwards from a king to a shovel, expresses in a few words the truth that of course wealth can be dissipated over a couple of generations as easily as it can be accumulated.  We know of examples of that too.  The best that any Government who depend on the votes of people can do is to deal fairly and justly with the people under their control, to take money from them in taxation, however that taxation may be contrived or constructed, in order to help people who, because of the fact that God has not given them the same gifts as their neighbours, have not got what it takes to survive in the race of life or who, because of handicap, age, disability or misfortune, are unable to provide for themselves properly.  That duty is inescapable. I accept it.  Not only do I accept it but I stand 100 per cent <Col N="286" /> behind the compassionate end of any Government who say: &ldquo;Look, you have more than you need and we will take the surplus from you in order to look after the people that life has dealt with more harshly than with you&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to express another instinctive feeling of mine about the Irish people. I believe they will go a very long way if led&mdash;not driven&mdash;and persuaded. There is no limit to the distance they will go in the relief of hardship, in the making up to a person for a handicap which God has laid on him, so far as money or care can make it up.  There is almost literally no limit to what you will persuade or lead Irish people to do in the line of what some people may dismiss as cold charity but which is in fact in recognition of simple justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this Bill and the whole complex of measures which the Government are promoting to do what was very much overdue, to recast our tax legislation, represent an attempt to lead the people in the direction I am talking about.  To the extent that it has caused annoyed reaction, it may be that the persuasion part of the operation has not been as smooth as it might have been.  I am sure this total package of legislation will have rough corners or sharp edges on it which will have, with the maximum speed and compassion, to be filed down and smoothed away.  I have no doubt whatever that this Government will do this.  I will do the Opposition the credit of saying that if they found themselves with legislation of this kind on their hands, as I suppose they may do one day if they return to this side, they would also do their best to smooth away rough corners or sharp edges.  When any major legislative revolution is going on there is the danger that some hazard is insufficiently appreciated by the Government, that it is not as well appreciated by a Government as by some of the people who will be affected by it.  Of course, that danger exists but this Bill still has a long way to go in this House and in the other House.  Even when it is law it is not the end of the world.  If there are things in it which are detrimental, which are unfair, unworkable <Col N="287" /> or any of the other things that have been said about it, this Government does not consist of ideologues, madly intent only on the achievement of a political proposition and to hell with the reality of human beings, business, agriculture and so forth.  It does not consist of people like that, and it will certainly do whatever it considers necessary to remedy any difficulties which the Bill, when law, may contain for anybody.  The acid test of any measure, legislative or otherwise, in a democratic State when you are dealing with a democratic Opposition is whether you would repeal or reverse this, that or the other measure if you were in power tomorrow, next week or next month. That test is unavoidable.  You cannot get out of it, you cannot insure against it, you cannot duck it.  You have to face that question.  I have put that question across the floor of the House and elsewhere indirectly to the Opposition time and again in regard to various measures which were called impossible, such as the removal of VAT from food.  There is a long list of such measures with which I will not bore the House.  I have repeatedly said to the Opposition: &ldquo;You have done enough talking about how bad, unworkable and nationally damaging this, that and the other is&mdash;making farmers over a certain limit liable to income tax in the same way as everybody else, taking the compulsory Irish out of the Civil Service and out of the schools system.  You are full of criticism of these measures but will you give a firm undertaking to reverse them if you are back in power tomorrow?&rdquo; I am still waiting for the answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to a single one of those questions.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Opposition attitude to this Wealth Tax Bill has not been that the Bill is bad from top to bottom.  As far as I can understand it, the line taken by Deputy Colley and Deputy Brennan is more to the effect that it is inopportune at this time so, perhaps, to ask the Opposition this question is a little unfair.  Having admitted that, I will have to ask them if this Bill goes through and if they find themselves in Government again next <Col N="288" /> week or next month, will they give the people a firm undertaking before they present themselves for election to repeal this Wealth Tax Bill and go back to the old system of death duties. Since the parliamentary opposition to the Bill has been a somewhat more qualified one I recognise that the answer might not be a straight &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; but it is a question which anybody considering this debate must regard as essentially one which the Opposition must answer.  If an election comes up next week or next month when the Opposition review the measures which this Government have applied, will they reverse the ones they have criticised?  I would particularly like to know whether, assuming this Bill becomes law, the Opposition are going to commit themselves, if not to repealing it outright at least to introducing an amending Bill which would suspend its operation for a year, two years or three years, and will they reintroduce and continue as from 1st April the death duties in the old form. Until we get a satisfactory answer to that I think we are entitled to write off what we have heard from the other benches as opposition for opposition's sake.</P>
    <P>I have expressed here this morning points of view about wealth, about the capitalist society, about the kind of people I believe the Irish people are, which I suppose are conventional enough.  Deputy Crowley took it upon himself to say, before I stood up, that I did not support the wealth tax.  He is wrong.  I do support it.  I am not a financial or industrial expert and I will not offer a judgment, therefore, on the criticisms which have come from the Confederation of Irish Industry or other sources although I recognise that they must be taken seriously and I have no doubt that the Minister will take them seriously.  I see in the Bill nothing like the monster which the Opposition have conjured up and which individuals outside the House have conjured up.  I see it as being an attempt to discharge a duty which the people implicitly laid on us at election time.  If the Bill goes too far, if it is damaging, if its bad effects are more numerous than its good ones, I have absolutely no doubt that it will <Col N="289" /> in time, perhaps rapidly enough, be amended or adapted, but a Government cannot be blown about by every wind of criticism.  It has to take its stand and do what it thinks right.  It cannot be chopping and changing every day of the week.  We have already had a fairly substantial modification of the original proposals and the Bill now before the House represents a considered attempt to reconcile the points of view, the valid points of view, which the Government have received from all sides.  For that reason I support the Bill, not merely as a matter of party discipline, but with conviction; and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach speak for the past three quarters of an hour, I am reinforced in my belief that the Parliamentary Secretary is a very honest, upright and, indeed, rational man and I only wish that instead of being Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach he were Minister for Finance.  If he were the Minister for Finance I certainly would not have the fears I have now of that type of Bill.  I found myself in agreement with practically his entire speech.  Everything he said was, in my opinion, absolutely authentic, especially where he referred to the Irish paternal attitude in wanting to hand down to their children something that, perhaps, they did not have without a lot of thrift and hard work and wanting to do the best they can for their children.  I agreed with Deputy Haughey's original statement when the White Paper on the Wealth Tax was first published that this was the end of free enterprise in the country. I think the Parliamentary Secretary acknowledged that on such a fundamental change as the abolition of the free enterprise system the Government had not a mandate to carry out that kind of economic upheaval in the country.  I think people were right to speak out and those outside the House who spoke out against it deserve to be congratulated.  They highlighted the drastic consequences which could result if the White Paper <Col N="290" /> were implemented as a Bill in this House.</P>
      <P>We all recognise that the Parliamentary Secretary with his legal training uses words very carefully. He used the phrase &ldquo;the replacement of death duties&rdquo; as one of the 14 points in the Coalition's manifesto before they went to the country in the last general election.  If I remember rightly, they promised&mdash;and they promised it verbally because I heard them with my own two ears&mdash;the abolition of death duties.  They never talked about the replacement of death duties.  We all realise that, if you abolish a certain source of revenue to the Exchequer, you have to look around for alternative sources of revenue.  In fairness to the people at that time, that should have been put clearly before them.  Farmers in my own area voted for the Coalition on that issue alone.  They are now very disillusioned with the whole charade being conducted by the Coalition.</P>
      <P>The greatest danger I can see in the introduction of wealth taxes or, indeed, any type of what I can only describe as ideological taxes, is that they do not just affect the wealthy person, because the wealthy person can liquidate his assets and take them out of the country and the country loses forever the benefit of that capital.  The first person to suffer is the humblest worker because unemployment is created immediately.  Unemployment starts at the bottom and works its way up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are right on this side of the House in saying that, while the present Bill is not all that Draconian and bears no relationship to the original White Paper, this is not the time for the introduction of such a Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary may well ask what is the right time for the introduction of any form of taxation.  You need never fear the introduction of new taxation where you have an economic boom, where you have progress and prosperity, and where you have more or less full employment. It is absolutely vital that we should have an inflow of foreign capital continuously to make available, through the banks or through some of the <Col N="291" /> financial institutions, capital by way of loans or, in some cases, grants to various enterprises who badly need capital.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is also perfectly right in saying that the communist system has failed and that we must preserve the private enterprise system.  Taking Russia as an example, various Russians have little plots of land, little gardens, which make up something like ½ per cent of the total acreage of Russia and, yet, on that ½ per cent of land one-third of the vegetables in Russia are grown.  This is a phenomenal statistic.  To me it is the greatest possible condemnation of the whole socialistic or communistic attitude to property and to wealth.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Parliamentary Secretary this morning, I felt very reassured that at least we have one man with access to the Government who is not involved in what I can only describe as the political twilight in the Cabinet.  We all know the clichés which are thrown out especially by the Labour members of the Coalition: &ldquo;We will tax the speculators.  We will get at the wealthy man.  We will give to the poor.&rdquo;  Nobody disagrees fundamentally with having a more just society and with redistribution of wealth but I would be very seriously worried about the system involved in the redistribution of wealth.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Irish people will ever opt for a system where we have not a free choice under a free enterprise system.  I do not think that will ever change, although one cannot predict the future.  One can only make judgments on one's own background and one's own beliefs.  If we are to take into account the slogans coming from the Labour Party, to fulfil their aims would require a redistribution and an economic upheaval at least every 12 months.  As the Parliamentary Secretary so rightly said, all people are born different.  Some are given more talents than others.  Some are given the gift of enterprise more than others; and others, with the best will in the world, have not got the talent or the ability to make it on their own.  Therefore, they need help <Col N="292" /> from the State.  Everybody encourages that.  It is only right that the less well off members of the community should be looked after to the best of the State's ability to pay.</P>
    <P>My greatest fear would be that, in in the pursuit of this type of ideology, we would cause economic chaos with the result that everybody would be affected.  It is important that we, as the Opposition, should at all times highlight the inadequacies of the Government as we see them, and criticise legislation as strongly as we can if we see flaws in it.  The Parliamentary Secretary asked if we were in Government would we change this Bill.  That is a very hypothetical question and, as he said himself, you cannot gives a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or a &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer.  I do not think we would be against the principle. I know we would not be against the principle of the redistribution of wealth under controlled circumstances.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> As Deputy Crowley said, there does not seem to be much of interest by Government Deputies, particularly those of the Labour Party, in this Bill.  One thing I am happy about as regards the various tax proposals before the House is that the Bills to implement them will not have to be put through before Easter.  At one stage we were left with the impression that the Wealth Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Finance Bills would have to be through the House before the Easter holidays.  We have been told now that that is not so.  I am glad of that because they are complicated measures which will have to be studied properly in Committee.  That can be a time-consuming occupation and it is heartening to learn that they will not be put through in a hurry because ordinary Deputies will find it very difficult to digest their implications.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for financial experts and lawyers to try to understand these complicated measures.  We know how complicated the Capital Gains Tax Bill is and the one now before us is also very complicated.  I often wonder whether the expert advice available to the Government could not be made available to this side so that we would know exactly what Bills of this type contain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I was saying, I am glad these Bills are not to be rushed through the House.  There is no possibility of the Capital Gains Tax Bill being finalised before Easter and neither could the Bill we are now discussing be rushed through.  The Second Stage of the Finance Bill has been completed and <Col N="294" /> after Easter we can sit down and study it section by section.</P>
    <P>The Wealth Tax Bill is part of the package contained in the White Paper issued on 28th February, 1974. We know what it is supposed to replace: death duties are to be abolished in April.  That is another welcome feature.  Since I came into the House I have been saying publicly that that was an unjust tax which always struck at a time when families were at their weakest, when widows were confronted with the task of trying to find this tax.  We have seen businesses getting into terrible trouble because of it. Once I was executor of a will and I saw a widow having to find £6,000 to pay this tax.  Any measure aimed at abolishing it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The amount of tax collected in death duties was £12 million to £14 million.  I agree that that amount had to be compensated for in the budget but I do not agree with the method being employed here.  Fianna Fáil put forward proposals for the collection of this £14 million.  We proposed that proper capital gains and capital acquisition legislation would be sufficient, but if such legislation fell short by any fraction, it would be infinitesmal in a budget of this year's size, £1,200 million.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the measure now before us will collect that amount. However, that is not my objection to it.  I am looking at how it will affect the business outlook.  Business people must be assured that they will be rewarded for their endeavours and it will be a bad day if business people have to say: &ldquo;Why should I make an endeavour?  Why should I not finish work at 5 o'clock and go out to play golf?&rdquo;  Numerous people can afford to do that, but much of the endeavour and the thinking that goes into business expansion are done far beyond ordinary working hours&mdash;there is no 9 to 5 in a businessman's life.  In framing our fiscal policies we must think along these lines.</P>
    <P>We have no objection to the distribution of wealth, but logically wealth must be created before it can be distributed.  You cannot expand a social policy without first expanding the social economy.  You must put people <Col N="295" /> to work.  It is only in that way that you can expand the social arm and uplift the old age pensioner, the widow and orphan and the disabled.</P>
    <P>There is no man unemployed in Dublin today who would not prefer to be back in a decent job.  The ambition of a wage-earner is to get a decent job with security and what is lacking today is that wage-earners are afraid in their jobs&mdash;is there guaranteed continuity for them, or is confidence being undermined?  Will they be unemployed next week?  This is what the worker is afraid of.</P>
    <P>We must in no way deter or discourage the expansion of our industrial arm because if we do we will run into deep trouble and obviously we will not be able to meet our social commitments.  If our economic arm contracts and industries close down, naturally there will be less money in circulation from the consumption point of view where indirect taxation is concerned. There will be less money also from direct taxation in so far as income tax is concerned.  Naturally also that will have an adverse effect on the amount of money available for distribution to the social welfare sector of the community and that is what we are trying to achieve in the distribution of wealth.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this wealth tax will distribute equitably the wealth of the country.  If we consider how it will operate in regard to distribution of wealth, we will find that the thresholds are quite large.  We must remember that factor.  I agree that the thresholds are quite generous.  For example, there is a threshold of £100,000, and we have agricultural land valued at only 50 per cent.  Therefore, I am convinced that will exempt a considerable number of farmers.  So also will it exempt a considerable number of smallholders and shopkeepers.  If we exempt such people, the self-employed and those employing very small numbers, at whom then are we directing the wealth tax?  We will be directing the wealth tax at people who are expanding industry and creating jobs.  It cannot be directed at any <Col N="296" /> other section of the community.  Is it more important that such people be left with a sufficient amount of capital with which to expand their businesses and create employment than to take it from them when there will be a contraction of industry and more unemployment?  That is a balance we must strike.  We must try to decide whether or not it will be worth what we will get.  If I thought this would produce £100 million, then I might consider it and say: &ldquo;Yes, without affecting industry or the employment situation&rdquo;.  But I believe it can have a psychological effect which would far outweigh any gain in revenue.</P>
    <P>We should be endeavouring to encourage people to expand, making it worth their while to do so and if at all possible to create new employment. That is what the whole exercise of a good economy is about.  We must try to generate confidence abroad.  It is quite obvious there is not sufficient wealth in the country with which to expand industry.  That is one thing about which we must make up our minds.  As much as I should like to see the greater part of Irish industry in Irish hands, I cannot see that happening.  Therefore, our aim must be to attract new wealth to the country.  I wonder if we are going about it in the proper way.  We will have to establish what will be the pattern here if we are not to have massive unemployment.  We would need to look at the position obtaining in other EEC countries and observe the number of people engaged in industry as against agriculture there.  For the past 20 years here there has been a decline in the number of people engaged in agriculture and if that does the past 20 years here there has been a decline in the number of people engaged in agriculture and if that does not continue we will not be able to bring up our standard of living in line with that of other EEC countries.  We will have to get industry going, whether it be ancillary to agriculture or some other type.  On average the percentage of people employed in agriculture in other EEC countries is 10 per cent. That is a figure taken in 1971 and which demonstrates the pattern at that time.  The remainder were employed either in industry or the services.  In 1973 it was estimated that 25 per cent of our people were engaged in agriculture <Col N="297" /> It is quite obvious from the figures I have given that there will be a further shift to industry, businesses and services.</P>
    <P>We shall have to direct our attention along those lines in creating new jobs if there is not to be further emigration. Indeed, it was forecast recently, with regard to our future population, that we will require between 20,000 and 25,000 jobs per annum up to, I think, 1990.  I doubt very much if there is any hope of meeting that figure or of creating sufficient employment for the people who will be leaving agriculture.  If there is not that shift from the agricultural sector we will continue to be the most backward country of the EEC.  Their standards of living will be improving progressively while ours remain static. Therefore, we must consider the policies of creating new industries and getting more people employed in the services.  A lot of thought will need to be given as to how best we should achieve that aim.  Fiscal policies and these types of Bills will have an important bearing on it.  They will decide eventually whether or not we are progressing along the right lines.</P>
    <P>Were this Bill introduced when we had practically full employment, when we were highly industrialised, then I would welcome it.  Had we the concentration of capital over the past 100 years of some other EEC countries, then again I would welcome its introduction. Were we in that position, then I would say: &ldquo;By all means let us introduce a Bill such as this&rdquo;, when it would produce revenue.  But on the basis of present wealth in this country, with the thresholds contained in the White Paper it is debatable whether or not the amount of money accumulated for the Exchequer will work to the advantage of the economy in the long run.</P>
    <P>We are well aware of the advice given to the Government before Christmas.  Various industrialists and economists have pointed out in no uncertain fashion the state of industry today.  The Confederation of Irish Industry have made several submissions to the Minister for Finance as regards their position prior to the last budget.  We are aware of the position <Col N="298" /> in which they find themselves in regard to cash flow and liquidity.  We have only to look at many of their balance sheets to see the downward trend in profits.  It is not that the shareholders are getting less but rather the adverse effect it is having on the economy and the creation of more unemployment.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is not very fashionable to talk about a Bill such as this one at all.  There are very few votes to be got out of speaking against a Wealth Tax Bill.  It might be all right for the super-socialists who can talk about distributing wealth.  It is very popular to be uttering these socialist clichés. Provided you can project the right image as a socialist you can live as a capitalist.  Anyone speaking against this Bill is doing it because he is genuinely concerned that in the long-term it may not be beneficial to the country.  In the short-term, say, over the next three or four months, this will not show any adverse effects for the man in the street, but in the long-term I believe it will have an effect on our economic development.</P>
    <P>The Minister was advised before Christmas in relation to the budget and the problems firms would face in regard to cash flow and so on if something positive were not done.  I thought something positive would be done in the budget.  I do not intend to go into the budget now, but it is slightly relevant to this Bill.  What did these firms get?  They got deferred taxation of £12 million, which every businessman knew was of no significance. The real dishonesty of the situation is that six weeks later they are told an increased contribution to the stamp will cost £28 million extra. That is not what you would call helping industry in 1975.</P>
    <P>On top of that, industry will have to contend with this Bill, and three months after April they will be called upon to pay this tax.  I know many companies that are struggling at the moment to make ends meet. They are on the tightest possible margin and hoping to keep their employees at work.  Some of these companies can have a very high valuation as regards property and plant, but what <Col N="299" /> is the return?  If a company is making big profits I believe it should pay, but there is a mechanism to make it pay&mdash;company taxation.</P>
    <P>Wealth is accumulated in three ways and should be taxed in three ways.  When wealth is inherited there should be a capital acquisition tax, and it is intended to have such legislation later on.  When capital is disposed of there is a capital gains tax.  We did not object to the Capital Gains Tax Bill, although we objected to certain provisions in it and put forward other provisions which we thought would be more suitable to this economy. When capital is held it is worked, and a person is taxed through income tax or surtax, as the case may be.  If you go along those lines you will tax capital in all aspects.</P>
    <P>However, when you tax wealth on top of that, that is where the disincentive comes in.  When a person holds wealth within the State it should be the Government's duty to encourage the full expansion of that wealth by its utilisation, thus building up a sound economy.  Taking wealth away, slice by slice, has a depressing effect. Of course I do not believe this is a wealth tax at all; this is a property tax, whatever name you call it.  It is a tax on assets that are generating employment. I doubt very much that the policies being pursued by this Government over the past two years have been conducive to economic expansion.</P>
    <P>This tax is levied at 1 per cent right across the board.  There is different profitability among companies.  Some companies have a high concentration of labour and give a very low return on capital.  Other highly mechanised companies can have a low concentration of labour, and thus have high profitability.  This tax is levied irrespective of the profits achieved by a company or a person.  We have often spoken in the past of the injustice of the rates system, that people were obliged to pay regardless of their ability to pay.  There is a certain element of that here too.  This does not take into consideration one's <Col N="300" /> ability to pay.  It is automatically levied on property.</P>
    <P>Denmark has a wealth tax but they take into consideration a person's ability to pay.  The full impact of the wealth tax there will not be implemented unless profits are over 6 per cent.  There is merit in that type of proposal.  But to tax a person on a property which is not returning a very high profit is not a good idea.</P>
    <P>Many export companies here today may find it difficult to maintain employment because of the increased social welfare contributions being introduced on 1st April.  They will have to look at their costings to see if they can continue to be viable.  All these factors must be taken into account.  An employer told me last night that he is not in a position to pay the 10 per cent increase which came into operation on 1st March. He told the unions also of this unfortunate situation.  He further stated that with the increase in the stamp and wealth tax he will have to let four or five men go.  He can see no way out.  Most employers are in this unfortunate position.  There are 104,000 people unemployed.  It is all very well to boast about our great social welfare system, the amounts of money being paid to the unemployed and to those who become redundant and so forth, but they are no substitute for a good job.</P>
    <P>The duty of any government is to provide work for the people.  If any government fail to do that, or are not capable of doing it, they should give the job to another party who can.  Every government, are elected to generate prosperity, to create and guarantee employment. This Government have failed to generate confidence in the business community over the past two years. If anything, they have eroded confidence by pursuing certain policies&mdash; doctrinaire socialism, as it is called. This is doing a very great deal of damage.  It is undermining confidence at home and, I am sure, abroad.</P>
    <P>I was amused to read in the newspapers last week that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was in <Col N="301" /> America telling industrialists how we had doubled our exports to EEC countries over the past two years.  The Minister should go down to the Dáil library and read some of the statements made during the EEC debate. At that time we in Fianna Fáil were telling the people it was good for this country to join.  Now we have the Minister, Deputy Keating, telling the American industrialists what we gained from the EEC.  That is what I call double thinking.  We would not be in the EEC if the Minister for Industry and Commerce had had his way.  We would still be fighting for markets which we would not be able to find.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to look at the highly industrialised EEC countries who have not a wealth tax. Belgium is half the size of Ireland and has twice our population.  The headquarters of the EEC are situated there.  Every country in the world has offices there.  The cost of office blocks and property in Brussels is astronomical. That country is booming.  Yet, they have not got a wealth tax.  France does not have a wealth tax either. Because of their mineral wealth over the years they are in a far better position to carry a wealth tax than we are.  Italy does not have a wealth tax.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom have forgotten more about industrial development than we will learn for a long time yet.  There has been capital inflow into industry in England for the past 200 years.  They have been talking about introducing a wealth tax but they have not done it yet.  How will Irish companies fare against British companies or where will the transfer be after a number of years? It might not be too difficult to avoid a wealth tax then if our nearest neighbour has not got one.</P>
    <P>Belgium has coal mines, iron, steel, brewing, and textiles.  France also has textiles and huge technological investments from America.  These countries have vast wealth.  Italy has iron, zinc, marble, natural gases and cotton. These countries also have a large tourist trade.  Wealth is flowing into these countries.  I agree that the south of Italy is poor but there is real wealth <Col N="302" /> in the north because of industrial development. As I said, these countries do not have a wealth tax.</P>
    <P>Our super-socialists must jump first, even before our nearest neighbour.  If I were introducing a wealth tax I would wait until England had introduced hers first.  This Government might regret the day this tax was introduced.  The European countries already mentioned have regard for the distribution of wealth and a high standard of living.  Their social welfare systems are far better than ours.</P>
    <P>There are two ways of distributing wealth as there are two ways of making money and two ways of getting money to boost Exchequer funds. There is the way the Government take, namely, taxation&mdash;tax everything. That is the negative approach.  The positive approach is to create wealth and thereby create more jobs.  Workers will spend money and that money will come back to the Exchequer in both direct and indirect taxation.  That is how a country is built up.  The philosophy one should instil into people is that it is worth while working. The Government have opted for the lazy way, for taxation.  If we continue like this eventually there will be nothing left to tax.  That could happen. People can get tired of paying taxes especially if they have not got the ability to pay.  This is an important factor.  If we were a highly developed country industrially the people who will be affected by this legislation could carry the burden but they cannot carry it in our present state of economic development.  Our economy is at its weakest point.  We have a frightening unemployment problem with 104,000 people out of work.  This legislation will make no improvement in that situation.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce should get together and devise a policy aimed at expanding the economy.  A combined effort might result in something positive.  At the moment there is no positive approach.  This Bill will not create one new job.  It will not bring down the cost of living: if anything, it will increase the cost of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> A look into the minds of the directors of some of the big retail outlets in Dublin might be very interesting.  It is quite possible some firms will be valued at £8,000 or £9,000.  It does not take a great deal of arithmetic to figure out what the valuation will be with a threshold of £100,000.  Roughly it would be about £70,000 or £80,000. Does the Minister think that will be absorbed or will it be passed on to the consumer?  Let him consider that aspect to see what the effect will be on the cost of living.  Take any of the big firms, such as Jacobs, Mackintoshes and Seafield Fabrics, which is struggling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I do not want to have it both ways.  I am telling the Minister what the consequences will be.  Prices will be affected.  Prices will increase. There will be an effect on increasing production because otherwise people will take their money out completely; it will not be worth their while to leave it in.  I am speaking about firms on a tight margin.  The big firms will look at their costings and they will have their accountants.  The effect is bound to be adverse.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand section 3. Subsection (1) provides:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, the taxable wealth of an individual who is domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on the valuation date shall comprise all the property, wheresoever situate, to which he is beneficially entitled in possession on that date.</P>
      <P>I presume that is if the individual concerned has property in Japan, America, Britain and France.  Subsection (5) provides:</P>
      <P>... an individual who is not domiciled in the State on a valuation date and who has been ordinarily resident in the State for not less than seven out of the ten years immediately prior to that date shall be deemed to be domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on that valuation date;</P>
      <P>A great many of our companies were founded by foreigners who have companies in other countries as well as here.  Will their foreign assets be subject to wealth tax here?  Some years ago a Bill was introduced giving certain concessions, like tax holidays, to foreign industrialists who founded industries here.  On my reading of this Bill, it looks as if these foreign industrialists will be subject to this wealth tax.  In clause (ii) it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>an individual who was domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State <Col N="305" /> on a valuation date shall, notwithstanding that he ceased to be ordinarily resident in the State after that date, be deemed to be domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on the three valuation dates next following that valuation date:</P>
    <P>If a businessman leaves the State, does that mean his property abroad will be taxed on the three valuation dates next following that valuation date?  I do not expect that is what it means but it appears that way.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the Revenue Commissioners can value assets held abroad.  We have heard in the past of plans to provide aeroplanes for Ministers to travel to the various parts of the world but it will be the Revenue Commissioners who will need aeroplanes if they are to assess the value of assets held abroad.  If my understanding of the Bill is correct, it cannot be a workable piece of legislation. However I should like to hear the Minister's reply to this point.  A person domiciled here could have a factory in Chicago or New York or he could have a brewery in Nigeria.  Would it not be very difficult to assess the valuations of any such assets?  It would be interesting to hear how it is intended to extract a wealth tax in respect of such persons.</P>
    <P>This Bill is in no way designed to attract people from outside to invest here.  It is a means of penalising people, especially those who have been living here for the past seven or eight years. There are many aspects of this Bill which could be discussed more suitably on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the proposal to tax both private and public companies in the same way.  A public company pay their dividends and the money is spent by the shareholders, whereas a private company operate in an entirely different way.  Mostly they use the minimum amount of money and plough back the remainder into expansion. I know of one private company which, seven years ago, had a share capital of £120,000.  In their early stages they employed about 15 people and this figure has been increased in the meantime to its present strength of 45.  There are three or four shareholders.  The people who <Col N="306" /> invested in that company, with the exception of the manager, have not drawn any money from it during that time but have ploughed all the profits into expansion, the purchase of new plant and the expansion of an export market.  If this Bill goes through, a company such as that would not be wise in the future to act in this way. If the Minister wishes I can let him know the company to which I am referring.  By foregoing profits these people were helping to build up the nation.  Because of these Wealth Tax Bills the attitude will be to enjoy oneself, play golf and take holidays abroad.  This is the difference between the policy of Fianna Fáil and that of Fine Gael.  We have always encouraged people to work, to build up the State and to create more jobs.</P>
    <P>There will now be the danger that the average businessman will ensure that he remains below the threshold of £100,000 so as not to become involved in these wealth taxes.  Many companies and businesses who remain below that threshold will have greater net profits than those whose assets exceed the threshold.  Of course much would depend on the type of business concerned.</P>
    <P>I understood from the White Paper that this tax would not become payable until 1976-77 but it appears now that payment will have to be made from April, that is, the 1 per cent on assets assessed at April 1st will have to be paid within three months.  This will mean the submitting of thousands of accounts in that time, many of which will not be subject to wealth tax.  The Revenue Commissioners have to contend with a huge volume of taxation, but I wonder how they are expected to deal with these new taxes.  Have staff been recruited for this extra work?  There will be a massive amount of work to be done in the field of valuations and all cases will have to be examined to ascertain whether they are liable for the tax.  Can all this work be carried out within a few months?</P>
    <P>A big problem will be that of accurate valuations.  I doubt if anyone could give an accurate evaluation of his property today.  If, say, a business <Col N="307" /> were to be put on the public market and withdrawn at a certain figure but sold later at a higher or a lower figure, which figure would the Revenue Commissioners take for the purposes of assessment?  It is not a simple matter to value property in a depressed market.  If a property valued in April is sold 18 months later at a much higher figure, will the Revenue Commissioners seek back-tax, or in a reverse situation would they refund the extra amount that had been paid? These are some of the problems I see in relation to this Bill.  It is all right to say that payment must be made within three months of the valuation date, but does this mean that payment will be made in advance? Ordinary income tax in respect of businesses is usually paid within 12 months of the assessment date.  This is the way that business accounts are dealt with; but to pay three months after the day of assessment would mean paying nine months in advance. The business community today cannot meet their current demands in cash flow not to mention paying in advance.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am wrong.  If the Minister does not clarify it in his reply we can have it clarified when we come to Committee Stage.  It will be interesting to see how many new officers the Revenue Commissioners recruit to try to cover the most cumbersome taxes which have been introduced in the past few months.  They are not all through the House yet but they will be on the Statute Book within the next few months.  It is then we will know if the Revenue Commissioners are in a position to handle them.  This party are in favour of the distribution of wealth but we believe the timing of this Bill is wrong.  If we had it in the middle of the 1960s, when we had economic progress, there would be some justification for it.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for bringing in a Bill like this when the economic situation is as bad as it is.  When the Minister for Finance introduced income tax for farmers he stated that the best time was probably when you <Col N="308" /> had the lowest profitability in land because no income tax would have to be paid.  You would then pay according to your profits.  There is a certain argument in that.  I should like to hear the Minister putting forward the same argument now.  If it is right to put in a tax that must be paid without taking profits into consideration&mdash;profits are at their lowest ebb&mdash;this is the right time to bring it in.  He would be laughed out of the House if he said that.</P>
    <P>We could consider the introduction of a wealth tax if business and industry were booming.  We have never been against the distribution of wealth in order to contribute to the weaker sections of the community.  Fianna Fáil do not need any lecturing with regard to helping those people.  They piloted that course during their term of office.  This is not the preserve of the Coalition Government by any means.</P>
    <P>There is no section in the Bill to deal with inflation.  Inflation is not taken into account at all.  The Minister just said he would review it.  We do not know what yardstick he will use in relation to what inflation has taken place within three years.  The Minister knows as well as I do that if some measure is not taken in relation to inflation we will have a chaotic situation.  This Bill will encourage the transfer of the wealth of the country to foreign countries.  Although foreign shareholders over the threshold of £100,000 are technically caught in the Bill, the Minister knows as well as I do that these people will arrange their business so that they will not go over the threshold of £100,000.  It will be an encouragement for foreign investors to take over companies probably at a lower rate because the Irish shareholders will be caught.</P>
    <P>Many of the supermarkets in this country are foreign owned but one of the leading Irish supermarket owners has stated that any supermarket owned by an Irish private company&mdash; we know the rates they are operating on&mdash;will be vulnerable to foreign takeover when this Wealth Tax Bill takes over.  Their counterparts, owned by foreign concerns, will be able to avoid <Col N="309" /> it.  These things need to be looked at. The Minister has put a flat tax of 1 per cent on all business as if they all produced the same profits.  He has readily conceded that agriculture does not produce the same profits.  He has given agriculture a 50 per cent reduction. The same should apply to certain industries.  The Minister did not give any concession in relation to a company which operates on very high profits and one which operates on very low profits.</P>
    <P>Investment in the country is running at around 10 per cent at the moment.  This is not very high when you take interest rates into account. This Bill will take 1 per cent off that figure.  That is not very encouraging. I believe, irrespective of what tax you bring in, whether it is wealth tax or capital gains tax, it should be designed to improve the standard of living of the people.  I am sure no tax is brought in with the intention of destroying the economy but there can be misguided ideas.</P>
    <P>We should try to uplift the sagging economy.  We should encourage businesses to expand their holdings and create more work.  If we do not do this, we have no hope of keeping up with European countries.  Our immediate concern should be to provide employment for the 104,000 people out of work.  The Government's major concern should be to direct their attention to a major expansion in the economic front with a large injection of capital.  There is no effort being made to get this capital to expand industry.  We are just drifting along helplessly.  The Minister in his budget speech, in relation to planning for the future, stated that he would consider it a futile exercise at the present time to provide a medium or a long-term plan.</P>
    <P>I hope the semi-State bodies do not take the advice of the Minister.  I hope that CIE do not say: &ldquo;We are losing £17 million but when inflation is rampant we do not see any sense in having a plan.  We will drift along and things might right themselves&rdquo;. What would the Minister feel if many business firms, who find themselves with problems on all sides, decided <Col N="310" /> that there was no good in planning, that things were too irregular, that prices were jumping so often and inflation was fluctuating that they would wait until they could get out of the situation they were in at the moment?</P>
    <P>How could any business survive if that attitude were adopted?  I do not think any businessman would make such a statement to his staff.  It would be very depressing for the staff of a firm to be told by the manager that there was no plan in operation and that the firm were merely drifting along.  We need a positive lead from the Government if we are to boost the economy.  If the Government do not give good example, they cannot expect any section of the community to take positive action.</P>
    <P>We did not get good example in the last budget.  Then the Minister deferred taxation of £12 million on a temporary basis and subsequently the Minister for Social Welfare took £28 million from industry when the social welfare stamp was increased.  This kind of action is not encouraging. Positive action is needed if we are to protect employment.</P>
    <P>We have been told there will be an upturn in the economy towards the end of the year and I hope this will happen.  However, we should not put too much hope in this.  There is overproduction in America and in European countries; they are selling their goods at ridiculously low margins on the European markets in order to maintain employment.  If this continues on the European and the world markets, it is problematical whether our economy will expand at all during the year, particularly as costs will continue to rise.  Some £28 million has been taken from industry because of the increased cost of the social welfare stamp.  The unfortunate employees will have to pay about 40p and this will more than offset the tax relief they received in the budget.</P>
    <P>There are many points in the Bill that will have to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  In section 13 of the Bill there is the anomaly which we tried to eradicate in the income tax <Col N="311" /> code with regard to threshold points and allowances.  In this section two single people are allowed a threshold of £70,000 each while a married couple are allowed only £100,000.  I thought we were getting rid of that anomaly in the income tax code but it still exists in this Bill.  If a couple live in sin, without going through the ritual of marriage, they are allowed £140,000, while people who do the respectable thing are allowed only £100,000.  The Minister should try to eliminate this anomaly.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been introduced at the wrong time, when the economy is declining.  We should try to encourage expansion and ensure that industrialists have confidence in the economy.  I agree that the Government have not been completely at fault.  I know that external pressures have been the cause of some of our troubles but the Government must take their share of the blame.  The report of the Central Bank before Christmas pointed out that only 50 per cent of inflation was of an imported nature, that the rest was under the control of the Government.  Nobody has greater control over the matter than the Minister for Finance and he must accept responsibility for 50 per cent of the inflation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not add to the inflation already raging in the country. It has nearly wrecked the world economy and at this stage we should do our utmost to try to control it as it affects us.  However, the policies of the Government to date have not been directed along these lines.  We should not have introduced the Wealth Bill at this time, certainly not until other European countries put it on their Statute Books.  It was a mistake to introduce this legislation in advance of England; if they do not adopt a similar taxation measure they will have an advantage over us.</P>
    <P>Rising prices and other factors have affected the economy.  Unit costs are one of our greatest problems and we have lost the advantage we had in this direction four or five years ago.  Now we are exporting to the European markets on a par with European firms <Col N="312" /> and this will not help us.  I agree our exports last year were good but we need to maintain and expand that record.  I do not think this will happen and I do not see how we can absorb the 104,000 people at present unemployed. We are also faced with the prospect of providing employment for school-leavers and if we wish to keep them in the country we will have to do something positive with regard to industrial development.</P>
    <P>The average wage-earner wants the Government to give him a guideline, at least to let him know if there is a future for young people here.  They will have to see some prospects if they are to remain.  At the moment the outlook is dismal and it is up to the Government to ensure that their policies are directed towards promoting industry and services and generally building up the wealth of the country. Then we will be in a better position to help social welfare recipients, the old age pensioners and those receiving disability benefits.  We will be able to help them attain a good standard of living but if we continue with the present negative taxation policy we will not be able to help even the social welfare recipients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the promises of the National Coalition was the removal of estate duties but little did the people know they would be saddled with many other forms of taxation.  I do not claim to be an expert on taxation or on the legislative proposals that have come before the House recently with regard to taxes on capital gains, wealth and so on or on the Bills that are about to be brought into the House.  I come from a rural area, mainly agricultural. In my opinion, this tax will have an adverse effect on the farming community. Take the farmers with small holdings.  These men used to do contract work for the bigger farmers with over £100 valuation.  They have decided to discontinue that for the reason that the farmers of £100 valuation and over will have to make returns to the Revenue Commissioners and the smaller farmers will also have to make returns.  The small farmer, whose average acreage is about 40 <Col N="313" /> acres, has to find some other means of income in view of rising costs and the high cost of living, in order to keep his head above water.  It is as simple as that.</P>
      <P>I want it to be clear and I want to put it on the record of the House that I am not against people paying a fair share of taxation, but I realise and most of the people in the country realise that the timing of the Bill that is now before the House is wrong.  Let us have a look at the timing.  The Bill is being brought in at a time when business firms are operating a three-day or two-day working week.  It is no joy to any firm to be on a short working week.  The overheads and the running costs remain high.  A prolonged period of short working would have an adverse effect on a company.</P>
      <P>Most of the companies as I know them, especially in that part of the country where I am involved, are working on bank overdrafts and the past year was a very difficult period for them.  That is undeniable.  Those industrialists and the men with the money who came into this country will now have a look at the situation and will consider what effect a wealth tax will have on them.  An industrialist who has come here with thousands of pounds, maybe millions, to start up an industry here will now find if he has assets abroad that he will have to pay tax on them also.  I do not know how it is intended to collect the tax. An industrialist who is giving good employment here has industries in England, America, or anywhere else, will be caught for tax here also.  How is it intended to collect it?  Is it intended that Revenue officials will be sent around the world in Aer Lingus jets to investigate?  Are the Revenue Commissioners about to take on a new role in the collection of this tax? The Coalition Government got no mandate from the people at the last election to bring in such taxation.  It is taxation that will cripple every industry in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the ordinary industrialist operating here at the moment. Take a man who is on the threshold of £100,000.  Trading at the moment is very difficult.  He is faced with competition <Col N="314" /> from the other EEC countries and from countries outside the EEC who were sending goods here at very low cost.  He has a problem.  I have been speaking to many of these industrialists and they have said to me that the incentive to expand is gone and the incentive to provide additional employment is gone because from 25th April they will need to have a special staff employed to keep account of all this taxation.  They will be inundated with documents, returns, queries and so on.</P>
    <P>At this point in time there are 104,000 persons unemployed.  The country can be divided into two categories, a tax-ridden country and a dole country.  How is it intended to pay all those who are on the dole?  Where is the money to come from?  The money comes from the business and working people.  The social insurance stamp has been increased to £4.60.  The employer has to make an increased contribution of 80p and the employee, to pay for the people who are on the dole, has to pay an increased contribution in the region of 30p.  If this situation continues, if there is no expansion in industry, if there are more persons coming on the unemployed register, the economy and the industrial life of the country will be brought almost to a halt.  That is the situation at the moment.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of this Bill states:</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, the taxable wealth of an individual who is domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on the valuation date shall comprise all the property wheresoever situate, to which he is beneficially entitled in possession on that date.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if this concerns property a person owns, property outside the State.  I presume it does but how does the Minister propose to collect the tax if the property is outside the State?</P>
    <P>Last week some respected Members, noted businessmen, spoke against this Bill because they felt it would have an adverse effect on industrial and business life.  The Minister stated that only a small number of people would be affected by the tax but he must have <Col N="315" /> realised when he was scrubbing the estate duty he would have to look elsewhere for the money the Exchequer collected from that duty. My estimate is that the Minister will collect in the region of £20 million on this new duty.  Most of the big businesses are owned by foreigners and these people will have another look at the situation before they extend their business.  I am tired listening to organisations&mdash;I do not mind saying this because one gets no votes for speaking on a Bill of this nature&mdash;saying that certain people are getting away without paying enormous amounts of tax. In stating this they are talking about the wealth they say exists here but I cannot see the great wealth they refer to.  It is possible that a few individuals &mdash;they are very few&mdash;have considerable wealth.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out, to the workers in particular, that the people with money give the employment and if they withdraw their money there will be little or no work.  It should be realised that a number of companies, including some in my own constituency, have intimated that they are unable to pay the recent 10 per cent increase in wages and salaries.  These firms have pointed out that if they have to pay the money they may have to close down resulting in further redundancies. We cannot have our loaf and eat it.</P>
    <P>There should be initiative from the Government to encourage capital inflow but the Government are driving money out.  If a person has £1,000 on deposit for a period in excess of 12 months he pays income tax, something I could never understand.  That figure should be increased to at least £10,000 tax free.  If that was done we would be encouraging investment, something which is badly needed.  I agree that speculators should be taxed. The person who moves in, buys property and makes a quick return should be taxed at a heavy rate.</P>
    <P>Some organisations have accused me of supporting the rich and the big businessmen in my comments on the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  I challenged them last year to give their views on <Col N="316" /> taxation and financial affairs but they have not done so.  It should be remembered that if we do not have people willing to invest their money in our industries, to expand them and create further employment, a lot of our small industries will go to the wall. When Fianna Fáil were in power those who went abroad to encourage foreign industrialists to come here were in the happy position of being able to point to the tax concessions for new industries but such industrialists will be hesitant to come here in view of this type of taxation.</P>
    <P>I believe that the IDA have had a falling-off in the number of inquiries from abroad.  Speaking about the IDA. I should like to state that when they issue figures for job potential I divide their figure by two.  In 90 per cent of cases my division by two of their figure results in a more realistic projection. There is a general feeling in industry that small firms should not be asked to pay tax at the same rate as the large firms and that is only right.  Most companies are working on loans from the banks and after going through a very difficult year or 18 months there is no company that I know of making what can be called big profit.</P>
    <P>I hope the national wage agreement will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. When we were on the other side of the House we were always constructive on that issue.  We always put the interests of the nation before politics or vote catching.  We intend to be as constructive as we possibly can in opposition and to put the situation to the Government as we see it.  With all the taxation being introduced at present there is a scare on.  The men with the money, the will and the skill to expand are scared.  Why would anyone expand when he will be riddled with income tax?  Forms will be coming every day in the post and some companies will have to employ special staff to deal with all the forms and queries.  There is no use in anyone saying that companies are making big profits.  They are not.  Some of the men who are heads of companies work seven days a week.  There are no nine to five men in any company that I know of.  They must go abroad to look <Col N="317" /> for markets and to negotiate, they must ensure that orders are met and that they can compete.  They find now that the more they do and the more employment they give the more they will be taxed.</P>
    <P>This is the thin end of the wedge. When this Bill becomes law all the Minister for Finance has to do is to introduce an amendment.  Many average people did not realise but they are beginning to realise, especially the farming and business communities, and the workers too, that this taxation is the thin end of the wedge. The next time this comes before the House in the form of a Bill or Financial Resolution the small print will be put in and the £100,000 will be reduced to £80,000 and, perhaps, to £50,000.  The farmers are terrified at the moment.  They say to me: &ldquo;One is taxed at present on a valuation of £100 but what will it be next year?  Will it be reduced until we are all in the net?&rdquo; I spoke earlier of the small farmer who did contract work for the larger farmers.  Such a small farmer will not now work for the bigger farmer because when the bigger farmer is making out his return he will mention that the other man worked for him and then they will be after him.  Any man with a farm of 40 acres, which is the average according to the latest survey carried out, must supplement his income by some means.</P>
    <P>What is happening now is that most of those men are selling their machinery and much of their machinery was bought on HP.  The factories where this machinery was made and the suppliers gave employment too.  Sales of agricultural machinery have taken a nose dive.  All this taxation, especially on wealth, is bad.  We are in favour of a Capital Gains Tax Bill provided it is put through in a proper way.  I believe in taxing the man who is in for a quick profit overnight but I believe that in the case of people who own property, who have developed it, repaired it, carried out major improvements, if they want to dispose of it after 15 years they should not be liable for income tax or capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>I know the problems the Minister has, because all this taxation that has <Col N="318" /> been introduced is Labour Party social policy.  Is it Labour Party policy to have the dole and to tax to the hilt everybody who has anything?  In the long run there will be no money to pay the dole.  Recently the Government borrowed £187 million abroad.  I looked through various documents to see did we ever borrow that amount, and we never did.  The Minister stated in his budget speech that he will borrow more, I presume on the foreign market.  Who will pay the interest?  It is like a man who borrows one year, borrows again the next year, and the following year he reaches the point of no return.</P>
    <P>Is it the Government's intention to sell us down the river?  If it is, they should state that in the House.  If it is, it is the Arabs who will own us.  They will dictate the terms.  It is the person who provides the money who dictates the tune.  Are we to sell ourselves to the Arabs and let them dictate the tune to us?  I do not believe in that. It is time the Irish people opened their eyes.  Some of them have, but some of them have not yet seen the light of day. Some people believe that so long as the dole keeps flowing everything is all right.  I have heard people saying that so long as the money comes on Friday night they are all right.  They must ask where is this money coming from.</P>
    <P>There was no money in the budget for expansion.  We need something in the region of £400 million to keep our services in operation.  That is my calculation.  There are two options open to the Government.  They can go to the foreign market, or they can go to our financial institutions.  The Central Bank have intimated that they will release some extra finances, I presume, to the subsidiary banks.  I hope that when they do, the Minister will not step in and grab it and leave nothing for the private individual.  If the Minister takes all the capital made available by the Central Bank, there will be no capital available for private expansion.  That would lead to a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>There are 33 sections in this Bill. Some of them are very complicated and will have to be explained to us on Committee Stage.  We will want to know what the involvement will be, <Col N="319" /> what the means of collection will be, how property will be valued, and who will value it.  Will it be the Revenue Commissioners?  Will they have the right to send down an inspector to value property?  These are some of the questions we will be asking.</P>
    <P>The Minister watered down the White Paper he introduced last year. He had to bend before a great deal of pressure.  The Minister said the White Paper was open for discussion.  The timing of this Bill is very bad in view of the economic state of the country, in view of our balance of payments, in view of the unemployment position, and in view of the lean times through which companies small and large are going.  I do not think anybody can deny that.  So far as I know the Bill comes into operation on 5th April and the first instalment will be due three months later.  If you do not pay up, the interest rate is rather high.  This must be looked into.</P>
    <P>The Government stated that all the problems were due to the Arabs and to oil.  Not so long ago the Central Bank stated that only 50 per cent of our inflation was imported and that the rest was due to our own bad management.  Last year the Central Bank spoke very strongly about the way the Government were running our affairs.  They did not say it directly.  What I fear is that all in all the Government have decided to bring in a tax that will cripple industry, agriculture and every other walk of life.  The ordinary people see it as the thin edge of the wedge.</P>
    <P>I do not want anyone to think I do not believe in people paying a fair share of taxation: I believe everyone should pay according to their ability to do so.  I also believe that no tax should be imposed which would interfere with expansion in employment and which would in that way interfere with job creation which is badly needed at the moment.  No tax should put jobs in jeopardy.  I am afraid this Bill will mean a stop to industrial expansion and that would be the sad day for Ireland.</P>

      <P>The debate has been well <Col N="320" /> worthwhile.  It has afforded a number of Deputies an opportunity to get a lot of emotion off their chests.  The Bill has nothing to do with doctrinaire socialism, doctrinaire conservatism or doctrinaire philosophy of any kind.  It simply proposes a reasonable alternative form of taxation of capital to replace death duties, which will be abolished in three weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Companies will not pay wealth tax in the manner described by so many Deputies, but I will come to that later.  At this stage I want to deal with the rather puerile, unrealistic and emotional speeches we have heard, particularly from the Opposition, who cried &ldquo;ruination&rdquo; and flung at us accusations of a doctrinaire approach to the whole problem.  I want to go to the root of Government thinking and action in this matter.  It is to be found in the statement of intent of the parties forming the National Coalition Government on 7th February, 1973. It stated very simply, very honestly and quite courageously:</P>
      <P>With a view to relieving the heavy and unjust burden on ordinary house purchasers and farmers, the National Coalition Government will abolish estate duties on property passing on death to widows and their children and replace them with taxation confined to the really wealthy and to property passing on death outside the immediate family.</P>
      <P>The proposal was explained in detail as follows about ten days later in a document entitled <i>The Cost of the National Coalition Programme:</i></P>
      <P>The National Coalition will abolish estate duties.  The money involved will be recovered through a new form of taxation of capital, which will be paid during the lifetime of the owner of the capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It then went on to suggest an exemption threshold of £40,000.  The Bill provides much more generous thresholds of £70,000 for single people, £90,000 for widowed people and £100,000 for married people, plus in <Col N="321" /> all cases the principal private residence, contents and one acre.  Our paper of 1973 forecast that taking a threshold of £40,000 would relieve about 92 per cent of all estates liable to estate duty.  With higher thresholds the number being relieved is much greater, in excess of 95 per cent of all estates now liable.  They will not be called on to pay one penny of capital taxation, one penny of wealth tax or of the other taxes in the package of taxes which will replace estate, legacy and succession duties.</P>
    <P>Our document of 1973 stated that all but about 500 people would, under the National Coalition scheme, pay less tax than under the estate duty code. The document also stated that new taxes would be imposed on assets passing outside the immediate family.  I expect tomorrow to be introducing the Capital Acquisition Tax Bill which will be circulated shortly afterwards and this will enable the House and all interested parties outside to have a full view of the capital taxation package before we come to discuss the Committee Stage of this Bill and the other capital taxation Bills.  It will enable this discussion to become realistic.  Hopefully the House will then deal with hard facts and escape from the quagmire of unrealistic emotion and accusation in which so much of the discussion has been conducted up to now.</P>
    <P>One of the most encouraging aspects of the abolition of death duties and their replacement by instalment taxes payable during life is that the people who expect to be affected by the new taxes have suddenly developed a tremendous life expectancy.  Ever since we proposed the abolition of death duties, people, liable to the new taxes believe themselves to be gifted with immortality.  Reasonable people in the past were concerned that their next-of-kin might have to pay death duties on their demise.  They took steps, as best they could, to avoid payment of death duties.</P>
    <P>In certain cases they engaged in the legitimate avoidance practice of distributing their property more than five years before death.  That was a luxury which could be engaged in by <Col N="322" /> the well-to-do, who could distribute most of their wealth and still retain ample to maintain themselves in comfort. The overwhelming mass of people who had property in excess of £7,500&mdash;which was liable to duty when we came into power&mdash;were not in a position to alienate from them such capital as they had because, prudently, they had to maintain their homes and savings in order to ensure that destitution would not be their lot in the autumn of their days.  The people who had more than usual wealth were able to distribute large sums and yet retain ample for themselves.</P>
    <P>Prudent people also, if they were concerned to avoid imposing death duties on their next-of-kin, took out insurance policies so that, on death, a lump sum would be payable to enable their next-of-kin pay estate duty.  As I pointed out earlier, over 95 per cent of people now at risk of paying estate duty will be entirely freed from that liability, or any capital taxation in the future.  But of those who will be called on to pay capital taxation in the future, the amount which they will pay one year after another, in many cases, will be less than the premium they would in the past have paid on a policy taken out for the purpose of paying estate duty. All of which indicates that, far from the taxation being a punitive and extortionate one, the taxation package we are offering as an alternative to the archaic system&mdash;which has been rightly condemned&mdash;is one which is very carefully tailored to the ability of people to pay and will enable people to make adjustments in their wealth holdings and their incomes in order to pay the tax.</P>
    <P>Of course, the new capital taxes will lead to adjustments in wealth holdings in Ireland.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  There is a great deal of idle wealth in this country.  There are many assets here which do not yield an adequate income, adequacy being measured by the capacity of such assets to produce income.  Countries which introduced wealth taxes found that people who tended to hold on to assets of low yield disposed of them and converted their wealth into forms <Col N="323" /> of assets which would produce a much better income.  If that occurs here&mdash; and I expect it will&mdash;it will be a very good thing, not alone for the taxpayer but indeed for the economy.</P>
    <P>When examples of other countries which have wealth taxes were quoted here it was claimed that they were countries with greater economic fortune than ours.  The question might well be asked: why is it that other countries have done better?  Of course, there are many reasons why other countries do better.  They may have more natural wealth, more industrialised economies. Many countries in the past had empires, lands which they conquered and from which they took considerable wealth without making a fair return. But wealth can be generated and accumulated in a country if its taxation system is such as to encourage people to use their assets to best advantage. If the wealth tax here leans on some people so that they look hard at the poor yield they have on their assets, it may well encourage them to reinvest their money in productive outlets which will generate resources for themselves and the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The only form of capital taxation we have at present was designed in 1894.  I do not think there is any Member of this House who was even born at that time.  Certainly there is no Member of the House who, at that time had reached the age of reason.  Yet that is the only tax which today affects or influences in any way, holdings of capital in Ireland.  I do not know of any other country where the capital tax situation has remained stagnant for so long.  We followed the British with the system we are now abolishing.  But even the British found themselves obliged, for good social and economic reasons, to make radical changes in their capital taxation system.  For instance, they have long experience of a capital gains tax.  They are now proposing new taxes like wealth taxes at levels far higher than anything we in Government propose.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Bill is based on a philosophy which does not respect property.  It has been said <Col N="324" /> that the promoters of the Bill consider capital to be a bad thing.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  I have never heard anybody suggest that taxation of income is an infringement of the principle that the labourer is worthy of his hire.  Is there anybody so daft as to suggest that because wages are subject to income tax it is tantamount to saying that a person should not be paid for his labour.  I find it very difficult to accept there is any worth in the argument that taxation of property is an infringement of the right to acquire or own it.  I cannot accept that to tax property is an infringement of the right to enjoy the profits arising out of its ownership.  Possession of property confers a capacity to pay tax.  I enunciated that principle at the beginning of this Second Stage.  Nobody in the House has contradicted it.</P>
    <P>Nobody has denied it directly but, by inference, accusations have been made that there was something basically wrong in thinking that possession of capital conferred a capacity to pay tax.  Of course, there is a very good reason why it could not be denied. That is the principle that has been in operation ever since the Finance Act of 1894 when estate duties were introduced. They were a form of capital taxation but capital taxation that was paid in what I would regard as confiscatory amounts.  Between the top rates of estate duty and legacy and succession duties as much as 65 per cent of some estates could be confiscated at time of death.  That disruptive tax has done serious harm to business in Ireland.  It closed down several businesses, particularly family businesses. That is a tax which has forced families to sell off large portions of the family farm because it operated at very extortionate rates.</P>
    <P>One of the great disadvantages of estate duties was that it was tax which occurred by accident and not by design. It could occur in rapid succession affecting some families seriously because of frequency of deaths in certain families.  While there was some reduction granted in respect of rapid succession, it operated in such a way that some families found themselves, over a decade or so, almost deprived of any <Col N="325" /> of their real assets, while other families in precisely the same originating circumstances were, during and at the end of the same period, not subjected to any tax at all.  It is foolish to maintain a system of taxation which operates by caprice, hits the innocent and can be avoided by the well advised. In 1973 we took a decision to end such a system and to replace it with one which would be known, would be calculable and unavoidable, and would be payable without real harm or difficulty.  That is what we have done.</P>
    <P>A reason why one might not be too impressed by the complaints of some people about the new capital taxes is that their complaints have not been accompanied by any public recognition by them of the considerable tax reliefs which this Government have given in anticipation of wealth tax and other capital taxes.  No account has been taken by several of the critics, in the course of this debate, of the considerable tax concessions which have been given by the Government in the Finance Acts of 1973 and 1974, and are being given in the Finance Act, 1975.  Last year the Finance Act abolished sur-tax and it subjected income, whether it was earned or investment, what was called unearned, income, to a new unified income tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>And exactly equivalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Unearned income used to have a heavier rate of income tax than earned income. There was one concession for people with property, who have investments and who have income from those investments. Last year's Finance Bill also gave very significant tax relief to holders of life assurance policies, a relief which was greatest for the people with the largest amount of wealth and the largest insurance policies.  This year's Finance Bill reduces the top rate of income tax from 80 per cent to 70 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These moves were preparatory to, and associated with, the introduction of the wealth tax, and there would be little justification for making these concessions if a wealth tax was not to be introduced.  I did not hear any <Col N="326" /> people who criticised the wealth tax suggest that we should restore the previous levels of income taxation to the higher income levels and also to income from investments.  They cannot have it both ways.  Equity requires that people pay tax according to their capacity to pay, and it would be totally wrong to give considerable tax relief at the top level of income and property holding while people at the lower income level are being sorely pressed by tax.</P>
    <P>It is the ambition of every Minister for Finance to relieve as many tax payers as possible and particularly to relieve people in the lower income and lower property holding groups. The only reason why further relief cannot be given is because of the pressing demands for public revenue to meet public needs.  Our behaviour in Government to date clearly illustrates that we are a reforming administration and that tax reform is something we do not hesitate to pursue, notwithstanding all the difficulties, all the hard work and uncertainties and all the embarrassments which are concomitant with changes.</P>
    <P>There is a natural inclination on the part of mankind to assume that what is old and known is respectable and good and that anything new is to be feared and will probably be dangerous.  Other countries have succeeded admirably under the kind of capital taxes we are introducing, and there is no reason to anticipate that Ireland will not do as well as those countries when you bear in mind that we are abolishing death duties, which other countries did not do as they introduced capital taxes. It will be seen that the tax climate in Ireland as far as property is concerned will be much better at the end of the exercise than it was when we started out.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise something which has been overlooked in the fog and smoke generated in recent weeks in relation to this Wealth Tax Bill. There will be no wealth tax paid by any married person&mdash;and they represent the majority of wealth holders in the country&mdash;until such a person has a home and its contents and an acre <Col N="327" /> around it and another £100,000 besides. It does not matter what the size or value of that home is, tax will not be payable on it.  When tax becomes payable for the comparatively few hundred who may be liable to it it will be paid by them, not on the home or on its contents or the acre around it or on the £100,000 which is also allowed but only on the slice above that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that we should follow the example of Denmark. People have been very selective in the course of this debate, picking out of one taxation system or another something that suited them and overlooking what did not suit their argument.</P>
    <P>In Denmark the level of exemption is £30,000 per person or for a married couple.  There is no exemption for the home and its contents and no exemption up to £100,000 such as we are proposing.  They also do not have the advantages and exemptions we are giving, such as the 50 per cent on £200,000 for agricultural land and the 20 per cent exemption on productive assets which, in addition to the other areas of exemption mentioned, will confer additional benefits on people of considerable property.  That is why I consider it vitally necessary that a great deal of the mischief, which was maliciously generated, should be dissipated. People will then see the reality of the situation and understand how concerned this Government are to ensure that this wealth tax will not press on anybody who is not in a position to pay it without hardship.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last night that our ancestors thought it proper, in the first half of the nineteenth century, to honour a British Under-Secretary, Drummond.  They cast his likeness in bronze.  It stands today in Dublin City Hall on a plinth which bears his famous words &ldquo;Property has its duties as well as its rights&rdquo;.  Drummond asserted that against the hostility of people of considerable substance and influence.  We assert the same in 1975. It is sad to think that we must assert it against not dissimilar hostility.</P>
    <P>Property has its duties as well as its rights, and <i>vice versa</i>.  This Bill, and all this Government's capital <Col N="328" /> taxation proposals, recognise the rights and duties of property.  One cannot have a right without a corresponding duty and <i>vice versa</i>.  From listening to Opposition speakers it would appear that they claim proprietary rights which carry no duty. They also appear to be asking us to accept that ownership of wealth does not confer any capacity to pay.</P>
    <P>Drummond's precept has stood the test of time.  It is as applicable today as it was in the first half of the nineteenth century.  Society has developed and there is a better social conscience and sense of obligation towards less well off people today.  In my view, Drummond's axiom is entirely pertinent and should not be forgotten in the course of all the debates on capital taxation.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Opposition that Article 43 of the Constitution while guaranteeing the right to private property also recognises that the property rights may be delimited by law &ldquo;with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.&rdquo;  Is that doctrinaire socialism?  If so, then Mr. Eamon de Valera and his party were guilty of doctrinaire socialism in 1938.</P>
    <P>The late Judge Hanna of the High Court described that phrase &ldquo;the exigencies of the common good&rdquo; as &ldquo;a kind of political shibboleth, the meaning and application of which has changed and will continue to change from one generation to another&rdquo;.  Of course what the judge was saying is accepted as true by all reasonable people.  He said that each generation has a right, within the fundamental law, to determine its own priorities and what way the resources of man should be distributed among its citizenry.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage in 1975, when the public conscience demands that there should be a fairer distribution of the nation's resources.  There are different ways of effecting that distribution, but only one has been thought of in this debate.  This Bill endeavours to redistribute property, not by the sole mechanism of taxation because quite clearly property is not significantly redistributed where a tax <Col N="329" /> of only one per cent operates above £100,000 plus the house and its contents.</P>
    <P>It has always been accepted that one of the principal justifications for estate duties was that they encouraged people to break up substantial accumulations of wealth in order to avoid payment of tax.  That had a good social consequence.  It prevented the concentration of wealth in too few hands.  As we are getting rid of estate duties because of the hardship necessarily associated with them, it is essential we provide a system of taxes which will encourage people with vast accumulations of wealth to break them up and redistribute them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It can also be distributed outside the family.  The distributions we are allowing to take place within the family are quite considerable. Yet we have pitched them at a point which should encourage people to contemplate a distribution of some of their property outside the family.  It is desirable to break up vast accumulations, even within families, rather than leave property in only one name.  If we are to have a just society, it is appropriate that our capital taxes should have this redistributive effect. When that redistributive effect is combined with a better use of capital, it is bound to operate to the general good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked to put an estimate <Col N="330" /> on the yield of this tax.  As in relation to estate duties, the more effective this tax in encouraging people to redistribute their wealth, even among their own families, the less revenue will the State obtain.  We cannot say precisely how people will manage their property in the future. We do not even have an adequate picture of how property was held and distributed in Ireland under the old system of estate duty.</P>
    <P>As I cannot point out too often, the biggest estates avoided payment of estate duty because people took avoidance action in good time and these estates have not come within the knowledge or the net of the Revenue Commissioners.  But it is common knowledge that such estates exist.  Their value and the frequency of transfer and so forth are not known, but they will be known in future.  This is one of the reasons, possibly, why people of considerable property who avoided tax resent these new taxes because they realise the opportunity for avoidance will not exist in future since the possession and distribution of wealth will be monitored as it passes from one hand and one generation to another.</P>
    <P>There is total policing of the income of wage earners.  Employers are under obligation to make returns and pay tax on what is paid out by them. The wage earner has no opportunity of avoiding tax.  I do not condemn people for wanting to avoid paying tax because, to do so, would be to condemn human nature.  It is a natural inclination.  But one section of the community, the section which includes some of the poorest people, has no opportunity of avoidance. Surely it is not inequitable to ask the better-off sections to accept a similar discipline so that they like others will be obliged to make a fair return to the community through which they have made their profits, the profits that have given them their property.</P>
    <P>We have taken action in our Finance Bills and, if necessary, we will take further action, to prevent tax avoidance, to prevent people investing property abroad in order to avoid paying tax here.  This necessarily <Col N="331" /> means that policing powers, as it were, have to be given to the Revenue Commissioners to keep a watch on the movement of funds. There have been some emotive denunciations of this operation but I repeat, if such disciplines and constraints apply to wages and other incomes then, in equity, they must also apply to property holdings and to the distribution of property.  There is absolutely no underlying view in the mind of the Government or in the mind of any supporter of this Government that capital or discretionary trusts or private non-trading companies are bad.  In pursuit of our determination, however, not to permit avoidance operations we must treat discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies in the way in which they are treated in this Bill. If we did not do that there would be a very, very simple device available to anyone wanting to avoid payment of capital tax.  It would be a nonsense to introduce a wealth tax and at the same time allow people distribute their property through discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies in such a way as would enable them to escape liability to payment of wealth tax.  We are doing no more than any other country has done in an endeavour to operate taxes fairly.  We have to ensure that people cannot avoid liability by resorting to legal fictions.</P>
    <P>A great many of the points made in this debate are substantially Committee Stage debating points but some might, I suppose, be usefully dealt with at this stage if only to clarify the minds of Deputies and expedite the handling of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crinion suggested that the promise of the Government to abolish death duties was made only two days before the election.  I have already pointed out that it was announced in a document dated 7th February, a long time before the election, and it was followed by a document ten days later which invited the Fianna Fáil Party and Deputy Colley in particular to challenge at that stage the National Coalition's thinking on the matter.  The <Col N="332" /> Fianna Fáil Party did not take up the challenge.  They did not say at that time that we were wrong to replace estate duties by an alternative form of taxation, which would be paid by instalments.  I find it very interesting, indeed, now that they are on the Opposition benches, that they should be expressing the view of people of substantial property that there is something wrong in the Government's thinking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly Deputy Crinion was mistaken and confusing it with the promise by the Taoiseach not to introduce a wealth tax, which was made two days before the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the National Coalition Parties was contained in these two documents of 7th and 17th February.  I think Deputy Crinion was confusing a promise to miraculously abolish rates made by Fianna Fáil immediately before the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister denying the Taoiseach made the promise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying Deputy Crinion confused the Fianna Fáil Party on-the-eve-of-the-poll promise to abolish rates with the firm commitment of the National Coalition Parties to form a Government which would abolish estate duties and replace them with taxation applying to real wealth, taxation to be paid under an instalment system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are not so conceited as to insist that every line and comma of this Bill must be accepted without amendment.  We will be only too happy to listen to reasonable comments on it and my hope would be that we would get down to more sensible working arrangements in the course of the Committee and later Stages of the Bill.  If we do that we will be able to produce a Bill entirely suited to the needs of our time, a Bill which will avoid possible pitfalls.  We have had to move with considerable speed in a very difficult and delicate area.  Anybody who has experience in taxation law&mdash;barristers, solicitors, accountants, tax consultants, businessmen and so on&mdash;knows just how complex <Col N="333" /> tax laws are.  It has, unfortunately, taken a considerable amount of time to draft the necessary legislation to implement the simple idea we propounded early in February, 1973 and for which we were given a mandate in the General Election.  Now that we have reached the stage of discussing the legislation we want to maintain the spirit and the practice of consultation, which we have had with interested parties ever since we published our White Paper in February, 1974.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Opposition that if they have any worthwhile amendments to make to this Bill we will consider them on their merits and we will not be in any way put off by the emotive abuse to which we were subjected in the course of the Second Stage debate.  If we were doctrinaire about this we would, of course, not have produced a Bill with as many exemptions and privileges as this Bill has.  We are anxious to assist any section of the community which may have particular problems.  The fact that we have given an exemption to the farming community, a special exemption to the fishing industry, to the hotel industry, to holders of productive assets is proof of our readiness to tailor our proposals to the specific needs and requirements of particular areas.  This will continue to be our policy as we process these Bills through the House.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that I have been encouraging people to live in sin because the thresholds for a married couple will be at £100,000 while that for single people will be £70,000.  This argument is a fine debating point and that is about all it is.  It overlooks what everybody knows, that wealth tends to be held in family arrangements. There are more single people but they are not all that common, who have considerable wealth of their own but the greater number of people hold their wealth in family situations.</P>
    <P>Income tax treats income as being acquired jointly as between husband and wife.  Perhaps it is because the law accepts what every romantic knows, that two can live as cheaply as one.  It is not at all extraordinary that the <Col N="334" /> wealth tax should treat property holdings in family situations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley asked why the Bill treated a person as a minor up to 21 years of age.  He said we should make the age of majority 18.  It is some years ago since I had the privilege of being a <i>rapporteur</i> of the legal committee of the Council of Europe in which I proposed to the Assembly of the Council of Europe a resolution urging all countries of the Council to adopt the age of 18 as the age of majority.  I am convinced that is the proper age of majority, that one should become a full legal person at the age of 18 years.  We have a strange anomaly in our law whereby people may make wills over 18 years of age and yet we treat them as not having full rights and obligations until they are 21 years old.  Against reducing the age of majority from 21 to 18 years, it can be argued that the age of majority carries with it not merely the privileges of maturity but also the obligations and, therefore, if you want to save people the burden of obligations you are doing them a favour by depriving them of seniority and majority until they become 21 years of age.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the reduction of this age but this is not a Bill which can deal with that.  It is a matter which embraces the whole civil law and would have to be dealt with in a separate Bill.  I am sure Deputy Colley, as a lawyer, would appreciate how extensive the effect of changing the age of majority would be and it is not something which could be taken in isolation in a tax Bill.  We may possibly move in that direction in the not too distant future.  When we do I think there will be no difficulty whatsoever in adjusting all the tax laws so that wherever the age of 21 is the operative one in tax laws now the age of 18 will be the appropriate age in future. It would probably not be necessary to have a separate tax Bill but I am not speaking <i>ex cathedra</i> when I offer that opinion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley also asked why the Bill referred to &ldquo;a wife&rdquo; in some sections rather than &ldquo;a spouse&rdquo;.  He will find there are several sections where in fact the spouse and the wife are <Col N="335" /> separately mentioned and have to be separately mentioned.  Possibly we could avoid using the word &ldquo;wife&rdquo; by talking about the sex of the spouse.  I think the word &ldquo;wife&rdquo; is so sufficiently understood and is such a respectable status in any event that we do not have to be oversensitive about using it, as we do use it, for the sake of clarity in the Bill.  In this and in all other taxation Bill debates there is forever a plea for clarity and simplicity of language.  We could, perhaps, devise new phraseology and use new terms to mean what simple words mean.  I see no harm in maintaining in our law such a simple phrase as &ldquo;a wife&rdquo;, which is a status which is easily understood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we must be concerned not merely with helping the draftsman, although I consider it very proper that the burden of work falling on him should be eased if it can, but it is most important that we should consider the ordinary person who is trying to interpret legislation.  If simple everyday words can be used rather than using gems of legalistic beauty then I think it is better to use the simple words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>Section 13 is a case in point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a look at it and it would need to be redrafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 13 refers to spouse and wife in different contexts. Deputy Colley mentioned the discretionary trust which he says was getting special treatment in certain cases.  He made a plea that special treatment would also be given to discretionary trusts set up to provide a fund for a daughter separated from her husband. Might I say in passing that when the Deputy identified that as a particular problem he was moving into the same simple and honest atmosphere as the one in which the parliamentary draftsman operates when he uses the term &ldquo;wife&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless the Deputy mentioned it.  I think there is merit in what the Deputy said in this regard.  Of course, one does not like to move out the limits of areas of exemption because the further you move them the more people seem to be the other side of the anomaly line.  You may get to a point where discretionary trusts could not be supervised at all.  I will have a look at this and if we can handle it in an appropriate amendment I will not be averse to accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Does the Minister understand I was simply using that as an example?  I am concerned with the principle involved.  It may involve bringing the Revenue Commissioners in to judge a person's trust but it should not be confined to the kind of case I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough, but I have warned against the risks involved in extending the boundaries of exemption too far because then we get into an area of avoidance.  In fairness to the general body of taxpayers we must not encourage avoidance practices.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley complained about the absence of valuation rules.  The rules that will apply in future will not be dissimilar to the present rules with regard to the valuation of capital for estate duty purposes.  They are well known and they have stood the test of time.  It may be necessary to refine them in the light of experience and development and, of course, this can be done.  However, the general rules of valuation are obviously the best ones. There is a great danger in spelling out rules of valuation and measurement in a statute so that they become the only rules that can be applied.  Fixed rules could result in an injustice to taxpayers. Everything that is relevant to the value and the price of an article should be considered whenever valuations are being made.  Deputy Belton made the same point about valuations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham complained that the rates of tax were too low and when we consider the rates operating in other countries and the thresholds at which they operate it seems a fair comment.  We have deliberately set the rate of tax at a mere 1 per cent and <Col N="337" /> have set the thresholds high because we do not want to allow a situation to develop where there could be the remotest possibility of the harmful effects suggested by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the debate has been about companies.  This morning several Deputies on the Opposition benches spoke about the dreadful harm that would be done to industry by the operation of this tax.  I want to emphasise once again that the tax will not apply to trading companies.  The tax will apply to shareholders in companies but only to such shareholders as have property in excess of £100,000 net in addition to their private home, the contents and an acre of land around the house.  The number of such people in Ireland is few; they are a tiny minority.  I am not saying that their rights may be disregarded&mdash;far from it.  We are considering their problems too by the several adjustments we have made in the ordinary system of taxes to date and in the provision in the Bill.  This will reduce the rate of wealth tax if wealth tax and income tax combined exceed 80 per cent of income, subject to a brake of 50 per cent of the wealth tax below which the tax may not go.  Instead of the gloomy picture painted by the Opposition that this tax will press harshly on companies, the reality is that only a tiny fraction of the thousands of shareholders in companies will have to pay a small annual instalment tax.  Throughout this debate it has been assumed by all critics that the only property held by shareholders in companies is company property or shareholding in the company.  These kind of people do not exist&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What has been suggested by the Opposition is that the typical taxpayer has only one form of wealth and that is his shareholding in a company.  They hold that if the tax presses on him it will press on the whole company and the company's assets will have to be liquidated to pay the tax.  That is not the reality. It is unlikely that a person affected <Col N="338" /> by this tax will have his assets in only one form; he will be a man of considerable substance and almost certainly his property will be scattered over a wide portfolio and in different forms.  He will certainly be in a position to adjust his affairs to pay this comparatively benign tax during his lifetime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so but perhaps I might refer to it briefly now. If the life tenant is not subject to the tax, it would be a very simple avenue of avoidance.  For instance, a person could make himself a tenant for life, afterwards his wife could be tenant for her life and then the children.  If the life tenant were not to be liable for tax, liability could be avoided entirely on quite substantial property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The system we proposed seemed to be the most convenient from the administrative point of view and from the point of view of the taxpayer.  Deputy de Valera quite properly has been at pains to point out that it is desirable that the convenience of the public administration as well as the private individual be considered because unless a tax system can be operated with reasonable efficiency it will fall into difficulties and ultimately the taxpayer as well as the public sector will suffer.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera said he had difficulty in reconciling the policies of Fine Gael and Labour as announced.  Our policies were set out in the National Coalition Statement of Intent.  He seemed to rely upon that long-since-proven-to-be untrue image of Fine Gael which his party attempted to create in the 1920s, that Fine Gael was a conservative party.  I would challenge anybody to justify that image on a review of the policy statements of Fine Gael over the last decade&mdash;just taking that period alone.  I would challenge any historian in years to come studying Fine Gael over the last three decades to describe Fine Gael as a conservative party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): As I have stated previously, in reply to parliamentary questions and in the course of the debate on the Estimate for my Department, migration generally from Connacht to Leinster has declined considerably in recent years.  This overall trend is reflected in the figures for County Mayo, all of which is a scheduled congested area, which were as follows :&mdash; 1968-69&mdash;15; 1969-70&mdash;9; 1970-71&mdash; 3; 1971-72&mdash;4; 1972-73&mdash;4; 1973-74&mdash; 1.</P>
      <P>While it is not possible to say at this stage how many migrants will be moved from County Mayo in the coming 12 months it may be taken that the number, if any, will be very small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): It is not that.  When the transfer or the migration of somebody from Mayo, say, to another county is considered there are two considerations. One is the suitability of the farm which the migrant would be leaving for the relief of congestion in Mayo, for example, and the other is the availability of a suitable holding elsewhere. My information is that the number of offers from migrants with suitable holdings to surrender is very minimal and I am also told that where migrants have suitable holdings to surrender they have become in recent years much more difficult to satisfy and much more selective in their approach to the holding that they are going to take.  It is thought that, perhaps, the social assistance payable to farmers has had some effect on the trend of migration from Connacht to the other parts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, on 4th March the Council agreed on the regulations setting up the European Regional Development Fund and established a draft supplementary budget for the fund.  The instruments are now with the European Parliament and we expect that the necessary procedures will be completed very soon so that the regulations can be formally adopted.  Expenditure from the fund will be retrospective to the 1st January last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will complete the long process of negotiation on the establishment of the fund which will form the main instrument of Community regional policy.  In the Minister's view, the fund should have been endowed with considerably <Col N="347" /> greater resources.  However, the economic situation in the Community in the last year was such that this was not possible and to reach agreement on a fund of the present size is a considerable achievement by the member states.  The Minister is confident that it will play an increasingly significant role in the operation and growth of the Community regional policy over the years ahead.</P>
    <P>For Ireland the fund is a new source of development finance.  It will form an important addition to our own resources and it represents a tangible commitment by the Community to the principle of regional development which is so important to us.  The Government is now examining the most suitable projects for submission for assistance from the fund.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary serious when he describes the regional fund as at present constituted as being a considerable achievement by the nine member states in view of the fact that for more than a decade the Commission were attempting to have a regional fund which would result in a considerable transfer of resources from the very intensely developed regions to the less well developed areas?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>At a meeting at Baldonnel on 17th September, 1973, between the Taoiseach and the then British Prime Minister, Mr. Health, it was agreed in principle that the Irish and British authorities would make a joint approach to the Commission of the European Communities with a view to having a cross-Border regional development study financed with the aid of Commission funds. As the Minister indicated in replies to similar questions on 7th November, 1974, and 5th February last, this agreement in principle was reiterated at two subsequent meetings between the Taoiseach and the present British Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>On 24th January, 1974, we transmitted to the British Government a draft outline for broadly based studies of the north-west and mid-north-east cross-Border regions.  We believe that such an approach would have wide support from all groups in the community on both sides of the Border. However, there have been differences between the British Government and ourselves about the need for the studies.  We remain convinced that a broadly based study is a desirable step in promoting development in the Border area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only add that discussions are <Col N="351" /> continuing with a view to resolving our differences on the terms of reference for a joint approach and that we, on our part, have been ready for more than a year to proceed with an approach to the Commission.</P>

      <P>I understand that the reason for the delay is that the British approach to the problem is different from ours.  The Government have been trying to get the British to agree to a large-scale study of a large area on the Border but the kind of study the British Government seem to prefer is of a more limited kind.

I said that their interpretation of what would be a useful study differs from the interpretation this Government have of that idea.  Essentially, there is a difference of opinion of what is a useful way to begin.  The Minister has repeatedly and no later than last week again pressed the point of view that a large-scale study of a large area spanning the Border is what is needed.  But until he can succeed in bringing the British around to that point of view, it does not look as if we are going to make much headway.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's reply in based entirely on proposals to carry out studies.  Does he not think that is a rather academic exercise at this stage?  Would it not be better for the Irish Government to put forward a positive proposal for a particular trans-Border scheme?</P>

      <P>This Government's idea was that the way to start was to make a thorough economic and social study of a large trans-Border area.  That seems to me to make a good deal of sense.  I can see that it may not be active enough, but we are only starting. I do not accept that it can be written off merely as academic.  Until one understands thoroughly with what one is dealing it is premature to be making more concrete proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The entry of foreign-owned commercial vehicles into this country is governed by the provisions of the Road Transport Acts. Such entry is licensed on a liberal basis but as the details are somewhat complex I issued an information notice in the matter in January, 1975 for the <Col N="362" /> guidance of road hauliers and the customs authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The technical assistance grant scheme, as operated by my Department up to the 1973 oil crisis, provided for grants towards the cost of general fuel efficiency surveys in industry, including certain service industries.</P>
      <P>The number of firms availing of the scheme was four in 1974 and two in 1975 to date, compared with one in 1973.  The scheme was modified early in 1974 in the light of the oil crisis to provide specifically for boiler efficiency tests.  The number of grants paid under this heading was 47 in 1974 and 46 in 1975 to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied with the level of interest being displayed in the boiler <Col N="363" /> efficiency tests but I would like to see more firms having general consultancy surveys undertaken as there is still considerable scope for savings in many areas of energy consumption in industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my reply of 19th February, 1975, to previous parliamentary questions on this subject, it is Government policy to encourage the use of native fuels. Effect has been given to this policy through the use of turf and Irish coal for the generation of electricity and by ensuring that State, semi-State and local authorities give a preference to native fuels for space and water heating and other heat loads normally associated with buildings under their control.</P>
      <P>I also explained in my reply of 19th February the forms of assistance available from my Department, the Department of Local Government and Roinn na Gaeltachta for the improvement of bog roads.  The fourfold increase in oil prices should provide an adequate incentive for increased production of turf, and the provision of special assistance or incentives in present circumstances should be quite unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power when it is proposed to provide power for the inhabitants of Innisturk, County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the extension of electricity supply to Innisturk and to Clare Island would be so costly that it would involve completely prohibitive special service charges and it is, therefore not a practical proposition. There are no funds available to me from which the cost of extension of supply or provision of local generators could be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a satisfactory service has been provided on one of the Aran Islands&mdash;Inishere?  Would he agree that other islanders around the coast are entitled to the same service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That service was provided on a Gaeltacht island with the help of a grant from Roinn na Gaeltachta. I have no funds from which I could make such a grant.  There is no subhead under my Department from which such a grant could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the rural electrification scheme is almost at an end, would the Minister not agree that areas such as Clare Island and Innisturk should be considered for a service, irrespective of the cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy says, the rural electrification scheme ends this month.  That does not mean that the work will not be continued in the areas in which they contracted to do the work.  I sympathise with the Deputy's point of view.  There are pockets in various parts of the country where it would be extremely <Col N="370" /> expensive to put in electricity.  These areas comprise 2 per cent of rural houses which will not be connected when the rural electrification scheme comes to end.  I am having that position examined at the moment to see if there is something we can do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister introduce legislation to give himself the power to provide electricity through generators on the islands which are not in the Gaeltacht?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at the moment. I am examining the position about the remaining houses which will not be connected when the rural electrification scheme ends.  I will then consider if legislation is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister has been examining that aspect for the past 12 months because that is the answer he has been giving here.  Surely the Minister must agree that if the Department of the Gaeltacht and the Government at the time thought it appropriate that electricity should be provided on certain islands, which happened to be Gaeltacht islands, the natural extension should be to ensure an equal standard of living to residents of all islands.  There are not that many of them.  Surely the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant given for electricity is not yet under a specific subhead.  It comes out of a general subhead in the Estimate for Roinn na Gaeltachta.  There is no specific subhead providing money for electricity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the various developments in the world of energy, would the Minister not regard it as one of his functions to encourage some agency under his control to investigate the possibility of providing electricity on these offshore islands through the use of either wind or sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy knows it will be many years before the islanders would get their electricity either from the wind or the sea.  I would have to see if we could provide generators at a reasonable cost and I do not want to commit myself in that regard at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give the House an assurance that in this energy crisis situation some agencies under his control are actually investigating all these possible methods?  There are parts of the world where the provision of electricity by wind is being actively investigated. Could the Minister give us an indication that some such thinking is permeating the inner recesses of his Department and the agencies under his control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I could.  The electricity provided for electric light would not be suitable for television and the islanders want television just as much as they want electricity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has taken two questions together.  Is the Minister aware that University College, Dublin, has a group actively engaged on the question of providing power from the wind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that is going on but the information Deputy Haughey is seeking is completely out of date.  The Deputy is just not with it.  This has been in the papers for the last two months in a condensed form and that is one of the points made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in the last two months it was on the paper that one of the snags about wind generated electricity was the fact that it was not suitable for things like television.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that development work under the final phase of the ESB subsidised rural electrification scheme has been <Col N="373" /> completed in the majority of the rural areas in County Mayo.  The areas in which work is in progress at present are Achill, Mulranny, Mayfield, Mayo Abbey, Ballyglass, Cross, Knock and Hollymount rural areas.  It is expected that development work in the remaining areas will commence in 1975.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree there would seem to be plenty of room for extending this particular station?  In view of the unemployment in the area would he consider asking the ESB to have another look at it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>They have looked at it again and they say it would not be practicable to extend the station. What they have done is taken other bogs into commission.  It would not be practicable to build a second unit on the existing power station site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some motor assembly firms are at present experiencing difficulties which, as elsewhere, arise from a decline in the market demand for motor vehicles.  Prospects for the industry in the short term will depend on an improvement in the demand for new vehicles.  As regards prospects in the longer term I would refer the Deputy to the answer given on 28th November, 1974, to Question No. 63 as reported in the Official Report, volume 276, columns 577 to 579.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the terms negotiated by the previous Administration in regard to the protection of employment in the motor assembly industry been fully satisfied and can the Minister comment on the difficulties now being experienced in the Brittain group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the terms are being maintained.  There has, in fact, been a slight improvement in the relative position of Irish assembled vehicles on the home market as against imported vehicles.  The problem is that the total overall market has declined by approximately 20 per cent as against the previous year.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's second supplementary question, the Department have had to act as a mediator in this dispute, which was effectively a difference of opinion between the group and their suppliers in relation to commercial arrangements.  Meetings were held on 6th and 7th March.  It was not possible to discuss all the problems at these meetings but it was hoped to arrange a further discussion in the week commencing 10th March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary say with any degree of certainly that the employment content of the Brittain group will be maintained and could he give me some information about diversification in the event of a run down in assembly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can give the Deputy an assurance of the nature sought because the discussions are still taking place and they are of a sensitive and confidential character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very important to me as the local representative.  It is not alone the Brittain group but motor assembly firms in general which are involved.  As I understand it, there were long and hard negotiations to try to protect the employment content either by diversification or more assembly work.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary say if this diversification will take place to maintain the employment content?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Department are making available <Col N="375" /> through the IDA generous aid towards diversification.  I think all the firms are considering diversification and some are at a more advanced stage than others.  In the case of some there have been certain unforeseen difficulties but I cannot go into details about these at this juncture.</P>

    <Title>Meeting of Heads of Government: Statement by Taoiseach.</Title>
    <Col N="376" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, I would like to take a little of the time of the House to give a brief outline to Members of what transpired over the last two days at the meeting of Heads of Government of the Nine countries of the European Economic Communities.  The Foreign Ministers of these countries and the President of the Commission, with his colleague the Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, also attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>This was the first meeting of Heads of Government under the new arrangements agreed in Paris last December.  A characteristic of these arrangements is that there should be no formal communiqué after the meetings.  Nevertheless, a number of issues before the meeting were of such importance and such complexity that it was found necessary to incorporate the decisions in formal declarations or statements.  I have made copies of these statements available to the Leader of the Opposition. They have also been laid before both Houses and are available in the Library.  I should say at present only stencilled copies are available but they will be printed at a later stage and put in the Library as usual.</P>
      <P>A matter of great importance discussed at the meeting was the criteria by which the situation of a country could be examined to see if its membership of the Community was leading to unacceptable conditions, and how this situation might be corrected.  This is a major issue of concern to the United Kingdom at present.  There is, as Deputies will be aware, a document on the subject, produced by the Commission of the Community entitled &ldquo;The Unacceptable Situation and the Correcting Mechanism&rdquo;.  The meeting concluded that the correcting mechanism as outlined in that paper should be applied, with the following modifications:</P>
      <P>1.  The criteria concerning the balance of payments deficit and the two-thirds ceiling are dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> 2.  The following provisions will be incorporated into the agreed mechanism:</P>
    <P>(a)  The amount of the correcting mechanism shall be up to a ceiling of 250 million units of account.  However, as soon as the amount of the Community budget exceeds 8,000 million budget exceeds 8,000 million units of account, the ceiling shall be fixed at an amount representing 3 per cent of total budget expenditure.</P>
    <P>(b)  When a moving average drawn up over three years indicates that the balance of payments on current account of the country in question is in surplus, the correction shall only affect any difference between the amount of its VAT payments and the figure which would result from its relative share in the Community GNP.</P>
    <P>Because of the number of variables involved&mdash;like the rate of growth of the country concerned and of the Community as a whole, the state of its balance of payments and the composition of its trade over a period of years &mdash;it is quite impossible to indicate with any useful degree of accuracy how this new arrangement will affect Ireland.  I can say, however, that whether we are beneficiaries or contributors under the arrangements, the amounts involved will be insignificant in comparison even with the monetary benefits alone, of our membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>The question of British membership of the Communities is also affected by the decision arrived at by the Heads of Government on the review of the importation of quantities of New Zealand dairy products to the Community, in accordance with Protocol 18 of the Accession Treaty.</P>
    <P>The protocol permits the importation, free of levy, of certain specified quantities of these products in the years up to and including 1977.  Under the terms of the protocol, the arrangements are to be reviewed before the end of 1975.  The meeting decided on certain guidelines to be given to the institutions of the Community in <Col N="378" /> carrying out this review.  The Commission's proposals on the subject are to be ready as soon as practicable and are to include special import arrangements as provided for in Article 5 of the protocol, after 1977.  The proposals will provide for price reviews having regard to certain defined criteria.  I cannot, of course, anticipate the outcome of the review by the institutions of the Community under the arrangements we agreed yesterday, but I do not think that it will give rise to any great difficulties so far as this country is concerned.  The matter is dealt with in more detail in the declarations which I have had made available in the Library.</P>
    <P>The subject of Energy and the price of Energy occupied the attention of the meeting for a considerable time. There was, in particular, a great deal of concern expressed at the inadequacy of the Community preparations and policy in this area&mdash;which is vital to its security and stability. The meeting agreed that under the authority of the Council (Foreign Affairs) a special high level<i>ad hoc</i> Committee composed of representatives of the member states and of the Commission should be established so as to co-ordinate the approach to this problem in the interests both of consumers and producers, and of economic stability in the entire world. The first meeting of this committee is arranged for 19th March.  The Heads of Government have incorporated their views on this also in a declaration of which copies will be available in the Library.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the world economic situation with particular reference to the problems of unemployment and inflation following the steep increase in oil and other raw material prices, and to the influence which the major economies of the world exert on each other and on the economies of other countries.  There was general agreement that this issue and the views of the Heads of Government on it, should be referred to the meeting of Council of Ministers of the Community (Finance) to be held on 18th March.</P>
    <P>On raw materials, there was an extremely <Col N="379" /> useful discussion.  Security and continuity of supply is a matter of vital and growing importance to the countries of western Europe.  It was decided that the matter, which was coming before the Heads of Government for the first time, should be referred to the Council of Foreign Ministers on the basis of the proposals put before the Council by the Commission.</P>
    <P>We also had a useful discussion on the Conference and Security and Co-operation in Europe which is currently taking place in Geneva.  We have agreed on a statement on this subject which is also available in the Library.</P>
    <P>On Cyprus, the Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers, recalling the statement issued by the Foreign Ministers following their meeting in Dublin on 13th February expressed the hope that in the context of the discussions currently being held at the United Nations in New York, there will be an early resumption of negotiations on the question of Cyprus. The Nine will, of course, continue to keep in close touch with developments as regards the situation there.</P>
    <P>I was glad to have had the opportunity to preside over this Heads of Government meeting which, in addition to dealing successfully with other items, brought to a conclusion the prolonged discussion of the issues raised by the question of British membership.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the Taoiseach for responding so promptly to my request this morning for a statement on the conference held in the last two days.  I should like to express satisfaction, on behalf of the Opposition, at the outcome of the conference, in so far as reasonable adjustments now seem to have been agreed in the areas which were causing some concern for the British Government, so that the opportunity of their continued membership is now brighter, I am glad, however, to note that during the course of some interviews at the conference the Minister for Foreign <Col N="380" /> Affairs affirmed the view expressed so often by this side of the House that even if Britain does not wish to continue its membership that it would be in Ireland's best interests to continue even though we accept it would be even in our better interests if Britain were also a member.  I should like also to commend all those responsible for the satisfactory arrangements made for the efficient working of the conference.  I have had some experience of the extent of the task involved in hosting such a conference and in mounting the necessary facilities for visiting members of Governments, visiting officials, personnel and the media.  In addition, in this case the building had to be adapted for the purpose and I should like to pay tribute to all those who worked behind the scenes to ensure the satisfactory working of the conference. Apparently this was commented on by visiting personnel.</P>
      <P>There are one or two questions I should like to ask the Taoiseach but I do not know if he is prepared to answer them now.  Will he state specifically what are the implications for this country, arising out of the correcting mechanism now to be employed which, apparently, will reduce the financial input of the British Government in certain circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, in relation to the statement on New Zealand dairy product imports which I was handed a short time ago, will the Taoiseach state what are the implications of the agreement made apparently yesterday in relation to New Zealand cheese? Protocol 18 provided for exceptional imports of New Zealand cheese up to the end of 1977 and I would ask the Taoiseach how this can be reconciled with the final paragraph in the statement which stated that in relation to Protocol 18 there is to be a further review of the import of cheese from New Zealand with the New Zealand authorities with the objective of promoting in their mutual interests an orderly operation of world markets? There seems to be the implication in the Taoiseach's statement that some arrangements would be made after 1977 for the continued importation of <Col N="381" /> cheese to the market.  Specifically I wish to ask the Taoiseach in the event of the market being self-sufficient in cheese by the end of 1977 whether the facilities for the importation of New Zealand cheese, to the disadvantage of market producers and particularly Irish producers, will be continued.</P>
    <P>Finally, will the Taoiseach state if the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at a Press conference prior to the Taoiseach's own Press conference to the effect that nothing of real consequence for Ireland had been involved in the conference was a statement of the real position?  In summary, my questions are: first, the implications of the special mechanism for Britain; secondly, the implications in respect of any change in the Protocol with regard to New Zealand cheese; thirdly, whether the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs was a correct assessment of the outcome of the conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to endorse fully what the Leader of the Opposition said about the arrangements. In fact, I have already indicated that my thanks and the appreciation of the Government and the public should be conveyed to the people concerned. It is worthy of note that a number of favourable comments were made on the suitability, general competence and efficiency of the arrangements.</P>
      <P>So far as the queries raised by Deputy Lynch are concerned, the estimate of the effect on Ireland of the correcting mechanism ranges at about £1 million and £2 million at the very outside. Of course this depends on a number of factors and it is not possible to give a precise figure but that is the estimated assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as Protocol 18 is concerned, as the Deputy knows, cheese will be excluded after 1977 and the Protocol provides for a review by the Community before then.  It is not possible to anticipate the result but it would require an actual amendment of the Protocol included in the Treaty of Accession if any change is to be made with regard to cheese.  So far as butter <Col N="382" /> and cheese are concerned, deliveries from New Zealand have been far below the figure already included and it is not anticipated the matter will have any effect so far as this country is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, we heard many references to doctrinaire socialism in this debate and I pointed out it had little or no relevance to the topic under discussion.  However, as it was offered as an argument I should like to put these thoughts before the House for consideration.</P>
      <P>Doctrinaire socialism is the product of envy.  I heard no envious remarks in this House from the Government side.  There is not a scintilla of envy in the Government's White Paper and it is totally foreign to any approach we have adopted.  I think there has been plenty of doctrinaire conservatism. That is the product of fear of change and it was expressed in the House.  It was a wrong approach at a time when change is needed in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also had the ingredient of doctrinaire capitalism.  This is distinct from a proper understanding of the purpose and use of capitalism.  A doctrinaire capitalist probably accepts as legitimate that income, which is the value of labour, should be taxed but opposes taxation of property which is the accumulation of wealth that is in excess of current needs.  I consider all these doctrinal concepts wrong and think they are irrelevant and inappropriate to this debate.  Because they were introduced we had an extraordinary statement from Deputy Brennan, deputy leader of Fianna <Col N="383" /> Fáil, that the Wealth Tax Bill would promote a revolution.  I do not know if he was giving fair warning that some people are considering a <i>coup d'état</i>.  The remarks of Deputy Brennan would appear to foment discontent in a few people to whom I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the comments of the Confederation of Irish Industry published in their bulletin of 27th February last.  It would be appropriate that I should deal with that comment which was based on a number of inaccuracies, which produced figures that were wrongly calculated and which was, at best, very selective in the type of illustrations offered.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise once again that a company as such is not liable to wealth tax.  It is the shares in the hands of the shareholders which may become liable and only if shareholders happen to be fortunate enough to have wealth in excess of £100,000 in addition to a private residence and its contents. The valuation of company shares will be by reference to market value and market value will have regard to a number of things, including the control element.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry values the firm on a net assets basis irrespective of the percentage rate of return on those assets.  They have not taken into account the fact that valuations would consider amongst other things the net rate of return.  In the case of the lower rates, for instance, up to 10 per cent, the value of the shares would undoubtedly be much less than on an asset basis.</P>
    <P>An additional element which would operate to reduce the valuation of the shares would, of course be the very high level of loan capital employed. That is another factor that is not being considered by the Confederation of Irish Industry.  But, supposing we assume, for the sake of argument, that the valuation of the shareholding as given at £¼ million is correct, is it realistic to think that a married man with a shareholding of £250,000 has no other assets whatsoever, does not even have a principle private home <Col N="384" /> with ample contents?  One can only conclude from the example shown by the Confederation of Irish Industry that if such assets are not held by such persons, they are included as part of the assets of the company.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not unthinkable to ask that a person with assets in excess of £¼ million should pay about £950 or £1,000 wealth tax per annum?  That is what this Bill proposes and I do not think it is unreasonable.  Incidentally, the Confederation of Irish Industry paper overlooks the fact that there is an additional allowance of £2,500 per child and they suggest that the tax liability would be £1,000 whereas in fact the amount would be £950.</P>
    <P>But the submission is also faulty by what it omits, and that is, a contrast between the system that we are getting rid of and the system that will replace it.  It suggests that the proper picture is a no estate duty, no wealth tax, situation on the one side compared with a wealth tax situation, but that is not what is on offer.  We are getting rid of estate duty and we are replacing it with a wealth tax.  We have never said and we would not say, because we do not believe, that estate duty should be abolished without some alternative capital tax replacing it.  But the contrast which should be printed in black and white on the CII document is with the present situation in which wealth holdings of the size illustrated in their paper, of £¼ million would carry a tax of 55 per cent under estate duties and that would involve a tax payment of £137,500.  It will be a long time, indeed, before wealth tax, even as calculated by the CII, would reach to anything like that extortionate figure.</P>
    <P>The confederation also suggests that a business would not be subject to wealth tax if in the ownership of a foreign company and they have suggested that that is wrong.  Very strong representations were made to the Government that they should ensure that foreign interests which were invited to come to Ireland to set up here should not be frightened off by being subjected to taxation under a capital taxation code.  At present such foreigners <Col N="385" /> if they come here might well be subject to death duties.  They would not be subject to income tax on profits earned from goods which were manufactured here and exported but they would be liable to death duties. It does seem a bit thick that people should urge that no steps be taken to disadvantage foreign investment and then, as soon as these representations are listened to, come in and say that you were wrong to do that because you have provided a disadvantage affecting Irish people <i>vis-à-vis</i> foreigners. Again, let us look at the facts of the situation as distinct from the theory.  The foreign shareholders of the foreign company owning assets in Ireland may be liable in their own countries to capital taxes on such assets, so the differential suggested by the CII may not necessarily exist and in most cases would not exist.  In any event the number of cases in which a direct comparison between Irish and foreign ownership of a business of this size can be made would be very few, indeed.  It is only in the unusual type of family company that the impact of the wealth tax&mdash;which again I want to emphasise is leviable only on the individual&mdash;can be regarded as an indirect impact on the company and on the company's funds.  In the more general case of foreign investment in Ireland ownership, shareholding, would be very widely distributed and it is clear that in such cases the comparisons drawn by the CII are not relevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have checked this through the Revenue Commissioners and this is the information at our disposal. It is suggested that foreign interests are going to rush into Ireland to buy up firms which are supplying the home market.  This, again, is an unreal expectation.  I have no doubt that we could carry on the debate for months and years here producing one unreal and unlikely situation after <Col N="386" /> another to produce some highly imaginary and anomalous situations.  It is time that we would be serious about what is the usual experience in business. If you take what is normal as distinct from what is fanciful, you will find that the Government's proposals are exceedingly reasonable.</P>
      <P>It is also suggested in any event that if assets here were to be purchased by foreign interests instead of Irish, Irish employment would somehow or other be affected.  We as a Government want the highest degree possible of Irish ownership of Irish assets.  This will continue to be our policy and we will promote it by every positive way we can.  The fact that ownership of a productive asset that is used in the course of employment is non-Irish does not affect Irish employment. Many of the largest industries which are providing employment in this country are owned by foreigners but that has not affected their employment potential and that is another indication that the CII argument is one of special pleading.</P>
      <P>The strange thing is that although CII argue that the Government package will encourage foreign investment rather than Irish investment they conclude their comment with the allegation that the whole package will discourage private foreign investment in Ireland.  So that you have the strange situation in which, like Deputy Colley's grasshopper, they hop from one argument to another and if in the process they contradict themselves, that apparently does not upset them tremendously.</P>
      <P>On a few specific items: I was asked about section 5 (3), discretionary trusts, and why the objects of such discretionary trusts should be treated as entitled equally.  It was said, fairly enough, that this might not accord with the facts of a particular trust.  First of all, this particular operation is more likely to benefit the parties, the beneficiaries of the trust, because if the trust assets are distributed evenly between the objects of the trust, it is likely to reduce but not to eliminate the liability to tax of the individuals concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way in which they could <Col N="387" /> be treated differently would be to look behind each trust, to get the detailed terms of each trust to obtain records of payments out of the trust over a period of years which would add consideraby to administration problems both for public and the private interests. On balance, I think the treatment we propose will be of benefit to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I was asked why we required 75 per cent of the tax payable would be asked for before an appeal would be allowed.  The tax we are dealing with is at 1 per cent above certain levels, so that the effective rate of the tax, taking total assets, will be much less than 1 per cent.  Unless there was some kind of brake on appeals, the likelihood is that a multitude of speculative appeals would be generated for the purpose of obtaining postponement of tax payments.  As Deputy de Valera said, it is right we should take steps to prevent clogging up the administrative machine.  This is a reasonable requirement which will not weigh heavily on any taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I listened to what Deputies had to say about the requirement that tax be paid within three months of the assessment date.  I think three months would be appropriate in any year.  To allow payment to go beyond that would be to permit people to postpone payment and the State would be obliged to borrow money to make good the deficit.</P>

      <P>We are saying that in order to avoid having to pay interest on overdue tax a person should pay on account.  The system is one of self-assessment until such time as the Revenue Commissioners get around to making their assessment.  Estate duty is of that form and provisional assessments are made regularly by the Estate Duty Office, based on figures offered by the personal representatives of deceased persons' estates.  These provisional assessments are corrected later.  Since August, 1973, in order to speed up probate and administration, special arrangements were made in the Estate Duty Office to issue provisional assessments as a matter of course.  They are subject to correction later on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Deputy favours the Wealth Tax Bill which is an instalment tax to replace estate duty payable on the termination of a human life.  That tax was paid in an extortionate form by the next-of-kin of somebody who had not taken timely avoidance steps.</P>
      <P>I have been asked to say how shares of trading companies will be valued. The valuation rules are not being changed.  They are those that have been operating for years past in respect of estate duty.  All factors are taken into account.  They include the assets of a company, the return on capital, the dividend record, the nature of the business, the prospects for the company.  If a company is doing badly, in the kind of way Deputies opposite have described, this will be reflected in the value of the shares.  Therefore, the kind of unreal situation of a company doing badly and having to pay a cruel amount of tax is unlikely to arise.  The real criterion for the valuation of shares is what a purchaser, at arm's length would pay for such shares.  If such shares are in a productive company, one takes the fair value of those shares, less 20 per cent, because they would be treated as productive assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> Deputy Belton mentioned the CII circular.  He mentioned that small businesses or firms could be badly hit by liquidity problems.  He said it would be a case of the Government taking money from successful firms and the Government putting the money to bad use.  With respect, I feel he misreads the situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Myles Staunton.  He was the one Deputy throughout the whole debate who properly grasped who would be liable.  He asserted, quite rightly, that companies would not be liable.  It is only the shareholders who have assets, together with their shares above a level of £100,000&mdash;the home and contents not being taken into account&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No doubt we will. The private, non-trading company is liable, as an entity in itself and it has to be.  If we do not make a private non-trading company liable as an entity in itself, it could be a convenient avenue for avoidance to any person with wealth above the thresholds of exemption, who would simply create a number of private non-trading companies <Col N="392" /> to distribute the assets around those companies and, in that way, escape liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If a reasonably simple method of getting over it was offered to the Minister, would he give it consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, most certainly. I am a very considerate man.  I recall also that Deputy Staunton realised that the majority of foreign industry coming to this country is set up by foreign corporations and not by individuals. He appreciates that shares in the foreign corporations would not be liable as they would be owned by foreigners.  Therefore, no disincentive to foreign investors arises.  Deputy Staunton expressed anxiety about one matter.  In fact, I think it was the only matter about which Deputy Staunton had any worry.  I should like to commend to the House the speech of Deputy Staunton because he is a successful businessman who understands how business ticks.  I would say he would be more typical of and know more about the small and medium businessmen of this country than some of the commentators from the Opposition benches.</P>
      <P>I think the 80 per cent ceiling of income in respect of income and wealth tax combined meets the situation Deputy Staunton had in mind where a business had a very poor return on capital.  As I said earlier, the valuation of such business anyway would take account of the poor return on the capital invested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an 80 per cent ceiling subject to not reducing the <Col N="393" /> wealth tax by more than 50 per cent of what it would be otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If anybody is sitting on assets which would not give them relief under the formula we propose, then in their own interests they would be better to get off such assets and let somebody else handle them.  That is being realistic.  One of the beneficial consequences of capital tax legislation will make people think, will make them reassess the return they are getting from their capital investment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley posed me the specific question: could I say, as a result of these new packages, whether or not, there would be an incentive to capital investment in Ireland?  I believe there will be a far greater incentive to use capital wisely and productively, to get a better return from it which will benefit not merely the owner of the capital but the community as a whole. On that account, I believe that the whole new, rethink we have forced upon many unwilling and unthinking people over the last year has been beneficial and will operate to the benefit of the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lalor asked me whether the provision enabling the Revenue Commissioners to authorise persons to inspect property for the purposes of valuation is new.  It is not new and I am sure Deputy Colley can tell him that.  It has existed since the Finance Act of 1894 and is provided for in many other Acts since then. Obviously, the Revenue Commissioners must have a right to assess the properties returned to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked what would be the definition of normal contents of a house and how they would be assessed. Normal contents mean the normal contents appropriate to the house in question.  It is something which is not capable of precise definition.  Obviously, if somebody in a small house has a whole stock of diamonds it would be reasonable to assume that such a diamond hoard would not be the normal contents of that house.  I give that merely as an illustration of what might be regarded as abnormal <Col N="394" /> contents of a house.  No doubt, there will be the grey areas and those of dispute but any taxpayer aggrieved by an assessment will have a right of appeal.</P>
    <P>Section 7 exempts annuities and lump sum benefits which any self-employed person might contract with an insurance company to have for himself on retirement.  The question was specifically put to me as to whether annuities and lump-sum benefits would be exempt.  I want to emphasise that they will be.  This puts the self-employed person in the same position as an employee who would receive such benefit under a superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked me to postpone doing anything until something was done in Britain.  I think that would be wrong.  We are an independent, sovereign, State with a right and, I believe, a duty to make our own arrangements.  While we must sensibly take note of what is happening in the outside world&mdash;particularly when you are a country endeavouring to attract capital&mdash;it would be wrong for us to postpone taking action until other countries took action in theirs. But it is fair to look at what is proposed in Britain, remembering that Britain is not proposing anything as beneficial to the taxpayer as our abolition of estate duties and remembering that Britain already has a capital gains tax which operates at a rate higher than ours.  It is worthy of note that in the British Green Paper on wealth tax, now being considered in Committee in the British Parliament, the rates of tax proposed are from 1 per cent to 5 per cent.  Our ceiling is 1 per cent.  They do not propose to exempt owner-occupied houses.  In fact, very specifically the British Government have said this in paragraph 28 of their Green Paper:</P>
    <P>Owner-occupied houses should fall within the scope of the charge. They are clearly realisable assets and their exemption would be unfair to those wealthy people who live in rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>They also say in paragraph 35 of the Green Paper which reflects the British Government's view:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> In the Government's view it would be wrong to exempt business assets or farms from the tax or to calculate liabilities on such assets on specially favourable terms.</P>
    <P>We are giving specially favourable terms for business assets and for farms.  We are exempting the private home and its contents and we are not charging the tax at a rate above 1 per cent.  It may well be the British Government may not proceed with all that they set out in their Green Paper any more than we did all that we had in our original consultative paper, but if they were to adopt our scheme they would have to climb down a great deal more than we did or at any time were obliged to contemplate.</P>

      <P>In page 3, lines 11 and 12, to delete &ldquo;in a university, or by reason of other experience or of other special qualifications or training&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;or by reason of such other special experience, qualification or training as, in the opinion of the Government, is appropriate having regard to the functions of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to deal with two matters which arose during the discussion in the Special Committee. It was pointed out that there are teachers of law in institutions which have not got university status <Col N="397" /> and that the Bill as drafted, when referring to the qualifications of persons for appointment to membership of the commission as teachers of law, limits such qualification to teachers of law in a university.  By deleting the words &ldquo;in a university&rdquo; it will be made clear that teachers of law in all institutions will be eligible for appointment.  Secondly, the amendment deals with the suggestions made in the Committee that the last part of this subsection should be more specific.  The suggestions were considered by the parliamentary draftsman and the wording now proposed takes into account the views that were expressed. The result will be that the section will provide that persons eligible for appointment to membership of the commission will include persons qualified by reason of such other special experience, qualification or training as, in the opinion of the Government, is appropriate having regard to the functions of the commission. This will make it clear that the qualifications referred to are relevant to the functions which the commission have to perform.</P>

    <P>If the House agrees, amendments Nos. 2 and 3 could be taken together. Amendment No. 2 is a drafting amendment which can be made if amendment No. 3 is accepted.  Amendment No. 3 proposes the insertion of a new subsection.  As Deputies are aware, the membership of the commission will be for a limited period only and the Bill likewise envisages that persons may be appointed to the professional staff of the commission for a special purpose and for limited periods of time.  It has been pointed out to me that a person who leaves his practice as a barrister or a solicitor for a period of time could be placed at a disadvantage if the subsection proposed was not enacted.  It is proposed therefore that service as a commissioner or as an officer of the commission will be deemed to be practice at the Bar or practice as a solicitor for the purpose of the relevant provisions of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 and the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really a drafting amendment.  This is a wise, fair and equitable addition and I am sure the committee would have readily agreed to it had it been adverted to. The Attorney General is right to introduce it and we will take it as agreed.  Subsection (3) of amendment No. 3 reads:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of qualification for appointment&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  under section 29 (2) of the Act of 1961 as a justice of the District Court,</P>
      <P>(b)  under section 51 (as so amended) of the Act of 1936, to act temporarily as such a justice,</P>
      <P>in subsection (2) of this section, the reference to a barrister shall be construed as including a reference to a solicitor and the reference to practice at the Bar shall be construed as including a reference to practice as a solicitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is unobjectionable and is perfectly <Col N="399" /> correct.  I have an instinctive objection to getting over drafting niceties by this device, in other words, by describing something as something which it is not.  There is an essential difference in the legal system and in legislation between the two branches of the profession.  Although I have no objection to what is happening in this Bill I do not like this method.  I should have preferred to treat the two as separate.  I hasten to assure the Attorney General that I will not make a point of this now.</P>
    <P>This is one of the rare occasions when we have the Attorney General in his ministerial capacity in the House.  As his responsibility is drafting generally, I wanted to make that point in drafting law.  The description of something which is different from another thing, such as a solicitor is different from a barrister, seems dangerous and can lead to absurdities. The classic absurdity occurred during the war when the hard case made the bad law.  At the beginning of the war a statutory order was made forbidding the export of scrap iron.  At that time there was a run on the export of horses.  In order to prevent the export of horses an amazing order appeared defining a horse as scrap iron.  As far as I remember the order read the term &ldquo;scrap iron&rdquo; shall include &ldquo;horse&rdquo;.  I hope the Attorney General takes my point.  I will not delay the House any further.  This amendment is acceptable.  As a member of the committee I can say that it would have been accepted without objection had the point been adverted to.</P>

      <P>As the Attorney General does not want to say anything on this Stage, I am sure he will not object if I say a few words.  This Bill is a useful and desirable measure.  On other occasions here we complained about the prolixity of law.  In recent times I complained constantly about the form in which financial legislation came before the House.  We will later be dealing with a classic example of legislation by reference&mdash;the Social Welfare Bill.  It is very difficult in modern times to avoid this type of legislation because one Bill is adding to another.  Legislation by reference makes it practically impossible for anybody but the trained lawyer who is pursuing his profession to grasp the totality of the legislation, unless the person in question happens to be engaged in the administration of the code concerned.</P>
      <P>There have been efforts, sometimes successful, to consolidate.  One of the difficulties about consolidation is that amending legislation takes place so quickly that it is an on-going process. In other words, we have no sooner consolidated than we are preparing for further consolidation in the future.</P>
      <P>In the social context there is a need for a revision of law, legal thinking and legal formulation to meet current requirements.  These functions make a commission as envisaged in this Bill desirable.  In my view it would be a mistake to think that this Bill will deal totally with consolidation or that it will be the mechanism for preparing Bills or doing the Government's job as regards policy, legislation or the work of the House.  The provision of this commission will supplement or be another organised arm of the area under the immediate direction of the Attorney General and, to some extent, the Department of Justice in the preparation and anticipation of legislation and the recommendation of areas in which legislation is to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it this commission will not be fixed with functions appropriate to the Attorney General's office in regard to drafting.  I take it the Bill does not cut across in any way the functions of a Minister in his Department in proposing legislation for the particular purposes of his Department. <Col N="402" /> Nevertheless an agency such as the Bill contemplates is necessary to deal with law reform, to look at law from a legal and from a general point of view and to complement existing agencies at the disposal of the Attorney General.  That is what I conceive this Bill to do.  Other people may have different conceptions of how it fits into the scheme of things.  The Bill will provide a commission of intelligent people&mdash;I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;expert&rdquo; because that can be open to a too narrow and too technical interpretation&mdash;a group of reasonable people, people who will know what they are doing, undertaking a task they are highly competent to undertake and, above all, possessing the qualities of broadmindedness and good judgment to offset a too purely technical approach on the one hand and a purely administrative or managerial approach on the other.  In that way a balance will be provided in the discharge of the very necessary functions of this House and the Government in modern times to see that law is practicable, that it is intelligible to citizens as a whole, that it is simple, workable and competent to cater for the needs of the community in the social circumstances of the times and that it is in accord with current ruling social and economic factors.  In that sense I commend the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> On Committee Stage we indicated our belief in the importance of parents or guardians in dealing with young persons below school leaving age and persons under the age of 18.  We argued that an amendment was desirabe in the definition of &ldquo;representatives of employees&rdquo; in the Bill.  In the definition section it is provided:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;representatives of employees&rdquo; means such trade unions as are, in the opinion of the Minister, representative of the employees in relation to which the expression is used, or where there is no such trade union, such persons as are, in the opinion of the Minister, representative of such employees;</P>
    <P>This is a very sensitive area and the definition section does not acknowledge the specific right of parents or guardians to be representative of employees. We have tabled two amendments to provide the Minister with an option but we believe the first amendments to provide the Minister with an option but we believe the first amendment is the most desirable and the most suitable.  In an amendment tabled by the Minister there is a reference to parents and guardians.  The acknowledgement of the right of parents and guardians is most important.  We ask the Minister to accept the amendment by broadening the definition to include parents or guardians as representatives of employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support everything Deputy Dowling has said.  We want the Bill to be as flexible as possible. On Committee Stage the Minister intimated that he would have another look at this and we believed he would put down an amendment.  I strongly urge the Minister to acknowledge the right of parents or guardians in this particular instance.  I have checked on that since and we are quite confident that, in fact, parents or guardians are included in the Bill as it stands.  I agree that parents or guardians can be consulted in the Bill as drafted.  I am advised that the inclusion by name of parent or guardian would be unduly restrictive. According to the rules of legal construction of statutes the proposed insertion could operate in practice to restrict the range of consultation with <Col N="404" /> various interested groups, including parents and guardians.</P>
      <P>In the Bill as drafted parents or guardians are included in the terminology we have here.  It seems paradoxical to put it this way but if we actually write them in by name in that sense the best advice available to us is that, in fact, it becomes a narrower interpretation and we do precisely the opposite to what the Deputies wish to bring about.  Since I am confident that parents and guardians are included in our legal definition here, it would be bad construction to introduce what could become an element of ambiguity by bringing in these terms.  There could, therefore, be a kind of technical constraint&mdash;one not intended by Members of the Oireachtas&mdash;by the inclusion of this term.</P>
      <P>I should also explain that the expression &ldquo;person&rdquo; used in the section is defined exactly as in section 11 of the Interpretation Act, 1937 and that word includes a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons as well as an individual. Therefore, it covers all description of individuals and associates.  The addition, therefore, proposed is in the circumstances superfluous and would not work in the direction the Deputies desire.  I hope they will appreciate that when I as I am proposing to do, reject their amendment, it is simply because the best advice available to us suggests that they would not be serving their own purpose by seeking the inclusion of the parent and guardian as they suggest.</P>

      <P>The interpretation here states: &ldquo;representative of the employer in relation to whom the expression is used, or where there is no such association, such persons as are, in the opinion of the Minister, representative of such employers.&rdquo; This can, in fact, mean that a person, other than the parent or guardian, can be the suitable person in the Minister's opinion, disregarding completely the rights of the parent or guardian. We feel this is where the weakness is in this particular section.</P>

      <P>I can reply to the amendment, the same as the Minister has the option to reply.  The Minister's opinion can be that the persons representing the employees are not, in fact, the parents or guardians. The weakness in this particular section is that a definite and positive indication is not given that the parents or guardians have such rights and that the opinion of the Minister cannot supersede the rights of parents or <Col N="406" /> guardians.  This is an issue on which there can be no give or take.  An assurance must be given that parents or guardians have the right.  It should not be superseded by the opinion of the Minister that some other person is the person who is the representative of the employee.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 7, after &ldquo;persons&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or associations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>According to the section, representatives of the employees mean such trade unions as are in the opinion of the Minister representative of the employees in relation to whom the expression is used or, where there is no such trade union, such persons as are, in the opinion of the Minister, representative of such employees. There could be other organisations or associations representative of the employee.  Associations, youth councils or other people who could be classified as representative of the employees should not be debarred.  The Minister having defeated the first amendment, having failed to recognise the right of parents or guardians, should at least accept this amendment in this very sensitive area.  The amendment is self-explanatory.  It has reference to the right of representatives.  I ask that some associations that might have the right to represent should be included in the definition section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Dowling's amendment again on this occasion.  It is the Minister's responsibility to accept the amendment.  I could not follow the Minister's line of argument in rejecting the last amendment that had reference to parents and guardians of young persons. The Minister denies them the opportunity of being recorded in a Bill such as this as having an obvious right in a situation as outlined in the section.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes that &ldquo;association&rdquo; be included.  There may be youth associations or associations of various types that would be well equipped to speak for young persons in circumstances where a trade union would not exist.  It is not right that the Minister should say that where trade unions do not exist it is only persons who in his opinion are regarded as representative of such employee who should be included in the Bill.  I accept that the Minister is a responsible man and I hope that successive Ministers will have the same sense of responsibility. As the Bill stands it is the Minister's opinion that governs who represents a young person when a trade union does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not accept the first amendment which sought to recognise the right of any parent or guardian. As a parent, I would be annoyed with any Minister who would not have a parent or guardian included in the Bill as having first priority to represent a young person.  Not <Col N="409" /> having accepted that amendment, the Minister should accept the amendment in Deputy Dowling's name and include &ldquo;association&rdquo;. A trade union is acceptable, and rightly so, but when it comes to the person for whom no union exists, the Bill says that it is only persons who in the Minister's opinion are representative who are entitled to speak for the young person.  Who will these people be?  It can cover a very wide field.  I would have my priorities and I am sure the Minister would have his priorities.  The Minister should specify his priorities in legislation introduced in the House.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that a Minister introducing a Bill with the title Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill, 1974, would not take cognisance of the parent in the first place.  There are many excellent organisations and associations catering for and working for young people. These people could be consulted in a situation where trade unions do not exist.</P>
    <P>If the Minister continues the line of argument which he adopted on the first amendment, I would find it very difficult to accept his argument.  He suggested that to include the parent or guardian would inhibit and would not help what we wanted to achieve by this Bill.  I cannot see how it would hinder it.  I cannot see how the same line of argument regarding &ldquo;associations&rdquo; would be valid.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment for a number of reasons, first of all, to give some status and recognition to the many youth organisations and associations that exist, who may on occasion be in a strong position to speak in certain areas.  Remember, we are talking of the country as a whole. I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be my fault.  I tried to explain on the last amendment that what the Deputies are seeking is, in fact, in the Bill.  Whilst I have no objection to Deputies expressing their position by vote or by speech or otherwise, I would suggest to the Deputies that they are involved in a rather foolish enterprise when <Col N="410" /> what they are seeking is, in fact, in the legislation before us.  I would put it to the Deputies that they are not dealing simply with my opinion.  We have consulted a very wide range of expert opinion, including legal opinion, on this matter and I can assure the Deputies that, in fact, the opinions they are expressing here are covered in the legislation before us.</P>
      <P>I would explain again that the expression &ldquo;person&rdquo; as used here includes a body corporate or a non-corporate body or persons as well as an individual.  That means the non-trade union body, the youth organisation. All of these are included in the terminology used, which covers all description of associations and the addition proposed is, therefore, superfluous. Where there is no trade union representative of the employee, I am empowered to consult the widest possible spectrum of persons.</P>
      <P>In the explanatory document which I will put out with this legislation after its passage through both Houses I will explain this Bill in simple, layman's language so that nobody will have any doubts about their rights under the legislation.  I would appeal to Deputies to understand that what they are seeking is here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If &ldquo;person&rdquo; has such a wide meaning as the Minister has indicated, surely it covers trade unions and other organisations?  Why then insert &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; in the definition section?  The Minister included &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; as distinct from a parent or guardian or association.  It is not logical to me.  I am not concerned about the advisers he has consulted.  There is common sense and logic in relation to this problem and there are the basic and fundamental rights of the parents. The Minister wishes to interpret the term &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  There is no interpretation of &ldquo;person&rdquo; in this Bill.  It is the Minister's own interpretation or the interpretation given to him by someone.  If it covers the wide field that the Minister has indicated, then there is no need for this section at all. Just put down &ldquo;persons representative of the employee or persons&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill that I am concerned about is the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill, 1974.  Whatever they may have thought in 1937 or 1957 or 1947 does not concern me at the moment.  This is a Bill that will be read by the public, by employers and by representatives of the employees.  If the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; is so wide, why does the Minister include &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; as distinct from other organisations?  Is it not just as vital that other organisations such as the Youth Council or a variety of organisations would have the right to speak on behalf of employees?  Once the term &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; is inserted, &ldquo;other organisations&rdquo; should be inserted. If the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means all of these things, I fail to see the Minister's logic.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned with the advice he got.  If a young person or an employer reads this Bill he will see the definition section and interpret it accordingly and not regard the opinion of the Minister or anybody else. Although I have regard for the Minister's opinion on certain matters, this Act will be the concern of other Ministers for Labour in the years to come because the present Minister will not be long there.</P>
      <P>Why does the Minister ignore parents and guardians and refer only to trade unions?  In the Minister's opinion, parents and guardians are to be superseded by associations which the Minister thinks should represent the employees.  Is it the Minister's opinion that no other organisation or individual than trade unions should be accepted?  This is a backward step and I would ask the Minister between now and the time the Bill goes to the Seanad to have another look at this and to get other advice on it.</P>

The point was made that, perhaps, section 4 was a bit excessively inflexible.  The advantages of certain hours being worked at weekends by contrast with weekdays were raised.  Although I feel the formula in the Bill&mdash;so many hours per school days and per weekends spread over the entire period&mdash;still seems to me to be the most reasonable, I appreciate there are varying views on the question in accordance with varying circumstances, regional as well as industrial.  I feel the best course, therefore, should be that, bearing in mind the point made about the variation of the maximum of 35 hours a week during holiday periods, I would take power by affirmative order of the Oireachtas to vary these hours generally, and this will mean that if I consider in the light of experience that a change is warranted in the future I can bring a proposal before both Houses of the Oireachtas to seek their approval before making an order.

      <P>We welcome this amendment.  The Minister has accepted <Col N="413" /> the point we made about the regional consideration.  We were concerned mainly with the rigidity of the section.  It is a criticism we have in regard to other sections of the Bill. This is a new explanatory piece of legislation and as the Minister admitted we have not a lot of statistical information.  Therefore, this type of flexibility of the Minister being able to make orders is required.  We feel our pressure on Committee Stage was responsible for this amendment and we would have welcomed similar amendments to other sections.  Therefore, we would welcome the Minister agreeing to have another look at this on the basis that being a Bill of this nature, being first in many fields, it creates a number of difficulties for young people.</P>
      <P>The basic purpose of the Bill is to prevent exploitation of young people and that is why we are supporting it. The Bill may present certain social problems for young people and for families.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 41, to delete &ldquo;or other satisfactory record&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;in such form as may be specified by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is necessary in legislation of this kind to have some flexible areas and others more rigid.  We feel this area should be fairly rigid.  Subsection 5 (1) (b) says:</P>
      <P>maintain a register, or other satisfactory record containing the following particulars of every young person or child employed by him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Then those particulars are listed.  We ask what one would define as being a satisfactory record?  We feel there should be specified by the Minister, or the Department the type of form an employer should maintain, the type of register he should keep, not merely any type of copybook that could be changed from day to day, but a definite record for all time.  We feel the term &ldquo;satisfactory record&rdquo; is vague and open to a variety of interpretations. What may be satisfactory in the opinion of one person may not be in that of another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel it should be more rigid.  It is the section which provides for the maintenance of records.  Records must be kept in a particular way, for a particular period, on a particular form and not left to an individual to decide what, in his opinion, is the best form.  I would ask the Minister to issue a form, as in the case of PAYE or value-added tax, where a particular form was issued by the Department involved, setting out the way one must keep such records.  We feel records <Col N="415" /> must be maintained in a form specified by the Minister or his Department to cover all aspects together with any others the Minister may feel necessary or desirable.  It is necessary that such records be of lasting value rather than ones that could be destroyed or changed.  It may not seem very important but we feel some more positive term than &ldquo;or other satisfactory record&rdquo; should be inserted in subsection 5 (1) (b) and we would ask the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern that there should be adequate records maintained.  Subsection 5 (1) requires the employer to maintain a register or other satisfactory record containing certain specified particulars.  The details are included in subsection 5 (1) (b) where we look for the full name of the young person or child, the date of birth, the time the young person or child commences work each day, the time the young person or child finishes work each day, the rate of wages or salary paid to the young person or child for his normal working hours per day, per week, per month or per year and the total amount paid to each young person or child by way of wages or salary.  Therefore, we specify exactly the type of information required.  As long as that is done, I cannot see any good reason for departing from a flexible arrangement consistent with the minimum additional record-keeping. I do not wish to burden employers with unnecessary paper work and make the provision of a particular form a statutory obligation.  I am reluctant to put that extra paper work burden on, perhaps, small employers or others around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am concerned about is to ensure that the information is available to the inspectors enforcing this legislation, that we arm them with sufficient power to look for all relevant records.  For example, in compliance with the requirement in subsection 5 (1) (b) it could be envisaged that an employer could offer his personnel records, time cards, wage records, computer print-outs, showing individually, <Col N="416" /> or collectively, all the required particulars as it happens to suit his current record system.  There is no uniformity of record system by employers even at present.  Several employers have indicated that they keep the required data already but in more than one record and in varying format.</P>
    <P>I believe I have set out in specified form the details I require.  What the Deputy is seeking to bring about is included in the objectives of subsection 5 (1) (b).  Taking into account the information that can be sought there and the powers of the inspectorate, we will be able to obtain all the information necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 30, to delete &ldquo;fifty&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;forty-five&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the maximum working hours of young persons over the age of 16 years, 50 hours in any week or such other number of hours as may be specified in an agreement applying to the young persons.  That is stated in subsection 7 (1) (b).  We ask the Minister to delete 50 and substitute there-for 45.  There must be a difference between the hours worked by a young person and those by an adult.  While these are the maximum number of hours, we feel that 50 is rather long when the general trend of working <Col N="417" /> hours for the adult worker is 40 per week.  Indeed, the maximum working hours for adults, in many cases, would probably average less than 50. This is applicable to the situation where a young person over the age of 16 years is employed, where the labour to the employer would be cheaper than that of an adult worker, where an employer could exploit a young person at the expense of an adult worker.  He could utilise such young labour for a maximum of 50 hours at a lesser rate of pay.  There is an effort being made to close the gap between the normal working hours and the maximum working hours of individuals.  We feel it wrong that the period in respect of a young person should be open to exploitation in any form whatsoever.  It may be a very small percentage of irresponsible employers who would seek to exploit young labour.  No doubt the majority of employers would not.</P>
    <P>Where there is the desire to reduce the normal working week, it is unsatisfactory that the maximum working week would not be reduced also.  If every worker was allowed work the maximum number of hours, then we would have very many people not at present in dole queues there in due course.  If employers wished to exploit the situation and work each of their employees to the maximum&mdash;workers over 16 years of age&mdash;then we would have a very serious situation indeed. On the other hand, there is the desire in relation to adult workers to close this gap.  As we pointed out on Committee Stage, many adult workers work far less than 40 hours and there is a maximum working week of 40 hours.  It is certainly anomalous that young persons should be conditioned to a 50-hour week.  In this Bill we had an ideal opportunity to show to the world that our thinking was progressive in relation to young persons and to indicate that we would not be bound by the legislation already there.  By the time this Bill is enacted other nations will have much more progressive legislation for young persons.  I should like to see a comparison of our legislation with that of other countries.  We would probably find that ours is the most <Col N="418" /> backward.  We certainly expected more from a socialist Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to condemn this subsection as I condemned the subsection with the limitation of ten hours per day for a young person.  This is something that should have been remedied, but if the force of numbers is to be the deciding factor in this House in relation to the maximum number of working hours for young workers it is a poor look out.  I do not know whether the Minister was pressurised into this situation by some right wing section, but it certainly does not do either him or the Government justice when we see these long hours which we thought we were moving away from and which, in fact, adult workers have moved away from.  We shall probably have a situation in the not too distant future when adult workers will be working for 35 hours a week while young persons will be exploited by employers who can maintain them on a lower wage rate for as much as 50 hours per week as specified in this Bill.  We hope that even in the Seanad the Minister will take his courage in his hands and say: &ldquo;I do not agree with this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister on many occasions both in government and in opposition, I thought that at the first opportunity he would bring in the most progressive legislation ever to be enacted here.  Instead of that we have the direct opposite.  Nevertheless, I still hope that the Minister will examine his conscience.  If there are shackles binding him, let him throw them off.  If they are not binding him, then he will have this on his conscience.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Deputy Dowling's amendment.  If we are to be progressive, then we should not impose a maximum of 50 hours on persons of the age of 16 years in 1975 conditions.  Certainly 45 hours would seem to be a more sensible figure.  I am disappointed that the pattern of legislation in the 1920s should be followed in this Bill, where there is a maximum number of hours per day, a maximum number of hours per week, for a four-week period and for a year.  I do not agree with those <Col N="419" /> criteria.  I asked the Minister the last day where such ideas came from.  Legislation should be introduced on the basis of what we consider suitable to our conditions and specify a maximum weekly working hour for people of this age group.  We are not so much concerned now with the four-week period because we have holiday regulations, and there are certain single-day holidays and annual holidays.  All these can be taken into consideration. I would ask the Minister to make a name for himself as a progressive Minister by scrapping this section and going to the Seanad with another provision. In our legislation we are too much inclined to follow precedents. &ldquo;Such-and-such a section is included because it was provided in a previous Act.&rdquo;  Surely what we must be looking at is a 1975 Act for 1975 conditions.</P>

      <P>The more I see of the Bill the less happy I am with it.  I do not think I ever saw anything as ridiculous as the Minister's amendment No. 6, the effect of which is to reduce the number of hours to 2,100 per year. Who could keep a record?  Can you imagine an apprentice saying in December that he still had three or four hours to go because he had worked 2,100 hours?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling's amendment is straightforward.  Any section which would ask a boy to work over 37 hours a week would be contrary to the Apprenticeship Acts. An apprentice's hours are limited by law.  He must be let go when he has worked a certain number of hours a day.  Under this Bill an unscrupulous employer could make the boy, not an apprentice, do extra hours and also some of the work which an apprentice should be doing during his shorter day.  This shows the absurdity of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling's amendment is better than the Minister's.  The Minister <Col N="420" /> should take a look at the working hours under this Bill.  This section is so flimsy he will walk into trouble. I can see trouble from the trade unions on this point also.  For years they fought to have apprentices' hours cut to the minimum.  They will not want to see a Trojan horse type of legislation brought in to lengthen the hours worked by a young person.</P>
    <P>Too few boys and girls get a chance of an apprenticeship.  The Minister should have another look at this point and when the Bill is in the Seanad the weekly hours to be worked should be vastly reduced.  Charles Dickens would have condemned some of the things in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We always do.  I repeat the Minister should look at this point again.  It could be abused by unscrupulous employers or by an employer who is short of labour at a certain time.  Under one Bill an employer could say that the boy or girl should work X number of hours, but an apprentice works a shorter day.  The Minister should clear up this confusion. Unfortunately I did not have time to get information on apprenticeship hours.  If his officials advise the Minister of the hours worked by apprentices in any industry he will see that they are less than the number given in this Bill.  There is still time for the Minister to ensure that this House does not pass legislation which can be manipulated and used against young people.</P>

      <P>I know Deputies make their contributions in all sincerity, in my best interests and in the interests of the people the Bill is designed to protect.  I can set their fears at rest.  Here we are talking about maximum hours beyond which there will be strict legal penalties and a very heavy fine imposed.  Over the early period the maximum hours worked in a week would be 43 and not 50.  Once we understand that, we bring this question into more realistic perspective which would keep the recommendations in line with good industrial <Col N="421" /> practice.  We are not talking about normal working hours but maximum working hours beyond which strict legal penalties would follow on breach. It must also be taken into account that in later sections rest periods are laid down which must also be complied with.  Therefore, I decline the halo of William Martin Murphy which the Deputies opposite proferred. I am confident this is forward legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister could not be more progressive.  He must realise that many of the young people to which this Bill refers will not have the advantage of the support of trade unions to better their conditions.  Their conditions will be outlined in this House. Does the Minister consider that this is a reasonable maximum period for a young person to work?  We do not. If the Minister was negotiating with an employer on behalf of a trade union I am certain he would say that a maximum of 50 hours per week is too great for a young person to work. The Minister now has the power to make a decision.  The decision he reached will not get him any applause. It is a backward step which will place many young people at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the maximum number of hours were less these young people would probably pursue courses of study which would benefit them in later years.  It is disturbing to see young people of 16 or 17 years being sentenced to a maximum of 50 hours. This will disrupt their courses.  The Minister should take this aspect into consideration.  On reflection I am sure he will realise he has done a grave injustice to these young people.  People of 16 or 17 should be protected and assisted to participate in educational activities which will prepare them for the technical age in which we live. Some of these young people may be in employment which they cannot change.  Notwithstanding the points made in relation to cheap labour, the Minister has an obligation to these young people.  Here he is insisting on long dreary hours which may well deprive young people of the opportunity of pursuing certain studies or <Col N="422" /> courses to their advantage in later years.  Perhaps the Minister would have another look at this before the Bill goes to the Seanad.  Will he consult with the trade unions and the young people's organisations and, if he is satisfied there is a case for a reduction, let him make that reduction when the Bill comes before the Seanad?</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore made a point about apprentices.  I do not know whether this provision would be in conflict with the law governing apprenticeship but surely this could apply to apprentices. Will the Minister give an undertaking now to do what I have asked him?  What is proposed here is a backward step and we will be quite happy to accept suitable amendments made in the Seanad.  Surely the Minister is not shackled.  In Opposition he was very progressive.  We are issuing a challenge now: let the Minister live up to what he said in the past.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following: &ldquo;(d) two thousand, one hundred hours in any year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment will ensure that employment over the year will work out at an average of 43 hours per week.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not welcome this amendment because it is quite obvious it is a compromise. Here we have a maximum number of hours per week.  Then we have a maximum number of hours in four consecutive weeks and a maximum number of hours period.  Deputy Dowling is right in referring to the Minister being shackled.  He is shackled because he is following too closely procedures laid down.  This is a ridiculous approach on the part of someone with the Minister's experience. I can assure the Minister that nobody will know whether or not the maximum is adhered to.  I think the Minister is progressive and I am amazed at his refusal to accept the previous amendment.  I appeal to him to scrap these two amendments.  I believe 45 hours would be an adequate maximum number of hours. These stipulations about four weeks and 12 months are absolutely crazy. They should not be incorporated in modern legislation.  Will the Minister reconsider this before the Bill goes to the Seanad?  I would prefer the Minister to have a discretionary power to impose a maximum number of weeks as against the manner in which it is sought to be done here.  We must oppose these amendments.  They represent antiquated legislation, too complicated for employers and employees. Visualise the situation in the month of November with an employer trying to figure out how many more hours a boy may work before the end of the year.  This is not the kind of legislation we would expect from a progressive Minister.  If the Minister does as we ask him he will be doing a good job and making a real breakthrough in protecting young persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 is quite the worst yet.  An employer would need a computer or be an Einstein to work out his position.  At school we used to say there were 52 weeks in the year and seven days in the week but, when one multiplied 52 by 7, one found the answer was 364; a day was lost.  There is a day missing and we all know where it is missing.  The Minister will make this worse if he takes it over a year.  His <Col N="424" /> amendment No. 8 says &ldquo;shall not exceed one hundred and ninety hours in any period of four, consecutive weeks&rdquo;.  If you do a small calculation there you will see the figure you get as against the two thousand one hundred hours per annum.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald pointed out the great confusion which will exist in deciding how many hours a boy or girl has worked.  I can see some employer saying he is using the Julian calendar and not the Roman calendar if the Minister insists on this.  Amendment No. 8 should be dropped.  The honest employer will be driven mad trying to calculate how many hours a boy has worked.  A man may want to show a great degree of honesty towards the boy or girl but he cannot be expected to ask how many of the 2,100 hours the young person has worked.  If this is put on a weekly basis, as Deputy Dowling suggests a week's hours could be looked after.  It will not work out in defence of the young person when you try to do it on a yearly or four-weekly basis.</P>
      <P>An employer could be excused for saying that he has not the time to tot up the hours worked over a month or a year.  The Minister should really drop Nos. 7 and 8 because they will lead to great confusion.  Nobody will be able to keep a record of the number of hours worked.  There was great confusion during the last war when people had to keep records of coupons they issued.  Many honest traders were in difficulty because it was so hard to keep track of those things.  When an employer is employing labour of the type we are concerned about in the Bill he has not the time to do the tots of how long the young person has worked.  The young boy punches a card and the wages clerk takes the card each day and he sees how many hours have been worked.  He could say to the young person that he worked seven hours yesterday and eight today but he still has his yearly total to work out. The wages clerk and the boy will be driven around the bend by this type of thing.  The Bill would be far better if both those amendments were dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone will the young person need to be a worker in <Col N="425" /> the future he will need to be a mathematician as well.  Those two amendments could be described as the Minister's computer checking kids.  One would need a computer to keep up with them.  In one amendment the average is 43 hours over the year and in the other it is 47½ hours over the month.  Surely the Minister could give an indication that the maximum working week would be 43 hours if he thinks that is a satisfactory maximum over a yearly period. Why does he insist on 50?  It does not seem logical to me.  If we break down the monthly figure, we find he can work 47½ hours.  If the Minister said instead of 50 hours he would make it 47½ hours we could see some logic in it because it is somewhere in between the 50 hours and the 43 we suggested. A maximum of 43 hours a week would be very acceptable to us.</P>
      <P>As Deputies Fitzgerald and Moore have already indicated, those amendments will drive employers and employees around the bend.  If the employee has not a parent or guardian to keep check of the hours he works he is in a bad way.  The Minister said there would be satisfactory records but there will need to be comprehensive records, far greater than those anticipated by the Minister in a previous section.  He should be realistic about this.  We will accept the two thousand one hundred hours in any year, a maximum of 43 hours a week. It is illogical if 50 hours is specified, that the young person can work 50 hours in any one week or if it is on a monthly basis that he can work 47½ hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find in the other section that 40 hours is specified.  Therefore, the young person can work 40 hours, 43 hours, 47½ hours or 50 hours in a week.  There is something wrong there.  There must be a mean average somewhere that the Minister can strike.  We have struck an average between the 40 and 50 hours.  This variety of hours will certainly be confusing to the young person, to the employer, to us and I am sure also to the Minister.  He must take into consideration the difficulty there will be in keeping those records.  The young person will have to take out <Col N="426" /> a notebook to see how many hours he has worked, whether he has worked two thousand one hundred hours or whether he has worked two thousand and ninety nine hours.  Is this amendment brought in as a smokescreen in order to confuse the situation, indicating that we are leaning on the right side in order to give the young person the opportunity of earning £x overtime? It seems confusing to me as it does to the other Deputies who have spoken.  If the Minister has another look at this and strikes an average of 45 hours we will be satisfied.</P>
    <P>The Minister is progressive in one section and he is not in the important sections.  When he is asked about this at Question Time or outside the House he will probably say that he had to define in the Bill the total number of hours a young person could work in any year, that he decided on two thousand one hundred and this is an average of 43 hours.  He has specified 50 hours here.  He should leave it at two thousand one hundred hours in a year because that works out at an average of 43 hours, which is acceptable. As the section stands, it is confusing to everybody.  I wonder how confusing it will be to the employer and the young person.  If this is the Minister's computer check in the future not alone will you need to be a mathematician but you will need a computer to keep abreast of the number of hours the young person works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The average maximum over the year is, of course, 43 hours.  The general principle behind the differentiation over the average for the year and the average for a four-week period is to ensure that over the longer period the lesser number of hours are worked.  Over a shorter period the maximum permitted would be higher than over the longer period because what we want to do here is to prevent exploitation. There are heavy legal penalties for the person who is in breach of regulations regarding the maximum hours to be worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employers will have to keep records for these periods of work. Deputies know that employers have <Col N="427" /> to keep a careful check on hours worked since wage rates relate to them.  Throughout industry there are quite sophisticated methods to ensure that a careful check is kept on the hours worked by employees and Deputies would be surprised to know how resourceful the employers are in connection with this matter.  I have not any worries that employers would be in any difficulty in calculating the hours worked.  Certainly the legislation assumes that, because employers are forced&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the Minister adopting such a difficult procedure when a simpler one is available? I take the point he has made that it is not impossible to keep records, but surely the simplest approach should be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Deputy, I hold that the methods chosen here are reasonably simple in the ordinary calculations used by employers in calculating the hours worked by employees.  We must not confuse maximum hours with the normal hours worked.  Over the longer period we have an average that, I think, most Deputies will agree is a fair one with regard to maximum hours.  Later sections involving inspectors have the power to ask of the employers the hours worked by employees and under this legislation employers are forced to keep records of the kind referred to here.</P>
      <P>I commend this section to Deputies opposite.  They need feel no shame in supporting it because it marks a decided and vast improvement with regard to maximum hours and it will be of solid benefit to those people who are covered.  As I mentioned already, later sections provide that records must be kept.  Deputies have queried the difference between the four-week period and the 12-month period; since we are dealing with maximum hours over the longer period, the maximum period permitted is much shorter than over a period of a month.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 51, to delete &ldquo;nine&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;eight&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 8 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this Act, an employer shall not permit an employee who is a young person under the age of 16 years of <Col N="429" /> age in his employment to work for him for more than&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  nine hours in any day, or</P>
    <P>(b)  forty hours in any week.</P>
    <P>The nine-hour day for a young person under 16 years went out with the Indians. We will not send the Minister away with any more because it appears he is being contaminated by working conditions abroad.  We consider that nine hours is too much for a young person and we propose that it be reduced to eight hours.  However, if the Minister wants to substitute seven hours we will fall into line with that.  We have suggested a reduction of one hour which would amount to one hour per week.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot be serious when he tells us that it is fair and reasonable that a young person should work a nine-hour day and a 40-hour week.  On Committee Stage we spent a considerable amount of time dealing with a 40-hour week and we pointed out how injurious would be the long working hours for young people.  Our amendment is reasonable and we ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <P>We had hoped that with the Minister we could have hammered out a Bill of which all of us would be proud but unfortunately that did not happen. Perhaps if the Minister had his way he would alter the situation but if this is his genuine view he must accept responsibility.  He is taking a backward step and he is becoming contaminated by the right wing element that is pushing him further and further to the right.</P>
    <P>We have got away from the long, dreary working hours, from the sweated labour shops and the slave labour situation where young boys were expected to work around the clock. We have reached a reasonable stage with the adult workers who have the power to regulate their hours to a reasonable degree.  However, young people have no organisation to help them, they have not got their parents or guardians to represent them but are represented by someone the Minister considers suitable.</P>
    <P>The Minister says nine hours is a <Col N="430" /> reasonable period each day for a young person to work.  How can he be serious?  If he insists on it, it is a matter the House will have to decide. Young people of 16 years will grasp at inferior types of employment and this is the area where the greatest exploitation occurs.  Children of that age are the most vulnerable section of our work force.  According to the Bill, an employer can keep a young person of this age at work for nine hours a day or 40 hours in any week.  The Minister has quoted Acts of 1936 and 1945, legislation which is now outdated. We must ensure that this new legislation does not bring us back into the dark ages where young children were exploited at sweated labour.  I ask the Minister how many adult workers spend nine hours in any day at work.  The Minister has said this is the maximum period and my reply is that the maximum very often that the norm.  The Minister cannot constantly revise legislation of this kind.  We have been told of the massive amount of legislation that is to come before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister spoke many times of the Bill as being reforming.  We welcomed the Bill but the more one looks at it the more one finds that the Minister is leaving an awful lot of <Col N="431" /> room for further reform in this sphere.  I do not know when the five-day week came into being, but at that time the normal working day for an adult was nine hours.  Now the Minister is saying that a young person of 16 years should work nine hours.</P>
      <P>The Minister is legislating for the country at large and to my knowledge there are young people of, perhaps, 15 years in employment.  Such a person may have to get up very early, cycle for ten or 15 minutes to meet the bus and then travel to his work for a further three-quarters of an hour.  He repeats this in the evening and that, to my mind, means an 11-hour day if he works for nine hours. We are anxious to see progressive legislation, and, therefore, there is an obligation on the Minister either to accept the amendment or to agree that he will by order fix the maximum number of hours a young person may work.  As an Opposition, we would accept that from the Minister knowing he would be sensible enough not to exploit the flexibility we would allow him.  But if the Minister does not accept the deletion of nine and the substitution of eight for people of that tender age we would have no alternative but to oppose it as far as we can.  We sincerely believe it should not be nine hours per day in this year of 1975.  It is too long for young people in their early and tender years. The Minister knows that just as well as I do.  The Minister should either accept Deputy Dowling's amendment or, alternatively, agree to having discretionary powers where that aspect is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy G. Fitzgerald when he says that this should be opposed to the full.  At the same time.  I hope the Minister will meet us in this amendment.  Most of us here regard the five-day week as something worth fighting for, which is now sacrosanct.  But if the Minister insists on this section remaining unchanged, if a young person worked a five-day week, that would amount to 45 hours, which would be more than the maximum allowable by the Minister.  On the other hand, if he <Col N="432" /> works four days he will be short. Deputy Dowling's amendment permits a boy to work five eight-hour days keeping sacrosanct the five-day week.</P>
      <P>The Minister will remember that last year we had in this city a nine weeks' bus strike the basic cause of which was an endeavour to work out a five-day week.  Unfortunately, at the time the employers and unions could not reach a solution, leaving the city without buses for a period of nine weeks and, I think, a second period of approximately three weeks.</P>
      <P>The whole point here is one of simple mathematics.  Deputy Dowling proposed that we substitute eight for nine, meaning that a young person could work eight hours per day for five days, which would be a 40-hour week permitted by the Minister in subsection 8 (1) (b).  Therefore, that section and Deputy Dowling's amendment are in agreement.  I imagine the Minister will agree to this, thereby saving a lot of trouble.  We shall have to adhere to the five-day week fought for over so many years by the trade unions.  Of course, we know the five-day week will become shorter and shorter as modern techniques of manufacture and the distribution of goods are perfected.  A young person is entitled to two days off per week just as are the rest of us.  At present the Minister allows a young person to work 40 hours per week but there will be further trouble with the five-day week.  It would be a simple matter for any young person to work five eight-hour days so that he would have two full days of rest in which to play football or do anything else he might want.  If the Minister persists in resisting the amendment, he will be causing quite an amount of trouble and friction between young persons and their employers.  Also, it is against the whole principle of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1935 which was a type of charter.  I think the Minister would be showing himself to be progressive in accepting Deputy Dowling's amendment and I would appeal to him to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>All that is at issue here really is the question of semantics.  We do say a 40-hour week <Col N="433" /> only can be worked by those under the age of 16.  That is an average of eight hours per day.  It is specified in the Bill before us that it is 40 hours maximum in any one week; eight hours per day is the average of 40 hours on a five-day week.  All that we have in this legislation is the permission of some flexibility, the maximum in any one day being nine hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the provision is over the weekly period.  The employer cannot, without breaching the provisions of the legislation and incurring very heavy penalties, exceed 40 hours maximum in any one week. Therefore, Deputies opposite need not be alarmed that there is anything more envisaged here than a five-day week and an eight-hour day.  It is the maximum about which we are talking not the normal.  We are talking about very heavy penalties if there is an infringement of that maximum over a week where it can be a maximum of 40 hours only.  But in any one day we do permit the flexibility of nine hours.  That would mean that where an employee did work nine hours on a five-day week basis it would have to be for the remaining four days of that week three eight hour-days and one seven-hour day.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I do not think Deputies should become over anxious about any departure from this Bill in this section. It is a fair suggestion that young people of that age work a maximum week of 40 hours, remembering again, all the rest periods and other provisions of the later sections.  Therefore, I would recommend that to Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with persons under 16 years of age and with persons over that age.  We have, then, the other category, the adult worker.  As we know, the adult worker has long passed the 40-hour week. There must be some difference between the number of hours worked by an adult and those worked by a person over 16 or under.  In many cases the norm for the adult worker is in the region 37, 38 or, in some cases, 35 hours per week.  The aim is to reduce further the normal working week of the adult, where the maximum would be 40.  We know of many cases where the norm is much less than 40.</P>
      <P>Here the Minister indicates that a person not alone over 18 years of age but, under 16 years, is condemned to a nine-hour day.  It has been indicated how exploitation can take place of a vulnerable section of our society, a section with no trade unions, no parents or guardians to look after their welfare.  They are alone and we are the only people who can indicate clearly what are to be their conditions of employment in the future.  We are not going to condemn them to a nine-hour day or a 40-hour week.  We feel that people of tender age, covered by this section, should not be exploited in that fashion.  Other European countries are moving away from a 40-hour week for adults.  Indeed, we have reached that stage and gone further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is very dogmatic in his insistence that we have this sweated-labour situation embodied in our legislation, that we condemn young people under 16 years of age to a nine-hour day.  As I have already pointed out, young people represent the most vulnerable section of our society, people who will grasp at any job on leaving school, or even prior <Col N="435" /> to that, and who represent the most likely section to be exploited.  We are going to leave a loophole so that they can be exploited by unscrupulous employers. Having come thus far in the Bill, we realise the Minister is not the kind of man we thought he was. He wants to make it tough for young people, to ensure that they work long, dreary hours.  He would deprive them of the opportunity of furthering their education after working hours.  The child under 16 years of age who would work a nine-hour day would be in no <Col N="436" /> condition to embark upon an educational course after going home.</P>
    <P>The Minister has quoted legislation of the past.  We are not concerned with that.  We are concerned about legislation for the future.  Why can the Minister not be progressive and protect young people in the manner we all desire and that, I am quite sure, the Minister desires?  What is he afraid of?  We expected more of him.  We will not stand for such a provision as this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 9, to delete &ldquo;eight&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;seven and one-half&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Two groups are involved in these amendments, young persons under 16 and young persons of 16 and over. The Minister is well aware that the eight-hour day has been the norm for the adult worker for a considerable period.  He is also aware that the 40-hour week has been the norm for the adult worker for a considerable period.  In this Bill the Minister proposes an eight-hour day and a 40-hour week for a child of 16.  This is a backward step.  This is something that cannot be tolerated.  In formulating legislation like this we should project that legislation into the future. Apparently the Minister is dedicated to the past.  We should ensure that our law is progressive.  Young people will object to these provisions, and rightly so.  As I pointed out on an earlier amendment, we have to consider the young person of 16 or under who wishes to pursue his or her education at night.  Surely the Minister is not serious in this.</P>
      <P>This is slave labour.  This is exploitation of youth.  This is seated labour. Our legislation should be equal to or in advance of that in other European countries.  This legislation is not progressive. The Minister will have to have second thoughts on this.  No explanation could convince me and my colleagues that there is any good reason for this exploitation.  Let us hope some Members on the Government benches will see fit to point out that there is room for improvement here.  How many of them will troop into the Division Lobby in support of slave labour and the exploitation of young people?</P>
      <P>The rights of parents and guardians are disregarded.  The child is placed on a par with the adult worker.  This slave labour attitude is to be deplored. We expected great things from a Labour Party Minister.  We expected he would be progressive.  He led us to believe he would be progressive when he was in opposition.  He is not progressive in this legislation.  We could not possibly agree to the exploitation of child labour.  We hope the Minister will change his mind on this when the Bill goes before the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this the collective wisdom of open government by Fine Gael and Labour? The Minister has the opportunity now to do something progressive.  It may be his last opportunity.  Will he grasp the opportunity and make this Bill a Bill of which we can be proud?  The thinking behind this is not progressive thinking.  It is stagnation.  We could not possibly tolerate this.  Surely there is some progressive thought somewhere in the Government.  It seems to me that the members of the Labour Party <Col N="439" /> are now completely submerged in the dictates of the reactionary Fine Gael Party.  We know what their attitude was in the past in regard to workers and the protection of workers.  The Minister has this opportunity now to show the people he is his own man and, if he does not take it, the finger will inevitably be pointed at him.  This Bill needs to be drastically overhauled.  We must ensure that our legislation keeps pace at least with that of other progressive countries.</P>
    <P>We have our own thinking to do quite apart from Continental or other legislation. We have to think of our own young people and their special problems. The Minister apparently accepts the dictates of the Fine Gael Party because as I understood it the Labour Party thinking was on the side of the weaker section of the community, especially young employees.  Now we find a completely different situation when they are in office.  Why should the young people be hounded into this situation by the Department of Labour and the Government?  Young people will be condemned to those conditions for quite a considerable period to come. We know when legislation passes through this House quite a considerable period elapses before there are any changes made to it or before new legislation is brought in to keep abreast of the times.  It is likely we will have to wait for a long time before our legislation is brought in line with European legislation.  We should not have to wait until other countries move. We should instead move on our own and show the world that we are progressive in our thoughts and that we are not creating slave labour conditions or have slave labour attitudes in relation to young people.</P>
    <P>When this Bill goes through, people who do not read the Dáil debates will think that the Opposition are as bad as the Government.  They will say that the Bill is the collective wisdom of Dáil Éireann and that it is a poor reflection on the House.  The bell will ring in a few moments and we will see how many Deputies will go into the division lobby in support of this slave attitude.  I did not think the Minister for Labour would bring in a Bill such <Col N="440" /> as this.  I expected much more of him because I know that in many ways he is progressive in thought.  He is selling out on the young workers of this country, those from 14 to 16 years of age.  We are going far beyond the number of hours an adult works in a day in relation to the number of hours young people can work.  An adult working day is eight hours.  In some cases it is less.  In this Bill we are condemning children of 13, 14 and 15 years of age to work longer hours.</P>
    <P>This Bill is called the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill but it is the greatest farce that ever went through the House.  How will the Minister answer the people who really wish to protect young people?  He has completely disregarded the rights of parents and guardians.  He has taken unto himself the right to decide who is to be the representative of those young people.  They have no trade union to back them up.  Young people who leave school at 14 years of age and often work in inferior employment are the most likely to be exploited. Have the Government any conscience in relation to those young people?  Is this the attitude of the advisers in the Department of Labour? Is this the Minister's attitude or the collective attitude of the reactionaries in the Fine Gael Party?  If it is I am sorry for him because he is weak if he yields to that pressure.  Some of those people are 20 years behind the time.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to go any further in relation to this matter because I have spoken at length on it on Committee Stage.  The Minister seems to think that children under 16 years of age can work longer hours than adults.  He should decide to do what he thinks is right and accept the two amendments I put forward.  There are other amendments we have to discuss but these are the most important because this is the area where children can be exploited.  They have nobody to guide or guard them.  They depend on the legislation passed through this House.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was on this side of the House he very often expressed concern for those young people in <Col N="441" /> employment.  Now that he is Minister for Labour and can do something about the matter he should be as concerned about them as he was then. There is no use quoting to us Acts of 1926, 1936, 1946, 1956 or 1966.  We are concerned with the 1980s and the 1990s and with the young people of the future.  The Minister should have some progressive thought in relation to them and should be prepared to accept our amendments.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister agrees wholeheartedly with many of the provisions he is putting forward but he has to accept responsibility for legislation he brings before this House.  We will oppose the slave-labour mentality of the Minister and the Government but we are giving the Minister an opportunity to meet our reasonable amendments.  Notwithstanding the fact that the amendments are in my name, I do not think they go far enough.  However, they will give the Minister an opportunity to move from his present rigid position with regard to this legislation.  This Bill is not designed to protect young people, it is designed to exploit them. Even at this late stage I hope we will hear some progressive statements from the Minister so that ultimately we can look back on this legislation with pride.  If this Bill is enacted it will be one of the most repressive pieces of legislation.  It is aimed at the most vulnerable section of the work force, the young people who have no one to protect them.  The rights of their parents and guardians are disregarded; we are the only people who can help them but we are not doing that now.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for the young people who will be affected by this legislation. Fianna Fáil have done as much as they can but the Minister has not been progressive.  Even at this stage he should consult with trade unions or some competent organisation; perhaps he might consider setting up a committee of parents, guardians, trade unionists and others who could decide on what they would consider a reasonable number of hours to be worked.  There must be some people who would help, apart from the reactionary <Col N="442" /> groups now advising the Minister.  It should be possible to get a group of people from different walks of life: married women with children in the work force, workers, trade unionists and the more progressive people in the Minister's Department so that justice may be done to those whom we purport to protect.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a good friend of mine and I am sad he has found himself in this situation.  We are doing our best to help him; it is up to him now but if he is determined not to be progressive in this matter we will have to test the House in the division lobbies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling has dealt with this matter very well and he has told us quite clearly that a measure that might be regarded as a desirable innovation for the protection of young persons is instead conservative and outdated.  There are flaws in all the sections but in this section it is obvious that the daily normal working hours are completely absurd for a young person.</P>
      <P>I shall be more kind to the Minister than Deputy Dowling because I am convinced the Bill is not worded as he would have wished and I am sure he realises he was ill-advised.  He should take back the section to the Department and should make the necessary alterations.  He should use his ministerial discretion.  I am convinced that by doing this he would ensure that a young boy or girl would not be obliged to work an eight-hour day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that whether the young people are from the town or the country areas it is more likely they will spend at least one hour travelling to and from work each day.  At the moment we have a catastrophic unemployment situation; jobs are difficult to find for young and old, and young people find it difficult to get apprenticeships.  It is a matter for serious concern for all of us but at times one wonders if the people in Government are worried about what is happening.  In Dublin city young people have to travel across the city to reach their places of employment and when one calculates the amount <Col N="443" /> of travelling time they spend it is clear that the eight-hour normal day becomes a ten-hour day.  This is quite unacceptable to us.</P>
    <P>The legislation introduced by the Minister has been disappointing.  It is my first time to be deeply involved with a Bill going through the House and I have been very disappointed by the stonewalling tactics.  The Minister has decided that our amendments will not be considered although their necessity is quite apparent.  It is obvious he will bulldoze the legislation through, that he will bring in the legions to carry it through by weight of numbers.  However, that cannot ease his conscience or lessen his responsibility to the young people.  This legislation will be remembered as an outdated measure even before it has passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage of the Bill the Minister said I would have to face him on many Bills in the not-too-distant future.  I hope the legislation he will introduce in the future will be progressive and forward-looking. I would ask him to accept the amendments we have put forward.  He is suggesting in this Bill that the normal working day for a young person should be eight hours.  This is unacceptable and we will oppose it to the best of our ability.  Deputy Dowling asked the Minister to take the Bill back and have another look at it before it goes to the Seanad. We will give him discretionary powers and I appeal to him to do this in the interests of young people.</P>

      <P>In the past four hours I have been wondering where all the Government Deputies have been. There has been nobody here but the Minister and five Fianna Fáil Deputies. This legislation is supposed to be reforming the position in regard to young people and one would think Government Deputies, particularly those in the Labour Party, would show some interest in a Bill the title of which states that it is for the protection of young people.  Their absence may be due to cynicism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> The Minister said &ldquo;no&rdquo;, &ldquo;no&rdquo;, &ldquo;no&rdquo;, to all amendments put forward by this side although on Committee Stage he gave an implied undertaking that he would accept amendments.  This legislation as it stands could become a sort of Frankenstein which could do more harm than good.  The Minister has said these hours are the maximum but we all know that the maximum becomes the norm, the minimum indeed, in many cases.  Why can the Minister not listen to the Opposition on this occasion?  Democracy does not mean a one-party Parliament.  We are here to do our duty, we have put forward worthwhile amendments but they have been rejected so far.</P>
    <P>I have doubts as to whether this Bill, if tested in the Supreme Court, would not be declared repugnant to the Constitution.  Various anomalies arise in sections 9 and 10.  There is one provision in section 9 which includes vocational schools, from the point of view of being released during working hours but it does not include primary schoolchildren.  A boy or girl of 15 years and one month might wish to stay on in primary school, yet there is this anomaly in the Bill.  It is symptomatic of the loose drafting which shows itself elsewhere in the Bill.  I do not regard the Minister as another Simon le Gris, I do not think there is slave driving in his nature, but neither do I think he is taking this legislation seriously.  For a start, the title is a misnomer and when Fianna Fáil return to power the first thing we must do is to review this legislation.  In the meantime our young people will suffer&mdash;I hope not for long.</P>
    <P>If one were to visit the grave of Charles Dickins tomorrow one would see that he had turned in his grave tonight because we in a progressive Parliament have endorsed this Bill which has no purpose beyond confusing employers and workers, a Bill which lays down that a boy or girl should not work more than 2,100 hours a year. Can anyone imagine asking a trade unionist who is on a weekly contract to work 2,100 hours a year?  Some of the Bill is archaic and some of it is completely unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I sincerely pay tribute to the interest they have in legislation of this kind.  For the Government, I say the Bill bespeaks their interest in reform in this area.  We do not require the presence of Government Deputies.  We have the legislation here which is an affirmation of the Government's seriousness in this area.  The Bill has received a general welcome from all the bodies I discussed it with. It is not a type of Bill for which we could expect unanimous support from all sides but it is fair to say there has been a general welcome for it from youth organisations, trade unions, employers and so on.</P>
      <P>Coming to amendment No. 10, I consider that for a young person of more than 16 years a working day of eight hours or a 40-hour week is reasonable.  This is allied in later sections to rest periods, and the provision that the type of work they do be subject to certain improvements.  I have discretion to alter these things as changing times and circumstances require. On amendment No. 11, I think it will be accepted that a 37½-hour week for young persons under 16 years is reasonable and could not give rise to some of the fears of Deputies about worsening the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are solid improvements in the normal working hours' category. It must be remembered that we have also, in other sections, maximum hours laid down.  For the person over the age of 16 years we have the average 43 hours' maximum over the year.  For the person under 16 years we have a maximum of 40 hours over the entire week.  I would again remind Deputies that, beyond those hours, there will be an offence committed with heavy penalties attaching.  It will be accepted that the normal hours will be 37½ per week for those under 16, subject to a maximum of 40 hours.  For the over 16s, it will be a 40-hour week subject to an average <Col N="446" /> of 43 over the year.  Those are reasonable figures in anybody's assessment of the situation.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputies that I am open to all suggestions, I hope, at all times.  I will not give way to the feeling that the person who has the honour of leading a Department of State should feel that he or his officials has a monopoly of wisdom.  I would say, in defence of officials of my Department, they are men and women of much commitment to real social justice as are any members of the Opposition.  Deputies opposite have been kind enough about my sentiments in this regard.</P>

I will go back to saying I praise the oratory of Deputies opposite but I think the content suffers when contrasted with the reality, as it obtains in this legislation.  I am at all times open to accepting constructive amendments and have shown evidence of that in the passage of this Bill.  Having listened carefully to what Deputies have been saying, I see no reason to alter my attitude in this area.  Therefore, I reject the suggested amendments.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may conclude on amendments No. 10 and 11. <Col N="447" /> The Minister has indicated that this Bill is a reflection of the solid improvement the Government wish to make in relation to social justice for young persons.

      <P>Members of the Government and their backbenchers will be asked to vote on these two amendments in a few moments.  The Government expect a person under the age of 16 to work a normal day of eight hours while adult workers in this State have been enjoying an eight-hour day for a considerable period. That demonstrates the backward thinking of the Government.  We feel that that slave-labour mentality of the Government cannot be tolerated and is one that will have to be backed up by the tramping feet of the people in Fine Gael and Labour in the division lobbies in a few moments.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 10 there is a difference between a young person of 16 years of age and the adult worker.  The Minister indicates that as a matter of Government policy, and a solid improvement, a person of 16 years or over should work an eight-hour day.  That is regarded as the norm. He indicates also that, as a progressive social measure of the Government, a person of 14 or 15 years of age should work an eight-hour day as the norm&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But we have here, in relation to what is called the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill the slave-labour mentality of the Government, when in fact it is a Bill that victimises young persons.  We have explained here in detail the problems of young persons who have no one to guide or assist them, who have no trade union to <Col N="448" /> back them.  Their conditions must be laid down in this House.  If this is the Government's idea of social justice for young people, then we have a record of what constitutes social justice in 1975.</P>

      <P>The Minister tried to distort the situation.  He indicated that the working week over a 52-week period would be 43 hours.  This is correct, but he has embodied a 50-hour week in the Bill.  We now have a situation where young people 14 years, 13 years or 12 years can be expected to work an 8-hour day.  As I said before, there is a difference between the child of 14, the young person of 16 or over, and the adult worker.  Adult workers have achieved the 8-hour day a considerable time ago.  I believe the Minister is being pushed by the right wing element in Fine Gael.  It is the collective wisdom of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties that was responsible for the sweated labour provisions being embodied in the Bill.  Is there one man in the Fine Gael Party or Labour Party who will say he does <Col N="449" /> not believe that a child of 13 or 12 years of age should be compelled by law to work an 8-hour day, the same norm as the adult worker?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) A young person shall be entitled to eight hours in a week, during normal working hours, to attend vocational training or other educational courses without prejudicially affecting the contract of service under which the young person is employed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 10 provides:</P>
      <P>Any time spent with the consent of his employer by a young person in vocational training during normal working hours shall be deemed to be hours worked by him for the purposes of section 7 and 8 of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not regard this provision as broad enough and our amendment proposes that a young person shall be entitled to eight hours in any normal working week for the purpose of attending vocational training or other courses of study.  The Minister promised us on Committee Stage that he would look at the situation again.  Is the Minister satisfied the young person is fully protected?  We were not satisfied with the Minister's explanation on the last occasion and, having considered the situation, will he now give us his views and we can then decide <Col N="453" /> whether or not to pursue the amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I referred to certain instruments adopted by the annual conference of the ILO, to which we are affiliated, namely, Conventions 140 and 148 and the recommendations dealing with educational relief and pay and leave granted for a specified period during working hours with adequate financial support.  This is a very complicated matter.  It is one requiring a great deal of preparation before these conventions and recommendations can be incorporated into legislation.  It could be held to be outside the scope of this particular measure.  There would have to be an assessment of our educational training systems in order to comply with these directives and some decision would have to be taken as to whether there could be integration with existing policies in relation to employment, education, training and hours of work as well as a decision about participation by public authorities and educational and training authorities in general.  All these must be examined in detail by Departments other than mine and it would be impossible at this stage to indicate what our approach would be to these international instruments especially in a Bill of this kind.  The matter will be before the ILO again this year and my Department together with other Departments will be examining what should be done in response to these <Col N="454" /> conventions.  We are in the same situation here as many neighbouring countries in considering what the approach should be in this area.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the educational problems of young children and I have introduced an amendment which permits me to give a licence in respect of schemes combined with limited experience of education or training.  I consider that schemes of combined work experience plus education or training hold out very interesting prospects.  There is a problem and it was brought to my attention in the consultations I had with youth organisations, especially in regard to children between the ages of 13 and 15 who have little interest in school.  They are very often illiterate and they very often come from deprived backgrounds. I believe that their education could be advanced by schemes which combine work and educational experience.  Under this legislation I can do that by licence.  That is my response to the problem.  On the general principle, however, what Deputy Dowling suggests would be a transition into a totally new approach too rapidly without the kind of adequate preparation that should take place.  I suggest we must have that adequate preparation before we can consider such a step and therefore I reject Deputy Dowling's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has again trotted out the question of some other organisation or body somewhere discussing the problem we are discussing and that our problem should wait until such time as somebody else has decided.  It is only then we can be progressive in our approach. The Minister has stated he is conscious there is a problem, having consulted youth organisations and other groups.  We are concerned that special conditions should apply to our people. It is quite another matter what the ILO do.  We should be progressive enough to have legislation to deal with our problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should our workers and our children have to wait until such time as somebody else makes the decision? <Col N="455" /> The Minister indicated that decisions must be made by public authorities and that it is a complex issue but we heard all that before.  We understood that the legislation in relation to children in employment, which would come out of this House, would be something wonderful but now we find it is very reactionary.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quoting legislation of the past.  In relation to ILO conventions and decisions in 1936 when the Conditions of Employment Act was passed in this country it was far ahead of the standards demanded by the ILO.  This legislation was brought in by the late Seán Lemass.  Why can we not do the same in 1975?  Why is it that the most vulnerable section of our society, the young people must wait until decisions are made in Europe and elsewhere and that it is only after a comprehensive examination of the situation that facilities can be granted to them?  All through this Bill we are waiting for other people and their ideas.  Surely we have ideas of our own?  Surely our amendment is a practical one to deal with the problems in relation to vocational courses in existence in the country? Young workers have been victimised throughout this Bill.  Surely we should be prepared to meet them in a realistic manner in relation to this amendment?</P>
    <P>We know there are pressures on the Minister in relation to the problems of young people who wish to pursue educational courses while they are employed.  We are not concerned with legislation that will come in in 15 years' time.  This legislation will project itself into the 1980s just as the legislation of 1936, which has not yet been amended in some cases, is projecting itself into the 1980s.  Let us not dig into the past and quote the Acts of 1928, 1938 or 1948 because we want to back up our viewpoint when it is regressive.  We should be progressive on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister and youth organisations feel there is a problem.  We want that problem solved now.  We want people under 16 years of age protected. If we wait for Europeans and <Col N="456" /> other people to decide what we should do it is a sorry state of affairs.  We should have enough initiative to ensure that our people are protected. We should move forward ahead of the ILO.  Why should we be impeded by something that will happen in the dim and distant future?</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted that there is a problem.  There should be no delay in looking after those young people because every delay means they are being victimised.  The Minister has told us that this is a solid improvement by the Coalition Government, that this is their idea of social justice.  However, they are prepared to allow the young people to suffer an injustice.  They have not even got the assistance of a parent or guardian according to this Bill.  The only person who can protect them, according to the Bill, is somebody the Minister sees is fit to protect them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is failing to meet his responsibility in regard to vocational training during normal working hours. Vocational training is nothing out of the ordinary in this country.  Why can the Minister not accept this amendment or bring in a suitable amendment in the Seanad to meet the problems of our workers?</P>

We want <Col N="457" /> a section embodied in this Bill which will give adequate protection to those people.  The Minister has indicated he is not prepared to do this until some foreign group decide to present a situation to him which he will present to various public and local authorities and it is only at that stage those people will get protection.  We want to ensure there is some constructive thought in this Bill in relation to the people we wish to support.  Will the Minister give an assurance that he will look at this situation before the debate in the Seanad and if he feels we have presented a reasonable case that he will bring in an amendment?</P>

He should disregard the ILO and the other groups.  If he is not prepared to meet us on this we will have to see if the Government and the backbenchers are prepared to meet this challenge in the division lobbies.  I ask the Minister to be reasonable.

It takes a great deal of preparation because it is a new area but in section 10 we have an agreement with the employers.  As I have already indicated, in later sections we have licence to take in the area in which there is most trouble, namely, the 13- to 15-year old group, young people who have not shown an academic bent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 32, to substitute &ldquo;four&rdquo; for &ldquo;five&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 11 states an employer shall not permit an employee to do any work for any period exceeding five hours in any day and we want to reduce the time to four hours.  The people concerned are under 16 years and we should ensure that they are protected.  It has been pointed out that it may take a person more than an hour to get to his place of work and adding this time to the working hours we consider it is too long for any young person.  Deputy Moore raised this matter on Committee Stage but I think his amendment was withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people living on the perimeter of Dublin have to commute to their place of work and this adversely affects young people. Therefore, we would ask the Minister to reduce the period to four hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be obvious that this is a reasonable amendment.  We do not wish to divide the House on this issue but it is extremely important.  When one considers young people have to travel for <Col N="460" /> an hour to get to their place of employment and that they will have to work when they reach their work place it is obvious that five hours is too long a period for young people to wait for a break.  They should have a rest period of 30 minutes.  This amendment complies with normal practice on sites and in industry generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Dowling and Deputy Fitzgerald have said.  Some years ago I worked for a large firm in Dublin; I started at 8 a.m. and worked until 12.30 when I had a break of one hour and worked until 5.30 p.m. and the conditions have improved since I was working.  Is it not strange that an adult works shorter hours than a boy of 15 years?  Adults have a break for one hour after four and a half hours and another break after a further three and a half hours but young boys are obliged to work for five hours without a break.</P>
      <P>This matter was brought to my notice by a group of women who were doing tremendous work on behalf of youth.  The Minister promised he would seriously consider the amendment and I would ask him to accept it.  We cannot ask young people to work for longer hours than adult workers who are protected by trade unions and legislation.  All the argument this time suggests that the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In the instance given by Deputy Moore there would be no problem or conflict because presumably what was the practice in the industry would apply to the young people concerned and we are here referring to a statutory minimum. There should be no conflict between rest periods other than statutory periods.  For example, in regard to traditional tea-breaks, the argument could be made that if we alter the five-hour working period, which is traditional&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not five hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.  Whatever the local arrangements are would apply in cases of <Col N="461" /> young people.  Here we are simply stating statutory periods.  It is a minimum standard.  There could be variety in rest periods quite apart from these set down here.  We must also consider that for the young people we are concerned with, throughout the year the maximum working week for those of more than 16 years is 43 hours and for those under 16 years it is 40 hours.  We have laid down definite rest periods and we have the other things we have already gone into.</P>
      <P>My problem here has been whether allowing by statute what appears to be a traditional settlement would create anomalies with adult co-workers. However, the section does not debar the negotiation of a shorter work period.  All we are doing is setting down the minimum standard and ensuring that there is as little disruption as possible of the pattern of rest periods, tea-breaks and so on, which would apply to adult workers generally.  Our aim is to protect both categories of young workers and we are excluding children younger than 14.  I undertook during Committee Stage, in response to Deputy Moore's advocacy, that I would examine the matter carefully.  I have done so and though I do not mind meeting any Deputy's reasonable amendment, in this case I have no feeling of rejecting something reasonable.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy Fitzgerald a few moments ago, the pattern is 8.30 a.m. to 1 p.m., 4½ hours.  This would be disrupted if I imposed 3½ hours by statute.  There would be an obvious conflict there. We have looked at this matter in a reasonable way.  Our statutory provision here will not involve any conflict with local arrangements.  Regretfully, I say to Deputy Moore, although I examined it carefully with my advisers, I do not see any point in accepting the amendment.</P>

The Minister talks about traditional breaks.  We are not concerned with tradition.  We want a Bill which will protect young people in the future. The Minister has adopted a slave-labour attitude which is to be deplored. A child of 16 is expected to keep abreast of the working day of an adult.  Why should a young person not take a break at a time different from an adult?  Let the employer make the arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister shall appoint an advisory council to monitor the enforcement of this Act and to advise him at regular intervals on the results of such monitoring.</P>
      <P>(2)  The advisory council shall consist of representatives of employers, representatives of employees and representatives of other persons or organisations interested in the employment of young persons.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is self-explanatory and it covers a very special problem. There is a variety of groups outside <Col N="463" /> this House having an interest in young persons, youth councils and organisations of one type or another, who may be able to advise the Minister on certain trends.  We feel it essential that the Minister would have some advisory group or council representative of the various sections having an interest in young persons available to him.  Judging by the Bill, as it stands, the people who advised the Minister on its compilation are very much out of touch with the realities of the situation because they have victimised young people throughout the Bill.</P>
    <P>As bad as the Bill is, it will become law by force of numbers in this House.  We want to ensure that some independent group will be able to advise the Minister and the Government if and when they stray from the right path.  We realise there will be great difficulties experienced in the enforcement of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Earlier on we had a discussion in relation to the number of hours a young person could work.  As I said, one would need a computer to keep a check on the children, on the hours they work.  One would need a ministerial computer to keep abreast of the situation.</P>
    <P>Here we have a reasonable amendment. Bad as the Bill is with its slavish mentality percolating throughout, we would ask the Minister to have some group advise him other than those who advised him on this Bill, whether it was members of the Government or of his Department, of his own party, they were not very forward-looking and certainly they did an injustice to young people.  We would hope that at some stage there would be somebody who would protect them in some way because this Bill does not afford them any element of protection whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment and ensure that whatever element of the Bill might be beneficial, at least it can be monitored and the Minister can be advised also as to when and where injustices are committed.  The Minister and the House have done young people an injustice by force of numbers in the <Col N="464" /> division lobbies through many aspects of the Bill.  The people who think in terms of a Bill such as this are not the appropriate people to deal with or protect young workers because this Bill does not afford protection in any form.</P>
    <P>We discussed it on Committee Stage and now on Report Stage and we cannot find anywhere in the Bill any reasonable element.  When we have tried to bring in reasonable amendments affording some protection the Minister ruled them out on the basis that we were too forward-thinking on this side of the House; We would have to wait until some situation developed in Europe or some foreigners had discussed it, before we could take a look at the situation.</P>
    <P>The last element of protection is the one we now seek.  In many respects the Bill puts the young person on a par with the adult worker and, in that respect, we need the advice of an advisory council.  Therefore, we ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 14, to ensure there will be somebody to protect young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the best amendments put down on Report Stage.  I feel sure the Minister, in his wisdom, will say: &ldquo;I accept that for a number of very good reasons.&rdquo; First of all, this is comparatively new legislation covering a new field.  It is legislation with certain good parts and with what I would regard as very bad parts indeed, with many areas where it must have been difficult for the Minister to reach agreement on the points specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said consistently on the amendments this evening, we would have been happier had the Minister been given more discretion in this Bill rather than specifying ages, hours of work and so on.  I am sure the Minister will agree that all of us will learn &mdash;and particularly the Minister's Department and inspectorate&mdash;the various difficulties and problems that will arise from the enforcement of this Bill.  I hasten to say there will be quite a number.  We want to see the protection of young persons in employment, <Col N="465" /> to stop their exploitation at all costs.  We feel also there are many social reasons why young people should work at particular times, for example, there are social needs in particular areas in summer time.  In effect this Bill may inhibit or prohibit some very useful employment satisfactory to both sides.  For that reason I think it advisable for the Minister to appoint an advisory council, consisting of representatives of employers, employees and the youth organisations to monitor the enforcement of this Bill and so discover problem areas.  They could report back to the Minister's Department for discussion with his officials. In that way, he would have involved the three vital sections concerned, the employers, the employees and the youth organisations.</P>
    <P>After all, the Government do proclaim that this is &ldquo;open Government&rdquo;. We are endeavouring to help the Minister still further in availing of open Government by involving such a council in the operation of new legislation which will guide the Minister and his Department, whose advice will be available to all of us, letting us know about any pitfalls to be found in its operation for the benefit of any future legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would include also on the proposed council some members of the task force set up by the Tánaiste to examine the problems of youth.  I am sure the Minister will agree that this Bill will need a watchdog during the period of its operation.  We do not have the time or facilities for so doing.  We should afford such facilities to some of our citizens concerned about youth today.  If the Minister would accept this amendment I would give him the names of some societies which prompted some of the amendments put down this evening.  In keeping with the policy of the Government and of the Tánaiste in setting up that task force, the Minister should have such people represented on that council.  It would repay both the Minister and the country if that were done.</P>

      <P>I have communicated <Col N="466" /> to the National Youth Council, to the other youth bodies I have met and to the Congress of Trade Unions my intention of setting up an employment committee and an advisory employment group.  I think the last place I mentioned that was in Wicklow on Saturday when I spoke to young people there at a careers seminar. But the concept I have is of a body having perhaps wider functions than those envisaged in Deputy Dowling's amendment.  The role he proposes in his amendment for the advisory council may contain elements which would restrict certain powers available to our inspectorate under the Bill.  The enforcement of this Bill will be the responsibility of this Department, acting under the directions set out in the legislation, in conjunction with the courts.  There is the suggestion of monitoring this enforcement arm of the legislation which could be taken to imply some oversight with regard to those activities and, which I am advised, is unacceptable in the context of ministerial responsibility, of Ministers and law courts and the relationship between them.</P>
      <P>There is also the question that the amendment is rather vague about the actual representation to be granted to the bodies referred to.  My concept of the body is somewhat wider than that envisaged by Deputy Dowling.  Indeed, the groups with whom I have already discussed this idea&mdash;the trade unions and the youth organisations&mdash;were in agreement that we may require a body with functions that are slightly wider than the terms of this Bill, and which would cover perhaps a wider area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyway, in principle I am in favour of the establishment of such a body, but I am not convinced that it should be set up by statute.  I think the constitution of such a body and its powers should be left for discussion with the interests involved.  While I am very receptive to the idea of a youth advisory council on employment, I think it should have the flexibility characteristic of a non-statutory grouping.  Of course, I shall be willing to supply such a body, when it is set up, with summary reports of the experiences of the Department in <Col N="467" /> the enforcement area following the enactment of this legislation.  Since I am concerned that such a body would be set up and that it should have a role slightly wider than that envisaged by the Deputy in the general area of youth and employment, I would ask him to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera </NameTxt>
      <P>I have not intervened on this Bill, but the Minister's remarks stimulate me.  Why not a statutory body?  One of the purposes of this amendment is to get over what you might call the bureaucratic or red tape approach to this.  It is all right for the Minister to talk about ministerial functions.  Ministers have been shedding their functions, with orders and regulations, all around the place. Here is an area where representatives of the people who are most affected should be taken into account and taken into account statutorily.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about inspectors and Departmental agencies.  Far be it from me to run down the ministerial function or the Minister's Department. I appreciate the difference between the administration of Acts from the internal or managerial point of view and the external or public point of view.  However, this amendment appears to me to be justified, as bringing into consultation the people most concerned.  The Minister and his party will be very loud on this question of consultation of the interests concerned.  The sincerity of the admission of that principle will be tested by whether that principle is given force or not.  The plea that it is better for the Minister just to set up what he wants to set up and leave it out of the statute is tantamount to saying: leave all the power with the Minister and his inspectors, then a little window dressing can be done. That does not ring sincere.  Here is a case where one can test out the sincerity of those who call for consultation of the interests involved, and here is an opportunity to give a real earnest of the sincerity of these protestations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a great deal of sympathy for the Minister when he used the words: &ldquo;I am advised&rdquo;.  Of course, the <Col N="468" /> Minister is advised and very often very well advised, but I wonder does he realise that his function is to weigh advice and to weigh it against the other factors beyond the technical advice of his Department.  He is not supposed to be a rubber stamp for the advice given to him, nor is it fair to his Department in relation to other Departments.  I am not to be taken as casting any aspersions on anybody in the Minister's Department.  We in this House have left too much of a burden upon the Department.  It is the Minister's job to consider advice but he must make his own decisions and take all factors into account.</P>
    <P>Again, without any reflection.  I would deal with the Minister's reference to inspectors and official inspection. I understand their difficulties. However, whether it is in the agricultural sector, the industrial sector or any other sector, anyone who has any experience will realise the limitations to the efficiency of a system of inspection and the need for something else to collaborate and moderate if it is not to give rise to delay and to friction.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister's approach, but I would like him to understand the approach on this side of the House, and even if he cannot do anything here in this House, I think that when it goes to another place the Minister should give very serious consideration to the points made by Deputy Dowling and Deputy Fitzgerald on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling </NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the amendments are not broad enough to meet the situation as he sees it.  We accept that.  The ground has been fairly well covered by Deputy de Valera and Deputy Fitzgerald and there is no need for me to speak further.  If the Minister is prepared to consider our viewpoints. then we shall be satisfied because another House will have an opportunity of discussing this matter.  If the Minister is prepared to meet the situation, we shall withdraw the amendment.</P>

My feeling at present is that it should not be set up statutorily but I shall consider that again.  As regards the idea of its being established, there is no doubt.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15.</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 16, after &ldquo;member&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or by the parent or guardian of the employee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Again, there is complete disregard for the parent or guardian in relation to the prosecution of offences.  The Bill provides that proceedings in respect of offences under this Act by an employee may be brought and prosecuted by the Minister or by the trade union of which the employee is a member.  The right to bring forward a case should not be solely that of the trade union or the Minister.  The parent or guardian has a right in this respect.  I would ask the Minister to accept this reasonable amendment so that the sole right of prosecution will not be with the Minister or the trade union of which the employee is a member.  In my view, the Minister should accept that this is a very reasonable amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary </NameTxt>
      <P>As things are, the parent may report the matter to the inspectors of my Department.  In a practical way they are prosecuting when they take on this task for their children.  The inspector has the right under section 16 to send for records and all necessary material from the employer.  If a young person does not wish to approach a trade union, his parents may complain to my Department. It is true that the guardian's name is not spelled out in the section, although I maintain that the parent has the effective field of action of bringing in the enforcing authority <Col N="470" /> if the child has been a victim of some of the conditions referred to in this legislation and clauses have been infringed.  I cannot concede where parents would wish in these circumstances to take such action when the inspectorate, on their request, can take the necessary action.  There is the further difficulty that the parent would not be empowered under our legislation to see the documents that the inspector could&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary </NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously if the inspector, having sent for the books, finds there is no case he could refuse to take action.  Of course, it is always open for me to make a decision that there is a case for prosecution even when the inspector thinks there is not. But that would be a very unlikely eventuality.  I do not know if the Deputy is convinced by this argument. It convinces me.</P>
      <P>As I have said throughout this debate, I do not hold strictly to the idea that legislation should be the total property of Government.  When amendments with merit come before me I accept them and give credit to the party which suggested them.  I put the case that there is ample scope for the parents here.  If the Opposition are still unconvinced by this argument I am prepared to accept their amendment, although I do not see the point of it.  Do you insist?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera </NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to say that last night I was diverted from the tenor of my way, to stray into what might have sounded like customary political polemics.  That was not my intention.  I pointed out that the origin of this social welfare legislation had come about when there were in this State progressives and conservatives. Our party and the Labour party at that time were the promoters of the first social proposals in this direction. In 1933 it was this party who passed the first Act mentioned in section 1 of this Bill.  The party with which the Labour Party is associated in Coalition today was the Conservative Party. I adverted to the facts of that situation to put this pertinent remark into perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this legislation was being developed at that time the Labour Party were in favour of it, as were the Fianna Fáil Party.  As I pointed out last night, one has only to read the first section of this Bill and the dates to see the record of Fianna Fáil in social services.  I want to associate that social record with a vital factor. That programme was possible and, more important, it was effective.  It was more than a formality, not because it was enacted here, not even because funds were provided, but essentially because it went a long way towards a progressive, developing, expanding economic policy, where the economy of the State was expanding, the economic activity was growing and the capacity to pay and support these services was expanding.  The difficulty I see in the present situation is that that corresponding environment and supporting activity are not here.  I fear that as a result of this Bill&mdash;I am not disparaging it, nor do I wish to do so&mdash;we are not concomitantly developing the resources to support this measure in order to make it as socially effective as similar measures were in the past.  In all fairness I concede that we are in a period of regression. I concede also that much of <Col N="472" /> today's difficulty stems from an overall environment, that there are factors which the present Government or, indeed any Government sitting over there are unable to control fully.  I do not want now to indulge in the political polemic of throwing all the blame on the Government regardless of reason but we must, nevertheless, face the facts.  There are certain difficulties of recession and I would be failing in my duty as an Opposition Deputy if I did not point out that I see nowhere in current programmes the expansionary economic activity which to my mind will be needed ultimately to make this legislation effective.</P>
    <P>Approaching this Bill with that principle in mind and, on that principle, I must refer, again briefly, to keep within the terms of order, to something that has come up on nearly all the Bills which have preceded this Bill.  This is really part of a series of financial legislation.  It has come not because of what has happened in its old context as a purely social service Bill to be taken independently and looked at in the light of the economy as a whole and treated as a unit but rather as part of a series of financial legislation.  I think this is somewhat unfortunate.  I do not want to broaden this but it is extremely difficult to disentangle this Bill from the series of operations, particularly through the Minister for Finance, in legislation still before the House and legislation that is pending.  This Bill can only be interpreted as part of a series of enactments implementing the budget; the Capital Gains Tax Bill, the Wealth Tax Bill, and the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill are all part of the budget. I hesitate to say this because it looks like a device to try to get out of order, but it is a very genuine difficulty in trying to assess this Bill.  There is nobody in his sane senses who will argue that these benefits should not be given.  I will go further and say that I am very glad in the circumstances the Minister has had to take into account to give these benefits, but I would like to be sure that this crutch will be backed up by the power to make the reliefs effective.  It is here, as I see it, <Col N="473" /> that we come into the difficulty of financing and treating this as part of the financial business.</P>
    <P>Two things must be said about this Bill; the increases in benefits are obviously necessary to keep the benefits in line with inflation.  That is absolutely necessary.  If the Minister has been able to do a bit better than that&mdash;I think he claims he has&mdash;more power to him.  Now what about the cost?  What does it mean?  How real are these benefits?  Where will they come from?  Where will they ultimately come from?  A few points are pertinent.  Because of the factors I have mentioned about financial legislation and in justification of my claim that this is only part of a series of financial enactments, can the Parliamentary Secretary deny that as far as getting the money is concerned&mdash; I shall come back to this again in relation to the accounting of it&mdash;if the Minister for Finance has given income tax reliefs to the vast majority of people who are working and earning wages and salaries, is he not taking those reliefs back in the form of social service contributions?  The Parliamentary Secretary will have every chance of answering me and I shall be delighted if I am wrong?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now questioning the financing of this and all I am saying is that this is the first time I have heard it questioned and I <Col N="474" /> am pointing out that I raised the question of financing on the Estimate last year and I raised it again when I introduced this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind the Parliamentary Secretary putting me right if I am wrong, but I have every right to make my speech and the Parliamentary Secretary will have every opportunity of replying.  What I am saying is that.  If I am wrong, then I am wrong; I hope I am wrong and I hope I will be the first to admit it.  I am only stating facts.  I am not apportioning blame.  I give the Parliamentary Secretary and his party full credit for what they have done in the past and credit for giving these benefits now.  I am not ignoring either the sympathy or the understanding that I believe I should have for the difficulties that the Government are in, even though I am opposed to that Government, when I deal with facts and try to help the Parliamentary Secretary by pointing out, as an Opposition Deputy should, a particular aspect. When one looks at the total financing of the State, this is, as I said, part of a series of financial legislation in this year, 1975.  That is an incontrovertible fact.  It is one of the difficulties in financial business and it is one that concerns me as someone charged with responsibility for taking an interest in the whole question of public accounts.</P>
      <P>A vast number of taxpayers are people earning wages and by and large these taxpayers pay their income tax by PAYE.  They also pay stamps. They pay social welfare contributions and part of these contributions are covered in this Bill.  Part of those contributions are covered in this Bill.  The redundancy and health charges are still there.  We are only dealing with part of them.  The actual figure, which I will come to in a moment, is a lot of money.  I am concerned with the buoyancy of the economy and the necessary economic activity to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first point is, after those general statements, for those people who are paying that taxation in two forms, PAYE and contributions, the Minister for Finance gives relief but the Minister <Col N="475" /> for Social Welfare comes along and takes away that relief by putting up the contributions.  That is an uncontrovertible fact.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to visit any factory or business where the wages are paid out and to see the chits given to employees.  He will find £x taken off for PAYE where the Government receive tax and then there is the cost of the stamp, where the tax is moderated. There is a sizeable increase in the price of the stamp.</P>
    <P>My second point on the financing of this Bill&mdash;this brings it into the category of financial legislation&mdash;is that benefits were given to the employer in the budget and certain very welcome reliefs were given to industry. When the manager comes to look at his accounts he sees the taxation relief and feels thankful to the Government but then he comes on to see what has to be paid under contributions.  I am delighted to see the Minister for Finance has come into the House.</P>
    <P>(<i>Interruptions</i>).</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is too serious to joke about and I do not want to make a political football out of it.  I do not want to delay the House <Col N="476" /> unduly but here again the reliefs given by the Minister, who is sitting beside the Parliamentary Secretary, are to some extent nullified&mdash;I am being moderate in saying &ldquo;to some extent&rdquo; because some people would say I am too moderate&mdash;by the increased contributions that have to be paid.</P>
      <P>My third point is the impossibility of really being sure of one's accounting in this matter because of the series of legislation.  I am in some difficulty as regards my accounting because of the way the Minister for Finance brought in his legislation.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will play ball with me and give me the actual figures straightly and without ambiguity.  If I am right in my estimation before Christmas we had taxation of the order of £50 million brought in, the budget brings in something of the order of £40-£50 million and now there is something of the order of £40 million further taxation in this Bill.  How do I get at that?</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Speed Limits.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the matter of speed limits for the purpose of getting some definite information on Government policy in relation to it.  This matter has been kicked around for some time as a political device.  We had the imposition of a speed limit to justify the increase in the tax on petrol, and its removal and its imposition in a matter of months.  I should like to know where we stand in regard to speed limits on public highways and in built-up areas, especially housing estates, which is of greatest concern to me.</P>
      <P>Government speakers on this subject from time to time have added confusion to uncertainty.  Now we do not know where we are.  The manner in which speed limits have been introduced, changed and reintroduced is a matter of gravest concern.  We read in <i>The Garda Review</i> that it is difficult to enforce the 50 miles per hour limit.  If this is the case, the law is being reduced to ridicule.  If the Government considered it necessary to impose a 50 miles per hour limit, they should have given the Garda the means to enforce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As he files through the country in his State car, I am sure the Minister has observed how this regulation is honoured in the breach more than in its observance.  He will have noticed the number of cars that pass his at high speeds, much faster than the Minister's car is travelling, and he is <Col N="479" /> not bound by speed limits.  He will, therefore, know that efforts to enforce this limit are ineffective because the Garda have not been given the devices with which to enforce the law in this respect.</P>
    <P>As I said, the 50 miles per hour limit was a political device to justify the increased tax on petrol.  There was the suggestion that travelling at lower speeds would conserve fuel.  Added to that, they mentioned the safety factor. Now we demand to know the truth about this.  We want to know what exactly is Government policy. The Minister knows that modern cars travelling at speeds less than 50 miles per hour do so only because the cars are not giving of their best and not because they wish to observe this limit, which the Garda are unable to enforce anyway.  In this respect we should like to know the Minister's opinion of the editorial in <i>The Garda Review,</i> to which I referred, and what action he proposes to take as a result.</P>
    <P>Also as I said earlier, my main concern is about the big housing estates and the other built-up areas.  It is of vital importance that the Garda be given the mechanism to enforce the speed limit in such areas.  The position in them at the moment is alarming.  In my constituency the number of reported and unreported accidents in recent months speak for themselves.  Most of them have occurred because of speeding. Therefore, there is a crying need for consultation between the Minister for Local Government, the Garda and the other bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>There are two points I should like to make.  First of all, I should like to know if the Government have a positive policy in relation to speed limits, if they intend changing the present speed limit and, if so, their justification for so doing.</P>
    <P>I know there are other speakers who want to make some points but those are the points on which I would ask the Minister to give us the benefit of his views and indicate the view of the Government in relation to any change in this matter.  To my mind and that of most other people the first change came as a result of a political device to try to justify the increase in the price of <Col N="480" /> petrol during the fuel crisis.  From statements made by some Government speakers it would appear that the imposition of the speed limit was with a view to conserving fuel rather than the safety factor.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify these matters and give us some indication of what are the Government's positive views and policies in relation to speed limits as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew I would be expected to say something on this matter.  I spoke on the speed limit in the House a couple of months ago and I was interviewed on radio in relation to the question.  Since then I received many letters complimenting me on the fact that I had raised this important matter&mdash;the fact that we have a speed limit which cannot be and is not being kept.  Let us be honest with ourselves. We may say we are keeping it but we are not.  I am not and I have been fined already, but I will accept a fine any time I am caught because, if one breaks the law, one is supposed to pay for so doing.  But I think it is ridiculous to have such a law obtaining on our major highways at present.  I drive only an Escort car but in any car being driven on our highways it will be diffifult for the driver to keep under 60 miles per hour.  In fact, that is what has been happening.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out before, if one is travelling to Dublin and has allocated oneself a certain amount of time for the journey, if one keeps to the speed limit on the straight road &mdash;and anybody who travels between Dublin and Galway will know the road between Moate, Kilbeggan right up to Kilcock&mdash;one will find oneself doing 55 miles per hour coming into Dublin, when one is in danger of crashing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason we were given for the imposition of this speed limit was the conservation of petrol.  On the evening the speed limit was first introduced I happened to be travelling home from Dublin and I noticed that there was an attempt made to keep to it.  Anybody travelling regularly from Dublin to Galway will know that on the Kilcock road there builds up a line of cars until one gets onto <Col N="481" /> the road outside of Kilcock, about five miles out, when the faster cars pull out, the lorries remain back and one can travel at one's ease.  But if everybody sticks to the 50 mile limit what happens is that all the way into Kinnegad one is perpetually changing gears.  I said before and repeat again that I certainly do not think it saves petrol.  This argument of having an unrealistic speed limit with a view to saving petrol is just not on.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be making too much noise about this but, like Deputy Dowling, I would make an appeal to the Minister in this respect. Certainly since I spoke on the radio nobody has said to me I was wrong, not one person said so because everybody knows, if they are honest enough to admit it, they are not keeping the law.</P>
    <P>I mentioned State cars here on the last occasion I spoke.  I do understand that police cars are privileged but, mind you, it is very bad example when these Mercedes fly past one. Sometimes when I am travelling at 60 miles an hour they pass me out as if I were on a bicycle.  What kind of law is that?  On any road I travel I find other motorists flashing their lights at me to say that the Garda cars are ahead.  It would be much better were the Minister to introduce a realistic speed limit of 60 miles per hour with, say, a limit of 40 miles per hour on any crooked or winding roads.  There is a dangerous bit of road in County Galway between Ballinasloe and Loughrea where we have such a speed limit imposed. But on the major highways I repeat that I think the present 50 mile limit is ridiculous.  For example, on the Nass carriageway&mdash;I often go home that way&mdash;motorists do not keep to the limit.  If I am travelling at 60 miles an hour there are fellows passing me out at 70 and 80 miles per hour.  But the ordinary man doing, say, 52 or 53 miles per hour is likely to be caught.  It is in that respect I make my appeal to the Minister.  I did hear the Minister was thinking of changing the speed limit.  I gather it appeared in some paper or other.  I can assure him that if that is true <Col N="482" /> everybody will welcome it because the present limit is one which cannot be enforced.  If one wants to bring the law into disrepute, then one makes a law that cannot be enforced. I would appeal again to the Minister to change this before the summer and make it a 60 miles an hour limit, ensuring that it is enforced, when I think the Minister will have the goodwill of all people concerned.  Nobody likes to see a motorist travelling as if he were competing in a race but a speed of 60 miles per hour on our major highways is by no means too fast.  By all means, speed limits should be adhered to in cities or villages and anybody who does not should be checked.</P>
    <P>I would make a final appeal to the Minister to have a law that can be enforced, that will be respected but do not have one being broken by everybody with nobody so admitting. I am not a speed hog but one just cannot keep the present limit on our major highways.  I would ask the Minister to make an announcement right away that he will change the speed limit, which would be welcomed by everybody.  One might think I was speaking for a certain section of the community only, but nowadays everybody has a car and uses it to go here, there and everywhere on business and pleasure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first raised the matter of speed limits, I mentioned that there was a strong body of opinion within the Garda that the present speed limit could not be enforced.  At that time also I mentioned a draft regulation drawn up by the Ministers of Transport of the EEC.  At that time I do not think the Minister was aware of the regulation but he said he would give it consideration. He has now had time to consider it and I would ask him to have it implemented now because the 50 miles an hour limit is not a realistic one and I join other Deputies in their appeal to the Minister in this respect.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;then to decide to interrupt so that the answer cannot be put across.  I take Deputy Callanan's point : if he is driving along and thinks he can get away with going over the speed limit and he is in a hurry, he admits that, and that is all right.  He has a small car, but the people with <Col N="484" /> the bigger cars&mdash;the State are not the only people to drive Mercedes&mdash;travel fairly fast too.  I can understand Deputy Murphy's annoyance because in the by-election he was travelling so slowly that he was not able to get around the whole area allotted to him. I can see all these points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say the Deputy did not ask the question before the by-election.  I said the fact that the 50 mile per hour limit was there prevented him from going as fast as he hoped he would be able to go, and he was not able to cover the area allotted to him.  We have a rather peculiar situation here.  In the USA the speed limit is 55 miles per hour and that is apparently acceptable.  In Britain there are three limits : 70 miles per hour on the motorway, 60 miles per hour on a dual-carriageway, and 50 miles per hour on other roads.  When the 1966 Road Traffic Act was being enacted, the Fianna Fáil Government were in power, and not alone did they want changes made between the winter and the summer but they wrote into the Act regulations whereby the Minister had authority to have a different speed limit for day and night.  I felt that having a lower speed limit in the winter than in the summer was not a bad idea at all, and I believe it worked out fairly well.  It coincided with a call for a reduction in the amount of fuel being used.  I am not personally convinced that it has reduced fuel consumption, and for that reason I am prepared to go a certain distance particularly with Deputy Callanan who made that point.  However, Deputy Dowling seems to think that when a change was made in the <Col N="485" /> general speed limit, it also affected the ones that were left out, the 30 mile an hour limit in the built-up areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The fact is that there is no draft regulation on speed limits in the EEC. When there is one it will be considered by the Government.  Deputy Callanan said he saw a report in a newspaper that I was considering changing back <Col N="486" /> again.  In fact Deputy Callanan was present in the House when this discussion took place before, and I said I was considering changing the speed limit when the time was changed.

The speed limit was 60 miles per hour mainly and then there were special limits of 50 miles per hour and 30 miles per hour.  The suggestion has been made by Deputy Dowling that there seems to be something wrong because Fianna Fáil were not in power when the 30 mile per hour limit came into effect in built-up areas.  That 30 mile per hour limit has not been changed and there is no proposal to change it.</P>
