    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 28:</P>
    <P>In subsection (6), page 26, line 28, after &ldquo;individual&rdquo; to add &ldquo;provided always that the period of ten years aforesaid may by decision in writing of the Revenue Commissioners be reduced by such period as to the Revenue Commissioners seems just where the individual has been prevented by ill-health from working as a full-time director for the said period of ten years or where the individual concerned is the widow or widower of the next preceding owner and is unable to carry on the trade, business, farming, office, employment or profession of his or her former spouse.</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Deputy Colley.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned last night I had outlined the purpose of this amendment, the purpose being to ensure that the relief proposed in section 26 in the case of a disposal by a family of a firm or business on retirement would be available to two categories of persons who seem to me to be excluded by the section.  One category is a person who has been engaged full-time in business and, as a result of illness, has to give up the full-time occupation and, because of his absence from the business, is forced to dispose of the business.  In such circumstances a man should be <Col N="407" /> entitled to the relief proposed in the section.  The other category is where a farmer was full-time or a director of a family business died and his widow endeavoured to carry on the business but found herself unable to do so; she also should get the benefit of the proposed relief.</P>
      <P>The Minister said last night that he believed the relief in fact would be given to the widow.  On the basis he put forward for that I still have doubt as to whether the Bill would give such relief.  If it would I would, of course, welcome it but I do not think on its face that it does.  I would expect therefore that the Minister would be disposed either to accept this amendment or introduce his own amendment to make certain such relief would be available to a widow in those curcumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the other category, the man who because of illness finds himself not qualified for the relief, the Minister indicated he could not accept the amendment because of difficulties involved for the Revenue Commissioners in determining the nature of the illness and various other factors.  The amendment is designed to give the relief in the cases I have mentioned when the Revenue Commissioners decide it is just that it should be given. The categories concerned are specified. There is provision where the Revenue Commissioners consider it just to reduce the period of ten years stipulated in the section.  There could therefore be no question of arguing that this amendment would be open to abuse because the control would be entirely in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister is mistaken in saying that the problems presented to the Revenue Commissioners would be such that they would not be in a position to handle them because of difficulty in deciding on medical certificates the degree of illness involved and whether it was such as to have caused the individual to give up his full-time work.  At the moment the Revenue Commissioners are obliged in the case of people claiming special income tax allowances in respect of health expenditure to make <Col N="408" /> decisions of this kind so that it is not a new prospect for the Revenue Commissioners. I do not think there is any major problem involved but I think the categories I have described are such as to require, and to be in all equity entitled to the relief.  The Minister and the House have an obligation to ensure that such persons get the relief.  I am not saying this situation will arise in every case but I believe it is one which can arise in quite a number of cases and that failure to provide for these cases would be a very serious defect in the relief which it is purported to give under section 26.</P>
    <P>A way of giving the relief must be found.  The way I have suggested ensures that there cannot be any abuse of this.  I urge the Minister very strongly to accept this amendment or alternatively put forward his own.  In that connection I should say I referred to these matters on the Second Stage debate and my recollection is that in replying the Minister said he would consider the points raised in this connection and if necessary bring in an amendment.  Since he did not do so I am afraid the indications are that he does not intend to provide relief in cases of this kind, particularly the case of the person compelled by ill-health to give up either his farming or his business.</P>
    <P>I regard that as a very grave omission from the Bill and one which would create considerable hardship, which is not justified simply on the grounds of difficulty of administration, or because of risk of abuse of the relief.  When it is totally in the hands of the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners it cannot be reasonably argued that it is open to abuse of that kind.  The sole reason advanced against giving the relief was the difficulty of administration that would arise for the Revenue Commissioners. I do not believe that is a sufficiently good reason to deny this necessary relief in cases of the kind I have outlined nor do I believe that the difficulties are such that they would prove insurmountable to the Revenue Commissioners. As I have indicated they are already handling problems of this <Col N="409" /> kind.  Even if they were not I do not accept they could not handle a problem of this kind.</P>
    <P>I want to urge the Minister very strongly again not to allow the kind of difficulties he envisages to stand in the way of giving the relief in cases where I am sure he agrees the relief should be given.  There may be a stronger case for giving the relief in the kind of case I mentioned than in the straightforward case envisaged in the section.  The section envisages giving the relief where a man retires from farming or business.  He may retire in the full of his health and he may engage in some other occupation afterwards.  The kind of case I am trying to cover in this amendment is where a man is obliged by ill-health to retire and almost certainly he will be totally dependent on the proceeds of the sale of his business and will not have any opportunity of earning a living, so the necessity for giving this kind of relief in these cases is even greater than it is in those where it is proposed to give the relief in the section.  For all of these reasons I urge the Minister very strongly to accept this amendment or if he cannot do that at the very least to accept the principle of it and undertake to introduce his own amendment to achieve the same purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why I am not disposed to accept the amendment is because I am satisfied that the Bill and the interpretation of it by the Revenue Commissioners will ensure that circumstances such as Deputy Colley outlines will not disqualify a person from the relief which it is proposed to give provided that person has been involved in the business for ten years prior to the date of disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware, and I do not think anybody else is aware, of any case under existing law where full-time occupation was necessary, where the Revenue Commissioners refused whatever entitlement a person was entitled to by reason of fulltime occupation simply because of a person's absence from business because of ill-health.  The test is not whether or not a person is <Col N="410" /> devoting the full working hours to a particular business but whether or not he is substantially involved in running some other business or activity to such an extent as not to be adequately involved in the business concerned.</P>
    <P>There are innumerable cases, as we all know, where people can be absent from a business for days, weeks, months and indeed years, but it has never been held against them that illness disqualifies them from being substantially or fully involved in the business.  If such a person was substantially involved in the running of another business in such a way as to be clearly unable to give adequate attention to the business which came under scrutiny by the Revenue Commissioners then a different case would arise.  The Deputy may be assured that the fears he has would not in the event materialise because the Revenue Commissioners would not interpret the section in the harsh way he feels they might simply because of the obligation to be involved in the running of the business.</P>
    <P>As far as the widow is concerned, as I said last night, the Revenue Commissioners have already informed me, and I am informing the Dáil, that they will interpret the section as meaning that there is continuity and will count the deceased husband's ownership and hers as one ownership.  The Revenue Commissioners have never gone back on any assurance which has been given in their name to Oireachtas Éireann regarding their understanding of a Bill and the way in which they would interpret it.  The Deputy will recall, when he had Ministerial responsibility, he had to give assurances of a similar kind and they never have been dishonoured.</P>
    <P>I will, however, give attention to the possibility of writing in something of this kind but, as I mentioned last night, I am loathe to write in a specific reference to the continuation of ownership between husband and wife in one section without looking to every other section of the Bill and indeed the whole schedule to see if by including it in one it might be deemed we intended to omit it in another.  I believe we are on much safer ground to proceed in the light of the indications that have <Col N="411" /> already been given in regard to the way this section will be interpreted by the Revenue Commissioners, who are the people, who under the law, will be charged with its operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is clear, from what the Minister said, that he agrees with the purpose of the amendment because he said that the Bill already provides for the cases envisaged in the amendment.  There is no argument between us on the desirability of this.  As regards the case of the widow I am familiar with the situation in which the Minister for Finance of the day gives an assurance in the House as to the way in which the Revenue Commissioners intend to operate a particular section of a Bill.</P>
      <P>As the Minister says, I know of no case where such an undertaking has been dishonoured.  Nevertheless I do not think I know of any case either where the suggested interpretation of the Bill by the Revenue Commissioners seems to be so far removed from what the Bill actually says.  That is the reason for my concern in the case of the widow.  However, the Minister has said that he will have it looked at in order to ensure that this matter is made clear and certain in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the other case, again, while I understand the point the Minister is making, I am not sure that this is sufficient.  If I understand him correctly he is saying that because the section requires ten years prior to the disposal as a full-time director if such a director is ill, let us say for two years of the ten years, the Revenue Commissioners will say that the fact that he is ill does not mean that that is the end of the matter, he was not ten years full time as a director.  However, the situation can be a little more complex than that.  For instance, if as a result of the illness going on for a considerable time and medical advice that the man will be unable to work again, say if he were to get the benefit of some superannuation or retirement scheme or insurance policy which would indicate that he was no <Col N="412" /> longer in full time work and would not be in future, in those circumstances would the Revenue Commissioners still interpret his position as being a full-time director?  The situation I have outlined is not an unusual one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the person was in receipt of some insurance benefit because of inability to pursue his employment, and it is quite a frequent form of insurance that is usually related to the possibility of return to the business, in such circumstances it would be deemed that there was always that possibility.  It is said rightly that doctors differ and patients die.  It can be said with equal truth that doctors differ and patients live.  I, and I am sure other Members of the House, know of cases where doctors even certified people as unfit subjects for insurance because of an anticipated short life span and the doctors themselves went to earlier deaths than the people in respect of whom they refused to issue certificates which would establish their long expectation of life. The area of health certification is uncertain, to say the least, and that is not casting any aspersions on the integrity or the ability of doctors, but the way in which the human body works and survives both illness and handicaps is imperfect of accurate forecasting and of certification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cases which Deputy Colley has in mind of the existing law where health falls to be considered are very limited and are more after the event than before it.  For instance, under the income tax code there is an allowance where a person's medical expenses exceed a certain figure in any year, provided the expenses have arisen in respect of some disease or ailment which could not be insured against.  There it is a question of establishing that the expenses have been incurred and the expenses must be incurred on the prescription of a doctor.  The kind of certification which would be required if the Deputy's amendment was to be recorded in the law would involve assessments by doctors as to the probable effects on people of remaining at work and those assessments could be <Col N="413" /> open to quite an amount of miscalculation, to say the least of it.  Many a person was advised by his doctor to give up work and, as a consequence of giving up work, died sooner than if he had remained at work because a person can become a hypochondriac as a result of having more time to worry about himself than if he engaged in work.  Some of the people who lived longest were those who remained working right to the very end, even to a hoary old age.  The Deputy will see that there is a great deal of difficulty involved in endeavouring to apply what he seeks to have considered and I am satisfied that the Bill, as drafted, and as it will be worked by the Revenue Commissioners, will ensure that the kind of case which he has in mind will be attended to.</P>
    <P>May I offer this point, more as a point of substance than as a debating point?  The Bill refers to the fact that a director must &ldquo;devote substantially the whole of his time&rdquo;.  The whole of a person's time has never been defined statutorily.  It means literally 24 hours a day but nobody has ever assumed that the Revenue Commissioners would so unreasonably interpret such similar reference in other Bills.  As far as the health aspect is concerned the way the Revenue Commissioners would read that is the whole of his available time, that is, such time as he was able to put at the disposal of the business having regard to his state of health.  If he does not devote the whole of his time because of the fact that he devotes part of his working time to some other business then the right to avail of this section would accordingly be removed.  I think that is reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But if a person is making available the whole of his available time, as his health permits, then such a person would not be denied the benefit of the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister is getting involved unnecessarily in the question of medical certificates, their accuracy, the differing views that <Col N="414" /> may be expressed by competent doctors on the same patient.  That is not really what we are concerned with here, I suggest.  What we are concerned with is how the Revenue Commissioners would interpret the section and how much discretion and latitude the Revenue Commissioners have in interpreting the section.  I would suggest that under the section as drafted they do not have a latitude sufficiently wide to enable them, in the case of a full-time director who by reason of ill health retires completely and perhaps draws insurance benefit based on total incapacity, to exercise the kind of discretion the Minister proposes that they will exercise.  That kind of discretion could only be given by something on the lines of this amendment, and it does not matter what their intentions are or how the Minister puts on the record what their intentions are.  They cannot go outside the terms of the section as passed by the House.  The real question, therefore, is what power are we giving the Revenue Commissioners in cases of this kind.  I would assume that where there is a medical certificate received in such a case by the Revenue Commissioners from a qualified doctor, where they have no reason to doubt it, they would accept it on its face.  It would be only in a small number of cases that they would have any reason to doubt this.  In such cases where they have reason to doubt, of course, they would have to check up and this amendment would allow them, if they wanted to, to do so and then make up their minds as to whether the relief would be given or not in a particular case.  That, I suggest, would not be in any except a small minority of the kind of cases we are talking about.  In the great majority of cases there would be no problem for the Revenue Commissioners of interpreting or checking up on medical certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would again suggest that that is going away from the real point with which we are concerned here, namely, have the Revenue Commissioners the right under the section as drafted to allow the relief proposed under this <Col N="415" /> section to a man who is in the position that as a result of illness and perhaps, as I said, of his drawing insurance benefit as being totally disabled, he retires from the position of full-time director and is not therefore able to establish that he has been a full-time director for the ten years prior to the disposal as required by the section? That is the kernel of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister is saying that in cases of this kind the Revenue Commissioners will interpret the situation as showing that the man was a full-time director for ten years because they would not regard his absence due to illness as meaning that he was not a full-time director.  I accept that that is so, but I cannot accept that where a man is clearly and demonstrably retired from the position because of illness they could so interpret, whatever their intentions might be.  I do not think that they are given the power to do that in the section.  That is really what this amendment is all about, to give them the power to do that, whatever they may intend to do. I would feel very strongly that we should make certain that they have the power to do what the Minister says they intend to do and what both sides of the House want them to do in circumstances of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the sections will come to the relief of the people the Deputy has in mind, and I think it is better to leave it the way it is rather than to meddle around with it in a way which would probably force the Revenue Commissioners to make more detailed inquiry regarding every case than it is their practice to do.  Under existing law, from time to time they have to assess whether or not a person is a whole-time director.  They do not go around looking for time sheets&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to see whether a person has been occupying a chair for X hours per year and, as men of <Col N="416" /> the world, they are aware of cases where because of serious illness like cancer or something of that kind a director has not been in useful involvement in business but they have not in the past and would not in future proceed harshly to rule out such people, nor do they go to see whether or not the person prudently insured against absence or against a fall in income in respect of absence from business arising out of genuine illness.</P>
      <P>If we proceed to try to deal with every one of these situations by producing amendments to the Bill the truth is that we will provide the right recipe of relief for some people and as a consequence rule out others who, under the existing practical and sympathetic way in which the law is applied are in.</P>
      <P>Quite sincerely, I would urge upon the Deputy that what he seeks to attain is best attained under the Bill as drafted and as it would be interpreted by the Revenue Commissioners, and that while his intention is good he might well defeat that good intention by putting the Revenue Commissioners into the position of having to probe the most intimate details of a person's medical history and attendance at business and that this would operate against the best interests of the majority of people who would benefit under the system that is proposed, which is not dissimilar to that which operates at present under the income tax laws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I accept that the Minister's intentions are good in this, the Bill, unfortunately, does not do what he wants to do and what he wants the Revenue Commissioners to be able to do.  I do not think there is any point in going back over the arguments again.  We have each put the relevant points, but I am not satisfied that the section does not give power to do what I want it to do and what I think the Minister wants it to do.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 26 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of the provisions in this section which I think require explanation.  I wonder would the Minister care to give an outline of the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for relief from capital gains tax in the case of an individual who disposes of his business or farm or shares in his family company, on his retirement at the age of 55 years or more.  To qualify the individual must have owned the assets for at least ten years and where the disposal is of shares of his family company, he must have been a full-time working director of the company throughout the ten years. <Col N="418" /> If the disposal is for not more than £50,000, all the gains will be relieved. If the disposal is for more than £50,000, there is marginal relief to ensure that the tax is restricted to half the difference between the consideration and £50,000.  The relief is limited in the case of one individual, however many farms or businesses he disposes of, to an aggregate consideration of £50,000.  Does the Deputy wish me to go through the various subsections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly concerned with subsection 1 (ii) paragraph (b) and also subsections 4 and 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection 1 provides the relief for an individual who has attained the age of 55 years and who disposes of the whole or part of <Col N="419" /> his qualifying assets as defined in subsection 6 (a).  The measure of relief is the full amount of capital gains tax where the amount or value of the consideration for the disposal does not exceed £50,000.  Marginal relief is provided where the amount or value of the consideration exceeds £50,000 to the extent that the amount of capital gains tax chargeable will not exceed half the difference between the consideration and £50,000.  For example, on disposal £52,000; gain £10,000; tax to be charged at 26 per cent, £2,600 but marginal relief would limit the tax to £1,000.  Subsection (1) (b) means that in applying the marginal relief, the amount of half the difference between £50,000 and the consideration received is to be compared with the tax which would not have been chargeable but for the gain on the farm or business.  That amount of tax is the difference between the capital gains tax which would have been chargeable on all the gains for the year, including the farm or business, and on the gains, excluding the farm or business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will probably recognise that paragraph (b) of subsection (1) (ii) is similar to another paragraph with which we were concerned last night.  We agreed then that it presented difficulties of interpretation.  Perhaps the same can be said for this part of the section and the Minister might look at it with a view to redrafting and making the meaning clearer.  It is in similar circumstances to marginal relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many of these things that could be made clearer by examples.  No doubt the text book writers will not be slow about producing examples but it is a difficult thing in a piece of legislation to produce an example.  I can give the House an example now if people want to use the record as the initial text book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If one has to fall back on that one will have to do so but it should be possible to draft it in such a way to make the meaning clearer than it is at present.  The difficulty <Col N="420" /> arises for the same reason that it arose in the other case because it is dealing with marginal relief and the same formula of words is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is not easy to follow until one has an illustration. Subsection (4) is an anti-avoidance measure aimed at ensuring the limitation of the relief to an individual during his lifetime to an aggregate consideration of £50,000.  Thus, disposals will be accumulated and relief for any year will be computed as if disposals for that year and all previous years had been made in the year under review, and for this purpose a part disposal by a husband to a wife or <i>vice versa</i> is taken into account at market value and section 13 (5) does not apply to such a disposal which otherwise pursuant to section 13 (5) would be treated as a disposal on a no-profit no-loss basis.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) provides for the application of subsection (1) to capital distributions received in the course of dissolving or winding up a family company and for this purpose the individual is treated as if he had disposed of interests in shares or securities so as to qualify for relief under subsection (3).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the effect of the exclusion of the provisions of section 13 (5) as provided for under subsection (4) of this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision is to prevent an abuse of the section by transfer taking place between husband and wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy looks at subsection (5) of section 13 he will see that it states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where in any year of assessment in which, or in part of which, the married woman is a married woman living with her husband, the husband disposes of an asset to the wife, or the wife disposes of an asset to the husband, both shall be treated as if the asset was acquired from the one making the disposal for a consideration of such amount as would secure <Col N="421" /> that on the disposal neither a gain nor a loss would accrue to the one making the disposal:</P>
    <P>Provided that this subsection shall not apply if, until the disposal, the asset formed part of trading stock of a trade carried on by the one making the disposal, or if the asset is acquired as trading stock for the purposes of a trade carried on by the one acquiring the asset.</P>
    <P>(6) Subsection (5) shall have effect notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 15 of Schedule 1 or of any other provisions of this Act fixing the amount of the consideration deemed to be given on a disposal or acquisition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the abuse arise of the provisions of this section if section 13 (5) were to operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could have a situation where a husband might give £50,000 worth of property to his wife and under section 13 would not be charged.  Then there could be a sale of £50,000 worth of property which it might be claimed qualified for the relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that not be regarded as a disposal within the family under section 27 in so far as it is regarded as a disposal at all between the husband and wife?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain what the Deputy's question is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that without this provision and if one were to allow section 13 (5) to operate this relief could be abused by the husband transferring the property to the wife and getting the relief provided for in this section?  I understood the Minister to say that was the purpose of section 4 of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This £50,000 in section 26 is a special exemption which applies outside the family.  Section 27 deals with the case of a family business. Section 13 deals with transfers between husband and wife and we are ensuring here that a total disposal which is governed by section 13 (5) would not come within the ambit of <Col N="422" /> section 26.  One is a case outside the family and the other is a case within the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>How can a disposal under section 13 (5) come within the ambit of this section since it is provided in section 13 (5) that such a disposal would be deemed to be at a value which creates no gain and no loss?  Therefore, no question of liability for tax arises on a disposal under section 13 (5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 4 (c) of this section states:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this subsection, a disposal of qualifying assets other than a disposal of the whole of such assets, by a husband to a wife or by a wife to a husband shall, notwithstanding the provisions of section 13 (5), be taken into account at the market value of the assets.</P>
      <P>Under section 13 (5) a husband can transfer anything to his wife at any time without liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If he can transfer without liability under section 13 (5) how could the question of relief as provided for in this section arise, since there is no liability on a transfer between a husband and wife?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4) provides that a man cannot transfer to his wife freely, then let the wife dispose of it and get the benefit of the £50,000 relief because, if that were permitted, they would get relief on £100,000.  There can be the one £50,000 only; there cannot be double relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (c) of subsection (4) provides for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (c) seems to me to remove the benefit of section 13, subsection (5) from a transaction between a husband and wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it ensures that there cannot be double relief, that one cannot have relief on £100,000.  There will still be the relief on £50,000 but one cannot get it on the double.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="423" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that that is the intention but I wonder if that is what it is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A man cannot transfer say, £50,000 today, then tomorrow sell off £50,000 of his own, the wife sell off £50,000 and get £100,000 relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing the man transfers to the wife, once he has transferred it, how can she get the benefit of the relief under this section, because she would not qualify under the other provisions of the section; for instance, she would not have been ten years; that is one of the qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>She could eventually be in ten years, herself, in her own right.  This comes back again to the fundamental concept that is, that husband and wife are so closely linked together for property-holding purposes, we want to ensure that if the favourable treatment which is enjoyed under section 13, subsection (5) is availed of, that that and this particular section cannot be availed of on the double so that one got relief on £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but this paragraph seems to say:</P>
      <P>(c)  For the purposes of this subsection, a disposal of qualifying assets other than a disposal of the whole of such assets, by a husband to a wife or by a wife to a husband shall, notwithstanding the provisions of section 13 (5), be taken into account at the market value of the assets.</P>
      <P>The qualifying assets are defined in the section.  How does one decide whether a transaction is one that comes within the ambit of paragraph (c) or within the ambit of section 13 (5)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any disposal would come within the meaning of section 13 (5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, any disposal would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, by husband to wife, which would be governed by section 13 (5).  This provision is simply <Col N="424" /> to say that benefit having been obtained under section 13 (5), there will not be this dual benefit, as it were, by applying section 26 to such a disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is not what it says.  What it says is that notwithstanding the provisions of section 13 (5) a disposal of part of the qualifying assets between a husband and a wife would be taken into account at market value.  It does not say: a transaction having benefited from section 13 (5).  Does the Minister see my point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is market value for the deduction of £50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not seem to me, on the face of it, that it is clear which provision&mdash;either subsection (4) (c) of this section or section 13, subsection (5)&mdash;would be applied to a particular transaction.  As I understand it, the Minister is saying that if section 13 (5) has been applied, then this section will not be applied.  But that does not seem to be what the paragraph is saying.  It seems to be saying: despite section 13 (5), those provisions will not be applied where there is disposal between a husband and wife of part of qualifying assets, which is not the same thing as the Minister indicated was the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have to look further into this.  I know what is the intention but I can see that there is some room for doubt as to whether the paragraph achieves it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, the intention is to prevent splitting, which would allow a couple to get exemption on £100,000 instead of limiting it to £50,000.  I will certainly examine it and, if necessary, bring in an amendment on Report Stage to clarify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When looking at this, would the Minister bear in mind that the provisions of section 13 (5), if applied to the transaction between the husband and the wife, is one <Col N="425" /> thing.  But, as I understand it, what he is getting at is that a subsequent disposal by the husband or the wife would not get the benefit of this section&mdash;that in fact there are two transactions involved, not just one.  I think that would need to be made clear in any clarification of this paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take note of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister is familiar with but I should like to get his comments on the statement in the Newsletter of The Confederation of Irish Industry relating to this section which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The Confederation considers that the amount of £50,000 should be increased to £150,000, as the figure of £50,000 is far too small to provide any satisfactory measure of relief for business.  When applied to manufacturing firms the proposals will have the effect of taking capital out of productive industry. Since the Government must still rely for 60 per cent of its job creation targets on new foreign industry, the Confederation strongly urges that investment in Irish manufacturing industry by directors or executives of the company should be exempted.  Relaxation of the statutory requirements where there are cases of hardship due to ill-health, <i>et cetera</i> should also be introduced.</P>
      <P>We have been dealing with the latter point on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Capital gains tax will not apply until a person is disposing of his interest in whatever assets he possesses.  In relation to what the Deputy has said, it would not apply to industrial assets until the person was disposing of them.  Therefore, if the Bill has any effect, it should operate to encourage people to leave their assets in industry rather than dispose of them and, by so doing, become subject to the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is partially true only.  I would suggest, that the disposal of a particular asset may, when subjected to the tax, in fact have the <Col N="426" /> effect of what the confederation says, of taking capital out of productive industry.  The Minister may say that a disposal of that kind, where it is proposed to re-invest the proceeds, is in fact exempted and gets the benefit of roll-over relief.  I do not want to go into this matter at the moment because later we will be discussing the precise benefits of the proposed relief, but even leaving that argument aside is it not possible that in some circumstances the effect of the tax on disposal of assets in productive use at the moment would produce the imposition of capital gains tax at 26 per cent and, to that extent, it could take that much money out of productive investment when we most need it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has anticipated my remarks.  I am satisfied that whatever else it does it does not take money out of industry.  It is an encouragement to keep it there, either by not disposing of it or by rolling it over if there is a disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister received any representations, in particular from the various accountancy bodies, in regard to the definition of &ldquo;family company&rdquo; in subsection (6) (a)?  If so, will he state his attitude to such representations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say offhand if such representations were received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a slight difficulty because I cannot put my hands on them at the moment but presumably this matter can be dealt with on the next Stage if that is necessary.  I will not hold up the Minister on that point.  I understand also that the Minister has received representations in regard to the definition of &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; working director&rdquo; in subsection (6) (b).  Has he any information on that and on his attitude to the representations made to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt fairly extensively with the question of definition and interpretation of &ldquo;full-time working director&rdquo; earlier this morning.  In relation to a company, a &ldquo;full-time working director&rdquo; is defined as a director who is required to devote <Col N="427" /> substantially the whole of his time to the service of the company in a managerial or technical capacity.  Where an individual is required to devote substantially the whole of his time to the service in a managerial or technical capacity in more than one company, and the company is constituted a group of companies, or carries on complementary businesses so as to form a composite unit of the business, on the disposal by way of sale or gift of the whole of his shares in all the companies, he may by concession be regarded as a full-time working director of any of the companies which, in relation to him, is a family company. Some representations were made on this issue but I am satisfied the way in which this will operate will ensure that people who are involved in more than one company in the group will enjoy the relief the section seeks to confer on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is unusual for a person to retire from farming at the age of 55 years without having ten years previous involvement in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point we were trying to make last night without any success was that a farmer could be 30 years or more in farming.  It appears it is useless to speak because the Minister is not listening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person were disposing of 100 acres and had 75 acres for five years before retiring, it would be considered he was in the same property even though he had added 25 acres within the preceding ten years.  It would be deemed to be the one farm on which he was engaged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The same situation would arise in a business where there was new plant or an addition to the premises in the previous ten years. This section does not require that a business should remain static and not be improved in the preceding decade and this will apply to a farm as well as to a business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister has said but the question arises of how far that can be stretched. If a farmer retained one acre for a longer period than ten years while the rest of the farm had been acquired within a few short years of his retirement, on that basis would the whole of the farm qualify under this section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a matter for interpretation in each case.  If the man had been fully occupied in working the one acre very intensively and had not engaged in any other activity and had added 99 acres in the previous ten years I am not certain what interpretation the Revenue Commissioners would put on it.  However, it is obvious that that is quite different from a man who had one idle acre of land which he let out in conacre and then a few years before retirement bought 99 acres.  These are matters of degree which must be determined in each case, having regard to all the facts, including the person's occupation.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The point Deputy O'Malley was making last night was that this would favour the large holding.  However, the farmer who had to sell his farm for £50,000 or £60,000 and moved to another farm but only holds it for about five or six years would not be exempt going on the example the Minister has now given.</P>

      <P>As I said before, if we try to legislate for every possible human business relationship we will end up with an Act which is unworkable and which in the long run, will leave out many cases which would be covered if the matter were left to the Revenue Commissioners. On the one hand, the amendment suggests leaving <Col N="429" /> some discretion in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners.  Discretion is exercised in the case of a certificate issued in respect of a man's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the proposal here is tantamount to expecting the Revenue Commissioners to act in an illegal way in exercising discretion.  By not trying to cover every possible arrangement of property the Revenue Commissioners will in the ordinary administration of the tax law use that discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be done in this way because if you tighten up the law to cover every possible situation you will do a disservice to people who would be helped by leaving the law as the Bill proposes.  If we proceed to say that a farmer may take on X acres in the previous ten years but not X plus Y, and so on, in order to be regarded as occupying the property and using it for a period of ten years, then you are going to leave everybody who is the other side of X plus Y with a greater sense of grievance and you force the Revenue Commissioners into a more detailed investigation of all the details in qualifying assets over the previous decade.  What they will look at is the situation in the round rather than going through the trading accounts of the previous ten years to see what was taken in and what went out.  I am satisfied this is a much healthier way in which to leave it.  If the taxpayer feels aggrieved and he thinks justice has not been done, he has the right of appeal.  I am not saying that is the reason we should not be careful.  We must be careful to ensure an injustice is not done and the best way to ensure that is to leave the section the way it is rather than produce tight laws which will create an impossible and unworkable code.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Where we have suggested the Revenue Commissioners should exercise discretion we have <Col N="430" /> been recognising the difficulty and, indeed, the undesirability of spelling out in precise details all the cases that require to be covered.  The Minister may be missing the point we have been urging on him which is to ensure that, where the Revenue Commissioners should have a discretion, they have that discretion.  The Minister has given us some information as to how it is intended the Revenue Commissioners should operate the section.  I want to ensure that they can operate it when it comes to the crunch.  Part of the definition of qualifying assets reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Qualifying assets&rdquo; in relation to a disposal includes the chargeable business assets of the individual which, apart from tangible movable property, he has owned for the period of ten years ending with the disposal . . . </P>
      <P>That is what the section says.  The Minister tells us the Revenue Commissioners would interpret that as including fairly considerable assets he has not owned for the period of ten years ending with the disposal but which he acquired and added to his existing assets.  I am not quarrelling at all with the Revenue Commissioners dealing with the matter in that way. There is a strong case to be made for it and for looking at the matter with some discretion, but I am questioning whether the Revenue Commissioners have power to do so having regard to the provision.  Assets which he owned for the period of ten years ending with the disposal seems to be to tie down the Revenue Commissioners very much and not to secure what the Minister has told us is the intention of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>What we are concerned to ensure is that, where the Revenue Commissioners should have discretion, they are given it.  It is all very well for the Minister to say they will do it in a certain way but he will agree that they cannot do things in a certain way unless the legislation gives them the power and the discretion.  On the face of it, I suggest the definition of qualifying assets does not give that power to treat the matter in the way the Minister has suggested.</P>

      <P>The Minister does not seem to realise that, if there is a dispute between the inspector of taxes and the taxpayer, in the first instance, and between the taxpayer and the Appeals Commissioners in the second instance, and the taxpayer is assessed for capital gains in a situation such as I outlined last night, and reading this debate and what the Minister said he believes he should not have been assessed and appeals on a point of law to the High Court the court has no option but to rule that he is liable for tax.  I gave an instance last night of a farmer who had been farming for 30 or 40 years and who changed his farm within the last ten years.  This is a frequent occurrence because people change their farms quite a few times.  If he changed his farm ten years before he disposed of it on retirement, it is not a question of the Revenue Commissioners being sympathetic or trying to interpret the law to assist him.  They have no option but to tell him he does not qualify for relief.  It is not enough for the Minister to say they will interpret the law in a way that will be helpful to him or give him the benefit of the doubt. We have had too much of this kind of thing in this debate.  The High Court and the Appeals Commissioners will not read these debates and all they can do is interpret the Act as it stands.  As the Bill stands here and now the situation we have been talking about is not covered and the inspector of taxes, the Appeals Commissioners and the High Court would not be justified in giving any kind of relief and the Minister should, therefore, amend the Bill.  I would like from him now a clear undertaking that he proposes to amend it on these lines on Report Stage.  If he does not do so the situation will be quite unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>I recognise the impossibility of spelling out every case but there is ground for the Minister accepting this amendment.  Deputy <Col N="432" /> O'Malley is quite right in what he says with regard to interpretation by the court.  I referred last night to the Planning Act.  Planning programmes are drawn up by local authorities and they can be interpreted in a different way entirely by the officials.</P>
      <P>What the Minister really meant was who should or should not get relief but it is a different matter when this comes for interpretation.  The Government and the Opposition have discussed this and they know their minds but the people interpreting this will be the Revenue Commissioners or the courts.  It will be interpreted either black or white by the courts.  I repeat what I said last night that there should be some way the individual can appeal to the Minister who represents the Government and the people.  He should interpret the legislation which he brought into the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is especially necessary in regard to the interpretation of it.  It is absolutely necessary for the protection of the individual that there be no political involvement in the application of tax laws once they are passed by the Dáil.  The political responsibility is in drafting the legislation in the first instance and in the event of cases coming to political notice, which indicate that the existing law is creating hardship, then to amend the law.  I certainly give the undertaking, which I think is unnecessary when I put it on record, that if in the light of experience of applying this Bill or any other Capital Taxation Bill, cases come to light which are inequitable, I will not hesitate to amend the law and, if necessary, retrospectively in order to ensure that hardship will not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as this particular section is concerned, I am prepared to look at the possibility of amending the subsection <Col N="433" /> in such a way as would ensure that in the case of people who have at the time of retirement assets which have not been held for ten years but which are similar to ones which were previously held the relief might be given.  Of course, we would want to be certain that we do not open the way to avoidance devices for the clever merchants with substantial moneys who may be seeking to make a quick gain, tax free.  If it is possible to devise a suitable amendment to deal with the case Deputy O'Malley mentioned of a farmer who has 100 acres of land in 1975, who sells it in 1980, replaces it with another farm immediately and retires in 1990, I shall bring one in.  I believe there is merit in considering an appropriate amendment to deal with such cases and I would prefer to see if a suitable one can be devised before the next Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My humour last night, as I recollect it, was perfectly equable.  It is a matter of opinion as to whether the same could be said about the Minister's but we can put it down to the upset to his metabolism because of too much travel recently and leave it at that.  The more you <Col N="434" /> read and reread the different subsections of this section the more you find in them.  On my initial reading of subsection (1 (a) (ii) I thought that the normal type of marginal relief applied but I find now that it is not and there is a very quick cut-off in the marginal relief.  If the consideration for the disposal of an asset, business or a farm on a person's retirement exceeds £50,000 the amount of the capital gains tax chargeable on the gain accruing on the disposal shall not exceed half the difference between the amount of that consideration and £50,000.</P>
      <P>It is not half the tax that will be payable but half the consideration, which is a very different matter.  In practice, it is three times as much with the result that the marginal relief will have had to be very small. Would the Minister not consider, in accordance with the usual practice in this type of thing, relating the marginal relief not to the consideration, which is never done, but to the amount of tax?</P>
      <P>I have read section 26 (1) (b) about six times and it is the classic of all time.  It should be printed and sent around the country to people.  What it means is totally beyond me.  I cannot aspire to the heights of intelligence attained on the other side of the House but I have passed a few examinations in my day and I do not know what it means.  It reads:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of paragraph (a), the amount of capital gains tax chargeable in respect of the gain shall be the amount of tax which would not have been chargeable but for that gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, with your long and distinguished academic record, could you interpret that for me because I am sure the Minister cannot?  There is nobody else on the other side of the House I can ask. Not alone do I not know what that means but it seems to me that it means less than nothing.  It states that the amount of the capital gains tax chargeable in respect of the gain shall be the amount of the tax which would not have been chargeable but <Col N="435" /> for the gain.  How could you have an amount that would not have been chargeable but for the gain?  Taking the &ldquo;but for&rdquo; as a negative it immediately follows the other negative &ldquo;which would not have been chargeable&rdquo;. Do the two negatives cancel each other out?  If so, what is the effect?</P>
    <P>The High Court and the Supreme Court will probably spend about three days trying to work out what this means and they will not have the benefit of the advice of the Revenue Commissioners or the draftsman. They will simply be faced with the four lines in this paragraph and the arguments of counsel on each side which will not be authoritative. Counsel will only be doing the best they can from their respective points of view.  It may be that the Revenue Commissioners and the draftsman mean something specific by this. Could we be told that and could we then see if there is any way in which we could render this into language which is intelligible?  The phrase is &ldquo;shall be the amount of tax which would not have been chargeable but for the gain&rdquo;.  If there was no gain there could not have been any tax chargeable and how one can, therefore, talk about the amount that would not have been chargeable but for the gain is beyond me. I am not, as I was accused of last night, making up impossible cases.</P>
    <P>I cannot give any example in relation to this because I do not know what it means.  The distinguished Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not know what it means.  We will wait now and see whether the Minister can tell us what it means.  It may mean something, but if it does it should be rewritten in a way that is intelligible to normal mortals, because some unfortunate taxpayer is going to spend a few days in the High Court or the Supreme Court at perhaps several hundred pounds a day trying to get this interpreted.  He may or may not succeed.  Nobody could advise anyone as to the meaning of it as it stands.</P>

      <P>We had a very lengthy debate yesterday, as I am sure Deputy Colley will confirm, on section 17 (2) (b) which is exactly on all fours with this.  We had a further debate on it this morning. I have gone into it in great detail. I have given an assurance to the House that if it is possible to express the meaning of the section in language which is more helpful I will put in an amendment on the Report Stage.  I do not think I can take it any further than that at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume, therefore, that the Minister is like myself and does not know what it means either. As a matter of general principle it is wrong that this House should be passing things like this.  It is sheer gibberish, gobbledegook of the worst kind.  Why not put in a section in Africaans or Swahili?  We will not know what it means, but we do not know what this means either.  I am glad the Minister has said that if it can be expressed more intelligibly he will try to do it on the Report Stage.  I do not think a paragraph like this, the meaning of which the Minister does not know and nobody in the House knows, should be passed.  The courts ultimately will have to be called on to interpret what this means.  I do not think they will be able to do it either.  If they do, it will be a stab in the dark because it could mean any of many things.  I simply feel that when a draft of a Bill that contains things like section 27 (1) (b) comes up to a Minister it should be sent back by the Minister to the draftsman to be put in a way that is intelligible.  It is clear that the Minister is no wiser about it than I am.  We are all very foolish in passing something that we do not know the meaning of into law.  It defeats the whole purpose of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm, as the Minister says, that we dealt with a similar provision in two previous sections and it is true to say that in discussing them Deputy de Valera, the Minister and myself all found ourselves unable to make sense of a particular phrase which is repeated <Col N="437" /> here and has been referred to by Deputy O'Malley.  The Minister has undertaken to produce an amendment that will clarify it.  &ldquo;Clarify&rdquo; is perhaps the wrong word because at the moment it has no meaning.  I would certainly go along with the point of principle raised by Deputy O'Malley, but there is another matter of principle that I want to refer to.  I believe it is something we must say and cannot allow to pass.</P>
      <P>We have had an example on this section and we have had it earlier on other sections of the Minister telling us what way the Revenue Commissioners interpret the section and intend to operate it.  That is helpful, but what disturbs me is when I find that the Revenue Commissioners apparently intend to operate and interpret a section in a way which, on its face, the section does not allow them to do.  As an example there is this matter of the definition of &ldquo;qualifying assets&rdquo;.  It says specifically that they are assets of an individual which he had owned for the period of ten years ending with the disposal.  I know the Minister has said that he will have a look at this and amend it and I appreciate that.  That is not the point I am making.  The point I am making is that it is not the first occasion on this Bill on which the Minister has given the House the Revenue Commissioners' interpretation and intention as regards the operation of sections, an interpretation which is not on the face of it open to them.  I find this disturbing because it means that the Bill, as drafted, and, in particular, this part of this section, does not meet the requirements of the Revenue Commissioners and that they simply have to stretch it beyond what, on the face of it, they are entitled to do in order to do justice.  It is admirable that they should want to do justice, but they have to do it within the law and it is our function here to see that the law as passed is such as to enable them to do justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alternatively, it would seem that the Bill as drafted is not what was intended and that instead of, when this was discovered, the Bill being redrafted in these particular aspects, it <Col N="438" /> was simply circulated and brought in here and is being pushed on with although it is clear that in some respects it does not represent what was intended by the Revenue Commissioners. I find this process disturbing and I feel I must say so.  I do not want to denigrate in any way any public officials when I say this, and the ultimate responsibility is that of the Minister, but we must protest when we find a Bill being proceeded with which clearly is not drafted to do what the Minister says is intended to be done.</P>
    <P>It is of considerable value that the Minister intends to amend the Bill, and that is not what I am complaining about.  I welcome that.  What I am complaining about is that, on its face, it does not do what the Minister says it is intended to do.  It is true that on the passage of any Bill some problems may be discovered, some lack of clarity and indeed, as a result of a change of opinion by the Minister concerned, arising out of discussion, amendments may be needed.  That is as it should be, but that is not the position here.  I am raising the point now because this is by no means the first time it has happened on this Bill. The record will show that it has happened in a number of instances, including the one to which Deputy O'Malley has been referring.  I think that is the third time we have come across the particular phrase to which Deputy O'Malley was referring, which does not mean anything.  It may appear further on in the Bill too.  I do not think it is good enough that this Bill should come in here with provisions which do not represent what the Minister intends&mdash;I say &ldquo;the Minister intends&rdquo; because when he tells us that the Revenue Commissioners intend to operate in a particular way, it is to be taken that that is what his intention is.  Either that or they contain unintelligible paragraphs as indicated already by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <P>I really do not think that is good enough.  We have an obligation to protest when that happens.  Whoever is responsible down the line, the Minister is responsible to this House in the matter.  I want to protest at this <Col N="439" /> being done.  It is a slovenly way to do business, a way that can cost a great deal of money to taxpayers.  While no system is perfect and no individual is perfect and we will always have defects, the defects that are coming to light in this Bill are so frequent, so blatant that a protest in regard to the manner in which this Bill has been brought before us, without apparently being corrected, is called for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is typical of the Minister.  One of the reasons why all the finance legislation passed in the past few years is of such low quality is that it has been impossible to debate it properly in the House.  All the time one runs up against this kind of sneer, which has nothing to do with the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us put the section in perspective. When this capital gains tax was proposed in a White Paper on 28th February, 1974, private residences, businesses and all the rest of it were supposed to be included.  Special reliefs were subsequently brought in to cover a number of things as a result of the storm of protest which quite legitimately was raised after the publication of that White Paper.  One of the things that people are led to believe are free of capital gains tax is the disposal of a business or farm for £50,000 or less on retirement by somebody aged 55 years.  That is the general belief that has been put abroad by the White Paper and by the subsequent amendments to it.  This section which purports to put it into effect so far as disposal on retirement is concerned runs to nearly two pages. It starts off by taking the general <Col N="440" /> proposition and it then cuts down the general proposition in such a way that a vast number of people who at the moment believe that they will be entitled to this relief will in fact not get the relief.  That is what we are protesting about.</P>
    <P>Some of the phraseology that is used is, on everybody's admission, including the Minister's, unintelligible.  Nonetheless it is retained in the Bill.  We are asked to pass this section even though the section has two major defects as outlined by Deputy Colley, one, that part of it is unintelligible and not understood by the Minister or anyone else and, secondly, that a whole lot of people who think they qualify for relief and who the Minister intends should qualify for the relief will not get the relief because the drafting is different from the interpretation the Minister is trying to put on it.  It is not enough, as we pointed out <i>ad nauseam</i> for the Minister to say, &ldquo;we want it to mean X&rdquo; when in fact it is drafted in such a way as to mean Y.  It apparently is a matter of no concern to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to the relief contained in this section is that, at the very best, it is not very generous.  A man can dispose only of a comparatively small farm free of capital gains tax on his retirement after a long period in farming and unless he fulfils a lot of onerous conditions that are in the small print in this section that the general public do not know anything about, he loses even that small relief.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to the section must be coloured by the fact that we see in the section a whole lot of things that apparently were not intended but nonetheless are there and so far as we can see will be left there, not the least of which is a paragraph that I have referred to already and to which others have referred, which is totally unintelligible.  Presumably if the Revenue Commissioners knew what that paragraph means&mdash;section 26 (1) (b) &mdash;they would have informed the Minister what in their opinion it was supposed to mean and he presumably would have informed the House.  That has not happened.  The Minister agreed by implication that it is unintelligible <Col N="441" /> and he does not know what it means and it is left at that. One can only assume that the Revenue Commissioners also do not know what it means.  Presumably, the only person who does know is the draftsman.  In these circumstances the draftsman should be sent for in order that he might convey to the Revenue Commissioners what it means and they in turn might convey to the Minister who in turn might convey to the House what section 26 (1) (b) is supposed to mean.  That is the least that should be done for the House because we feel quite strongly as a matter of principle that it is an abuse of the legislative process to ask this or any other House to enact into law something that literally nobody knows the meaning of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28a:</P>
      <P>Before section 27 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a widow disposes of a farm or business which she acquired on the death of her husband, such disposal shall be free of capital gains tax, provided the consideration does not exceed £150,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that where a widow disposes of a farm or business which she acquired on the death of her husband, such disposal shall be free of capital gains tax, provided the consideration does not exceed £150,000. The position at the moment is that the acquisition by a widow of a farm or business on the death of her husband is free of capital gains tax.  It may be subject to other taxes but death is not regarded as a disposal for the purposes of this Bill.  A gift is, other than a gift to a wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases leaving a farm or a business to a wife is of value to her only if she is able to realise it.  In a great many cases she is not able to carry on the business or the farm.  She may be able to pass it on to her children if she has any and, if she does that, they are subject to capital gains tax.  She may have to sell it if she has no children, or if the children are too young, or if the children are <Col N="443" /> not interested.  As matters stand under this Bill, she is caught for capital gains tax if she sells the farm or business, or if she passes it on to her children.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>The selective examples given by the Minister and the Government in relation to thresholds for widows and children on the passing on of property so far as inheritance tax and gift tax are concerned, become meaningless when it is realised as is the case, that such transactions are, in fact, subject to capital gains tax at 26 per cent on the value of a gain.  In this instance, if a widow sells the farm which she got on the death of her husband, or if she passes it on to her children, liability immediately arises for capital gains tax on 26 per cent of the gain.  The gain could well be substantial. The gain might be a gain not in terms of an increase in real value as such, but simply a gain in terms of inflation, a purely paper gain which is of no value in real terms.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to confine this relief to smaller businesses and farms and, therefore, where the consideration or the value of the property exceeds £150,000 we would be less concerned about it because those people would be in a better position to meet the burden. They will have to meet a terribly heavy burden in regard to capital gains in this kind of situation.  They have been led to believe that there is a threshold of £150,000 in relation to these transactions within the family.  There is not.  Very much smaller transactions can be caught for capital gains tax and, in many cases, the amount people will be called upon to pay will be quite substantial.</P>
    <P>In the course of my own practice I have recently drawn the attention of people who were making family transfers to the fact that there is a likelihood of liability for capital gains tax. This has come as news to them all, and it has caused many problems for people the great majority of whom are not aware of the provisions of this Bill and of the fact that a great many people will be caught for quite substantial amounts of tax of which they now think they are free.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> Many people are still under the impression that it is in their interest on the transfer of a property such as a business or a farm to have it valued as low as possible by the Revenue Commissioners with a view to saving stamp duty, which was always the objective in these matters up to now.  The situation is quite otherwise now because, in many ways, the higher the valuation the more capital gains tax will be saved in the long run.  People do not realise this and many of them get themselves into a tremendous amount of difficulty due to the fact that the composite overall effect of these four new taxes has never been clearly explained.  People do not realise that although they appear on the face of it not to be liable for inheritance tax or gift tax, they may well be liable in quite a number of cases for capital gains tax and in certain cases also for wealth tax.</P>
    <P>This amendment would get over the situation in which considerable injustice would be felt by a widow either on the sale of the farm or business or on the transfer of it by her to her children.  She feels that if it is to be free of gift tax or inheritance tax it certainly should also be free of capital gains tax.  This is particularly so in the case of a voluntary transfer from a parent to a child where there is no money passing and where the possibility of ready cash being available to pay this very heavy new tax will be fairly remote; where resort will have to be had to the banks to raise overdrafts to pay capital gains tax, where there is not really a capital gain at all, where the paper gain may be due to inflation and where no cash passes and, as a result, no cash is available to make payment of the tax.</P>
    <P>To have a capital gains tax on such an internal family transaction as that, or on a sale by a widow who believes she is now free of all taxes up to £150,000, is quite wrong.  Such a situation should be covered.  It should be free from any possibility of liability for this tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 27 a widow aged 55 years who disposes of <Col N="445" /> a farm or family business to her children for £150,000 and the farm or family business has, between herself and her deceased husband, been in their ownership for ten years or more will be exempt from capital gains taxation on the transaction.  The proposed amendment seeks to go further than that and suggests there should be no conditions as to age or disposal to the family.  The only condition is widowhood.  The relief in section 27 is generous by any standard.  It is intended to encourage the keeping of fairly substantial farms and businesses within the family and to avoid their breaking up, which had to occur under the estate duty system.</P>
      <P>If the amendment were accepted it would be contrary to the social objectives of the Bill.  It would encourage the sale of property outside the family. There are no grounds either social or equitable for doing this.  I cannot accept that there is hardship in any person being asked to pay capital gains tax on the disposal of a farm or business outside the family for £150,000.</P>
      <P>Let us assume that such a sale takes place on a consideration of £150,000. There is a gain of £50,000 and in such event the capital gains tax would be £13,000 out of £150,000 leaving a net £137,000.</P>

In the case of smaller farms and businesses up to the value of £50,000, if the widow fulfils the conditions in section 26 as to age and duration of ownership, a disposal even outside the family would be free of capital gains tax.</P>

      <P>Over 55.  By any comparison with what operates in any other country which has capital gains taxes, and virtually every country now has capital gains taxes &mdash;and we are a disgrace to the world in this field&mdash;these exemptions and reliefs which we are giving are far more generous than what operates anywhere else.  I think that is significant. It is time we started to get our tax code in line with those that have been found to be appropriate in all the progressive and successful countries in the world.  There is no use arguing, as has so often been argued, that only countries which are wealthier than we are can afford such taxes.  They can, but so can countries which are poorer than we are.  Many of them have taxes far more severe than ours.  This is by any standard in relation to taxation of capital gains a Bill which is directed towards people of comparative wealth compared with the masses who have none at all. To say that a small tax on an element of gain in a very substantial sale is a hardship seems to me to be stretching the English language too far.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Since we started discussing capital taxation in relation to wealth tax, capital acquisitions and capital gains tax, we have heard Government speakers justifying their taxation on the basis of the large thresholds which are contained in it.  We have heard the Minister speak now of the generous reliefs he has given as between husband and wife and husband and sons and daughters, but the reality of the situation is that there is no exemption at all given in the case of the sale of a property where a widow has been left the property and finds herself with six or seven young children.  Is the Minister so far removed from reality that he does not know what is happening in the business would today?  Is he aware that you could have a transfer of property today, a property of any description &mdash;hardware, grocery, or public house &mdash;and this is happening every day in the week&mdash;where the widow has never participated in the running of that business and has no knowledge <Col N="447" /> at all as to how it should be run? She has these young children and down through the years it was the husband who solely ran the business.</P>
      <P>We find ourselves now in the situation that she is entitled to this exemption of the thresholds up to £150,000 but this widow is not capable of carrying on this business, due to her not having past experience and having a young family so that she is unable to devote her time to it.</P>
      <P>She can easily find herself in the situation in which she will have to dispose of this property and when she does&mdash;let it be for £50,000 up to £250,000&mdash;the valuation will be taken as of when the husband acquired the property.  If he acquired it in 1974 and she has to dispose of it in 1984, the valuation will be taken as of the date when the husband purchased that property.  Surely it is not realistic that the Minister should say that we are giving substantial reliefs in that case? The Revenue Commissioners will go back to the date when the property was originally purchased by the husband&mdash;let it be April, 1974&mdash;and they will assess the property ten and maybe 20 years later, in 1994, and she will have to pay capital gains tax on that property, on every penny of it except for a slight relief in respect of the children.  If the Minister boasts that there are concessions in the Bill and that he is generous as regards the thresholds he has written into the Bill, I cannot see them in a case such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that even if the Minister were to bring forward some amendment to close loopholes which may be in our amendment, it is a concession which he should grant, because the Minister has given the example of a business man or woman selling at £150,000 and the income this would return.  It may not always be the case that the sale will be for £150,000 but for £40,000, £50,000, or perhaps £70,000.  That widow would have to depend on that money to keep herself and her family going maybe for the next 20 or 30 years.  Many of her children may at the time be only three <Col N="448" /> or four years of age.  Quite often we see cases of husband dying at 45 or 50, leaving children ranging from three years to 12 years.  I can think of many businesses in which the wife does not participate actively from day to day and when the husband dies she is certainly not in a position to carry on that business.  I have seen widows having to dispose of their businesses and have seen other cases where widows held on to the businesses, which proved disastrous because they had no knowledge of the businesses. It would have been much better if such a widow had disposed of her holding when the husband died.  At least she would have something, but she continued to hold on to the property, having no knowledge of it, with the result that it was run down over a number of years and she had to dispose of it at a far lower value than she would have got if she had sold it after her husband died.  If the Minister tells me that there is not a case here for exemption for that widow, I believe there is very little of a social conscience in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister yesterday could point to several societies which would be exempt from capital gains tax in the pursuit of their business and if you look at section 23, you will see a number of societies and organisations which are exempt and which can pursue their normal business exempt from capital gains tax.  Any of the large unions can pursue their normal business&mdash;let it be real estate or any other type of business or dealings in property.</P>
    <P>Compare such organisations with a widow with five or six young children who is forced to dispose of her property shortly after the death of her husband and there is no justification for not exempting her.  If there is no justification for exempting that widow then my sense of equity is entirely different to the Minister's.</P>
    <P>A lot of people, having read this Bill and the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, were under the impression that these great exemptions existed, but they do not, and the proof of that is in this section.  The people have been <Col N="449" /> misled into thinking that these thresholds and exemptions exist and they heard many Government Deputies boasting about these exemptions.  The moment a person disposes of property outside the family circle the exemption vanishes. We are not looking for an exemption for a son if he is 25 years of age or over so that he can gamble it on the Continent or buy a yacht.  Deputy O'Malley and I are interested only in the widow.  There is every justification for exempting a widow with young children who is forced to dispose of her property.</P>
    <P>There is a greater case for an exemption of that property than exempting bodies such as trade unions who can freely deal in real estate.  The widow faces an additional problem in that the Revenue Commissioners will refer back to the time when the husband purchased the property. It is on that valuation that capital gains tax will be assessed. There is more merit in this amendment than a lot of the amendments discussed on this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are not asking for the exclusion of the son or daughter of 24 or 25 years of age because they would be capable of building up their own assets, but a widow who has contributed in some way to building up these assets in conjunction with her husband should be entitled to some concession when she is forced to dispose of the property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed to hear the Minister for Finance, in commenting on the contribution made by Deputy O'Malley, latching on to the figure of £150,000.  The Minister told us that if such a widow sold the property and paid the capital gains tax she could invest the balance and live joyously off the interest.  I felt the Minister was working up to a stage where he would suggest to Deputies O'Malley and Fitzpatrick that if they had mentioned a figure between £70,000 and £100,000 he might have considered that rational and worthy of consideration.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has cited many cases, and all Members could cite instances where widows with children are forced to <Col N="450" /> dispose of their property shortly after the death of their husbands.</P>
      <P>In some cases the business or farm was purchased for £20,000 four or five years ago but because the widow never took any part in the business she is forced to dispose of it.  This happens very often in the case of licensed premises which have inflated in value.  With the crucifixion by the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to prices such a woman would need to have served her time to the fullest extent in the licensed trade if she was to survive. Such a widow is pitched in at the deep end and because she has not had any experience she has only two alternatives, to find a replacement husband experienced in the licensed trade or dispose of the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estate agents value the property and at the same time the Revenue Commissioners wait to collect 26 per cent of the capital gain. That could amount to anything between £10,000 and £15,000 capital gains tax.  That is not what I read into the White Paper on the distribution of wealth.  The Minister has gone out of his way to tell us that we are backward in so far as we are the least taxed people in Europe.  He has told us that most modern progressive countries&mdash;it is very hard to find them now&mdash;have all these forms of taxation and has suggested that we in Opposition should not be the sticks-in-the-mud to prevent him keeping up with the rest of the world in the taxation of people.  The Minister introduced the figure of £150,000 into the Bill and takes credit for having given relief on that figure and that is the reason why the figure was chosen by my colleagues.  If this amendment is not accepted or if the Minister does not convey that he is willing to insert a similar type of amendment a widow in those circumstances will be put in an unfortunate position, on top of the fact that she has lost her partner in life.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, we are not fighting this battle for the gay son or daughter.  Fair enough, she may be a gay widow&mdash; we have no control over that&mdash;but this battle is not being fought for <Col N="451" /> somebody to go gadding all over the world, having sold out the place, to enjoy themselves.</P>
    <P>I had not intended participating in the debate on this issue were it not for the fact that the Minister decided to choose some sort of a figure of .1 short of £150,000, making the case that the Opposition amendment was simply and solely to make provision for some rich widow somewhere.  That is not the purpose of the amendment. Its purpose is a realistic one, making a very justifiable point.  From my point of view, I cannot see why the Minister should not take it far more seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I can see merit in this amendment.  It is obvious now that the propaganda put out about thresholds and exemptions is false and the reality is right here.  If a widow disposes of her property today, there is no threshold.  She may make up her mind about that.  The Minister will make no provision for her.  There is very little exemption here for the widow when it comes to the sale of her property.  With death duties at least a widow with four children was granted exemption on property up to £45,000.  There is no exemption here from capital gains, good, bad or indifferent.  It is most unfair that the Minister would not allow some concession for that type of case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one amendment the Minister should see his way to accept.  If he did not want to accept it, as drafted by us, he could have redrafted it to ensure that if a transaction took place only three or four years after her husband died, she should get some relief or allow the Revenue Commissioners a certain discretion in the matter.  As I see it, there will be hardship cases immediately this Bill goes on the Statute Books.  There will be widows who will be forced to sell their property. <Col N="452" /> I am convinced they are unaware of the position at present.  They think they are exempt but they will find themselves caught completely within this net regarding capital gains tax and will be assessed on the value of the property from the date on which the husband had purchased it. As far as that widow is concerned there is no longer any exemption; all the exemptions about which we read will not apply to her.  The Minister seems to disregard completely the plight of that section of the community. In effect, they already find themselves in this situation because the Bill is already in operation.  I know the amount of capital gains on any property sold in the past 12 months will not amount to much. But certainly in the case of any widow selling her property within the next 10 years, the value of such property will be assessed from April last and she need not look for the exemptions written into this Bill because they will not exist so far as she is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disappointing the Minister is not prepared to meet this point at all.  I understood him to say that section 26 relief was available to widows up to £50,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not, in the circumstances envisaged in this amendment, because it does not come within the definition of a qualifying asset which has been owned by the individual for a period of 10 years ending with the disposal.  It is no good to the widow if it is left to her and she has to sell.  She does not get the section 26 or section 27 relief.  She is in an impossible position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick has rightly pointed out, the whole country is full of widows, or potential widows, who believe that, on the death of their husbands, they will be all right up to £150,000.  Let us be clear that that is wrong.  The only thing about which they are all right is inheritance tax. But, you see, death duties have been replaced by four taxes.  People tend to forget that and think there is merely a <Col N="453" /> new thing called inheritance tax. There are four taxes and a widow in this situation is very badly caught.  It would not be impossible to work out a particular value, threshold, at which a widow will be paying more in capital gains tax than she is at present paying in death duties.  There is no doubt that there will be such instances and that people have been misled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed that out and it has not been denied by the Minister.  It is perfectly clear.  It is appalling that people were allowed to be so misled.  We make an effort now to rectify the situation, to save widows from a very heavy imposition of capital gains tax which, for the most part, they know nothing about.  But we are merely told it is fair that they should pay it.  We cannot accept that at all. The great majority of widows whose husbands had been farmers or businessmen are not in a position to carry on those farms or businesses.  Life is too complicated nowadays for the average widow, especially if she has a number of young children to look after, to be able to do that with any success at all.</P>
    <P>So far as section 27 is concerned, a widow who disposes to her children by way of gift is free of capital gains tax only provided she is over 55.  It will be the younger widows who will be hardest hit because they will be the people with the younger children. They will get no relief under this proposed section, in particular those who have to sell through no fault of their own.  What I would try to make clear to them today is the fact that a transaction under £150,000 means nothing because while one may not be liable to inheritance tax, one certainly will be liable in the great majority of cases to capital gains tax which will be imposed at 26 per cent on the capital gain.  And, as we all know, the capital gain may not be a real gain at all.  It is purely a paper gain as a result of inflation.</P>
    <P>Once again we would urge the Minister to accept this amendment and clarify what he and the Government have led the country to believe is the position.  That is all we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> As I said earlier, when dealing with family transfers, at present one brings to the attention of the people concerned the fact that there is liability to capital gains tax.  People tend to look blankly at one and ask: How can there possibly be?  There is no gain.  It is an internal family arrangement.  One has to point out to them that, nonetheless, the liability exists.  Then they ask: Did the Minister for Finance&mdash;although they generally use some other terminology with which to refer to him related to a particular East European colour&mdash;not say that all these sorts of duties and so on are gone, that there will be no liability to any kind of tax or duty now on transfers of this kind?  And one must reply: &ldquo;Yes, he said that all right but that is not true; you are liable if you make this transfer now to capital gains tax at 26 per cent on the nominal increase in value that has taken place as a result of inflation.&rdquo; People tend to look blankly at one.  I think some people thought I was telling them lies, that there could not be capital gains tax in this kind of situation.  We are trying to rectify the situation by means of this amendment.  Unfortunately our pleas are falling on deaf ears.  It is a pity the Minister will not take the opportunity to rectify the situation. Assuming this Bill is passed, I have no doubt that within a year another Bill will be brought in to amend it.  A flood of amendments will be made by the Minister because when people realise how this will affect them they will scream and roar and the Minister will have to give in to pressure.  There will be many protests from Fine Gael branches, as there were in relation to the wealth tax.  People do not realise that capital gains tax, a very substantial tax, will be payable on many transactions; it will be payable in areas which people did not envisage, and it will apply to situations where the Minister for Finance led them to believe it would not apply.  The provisions are here in the Bill.  We are trying to rectify them, particularly in relation to a widow who is forced to dispose of her husband's business or farm.  She is in the most vulnerable position because probably she has young children and cannot take over the business.  She thinks that because it is less than <Col N="455" /> £150,000 she is free of tax but unfortunately she is in for a rude awakening.  If this amendment were passed, she would not be in for that rude awakening.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Deputy O'Malley is under the impression that is not the case but we will accept the Minister's word.  I have referred to a widow of 55 years and in her case it is most likely that her family are provided for and possibly are married and living away from home.  However, a widow of 40 years who may have several young children will be subject to a capital gains tax of 26 per cent if she sells £50,000 of her husband's assets. There is an anomaly and an injustice here.  The younger woman is in need of all the help the State can give because she must provide for her young children and in this respect her case cannot be regarded in the same way as the widow of 55 years whose family have grown up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might suit the widow of 55 years to dispose of the property entirely at that point because she would be well able to live on her means.  However, the younger widow has a large part <Col N="456" /> of her life before her and has to care for her children.  When she is forced to sell the business, the Revenue Commissioners will investigate when her husband acquired it and they will assess the value from that date.  They will take into account the amount paid by her husband and she will have to pay capital gains on the entire amount in excess of the original price paid by her husband.  As Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, this cannot be regarded as a real gain because inflation has a major influence on the price.</P>
    <P>We are giving a concession to a widow of 55 years but we are depriving a younger woman, who must care for young children, of the same concession. There is an anomaly here that we should rectify.  I should like the Minister to clarify if a widow of 55 years will qualify under section 26. If that is the case something should be done for the widow of 40 years who has to dispose of the property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>The position is a lot better than at present where a widow might have to pay 55 per cent duty on an estate irrespective of whether she wished to stay on in the business. The reality is that most widows maintain the family business or farm so that their children may succeed to it and they will succeed to it, free of death duties.  If there is no disposal there are no capital gains.  If there is disposal a liability would arise on such an element of gain as would have occurred, but it is a great deal less than what is chargeable at present and people, whatever tax they have to pay, will be in a better position than those who have no property at all.</P>

      <P>What the Minister said in relation to section 26 is wrong. Deputy Fitzpatrick asked if the first £50,000 was free of tax and the Minister said it was.  It was an over simple way of putting the question and it was also an over simple way of answering it.  Section 26 (1) provides that if the consideration does not exceed £50,000, capital gains tax will not be chargeable on any capital gain made.  If, however, the consideration exceeds £50,000 capital gains tax is chargeable on the whole of the gain subject to a marginal relief which shall not exceed the difference between the actual consideration and £50,000.</P>
      <P>In other words, if the consideration is £100,000 and the taxable gain is £40,000, a widow aged 55 or over&mdash; she need not be a widow, any individual&mdash;who disposes of assets such as a business or farm on retirement and makes a capital gain of £40,000 will pay on the whole of that £40,000 at 26 per cent.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was given to believe by the Minister that the first half of that would be free of tax.  It will not, and I would like that to be clearly understood.  If I am wrong, no doubt the Minister will correct me, but I have read the section very carefully and I do not think I am wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that he asked was the first £50,000 free of tax because of section 26 and he then went on to give an example of a sale for £100,000.  What I am pointing out is that section 26 is worth only a fraction of what the Minister has led people to believe it is worth because, if the consideration is more than £50,000, the whole capital gain is taxable subject to the very minor marginal relief in subsection (1) (a) (2).  In the example I have given, if there is a sale by an individual aged 55 or over for £100,000, which contains a capital gain of £60,000, then that £60,000 less the first £500 is liable to capital gains tax at 26 per cent of £60,000 which amounts to a little over £15,000. People have been given the impression by the Minister that in some way the first £50,000 was free.  The great difficulty that has arisen is that the first £50,000 could not be free because the £50,000 referred to is not £50,000 of capital gain but £50,000 consideration.  The capital gain element could be only £5,000 or £10,000.</P>
      <P>This matter should be approached quite differently.  The reliefs should be given on capital gain rather than on consideration because consideration is totally misleading.  One could sell for £300,000 and still only make a capital gain of £5,000.  One could have acquired a business for £295,000 and sold it for £300,000, making a capital gain of £5,000.  References to consideration are meaningless, and that is why section 26 is useless and that is why Deputy Fitzpatrick and others have been given the wrong impression as to the meaning of it.  It does not mean what we have been led to believe it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> It means something quite different. Even in the case of an individual aged 55 or over, if the consideration is more than £50,000 in effect there is no relief at all and tax is payable on the whole capital gain.  It cannot be argued that it is not payable on the first £50,000 because that relates to consideration and you cannot apportion the element of gain in that, certainly not under the section.</P>
    <P>If the section were redrafted you could say that on a sale for £80,000, where there is a capital gain of £X, the first five-eights of that capital gain shall be free because it would be £50,000 over £80,000.  But that is not what the Minister has done.  The section says if the consideration is over £50,000 no relief is available except the very minor marginal relief in subparagraph (2).  It is, therefore, almost useless to anyone who falls into that category and Deputy Fitzpatrick, through no fault of his, was led into the mistaken belief that the element relating to the capital gain in the first £50,000 would be free of tax.  It is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 26, subsection (1), after line 59, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) In paragraph (a) &lsquo;children&rsquo;, in relation to a disposal, includes nephews and nieces who have worked substantially on a full-time basis for the period of 5 years ending with the disposal in carrying on, or assisting in the carrying on of, the trade, business or profession or the work of or connected with the office or employment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment gives effect to the proposal made by me when introducing the Second Stage that the relief afforded by section 27 to an individual disposing of his family farm or business up to a value of £150,000 to one or more of his children should be extended to include disposal to deserving nephews or nieces of the individual. The amendment provides that such disposals to nephews or nieces who have devoted their time to assisting in the running of the business or farm for a minimum number of five years prior to the disposal will benefit from the relief.</P>

Now that it has been introduced in relation to capital gains, I hope it will also be introduced in relation to gifts and inheritance taxes.  It would be illogical if it was not because while it is necessary here it is equally necessary in the case of the others.  We asked for this amendment and advocated it strongly. We are glad that the Minister has now brought it in and we trust that he will act similarly in relation to the other matters we discussed.

I would like the Minister to know that his meeting matters in this was is appreciated but, of course, we will argue with him as to where the line is to be drawn.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The same problem arises here as the one which I adverted to in relation to section 26.  It is that the relief which is given on a disposal to children or nephews or nieces working full time applies only when the consideration does not exceed £150,000 and there is a very small marginal relief above that. Many people have been under the <Col N="463" /> impression, and I must confess that I was on my original reading of these two sections, that there was relief on the first £150,000 if the consideration was more.  It transpires, on a more careful reading, that if the consideration is more than £150,000 in the case of this section and £50,000 in the case of the preceding section there is no relief other than the very minor marginal relief given.  This applies to a gift also.  In fact, it would normally be a gift under this section because it is to children or nephews or nieces.  If the value of the property that is given to the children is £175,000 and if that contains a gain element of £80,000, tax will be payable on £79,500 at 26 per cent.  The marginal relief will not apply because the tax will be higher than the difference in the consideration.  People do not realise that and it will be a very severe burden on people who do not realise that they will be subject to a burden at all.</P>
      <P>Assuming that there is a gain element of £80,000, as I postulated, the tax is 26 per cent which is almost £21,000 and there is no relief at all for the first £150,000.  Many people on reading these two sections originally thought the gain element in the consideration for the first £50,000 in section 26 and the first £150,000 in section 27 were going to be free.  They are not, apart from the minor marginal relief given in subparagraph (ii).</P>
      <P>Exactly the same arguments apply as those which I put forward in relation to the previous section except that in this case, perhaps, the injustice is greater because this is not a question of a sale outside the family in which cash is actually obtained. This is a question of giving a gift to a child or to a nephew who has been working full-time with you for five years and there is no cash passing normally in that kind of transaction. It is an outright gift.  There may be reservations of rights of residence or support but there is no actual cash passing.  The diffculty in paying the capital gains tax, therefore, will be all the greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> I would urge on the Minister that he should on Report Stage either accept whatever amendment we might put down or preferably that he should put down an amendment which would have the effect of relieving from liability to capital gains tax the proportion of the capital gain which is equivalent to the ratio which £150,000 bears to the total consideration or value.  In other words, if the total consideration or value were £180,000, 15/18ths of the capital gain should be exempt&mdash;at the moment 0/18ths is exempt in that particular example&mdash;if the consideration or value were only £150,000 18/18ths would be exempt.  When you get to a certain threshold, suddenly you are down into the abyss and from having had an exemption up to a reasonably high point from capital gains tax you suddenly go over the precipice and are into an abyss which could destroy a family because they will not be able to raise the amount of money that is involved.</P>
    <P>The problem can be met, I suggest, and I think the Minister agrees with me, by allowing exemption from capital gains on the gain element in the total transaction in the proportion which £150,000 bears to the total consideration.  That is fair.  That is doing what I venture to think was the original intention until the draftsman got at the original intention and made it into something else, which I am afraid we may not have spotted up to recently.  It shows the value of taking these matters slowly.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot have spotted it either.  I think the Minister was under the impression that the position was that the gain element in the first £50,000 in section 26 and the first £150,000 in section 27 was free.  It was important, as I said earlier, in section 26.  It is much more so in section 27 because there is no money passing in the normal way on section 27.  Therefore, there is no cash available to pay the tax and in the kind of example I gave there would be tax of over £20,000 payable in circumstances where the people might have expected to pay £1,000 or £2,000.  The £20,000 odd payable in capital gains <Col N="465" /> tax will be additional to the 6 per cent stamp duty which will be payable. People often leave these matters out of consideration.  There will be 6 per cent stamp duty, 26 per cent capital gains on the gain and the certainty in that instance that gift tax will be payable at varying rates and the likelihood of wealth tax being payable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A few examples will, I hope, help to show the justice of what is proposed.  I want to emphasise that I have never asserted, and if I mistakenly misled the House I have already expressed my regret for doing so&mdash;that I was under any impression or that I was proposing that the £50,000 and the £150,000 should stand out on their own without being available to everybody.  I am not suggesting that.  The marginal relief is deliberately provided so that people who are above these thresholds will not find themselves left in a worse net position than if they were below them.</P>
      <P>Here are three examples which will indicate the operation of section 27: sale to a family at £150,000; cost, £50,000&mdash;gain, £100,000.  Were it not for the exemption provided in section 27 there would be a tax of £26,000 on such disposal to a family but the effect of section 27 will be to remove all liability to tax on that disposal to the family of £150,000.  That is not small fry, even accepting the way property has increased.</P>
      <P>The second example: disposal at £180,000 to a family: cost £60,000&mdash; gain, £120,000.  The tax there without any exemption would be £31,200. There will be relief which is calculated in the following manner: taking the disposal value of £180,000, deducting from that the threshold of £150,000, leaving £30,000.  The maximum tax is half of this, £15,000, instead of being £31,200 and £15,000 on £180,000 disposal is not atrocious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a disposal of that kind there would be very little element, if, indeed, there would be any at all, of inheritance tax.  There would not be an inheritance tax in the first case I mentioned of £150,000.  Obviously, if the property was disposed of to more than one at £180,000 there would be no element of inheritance at all.  I <Col N="466" /> want as far as possible to keep away from discussion of other taxes so that we can concentrate on these particular ones.</P>
    <P>The third example&mdash;take disposal of property valued £200,000 which cost £100,000&mdash;gain, £100,000.  The appropriate tax on that without exemption would be £26,000 but the difference between the threshold and the disposal value would be £50,000. Half of that would be £25,000.  So, there would, in fact, be a reduction even in that case which would make the tax £25,000.</P>
    <P>So that the marginal relief is scaled in such a way that it gives most relief at the lower ranges and as the disposal value gets greater and the gain is considerable, then the relief becomes less effective.  That is fair.  It is open to argument, as Deputy de Valera said, as to whether it should be more or less, or graded in a different way, horizontally or vertically. We will probably never cease to argue on that basis no matter who is in Government and who is in Opposition. There will always be people who will be just on the other side of the dividing line.  It is a fair effort to strike at marginal relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect which was dealt with by Deputy Fitzpatrick on the last section is the question of the individual having to attain the age of 55 years.  That may be fair enough from the point of view of an individual businessman or farmer, but we gave an example on <Col N="467" /> the amendment which was defeated of the widow below the age of 55 years having to pass on property or dispose of it in some way&mdash;in this section it would be just passing it on to one of her children or a nephew or niece.  Does the Minister not agree that the younger the widow the greater the hardship to her and the greater the difficulty?  In those circumstances, would he not agree to take out the words &ldquo;who has attained the age of 55 years&rdquo; at least so far as widows are concerned?</P>
      <P>The older the widow gets the older her children will be, and the better prepared for life and for their various careers.  They will probably be set up in their careers.  The younger she is the more vulnerable she is, and the more difficulty she has in running a farm or a business the more anxious she is to dispose of it.  Is it not creating additional difficulties for the widow whose problems are greater, and creating less difficulties for the widow whose problems are less?  Could that phrase &ldquo;who has attained the age of 55 years&rdquo; be expressed not to apply to widows?  A widow of 53 years of age may well have children in their mid-thirties who are well fitted to take over a farm or a business but, if she gives it to them, there is no relief. She may be giving it to them for nothing but they will have to pay capital gains tax on the entirety of the capital gain.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to make is a repetition of what I said about one of the earlier sections and which Deputy Colley said about several of them.  In subsection (1) (b) we have the same meaningless phrase again. We are enacting this several times in the course of the Bill.  I do not know what it means.  Could the Minister try to find out for us what it is supposed to mean?  Could he ask the draftsman or the Revenue Commissioners or somebody who knows?  Presumably somebody must know at least what was intended by it.  I know it means nothing and therefore the Minister cannot explain what it means.  Could he explain to us what it was intended by somebody to mean?</P>

      <P>I dealt with that on section 26.  I really cannot add anything to what I have already said except to say that the age of 55 years is unusually young for special consideration in relation to retirement.  It is 65 years of age across the water. While not wanting to oblige any widow to remain in a business or farm which her husband had prior to his death, in the generality of cases the widows are only too happy to retain the business or farm, not only because of the prospect it gives them of an assured income but also in anticipation that some of their children will succeed to the business or farm.  In such a case a disposal does not arise and therefore the liability to capital gains tax does not arise either.  We are dealing with cases which would be few and far between if they occur at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I agree with what Deputy O'Malley said about the age of 55 years.  A farmer may wish to transfer his farm to his son and it is very easy for him to have a son or daughter of 30 years of age when he is 55 years of age.  Quite often sons get married today at 21 years of age.  A man aged 44 or 45 years who owns a business could have a son or a daughter of 21 or 24 years of age.  This provision will affect the transfer of property.  Because a person has not attained the age of 55 years he will not qualify for the threshold contained in the section of £150,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see where any abuse would lie if a man transferred his property at 50 or 45 years of age.  I do not think this is a good section.  I am not sure that it will operate to the benefit of the country at large.  You should be able to transfer your assets at a reasonably young age.  People are now getting married much younger than they did <Col N="469" /> 20 years ago, or even five or six years ago.  I would say that the average today is 25 years.  If I am reading the section right, inserting &ldquo;who has attained the age of 55 years&rdquo; will be a disadvantage to a family.  They will not be able to transfer their assets when their children want to settle down and get married.  I think this is a bad section.  Maybe I am wrong.  I hope I am wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the questions I am about to ask will not indicate too clearly that I was not in the Chamber to hear some of the earlier remarks on the concatenation of sections. I do not want to put the Minister to the unnecessary trouble of repeating anything he has said.  I realise that he has had a pretty gruelling time.  Taking this section on its own and following up the points made by my colleagues here, what is the purpose of having this age qualification in this section at all, if you look at it from a policy point of view?  If this question has been answered already by the Minister when I was not here, the Minister's reply to that affect will amply satisfy me, but perhaps I might be allowed to make my point on the section all the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading the section, the purpose of it is to ensure that a family or farm can, so to speak, remain viable within the family.  I think that is the social purpose of the section, and if that is the purpose of the section, having regard to its provisions, why is an age necessary?  If it were a transfer above on the tree of inheritance.  I could possibly see a reason, but this is tightly confined to a disposal to children, and so tightly confined indeed is it that the Minister found it necessary to bring in an amendment to meet the cases of what I might briefly describe as deserving nephews and nieces.  If this is the policy of the section, I wonder what is the point when you cannot go back up the tree again.  I freely concede to the Minister that if the relationship were such that I could transfer to a son or daughter and then have it transferred back to me at a later date, there is a great need for an age qualification but it is going to be a one-time disposal. It may not be disposed back and get the benefit of the section.  If this is so <Col N="470" /> why have the age of 55?  What difference does that age make?</P>
    <P>This is Deputy O'Malley's first point and he was going a long way in concession, unless I completely misstated the point, in asking for the special provision for a widow, which I think is a separate thing and should be considered. I am not to be taken as in any way complicating the argument in favour of the widow, but taking my colleague's point on the age of 40 or 45, I ask myself the question: why 55 and not 45?  Deputy Fitzpatrick made the point about the son and there may be urgent reasons for doing something of this nature.  The policy of the section, taking the extended meaning of the word and making the point again that the section is so tight that the Minister found it necessary to bring in the very proper amendment which he brought in to meet his original intention&mdash;that is a proof that the section is extremely tight&mdash;you can have this kind of situation which Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned.</P>
    <P>A man of 45 has a farm or a business. He has a son and the crisis arises. I will go a little further than 45 and take 47 or 50.  There is a boy in his early twenties who wants to make up his mind as to where he is going and the father has to face the difficult problem of how he is to ensure that the boy is going to take on, because, the boy has to be sure of his own future too.  In that case the only practical way to achieve the social intention of the section is for the man to dispose of it, and why therefore should there be a difference in that case from the case of the parent who has reached the age of 55?  That reinforces Deputy Fitzpatrick's point.  I do not want to tire the Minister on this.  I realise that he has had a gruelling time and I do not wish to delay the debate, but I am at a loss as to the reason for an age qualification at all in the section, but there may be good reasons for it.  We all know that the Minister and his advisers do not put provisions in a Bill just for the fun of it.  There is usually a good reason, but sometimes these reasons may be so much for the sake of greater caution that they are unnecessary or even embarrassing.  I <Col N="471" /> am not quite sure whether I have made a really intelligent point on this but I would like to make it in that way.  If the answer has been given, I do not expect a repeat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question has not been posed as specifically as the Deputy has posed it.  I refer to the White Paper on Capital Taxation published February 1974 where the thinking behind the section is set out and where we deal with possible exemptions and reliefs for sales within the family of farms and family businesses on retirement.  That is the element.  Quoting from the White Paper:</P>
      <P>In order not to place any obstacle in the way of transfers of farms or buildings within the family provision could be made that the disposal of farms and family businesses for a consideration of up to, say, £150,000 would not attract liability to tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea is to deal with a situation which is not at all abnormal, which is quite usual of people who coming to the autumn of their years are concerned with the disposal of property within the family.  The likelihood of that happening is, I think, less the younger the parent.  The case has been put&mdash;if somebody feels like doing it at 45, why would they not get the same concession?  We are dealing with the normal run of cases&mdash;I should say the almost abnormal run of cases&mdash;to choose, 55 which in Irish circumstances is abnormally young and to bring it in at this level may be an encouragement to people to use it.  It is also, incidentally, applicable but uniquely this year for the first time in relation to the EEC farm retirement scheme of 55 and also the chosen year to encourage people to avail of the EEC scheme, but it is basically a scheme to facilitate people in the normal age or expectation or operation of retirement, and to ensure that if they are receiving cash, as they may in certain cases receive cash for what they are disposing of, that that cash which they will presumably be putting aside for the <Col N="472" /> purpose of purchasing an annuity or some investment to give them an income will not be touched unfairly by the capital gains tax.  That is the thinking behind it and I suggest that by coming to 55 years of age it is a movement in the right direction.  We shall see how it operates in practice and I am not saying it will be the last word.  Maybe the time will come when we will consider that gifts can be given by parents at any age to children without having any capital gains tax involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the referendum to which the Deputy refers and of its result.  I think it might be useful if I outlined some of the recent history of the proposal to site a welfare home in Clonmel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 15th February, 1974, the SouthEastern Health Board made a proposal to my Department to demolish the building, which contained the domestic economy school in Clonmel, and to build a welfare home on the cleared site.  While this proposal was being considered in my Department, another site became available at Gallows Hill, approximately a quarter of a mile away.  This latter site had recently been purchased by Clonmel Corporation, who were prepared to <Col N="474" /> make part of it available to the health board as a site for a welfare home.</P>
    <P>My Department had doubts about the suitability of the Morton Street site for a welfare home, and when the site at Gallows Hill became available, I asked them to prepare reports for me on the suitability of both sites.</P>
    <P>The medical, architectural and administrative officers from my Department who inspected both sites opted firmly in favour of that at Gallows Hill.  They did it for two main reasons.</P>
    <P>In the first place, they felt this site is environmentally far more suitable for a welfare home.  It is on open and pleasant grounds, proposed for development as an amenity area.  It is less than a quarter of a mile from the Morton Street site and environmentally far more attractive, in their view.  Their report described the Morton Street site as &ldquo;locked-in&rdquo;, with poor environmental amenities, and surrounded by a laundry, car-park and national school.</P>
    <P>Secondly, their advice to me was that the cost of providing a welfare home at Gallows Hill would be considerably less expensive than at Morton Street.  They estimated that the difference in cost would be of the order of £23,000.  I accepted their advice, and in June, 1974, indicated my approval of the Gallows Hill site to the health board.  I did so on the grounds of the environmental suitability of the site and of cost.  Since that date I have received a deputation from the health board and have received the result of the referendum to which the Deputy refers.  Both indicate that there are some people in Clonmel who wish me to reconsider my decision.</P>
    <P>If it were only a question of the environmental suitability of the site, I could consider changing my decision in deference to the wishes of the health board.  However, the additional cost of building at Morton Street was estimated at £23,000 in June, 1974, when my decision was made.  I am now informed that the difference in cost could have increased to approximately £31,000.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have a responsibility to safeguard public funds <Col N="475" /> and to make the most efficient use of the financial resources available to me. I think he will agree that I would not be fulfilling that responsibility were I to approve a proposal to build a welfare home in Morton Street, when a similar home can be built for an estimated £31,000 less, within a quarter of a mile at Gallows Hill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated there were some people in Clonmel who did not agree with his decision but is he aware that at a public meeting the Morton Street site was approved by 600 votes to 9 votes?  In the referendum almost three to one were in favour of the Morton Street site.  Does the Minister realise the huge number of people in favour of the Morton Street site?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise there are quite a number of people in favour of the Morton Street site but as far as the referendum is concerned&mdash;I do not deny the right of the people of Clonmel to carry out such a referendum&mdash;there was a 35 per cent turn out.  Therefore, it does not appear to me that a majority of the people want it.  I may be wrong in that but my main consideration was that to develop the Morton Street site would cost another £31,000 and that is no mean figure.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is the percentage of those who cared about the siting of the welfare home at any stage who were in favour of Morton Street?

Is the Minister aware that the Morton Street site is convenient to churches, the main shopping area, public houses and booking offices, amenities which are not available at the Gallows Hill site?  Is the Minister further aware that the Gallows Hill site would mean that the old people would have to cross the main Waterford-Limerick intersection and that it is just beside a new shopping complex? It would create a tremendous traffic hazard for these people.</P>

I gather that the distance is 394 yards and that the amenities and environment are far better.  It is my view, that of the architect, engineer and medical officer that it is a better site.  I have seen the Morton Street site and if I were a patient in a welfare home I would prefer it to be on Gallows Hill.  The Deputy must have regard to the fact that £31,000 is quite an amount of money and that the Southern Health Board could make quite a lot of use of it if it was at their disposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other health boards, the provision of funds in 1975 for capital projects for the North-Eastern Health Board was reviewed some time ago in the light of the overall capital allocation for hospitals, the amount required to provide for existing inescapable commitments and other relevant factors. As a result, the board was informed that it would not be possible <Col N="478" /> to allocate funds for the commencement of the welfare home at Monaghan during the current year. The matter is being kept under continuous review and when further funds become available the question of proceeding with a welfare home for the Monaghan area will be considered after consultation with the health board as to its priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the dire need for the provision of these welfare homes?  Would he not agree that a delay of even six months would add at least 10 per cent to the cost of building these homes?  Could he give the House an assurance that he will give this top priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of my being the absolute so far as priorities are concerned.  These are determined by the health board.  There is no question of abandoning the project whatsoever.  All I am saying to Deputy Leonard is that it will be considered within the capital allocation for 1976.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently extended the prescribed list of long-term diseases and disabilities in respect of which drugs, medicines and appliances are provided free of charge. While this scheme will continue to be <Col N="479" /> reviewed from time to time, I do not propose to extend it further in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has great sympathy for these patients.  I hope he realises that the appliances that those patients use cost them a considerable amount of money. I should be most grateful if he would consider them in the list, as prescribed for allowance in respect of their appliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy, I did extend a long list by about four within the last three or four months.  I have the utmost sympathy with these people but it goes beyond my sympathy because last year I allocated a grant of £5,000 to the Ileostomy Association of Ireland which of course, will be continued.  As far as out-patient and in-patient services are concerned, those in the lower and middle income groups will have these facilities free.  As far as appliances are concerned, again the maximum cost per calendar month need not exceed £4.  I appreciate that there are other expenses in respect of things that would not be regarded as medicines and appliances.  But, with others, I shall certainly be considering the extension of aid in respect of long-term illnesses. There have been very many requests to have certain illnesses included.  I will try, as far as I can, to have them extended to deserving people who find it very difficult to pay for special treatment, particularly in the case of long and chronic illnesses.</P>

Is the Minister aware of the continued representations I have made in particular with respect to the unusual, painful and unpleasant disease of ileostomy? Secondly is he aware of the dedicated voluntary work done by a small group of people, in particular a doctor in regard to these two questions and will the Minister treat Deputy McEllistrim's question as a matter of extreme urgency?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with every aspect of health.  I am mindful <Col N="480" /> of the representations made to me by Deputy Thornley.  I do appreciate there is much voluntary work done in this respect.  I might say I have had private approaches from other Deputies in the House as well who are very concerned about this particular ailment.  I am aware that in the Central Remedial Clinic there are lessons given to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from the appliances which these people need.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>My responsibility and that of the Eastern Health Board is to provide medical practitioners for those who hold medical cards.  It is not my responsibility, as far as I am aware, to ensure that there would be a general practitioner available for those who would not be in that group.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said in the reply that there has been no complaint and there seems to be adequate coverage for those in receipt of medical cards. If the Deputy could give me a little more information, either now or privately, certainly I will have the matter investigated.  It appears to me that what the Deputy is concerned about is a private practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very rural area.  There are no telephones in the area.  They tried to get some telephone <Col N="481" /> kiosks and as a result of this they have experienced considerable difficulty. Would the Minister arrange to have a deputation met by some of his officials in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what use could come of such a deputation. I am not adverse to receiving deputations or to asking my officials to receive them, but I do not see what I or any of my officials can do to induce any private practitioner to go to a certain area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must have some responsibility as regards the welfare of the people seeking medical services?  Surely there must be some responsibility somewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is but that is the concern and responsibility of the health board.  My responsibility is to ensure that those who come under the GMS scheme are provided for.  I do not know whether the Deputy can verify this but they are being catered for.  I cannot tell a doctor in private practice that he must go here, there or anywhere else.  He will go where he finds it attractive.  The attraction of the GMS scheme is the size of population and the potential income.  I do not want to put the Deputy off but it seems to me that the professional associations might be approached rather than the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the local community association who were in touch with me.  Perhaps if I arranged for them to telephone the Minister's office or his private secretary, something could be arranged that would afford them some hope of doing something. It is a sad situation that in an area very close to Dublin people are unable to get the services of a doctor when required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned made a claim for unemployment benefit on 6th May, 1974.  The claim was disallowed by a deciding officer on the ground that the statutory condition for receipt of unemployment benefit which requires a claimant to be available for employment was not satisfied.  The decision of the deciding officer was upheld by an appeals officer after an oral hearing at which the claimant attended and gave evidence. A further claim for unemployment benefit was made in 7th March, 1975, and this claim was also disallowed by a deciding officer on the same ground.  The claimant was notified of the decision and of her right of appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

I am not sure of the exact details but I understand that where it is not possible to give an electricity supply a scheme is operated by the Minister for Transport and Power and that a grant is available.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary believes there have been substantial increases, and that is a matter for himself, but a maternity grant of £4 is so small it might as well not be available.  Is it the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary to increase that grant by at least 100 per cent as an act of faith if nothing else and of recognition of the fact that we are living in very difficult times?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment assistance is being paid to the person named at the rate to which he is entitled.  This rate represents the difference between the rate of means assessed against him and the maximum rate of unemployment assistance which could be paid in his case from 2nd April, 1975.  The applicant's rate of means, which represents the value of free board and lodgings, was determined, on appeal, by an appeals officer whose decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider it just or fair to assess means of £5 a week in the case of this man just because his father is providing him with a bed and meals?  I am sure most people will agree there is a moral duty on families to look after one another but there is no legal duty on the parent in this particular case to provide board and lodging for this man and would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider it utterly unjust that means to the extent of £5 per week should be assessed against this man on these grounds?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that this man applied for a qualification certificate in February, 1972, when the Deputy was a supporter of the then Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> Under the assessment of means at that time he was disallowed completely and were it not for the changes in the 1973 and 1974 budgets this man would not have received any benefit whatsoever. How the Deputy can imply that the situation has worsened and that this type of assessment is being applied only by this Government defeats me. The fact is that when this claimant applied in February, 1972, he was totally disallowed.  He is now in receipt of some benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that, after two years, it is time he and his colleagues gave up talking about what happened two, three or five years ago? Has there been a change in the assessment of means in this type of case?  If there has been I am not aware of it.  I heard of no change in this type of assessment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy is aware that one could not qualify at all if, on that particular basis of assessment, one had an income in excess of £26 a year.  That was the position in February, 1972.  That figure of 10/- a week, equal to 50 pence per week now, has gone up to £6 a week in two years.  That is a very substantial change.</P>

      <P>I can give the Deputy some further information.  The original means of assessment was £7.35 a week and this was reduced to £5 a week. The applicant is now in receipt of a pension for which he would never have qualified&mdash;in fact he did not qualify&mdash; under the previous Administration's method of assessment and it is only because of the provisions of the 1973 and 1974 budgets that this man is eligible for any pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>I should point out that pensions, contributory or non-contributory, are not awarded on a joint entitlement basis.  A husband and wife may each have independent entitlement to pension and each will then hold a separate pension book.  In the event of the death of one or the other, the survivor continues to receive his or her pension without interruption.  If the husband dies, the widow as a result of the improvements introduced into the schemes in July, 1974, can obtain, in addition, payment of his pension for a period of six weeks after his death.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may have in mind the case of a wife who is not receiving pension independently from my Department but whose husband is receiving a contributory or non-contributory pension, including an increase of pension in respect of her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> The increase payable is, however, an integral part of his pension.  In the event of her husband's death she may similarly receive payment of his pension, including the increase payable in respect of herself for the six weeks after his death, by notifying my Department of the date of his death and returning at the same time any pension book or books issued to him.  Payment is made by the re-issue to her of her husband's pension book or books containing pay orders for the six week period after his death together with an authorisation enabling her to cash the pension orders at a post office.  Initial steps are taken at the same time for the award to her of a widow's pension to come into payment in the seventh week after her husband's death.  The procedure is a substantial improvement on the previous position and is working satisfactorily.  I do not envisage the need for any alteration to it.</P>
    <P>Free travel passes are now issued to all eligible persons who apply for them.  Accordingly, if a widow has reached or was over pension age at the time of her husband's death she should already have her own free travel pass and will not consequently suffer any deprival of the free travel facilities.  If she has not reached pension age she is not yet entitled to the facilities.</P>
    <P>Statistics are not kept in my Department of the length of time taken in each case for the re-issue to a widow of her deceased husband's pension book or books with an authorisation enabling her to receive payment of pension for the period of six weeks after his death.  I cannot accordingly supply the information requested by the Deputy but I can say that pension books in those cases are normally re-issued within two days of their receipt in my Department.</P>

      <P>I am not terribly interested in fast troop movement but I am very interested in the helicopter service.  The position is that it takes three years to train maintenance staff for new helicopters.  Therefore, next week I will be in Paris to look at possible replacements for the French Alouette, which is an excellent helicopter.  That will not be a fast decision as it is tied up with fishery protection and many other things.  I will be in Paris to look at those helicopters next week with the <Col N="502" /> head of the Air Corps and Colonel O'Connor.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of showjumpers at present in the Army Equitation School is eighteen.  The number of horses maintained in the school during the past <Col N="503" /> 12 months varied from time to time but a reasonable approximation of the average figure would be 75 made up as follows:&mdash; Property of the Department of Defence, 64; on loan from Bord na gCapall, 1&mdash;Lough Sheelin, which won the Strokestown Car; on loan from a private individual, 2&mdash;Sir John Galvin; property of Bord na gCapall (maintained on a repayment basis), 8.</P>
    <P>Two horses were also maintained for short periods while undergoing trials in the context of their being offered for sale to the Department. As neither horse was bought by the Department, I consider that it would be inexpedient to give the names of the owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indebted to Deputy Coughlan who said in his contribution on the Estimate that we were selling the cream and keeping the skim.  My answer to that is quite simple.  What we should do is sell some of the cream and get good money for it for Irish farmers.  We should keep some of the cream and we should let the skim look after itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The operative words are &ldquo;some of&rdquo;.  The position is that there are, say, ten millionaires in Britain and there is a man in Europe who has 60 showjumpers and I have found, as a rough figure, that the cost <Col N="504" /> of maintaining a horse in McKee Barracks is £4,000 per year.  One can advertise a bottle of stout by a label but one cannot advertise the Irish horse.  There must be somebody around the place who produces a good stable.  That is being done by the Army and that is it.  We do that but, of course, we do it not on the basis of keeping all the cream.  We do it on the basis of keeping some of the cream and selling some because we want money as well and I hope the Opposition do not mind that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy is quite incorrect.  What I said is that the policy is to keep some of the cream and to get all the money we can for the Irish farmer for the rest of the cream and to have the Irish jumping <Col N="505" /> team the way it was before the people opposite made a hash of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not mean that.  The Minister is quite clear in his mind that the amount of money provided in the Estimates over the last two years was sufficient and the best horses were bought.  There is £60,000 in the Estimate this year and I think that is quite sufficient.  We are only topping up now.  We had to make the capital expenditure when Fianna Fáil were degrading the Irish jumping team and were, in fact, getting rid of it and were at the point of wiping it out completely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer it myself.  I have not got the Departmental answer.  I do agree it is worrying that there was not immediate bomb disposal availability in Limerick on the occasion.  In June, that is, next month, we will have, I think, six bomb disposal officers ending their course.  We cannot send a person in to defuse a bomb unless he is a skilled officer who has done his course and it is quite difficult.  There is no question of difficulty about money, no question of difficulty about equipment.  The difficulty is to have the top officer available on the job.  We will have either five or six available in June and then we will be able to cover the <Col N="508" /> country a bit better but it is 24 hours a day, seven days a week and there is Limerick, Galway, Cork, Dublin and all the other places all along the Border.  I want to assure Deputy O'Malley that his question to me is a help because it indicates the problem as it is.  I would hope that within three to four months we will be better off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very unsatisfactory reply because civil servants got the pay increase and there was arbitration and the same rates of pay were to be paid to Army captains and commandants and it was not given to them.

      <P>The Deputy will realise that my best efforts will be made to look after the Army and to see that the best possible increases in pay in relation to the public service are provided for the Army.  At this point in time&mdash;and I emphasise at this point in time&mdash;up to the rank of commandant we have got through and the question of NCOs and men is with the Department of the Public Service and we are trying to work out rates.  It is not a question of saying, &ldquo;OK, we will make 5p, 10p.&rdquo; It is quite difficult to get a comparison when there are different terms of service and different numbers of years of service involved.  The House may be assured that as far as I and the Government are concerned the NCOs and men will get the very best we can give them.

    <Title>Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Bill, 1975: - Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where incapacity for work or unemployment is continuous a person shall be retrospectively entitled to pay-related benefit from the end of the 159 days up to the commencement of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Andrews.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of my short contribution last Wednesday evening I asked was there a respective element in the section and <Col N="515" /> the Parliamentary Secretary said, I am glad to say, that the effects of the delay in the passage of this Bill have been minimised to a very great extent by this provision. But if there is to be a continued attempt to delay the passage of the Bill some people will undoubtedly be affected.</P>
      <P>We put down this amendment, which we consider to be a reasonable amendment, arising out of allegations which the Parliamentary Secretary made on a previous occasion.  He said that quite a large number of people would be affected by the alleged delay on the part of the Opposition.  Now we discover that the so-called delay will have a minimal effect.  Our amendment will do away with all the effects of the so-called delay.</P>
      <P>No one will be affected by a continuing debate on this Bill if the Parliamentary Secretary accepts the amendment and nobody will be excluded from the provisions of section 4.  Our amendment would take effect during the period between the ending of the 159 days and the beginning of the operation of this Bill when it is enacted.  This side of the House would be willing to allow the Bill to go through the House straight away if the Parliamentary Secretary would undertake to introduce an amendment in the Seanad which would have the same effect as this amendment.</P>
      <P>If he feels that in some way the amendment is legislatively impure there is no reason why he with the full backing of the civil service and all the various draftsmen at his disposal should not make it legislatively pure.  I drafted the amendment myself. I did not pretend to have the knowledge of a draftsman.  I said that with all the humility a politican can have at his disposal.  Whether or not humility in a politican is a good thing is a matter for another day's debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appreciate it if the Parliamentary Secretary would state how many people would suffer hardship if he continues to allege that the Opposition have delayed the Bill in <Col N="516" /> any way.  The Parliamentary Secretary must concede that the purpose of my amendment is to deal with the allegation of delay and to bring the Bill into the area of retrospection. This is a reasonable request.  The Parliamentary Secretary being, no doubt, a reasonable man 99 per cent of the time will, I am sure, accede to this request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Andrews' amendment.  It was tabled due to a sense of justice.  A person affected by the Bill has enough problems without having to worry about whether he is qualified.  Deputy Andrews' straightforward amendment would remove some of those worries.  It is the desire of the Parliamentary Secretary to remove any doubts or complications or difficulties from legislation.  In a small pamphlet he issued on the pay-related scheme he said social insurance legislation runs to hundreds of pages, most of it is complicated and naturally written in legal language. This difficulty is recognised by the Parliamentary Secretary and by the Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews' amendment is so straightforward and so justified that the Parliamentary Secretary might well accept it.  It would improve the Bill.  It would remove doubts, worries and anxieties.  It would prevent an injustice being done to a person who qualifies.  A person will know that even though there may be certain delays the payment will be retrospective.  This is the case in any national wage agreement. There is always this factor of retrospection but otherwise the agreement would not be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who have lost their employment should not be penalised.  We should be able to say to them that we are treating them as we treat everybody who draws social welfare payments.  If Deputy Andrews' amendment is not legally pure the Parliamentary Secretary can amend it. This would augur well for future debates on social welfare.  If the amendment is not accepted it will lead to extended debates.  That is the smallest point we should think of.  The <Col N="517" /> important thing is that an injustice might be done to some person if the amendment is not accepted.  We have given a great deal of thought to the Bill and I do not think we should hesitate to give it a little further thought in the hope of improving it and preventing any injustice being inflicted on any person affected by the Bill.</P>

      <P>Anybody who reads this Bill will see that the transitional period allows any person who is still eligible and drawing a flat rate benefit to qualify for the improved conditions and improved payments provided in this Bill.  There is a regard for people who are still unemployed, still sick, and still within the general provision of the basic Act that you can only be eligible for benefit payment, the flat rate, for a period not exceeding 12 months.  The quicker this Bill is passed &mdash;and it has to go when it is finished in this House to the Upper House and start off from scratch there&mdash;the quicker the improved terms and payments will be made available to recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said here before that this Bill has been unnecessarily, and indeed deliberately, delayed in its passage through this House.  In fairness, I should say that I do not think that was altogether the wish or indeed the intention of Deputy Andrews who is the spokesman.  My own honest assessment of it is that there were other Deputies&mdash;Deputy Colley and Deputy de Valera, for instance&mdash;who were waiting to get in on another Bill and when that Bill was not available to them, they engaged in what I would only describe as trick-acting during the passage of this Bill.  It has been an extremely protracted passage up to now of a Bill that was a simple Bill, a Bill which in the view of any experienced parliamentarian to whom I have spoken would have taken possibly two or three hours to go through all its Stages.  We were halfway through the Committee Stage before any amendments were submitted.  I honestly think that this matter of retrospection now being discussed and <Col N="518" /> the amendment before us, notwithstanding the fact that what the amendment purports to do is very largely catered for in the Bill, are designed to try to justify in the eyes of the public the unnecessary delay and obstruction of the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are asked now how many people would be affected.  It is true that I said here that because of the provision we made, people who were still unemployed or still suffering from prolonged illness and are eligible for pay-related payment which extends for a period of 12 months, if they have exhausted the present provision for pay-related benefit and are now back on flat rate benefit, can come back in under the enhanced payments provided for in this Bill.  Some people will be affected and the longer the Bill is delayed, the more people will be affected.  I cannot say how many.  Some people&mdash;not a great number possibly &mdash;who could have qualified last week will not qualify this week because of this policy of obstructing the passage of the Bill.  It has to go to the Seanad and has to meet the other constitutional requirements before coming into operation.  There is no date of commencement in the Bill but it will come into operation through ministerial order, and it was clearly indicated that we were anxious to bring its provisions, which would play a very significant part in helping the man&mdash;and his wife and family&mdash;who was unfortunate enough to be either sick or unemployed for prolonged periods, into operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I could go on at great length about what I think has been the motivation behind some of the contributions from Deputies opposite.  I do not intend to do that at this stage in the belief that it may not help the passage of the Bill.  I am anxious that it would be finalised as quickly as possible for the reasons I have stated, but I honestly and sincerely believe that the only reason this amendment is before us is to try to justify in the eyes of the public the unnecessary obstruction of the passage of the Bill up to now.  If Deputies read the provisions <Col N="519" /> of the Bill and read the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill, they will see that in it a very large degree of coverage is provided for people who are still eligible when this Bill becomes law and who are in receipt of flat rate benefit.  They will be able to come back into pay-related benefit under these provisions and I ask Deputies to keep the fact in mind.</P>

      <P>I want, first of all, to refute the charge that the Bill was deliberately delayed.  The fact is that most of the discussion took place on the previous section related to the desire on the part of the Opposition to increase the 30 per cent to 40 per cent.  We made the case, and I do not intend to go over it again, that the money was in the fund, that the people who would benefit were those who had contributed to this fund, that the money was their money and that therefore in present circumstances when prices are escalating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply explaining why the discussion took such a long time and pointing out that the charge made by the Parliamentary Secretary that it was deliberately delayed by this party is contrary to the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this section and the amendment we are now discussing, the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that he himself raised the hare.  He did say earlier that unless this Bill was passed those in receipt of social welfare benefits who would be entitled to the extra pay-related benefit because of the extension in the Bill would lose out and it was because of that statement, which we felt at that time was in accordance with the facts that <Col N="520" /> we put in this amendment, so that we could ensure that nobody would be detrimentally affected by the time it took to discuss this Bill.  It was for this reason that Deputy Andrews put down his amendment.</P>
    <P>What will be the position of a person who last week was at the end of his flat rate payment when the Bill is passed?  Will he qualify for benefit? Even though there is no retrospection in the Bill will he benefit as if the Bill had been passed last week?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Flat rate benefit is only paid for 12 months and it cannot exceed that time.  The pay-related benefit can only be paid when there is eligibility for flat rate benefit.  There are two elements in the payment of unemployment benefit, the flat rate element and, if eligible, the pay-related benefit.  If one has exhausted one's 12-month eligibility for the flat rate benefit one cannot be paid benefit, flat rate benefit or pay-related benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with the question of retrospection.  If a person was eligible last week for flat rate benefit and is no longer eligible this week will he lose out by the fact that there is nothing in this Bill which would make the payment of the pay-related benefit retrospective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is referring to last week literally it would not make any difference but there would be a week's difference at some stage.  Under this Bill if a person was unemployed or sick for six months for 24½ weeks of that six months he would get, under the present system, 24½ weeks of pay-related benefit and then would be eligible for flat rate benefit for a further six months.  If that person had received the 24½ weeks pay-related benefit and was at present receiving the other three months flat rate benefit on the passage of this Bill that person would be entitled at that point to go on to pay-related benefit until such time as his full rate eligibility for 12 months had expired or if he exhausted the three months extension under this Bill.  Some people will be affected by the delay of the Bill.</P>

      <P>If that is the case the Parliamentary Secretary should accept my amendment.  He has suggested that there was a deliberate and unnecessary obstruction of this Bill by the Opposition but on Thursday week last, in reply to a parliamentary question, the Parliamentary Secretary said it was his intention to extend the pay-related benefit scheme.  I asked him when it was his intention to produce this Bill which was on the stocks at all times&mdash;I am not suggesting that the Bill is a result of my parliamentary question; quite the contrary. That question was asked on a Thursday and the Bill was taken out of stock the following day.  If the Parliamentary Secretary was so concerned about this matter he could have taken the Bill off the stocks a long time before the question was asked.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's suggestion of delay or obstruction and the allegations against Deputies Colley and de Valera are untrue and do not bear examination.  Deputy Colley asked a number of questions arising out of his experience in this House and we all know of Deputy de Valera's experience in matters of this nature.  In fact, it was Deputy Colley who was responsible for placing the Parliamentary Secretary in a difficult position when the Parliamentary Secretary was not able to give him the information he required.  If the Parliamentary Secretary had accepted the original suggestion, that the amount of the pay-related benefit for the extended period of three months be increased by 25 per cent, there would be no difficulty at all but he did not do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment arose directly out of a misrepresentation by the Parliamentary Secretary. I should like to quote from column 2014 of the Official Report of 14th May, 1975:</P>
      <P>Mr. Cluskey: . . . If they want to oppose the Bill, they should do so honourably and openly.  There is no retrospection in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> Mr. Colley: Why?  Why not put it in?</P>
    <P>At all times we understood that there was an element of retrospection in the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary has called &ldquo;transitional&rdquo; the feature in the section under discussion.  Under those circumstances, the Parliamentary Secretary stated there was no retrospection but surely it is not unreasonable for the Opposition to bring forward an amendment to give effect to the Parliamentary Secretary's implicit wish that there should be retrospection.  Like us, the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious that nobody should be denied his entitlement because of the passage of this Bill.  If people were to be denied their entitlement surely the Bill should have been brought before the House earlier.  To suggest that the Opposition obstructed the Bill is untrue and at variance with the facts.  I am doing the Parliamentary Secretary no favour nor does he want any favours from me.  I shall allow this amendment go through very smoothly if the Parliamentary Secretary will even mention its existence which he has not done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Mention what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Mention my amendment. The Parliamentary Secretary has not said what effect it would have. He has not said that if it was given effect by way of amendment in the Seanad it would deny anybody entitlement. We are just as concerned that everybody who is unemployed should not be denied entitlement and I think the Parliamentary Secretary will accept that the amendment was put down in that spirit.  Now we discover that the Parliamentary Secretary states that the alleged delay on the part of the Opposition will have minimal effects.  That means some people will be affected. We shall proceed on the premise that the Parliamentary Secretary will not accept the amendment, that he will not accept the principle of retrospection enshrined in our amendment.  We will accept that.  But can the Parliamentary Secretary say why he will not accept it if it gives effect to that with which the Parliamentary Secretary charges us, namely, the denial to some people of their entitlements because of <Col N="523" /> the delay in the passage of the Bill? Surely my amendment would take care of that problem, satisfy the Parliamentary Secretary, a man concerned with matters of this nature and satisfy the Opposition who are concerned also that no hardship be brought about by a delay of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to deal even in a short sentence with the effects of the amendment.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary has to pad each side of any statement he makes.  He has to protect his flanks in the past and future from the party political point of view.  That is accepted but could we do away with the political nitty-gritty and get down to the effect of this amendment?  For all I know, it could be a useless one but, if so, let the Parliamentary Secretary say so.  I would appreciate recognition of the amendment and the reason for its non-acceptance, when I shall let this go through like a knife through butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat unfair to suggest we are opposing this Bill for the sake of opposition.  After all, if we did not criticise and examine each Bill before the House would we not be accused of not caring?  We live in very critical times.  Therefore, it is the duty of people on this side of the House to examine every line of every Bill because it must be remembered we may not have an opportunity of doing so again on a Bill of this nature. In future, there will be a ministerial order made for extension or even for curtailment.  Even the date of implementation of the provisions of the Bill is a matter entirely for the Minister. Suppose the Government, for some reason, decided to postpone the enactment of this extension to any future date, it is the duty of the Opposition to ensure that people will not be adversely affected by such delay and that there will be retrospective payment forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might explain to one of my dull wit how a person coming back into social insurance will be affected by the Bill.  Will he or she be affected in <Col N="524" /> any specific way, being different from a person who is insured continuously? I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary also if the Bill will mean any great difference in the payment of maternity benefit?</P>
    <P>We must persuade the Parliamentary Secretary that Deputy Andrews' amendment has been put forward not for the sake of opposing the Bill, because one could do that in many ways, but because a genuine attempt is being made here to scrutinise the Bill and amend it so that it may be better legislation when enacted.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary complains about the length of time a Bill takes in its passage through the House, he has a very simple remedy and, that is, he can accept the amendment. However, that is not the main reason.  The main reason is to make this a better Bill and that is the spirit in which the amendment was brought forward.  We assure the Parliamentary Secretary that that is all we are trying to achieve.  Were he to approach it in that spirit, he might say: &ldquo;Yes, I will accept your amendment&rdquo; and we might then proceed very rapidly.</P>
    <P>It is our duty to examine all legislation and we welcome changes in legislation when they are being made but we must reserve the right to examine every line of every Bill and make from our experience suggestions for its improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews has asked me to explain the effects of this amendment.  We have done everything possible and, indeed, succeeded in the drafting of this Bill to ensure that anybody who is still unemployed, who is still out ill and who is still eligible for flat rate benefit will be eligible to receive the increased benefits under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Fianna Fáil are asking me to do is to give the increased benefits to people who have resumed work and may have done so some considerable time ago.  It would not be a desirable development that people who were unfortunate enough to be unemployed either through unavailability of employment or illness but who had resumed work possibly some considerable <Col N="525" /> able time ago&mdash;were this question of retrospection enshrined&mdash;would receive them.  This Bill is designed to ensure that, as far as possible, people who are unemployed or ill and still eligible for the flat rate benefit will get some of the increased benefits under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a totally unrealistic answer to a very reasonable amendment.  It does not answer the question at all.  The amendment is geared to give retrospective benefit to ensure that those people who are unemployed do not fall foul of the provisions of this Bill which the Parliamentary Secretary has admitted will cause some hardship to a small number of persons.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been honest enough to admit that he does not know the number of persons who will suffer as a result of the passage of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary would not be expected to know that.  I was going to give him credit in that respect.  As he says, it is not possible to know the answer to that question.  If a small number of people may suffer&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; advisedly because the situation may be such that nobody will suffer&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary may be inadvertently misleading the House.  I do not aim to make that allegation but I suggest that his lack of knowledge of the reality of the position is the reason for his not knowing how many people will be involved. Our amendment would ensure that nobody would suffer.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can tell us that the provisions of the Bill are such that nobody will suffer that is all right, but he cannot say that.  In fact, he has been saying a small number will suffer.</P>

Surely there must be an obligation on Fianna Fáil spokesmen to read and understand Bills before they make their contributions in this House.  I do not think that is too much to expect from them and it is the least the Irish people, and particularly Fianna Fáil supporters, might expect.  They should know what a Bill intends to do and its effects on the people concerned.  I accept that Bills are in fairly legalistic terms but in this case an explanatory memorandum was circulated.

If the Government were so concerned about the urgency of this Bill, they could have brought it in a week or a fortnight sooner.  In common with other people, they realised the unemployment situation was getting worse and will get worse in the words of their own political leader.  That is the reality of the position.  As for the suggestion that I made a remark about the Government stockpiling Bills, I apologise to the House for that.  I should have said the Parliamentary Secretary drew the Bill from some drawer in the Department of Social Welfare where it was already prepared.  I do apologise for accusing the Government of stockpiling Bills because we all know the Government have anything but a stockpile of Bills.

We had put forward the case that there are many instances of a son who gets married at 22 or 23 years of age and whose father may have a farm and another business.  We believe it would be desirable if the father in such a case were in a position to transfer the holding even though he had not reached the age of 55.  This subsection prohibits him from doing this because if he does so he will be subject to capital gains tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Subsection (1) of section 27 refers to an individual who has attained the age of 55 years and who disposes of the whole of his qualifying assets to one or more of his children. That means that a man would have to reach the age of 55 before he could transfer property to his son or daughter. It is nothing unusual for a man of 55 years of age to have a son or daughter of 30 years of age.  The section is undesirable in that it will inhibit the transfer of property which is so desirable.  I would suggest that if there must be an age limit, it should be reduced to 45 years of age.  A son who is in a job would be reluctant to surrender that job unless he got a transfer of the property to him.  Transfers of property take place every day of the week on the occasion of the marriage of a son or daughter.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider whether the subsection as drafted is detrimental to the transfer of property. A father should be allowed to transfer property freely as between himself and his family.  If the age limit were reduced to 45 it would make the subsection more acceptable.  Cases will arise where a man of 49 or 50 years of age would like to form a company with his family and to transfer half the assets to his son who, in all probability, is about to get married.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the section for the reasons I have outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I owe an apology to the House for not being here as the Deputy in possession when this Bill was resumed.  The other business concluded rather suddenly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> I had followed up the point that Deputy Fitzpatrick has recapitulated and the point made by Deputy O'Malley.  I raised the question as to whether an age qualification should be introduced in this section.  The Minister gave me a very full and satisfactory answer.  Arising out of that answer, I want to put two aspects to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I completely understand now the genesis of the section.  The Minister said on the one hand, that this was in pursuance of the proposals for capital taxation in regard to retirement. I hope I am not misquoting him in this.  I can immediately see the logicality and the place of this section here.  On the other hand, the Minister did say something which prompts a very valuable thought and which, perhaps, I would not have adverted to as clearly if the Minister had not drawn my attention to it.  I refer to the social aim of encouraging the transfer of executive command, you might say, to the most viable generation, in other words, the transfer of responsibility and opportunity to the generation that is best capable of taking the load, which is being blocked by the older generation hanging on. That is a different social problem altogether and the Minister adverted to that.</P>
    <P>Here we have the kernel of the problem and the first basic question that has to be asked on the section: what is the policy behind this section? Quite clearly, the Minister's original intention was to continue the policy in regard to capital taxation.  I pointed out before the adjournment of this business that his section was so tightly drafted that in order to bring in the equitably desirable extension to nephews and nieces he found it necessary to bring in an amendment, an amendment for which he was universally commended.  When that is so it is quite clear that the intention of the section is to afford relief of this nature to enable the family farm or family business to continue and to pursue the retirement policy.</P>
    <P>The question I want to ask now is whether there is not an opportunity <Col N="536" /> also of pursuing the other aspect of policy that the Minister mentioned without prejudice to the first.  If there was any contradiction between the two points of view here I would yield to the Minister and say that he has answered me that the consistency and the homogeneity of the code must be preserved.  My point is that if you were to delete the age qualification you do not perturb the logicality and the consistency of the section in its original intention and in its place in this revised code of financial legislation of which this Bill is a part.</P>
    <P>Because of the tight drafting of the section, unless I can be shown or can see that there is some loophole here that would go beyond that, I am making the point for consideration that the deletion of this age limit would not prejudice in any way the consistency and the homogeneity of the section which would result by the deletion of that age limit.  On the other hand, if I am shown in some way that something is breached I will say again that I appreciate the Minister's dilemma when he said ruefully last night that when you try to meet equity there is always the problem of where to stop.  I take the Minister's argument on that.  If I am right in suggesting that the age limit could go without prejudice to the legislation, that it would not expand it, that it would not bring in any loophole or contradiction, then the Minister should consider whether the putting in of the age limit merely followed from the train of thought that it was retirement legislation.  I am qualifying this conditionally the whole way through and I will accept any reasonable answer against that case.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister: why not achieve the other social gain as well? The Minister mentioned that 55 years was the European limit.  I put the case of the younger man with a son or a daughter who has to make up his mind at a particular point in time.  He may be short of the fixed age limit.  This may completely defeat the intention of the section.  I would strongly urge on the Minister to delete the age limit. Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned an age <Col N="537" /> limit of 45 years.  I could suggest 35 years.  Therefore I take the high jump and say: &ldquo;Why have an age limit at all?&rdquo; I am trying to be understanding and helpful to the Minister.  This point is completely distinct from Deputy O'Malley's point about the widow.  I do not want to put the Minister to the trouble of having to repeat himself in replying to me but, if anything I have said requires a reply, I would be glad to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can go a long way with what has been said from the Opposition benches if I accept as appropriate that all properties passing from parents to children should be exempt from capital gains tax.  Having regard to the very large exemptions which will be available under the capital acquisitions tax, very substantial accumulation of wealth could pass from one generation to another without paying any capital tax at all.  I do not think that would be justifiable socially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would pass without paying any tax at all.  Under the capital gains tax, it is only the element of gain in each disposal which becomes chargeable to tax in certain circumstances if the disposals were above the appropriate level.  I do not think it is inappropriate that some small tax should be paid above certain levels in respect of certain gains which have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can argue about the rates and whether they are too much of a burden now or hereafter.  We may argue about the need to adjust them from time to time because of inflation, and so on, but those are all peripheral arguments. The fundamental question posed to me was whether or not there should be total exemption in respect of gifts from one generation to another.  I do not think it is appropriate that there should <Col N="538" /> be total exemption in certain circumstances if the payment can be made without hardship.  People who receive property are in a position to pay.  So far as capital gains are concerned I must not get my fundamental thinking confused.  It is the person who is disposing of the property who is making the gain, who is liable for the tax.  It is at a time of liquidity in most circumstances that the payment will be made.</P>
    <P>The relief is given because we are primarily concerned with retirement situations.  I am not saying this is the last consideration that the Legislature ought to give or will give to the whole question of capital gains.  With the benefit of hindsight of the operation of this and the other legislation we may come around to what is the very best way to manage the capital assets of the country, for the benefit of the community, for the benefit of the country, and for the benefit of individuals within families.  It is unlikely that we are now in a position to prepare an appropriate régime of capital management for generations to come. The tragedy is that we allowed our affairs to be controlled for so long by the outlook of people who lived in 1894.  Fundamentally that is what the estate duty system was.  There were two small amendments which were made too late.  That was bad, and that is what led to the campaign a few years ago to do away with death duties altogether.</P>
    <P>Now we are endeavouring to tackle the whole problem of capital management because there is this element of capital management apart from taxation. There is capital management, distribution, the best way and the most equitable way of seeing to the distribution of wealth not simply its distribution through taxation systems but its distribution by having disincentives to undue accumulations so that property is distributed beneficially from the older generation, who have become tired in their ways, to the younger generation who may be more dynamic in the use of capital.  That can be generated by tax laws which may collect no revenue at all but, by being in existence, may cause people <Col N="539" /> to distribute their property in a certain way so as to avoid the tax.  That is a desirable social end as long as it achieves the right social end.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Irish pattern of behaviour and, indeed, the present pattern, the age limit of 55 years is an advance on previous experience.  I doubt very much that there are many farm holding which are distributed by their owners at 55 years of age, or many business holdings either.  It may be desirable to bring that age down in the future.  When we find that the age of 55 years is becoming restrictive we will have made a great advance and the Legislature will then be able to move forward in the light of that advance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister referred to the social aim of the distribution of capital, he was reinforcing my point.  He has not given me any specific reason why the age limit should remain but, in the latter part of what he said, he gave me a very good reason why it could be left out.  I do not want to take advantage of that.  The Minister has prompted me to ask a further question.  I will argue against myself now.  I want to be fair.  Is there any danger that my suggestion of removing the age limit would encourage premature disposals which would prejudice the ultimate return to the Exchequer?  It is difficult for me to formulate that question more precisely, although I feel there is possibly something in it.  On the spur of the moment I find it hard to work out an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an inflationary situation it is quite clear that it would suggest defeating accruals to the Exchequer by taking advantage as far as possible of the thresholds set in the Bill because in respect of all these thresholds in the Bill&mdash;all these Bills and this £150,000 which appears in so many places&mdash;one must face the fact that if we talk in such a laudatory way about them here and consider them adequate, any one of us who does so must of necessity have his tongue in his cheek to some extent because we know perfectly well that in a short <Col N="540" /> time these thresholds will be less and less significant.  Although the formal answer is that new legislation will fix this, the experience of financial legislation has always been that it is in arrears in catching up on such a matter.  In other words, the State always, wherever it is, takes advantage of the situation willy-nilly.  That being so, I can see that there might be some anxiety about deleting the age limit completely, but if it is so, I would suggest to the Minister to let us have it out frankly here and we will share with him the responsibility of passing the Bill if we have the opportunity of complete debate on it.</P>
    <P>As I say, in the absence of time to construct a useful specific example and in the absence of the information which I would probably need so to do, I cannot be more exact in my remarks, much as I would like to be, but the Minister will appreciate that I am seeking what is the best answer, and as in the latter part of what he said he was making my case for me, I want now to reciprocate to a certain extent by expanding on the part he opened with in order that we may do the best thing in this section and make it the best possible piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to say exactly what is going to happen. We just do not know.  We have no information at all about distributions of wealth, other than as a consequence of death or within five years before death.  This is the only information available, but all we can suspect is that the cases of distributions at such an early age as 55 years are very few and far between, so I think that we are catering for the bulk of cases likely to occur.  Time alone will prove whether we are right or not.  If we find that it is otherwise and areas of hardship, arise, certainly the Legislature will then move to put them right.  I would prefer in the meantime that hardship would not be done, but having regard to the fact that any transfers at an earlier age are likely to involve smaller gains, the tax will not be a hardship.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister might say that the number of people who transfer under 55 years of age is very small.  It might be but there are certain groups of people who would like to distribute part of their assets and form a company. I do not have to stretch my imagination too far to see where this section could cause a number of problems. I know people with property, a certain type of property, a certain number of businesses throughout the country.  These people might have three or four children&mdash;two or three sons&mdash;and whatever hope we had up to now of the father transferring 25 per cent of his assets, or 35 per cent, to his son, or maybe there are three or four sons and he would like to transfer 25 per cent to each of them on marriage, what this is going to do now as far as I can see is to compel him to withhold that transfer for a number of years until he reaches 55.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that this will apply only to a limited number of people.  So be it&mdash;I agree that it may be a limited number but there are cases throughout the country where a farmer has an outside farm&mdash;and you will find this in numerous parts of the country &mdash;and quite often the son settles down in the outside farm and the father would there and then transfer the holding to his son who is getting married. I can visualise numerous cases throughout the country where the father would be under 55 and would like to carry out this transfer, and this section as far as I can see will certainly prohibit him from doing so.  I am not sure&mdash; maybe the Minister might clarify it for me&mdash;whether he would be allowed to transfer the first £50,000 which is in section 26.  Would he qualify under that section for an exemption if he sold a particular part of his holding or transferred a particular part to his son? Would he qualify under the section for that part of the exemption or must that be on retirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my objection to the section, <Col N="542" /> that I think it will inhibit the transfer of property between a father and his children and I do not think this is good for society generally.  It would be much better if they could get established in their own right when getting married, even if the father is under 55 years of age.</P>

      <P>I would like, first of all, to reinforce the point raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick because I think I am right in saying that as a result of the amendment made by the Minister to the section, and correctly, the position now is that a transfer to a nephew will not be in the high category of exemption from gift tax, and, in fact, will be subject to a fairly substantial gift tax, in addition to being subjected to capital gains tax under this section.  That, of course, was something the White Paper said would not happen but it is happening. In view of the fact that the Minister has, in my view, correctly accepted that in certain circumstances a nephew would be in the same position as a son the argument made by Deputy Fitzpatrick is even more powerful in that the inhibition against the transfer of property in this way is much greater because of the incidence of gift tax in such cases on top of the incidence of capital gains tax.  For that reason the Minister ought to give further thought to the provision in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume what the Minister said on <Col N="543" /> previous sections in relation to wording similar to that in subsection (1) (b) applies also to this, that he will look at it with a view to rewording and making it intelligible.  On a previous section we discussed the question of the desirability or otherwise of a provision in the case of a legatee when he disposes of the property he inherits he is liable for capital gains tax calculated on a base going back to the time it was acquired by the person who left him the property. The Minister, arising out of the discussion, undertook to reconsider that position.  Does the Minister's undertaking to reconsider that decision apply also to the somewhat similar provision in this section whereby a member of the family benefiting from the disposal would, if he disposed of the property within ten years, become liable to capital gains tax on a base calculated on the market value at the time when the donor acquired the property?  It is not exactly the same position but it is somewhat similar and I should like to know the Minister's attitude in regard to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment to this section which I moved, and the House accepted, amendment 30, is similar to a provision in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill in relation to nephews or nieces who have been working on a farm or in a business for five years prior to the date of acquiring the property.  It brings in special treatment for nephews or nieces; they fall into category 1, the same as sons and daughters, in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, provided they have been involved in the management of the enterprise for five years.  On the second point, subsection (3) of this section provides:</P>
      <P>Where assets comprised in a disposal in respect of which relief has been granted under this section are disposed of within ten years of the earlier disposal, section 9 (acquisition and disposal deemed to be at market value) shall not apply to the earlier disposal and, notwithstanding any other provisions in this Act&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> (a) the disposal and acquisition of the assets under that earlier disposal shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be for such consideration as would have secured that neither a gain for a loss accured on that disposal, and</P>
    <P>(b) the acquisition of the assets by the individual making the earlier disposal shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be the acquisition of the individual making the later disposal:</P>
    <P>Provided that nothing in this subsection shall affect the amount of capital gains tax chargeable in respect of the earlier disposal, but to the extent that tax so chargeable has been paid, relief shall be granted by set-off against the amount of capital gains tax chargeable on the later disposal and not otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that but I am not sure that he has answered my question.  I asked the Minister whether he intends his review of the position in the earlier section&mdash;I think it is in regard to section 9&mdash;to be applied to the provision in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental difference between death which mercifully is usually not contrived or designed by a person but is something over which one has no control, whereas we are dealing in section 27 with voluntary and deliberate and controlable acts of people so that they ought to be treated in a different way.  Subsection (3) aims at discouraging devices by which the farm or family businesses are disposed of so as to get the relief provided by the section followed by a sale outside the family. To deal with this situation the section, therefore, provides that where relief has been given and assets comprised in the disposal are disposed of outside the family within ten years of the disposal by the parent, the capital gain on the disposal by the child is computed as if the parents' disposal had been made to him at cost.  In this way capital gains tax would be payable on the same basis as if the parent had made the disposal in the first instance outside <Col N="545" /> side the family.  This is not to result in any adustment in the tax charged in respect of the earlier disposal but if tax has been paid on that earlier disposal the tax chargeable on the disposal by the child will be reduced by the amount of tax charged on the parent.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that it is, perhaps, somewhat misleading to say that up to a transfer of assets to £150,000 would be exempt when in circumstances described by the Minister, the liability for tax is postponed even though there may be a good reason for doing it?  In my view it would be more accurate to say in such a case that the payment of tax is postponed and not exempt.</P>

      <P>The section is designed to deal with the genuine keeping of a property within a family.

      <P>The Minister will be aware that certain definitions in section 26 are imported into section 27. In regard to two of the definitions being imported into section 27 I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the suggestion that the relieving provision of section 27 may not be available in certain instances to directors of groups of companies. The various accountancy bodies have suggested that two of the definitions which are imported into this section, that of a family company and full-time working director should be extended <Col N="546" /> in order that an individual, who is required to devote substantially all of his time in a managerial or technical capacity, to the service of more than one company within a group may be regarded, for the purposes of this section, as a full-time working director of any of the companies which, in relation to him, is a family company.  I imagine that the Minister will have received representations on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

Is there some other part of either of the two sections that would apply this to the group of companies or on what does one rely to do this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, specifically there is not.  It is just the general interpretation and application of the law.  The matter will be more specifically dealt with in the proposed corporation profits tax legislation, long promised, long awaited and eventually to be teased through this House probably later this year.  We think it more appropriate to deal with those combinations of companies and all matters related thereto within the ambit of the corporation profits tax.  Hopefully, the whole think will be netted together there for some years to come. In the meantime, that is what will be done.  Any individual who is required to devote substantially all of his time to service in a technical or managerial <Col N="547" /> capacity in one or more than one company in the company's constituted group of companies, or carrying on complementary businesses so as to form a composite unit of business, will enjoy the concession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In pages 27 and 28, to delete subsection (2) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Subsection (1) shall not apply if part only of the amount or value of the consideration for the disposal of, or of the interest in, the old assets is applied as described in that subsection, but if all of the amount or value of the consideration except for a part which is less than the amount of the gain (whether all chargeable gain or not) accruing on the disposal of, or of the interest in, the old assets is so applied, then, the person carrying on the trade shall, on making a claim in that behalf, be treated, for the purposes of this Act, as if the amount of the gain accruing on the disposal of the old assets were reduced to the amount of consideration not applied in the acquisition of the new assets (and if not all chargeable gain with a proportionate reduction in the amount of the chargeable gain) and the balance of the gain (or chargeable gain) shall be treated as if it did not accrue until he ceases to use the new assets for the purposes of the trade.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment and is required to make clear what portion of the gain is to be deferred, what portion is to be chargeable when all the proceeds from the old assets are not utilised for the purchase of new assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> The amendment is in the form of a substituted subsection (2) which links the computation to consideration not applied in the acquisition of the new assets, while in the original draft the computation was linked with the gains applied in the acquisition of new assets.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31a:</P>
      <P>In page 28, lines 57 to 62, to delete subsection (8) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) This section shall apply in relation to a person who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  either successively or at the same time carries on two trades which are in different localities but which are concerned with goods or services of the same kind, or</P>
      <P>(b)  successively carries on two trades the first of which he has carried on for a period of ten years or more before he ceased to carry it on and the second of which he commenced to carry on within a period of two years from the date on which he ceased to carry on the first trade,</P>
      <P>as if, in relation to the old assets used for the purpose of the one trade and the new assets used for the purposes of the other trade, the two trades were the same trade.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the House knows, section 28 deals with the replacement of business assets and provides relief by way of deferment of the capital gains tax charge on a gain made on the disposal of business assets where the proceeds are reinvested in other business assets for use in the same trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (8), as drafted, extends the relief to a person carrying on two trades in different localities, provided that they deal in goods or provide services <Col N="549" /> of the same kind.  Two trades of that kind would be treated as one trade, so that if assets belonging to the one trade were sold and the proceeds reinvested in acquiring assets for use in the other trade, the relief provided by the section would be granted.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on Second Stage Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that consideration be given to the type of person who decided to change the type of business in which he was engaged and I think Deputy Paddy Belton advanced a similar argument. I have been considering the Deputies' suggestions and, therefore, propose to extend the relief to cover the case where there is a change from one business into another without any qualifications as to the type of goods dealt in or the type of services provided. However, some safeguards are necessary in order to prevent abuse of the relief.  Therefore, I propose in this amendment that, in order to qualify for relief, a taxpayer must have carried on the first trade for a minimum of ten years before he disposes of it and he must have commenced the second trade within two years after disposing of the first one.</P>
    <P>I trust this amendment will meet the point made, that not to allow people to reinvest in some business other than one precisely the same as that in which they have been engaged will ensure that business assets which are disposed of are, if I may use a current phrase as regards petro dollars, recycled back into business and, to that extent, will be beneficial.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I think it should be slightly longer.  A person might be forced because of this time limit into purchasing an unsuitable property.  Two years is not a long time when a person is looking for a suitable property or a farm.  I have known of many cases where people sold a business with the intention of buying another one and it took three or four years to do so.  People may be pushed to the point of buying a property at an inflated price in order to comply with the time limit set out.  I know of many people who have sold their business and have regretted that they did not get back into another business.  Nowadays speculators and outside interests may be involved and it may not be so easy to find a suitable business in which to invest money.  There are similar difficulties with regard to the purchase of a farm and the prospective purchaser may not find it easy to get a suitable property in the county in which he wishes to invest.  There is a case here for an extension beyond the two years.  It would not leave any loopholes in the Bill but would give some latitude to people who wish to invest their money.</P>

      <P>If on the completion of two calendar years the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that a person is committed to engage in a new trade or business, by concession they would allow the commitment to be fully completed.  In the present situation the person will have almost two <Col N="552" /> years to look for a suitable property and to enter into a contract.  He would not be made liable to tax simply because he had not completed all the arrangements within two calendar years.  Having regard to the liberal interpretation we are now giving on the right to roll over and in view of the necessity of ensuring the assets are not wasted in the meantime&mdash;there is a duty on the Exchequer to arrange matters so that there is a reasonable probability that the assets are there &mdash;if a person has committed himself to new business arrangements but has not completed them all, such a commitment would be accepted by the Revenue Commissioners as sufficient. In many cases the period could be 2½ years.</P>

      <P>The amendment goes a long way to meet the legitimate point raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick on Second Stage.  However, there are a few points on which I should like clarification.  From something the Minister said on two occasions when dealing with this amendment I got the impression that on the sale of a business tax would not be payable until it had been determined two years later whether the proceeds were going to be reinvested in another business.  Am I correct in this?</P>

If a person does not propose to re-engage in business, liability to tax would arise forthwith.  I suppose people might claim they were going to reinvest but not complete the arrangements.</P>

      <P>No, but I do not think it is any harm to draw the attention of the Minister to possible dangers. There is also another point the Minister might clarify.  In paragraph (a) there is reference to two trades.  If a person has two public houses in different locations, are they regarded as one or two trades within the meaning of the paragraph?  Paragraph (a) states:</P>
      <P>either successively or at the same time carries on two trades which are in different localities but which are concerned with goods or services of the same kind, or</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two ways of looking at it.  A great deal depends on how the person runs the business, whether he keeps separate accounts for each trading or whether he keeps them all under one account.  A company might operate one trading account and an individual might operate individually or, indeed, collectively. It would be very difficult, I imagine, to supervise the running of the business.</P>

      <P>You could divide them.  If it were a limited company it would be taxed accordingly.  It appears to be one unit then.  Is the income tax test sufficient here?  On the other hand, if there was a single proprietor or a company with two subsidiaries, or something like that, you would have a distinction; you would have clearly different trades.</P>

      <P>I do not think the position is quite clear in respect of assets which pass on death.  Having regard to the provisions of section 14 <Col N="556" /> and section 28 assets which pass on death and have been the subject of a sale, or successive sales, under subsection (1) of section 28, it would appear that the legatee would acquire those assets at an imputed cost which may relate back to the previously replaced assets held by the deceased and acquired many years previously. I wonder if the Minister could indicate whether or not that is correct.</P>

      <P>I would be hoping to hear it was not correct.  Where there has been a passing of property on death, as the Bill provides at the moment, in the event of a disposal by the legatee the capital gain is assessed in relation to the value at the date of original acquisition by the deceased. Now, if the deceased has been replacing assets before he dies and getting roll-over relief under section 28 for quite a number of years then, on the legatee getting the assets and disposing of them, is the assessment of capital gains tax on that disposal related back to the original market value of the assets away back before they were replaced and roll-over and relief got and replaced again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I compare the Irish and British systems it will show, I think, where the Deputy may have got his lines crossed between the two systems.  Under our system, let us suppose a business premises is sold for £60,000 and a gain of £10,000 is made on that transaction; we will call that stage 1.  Stage 2, the proceeds are then used in the construction of a new premises costing £100,000.  Stage 3, which would be ten years later, the owner decided to get out of the business and he sells the premises for £115,000.  On those new premises, which cost him £100,000, he makes a <Col N="557" /> gain of £15,000.  The way in which it will be approached will be as follows: the first stage when he sold the premises for £60,000 and made a gain of £10,000, the gain at that stage is not charged; it is rolled over into the new premises.  It cost £100,000 and no charge takes place at that stage.  On the third stage there is an ultimate sale for £115,000 and the gain on that is £15,000.  Now the gain on the earlier sale was £10,000 so that £25,000 then at that later stage is subject to tax.  He will get an eventual £500, of course, for that year so the amount chargeable is £24,500 at 26 per cent.</P>
      <P>Under the British system at the first stage of a sale of £60,000 and a gain of £10,000 there is no action.  At the second stage, the premises having cost £100,000 the gain, which he made at the first stage is deducted, that is the £10,000, so the new premises is deemed to have cost the man £90,000 at that stage, instead of the £100,000, which it actually cost him.  We come to the third stage when the premises were sold.  They were sold for £115,000 but you deduct the deemed cost of the premises, that is £90,000, so the amount chargeable is £25,000 and that is chargeable at 30 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I could argue with the Revenue Commissioners about what is an asset and what is goodwill as regards what is valuation for capital gains.  A few years ago we had a different type of system as regards stamp duty on the transfer of property.  It is very difficult to put your finger on goodwill because it is not a tangible thing.  The Revenue Commissioners recognised this a few years ago in the transfer of property as regards stamp duty.  The property was valued and it was only on that that you paid stamp duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take any business, a public house, a grocery shop or a drapery store that is sold for £40,000.  That is the value of the asset.  Anything contributed to that by work or ingenuity is not a very tangible thing.  When one is assessing assets I do not believe one is entitled to assess goodwill.  A doctor's practice is just as tangible as the <Col N="558" /> goodwill a man has built up in a property. If a doctor sells his practice after 20 years is he subject to capital gains?  If he is not I do not see why a man who has contributed the greater part of his life to building up the goodwill of his business and has given something to that business should have to suffer capital gains on the goodwill.</P>
    <P>At one time the Revenue Commissioners only assessed a property on the bricks and mortar in relation to stamp duty.  Anything beyond that was the goodwill built up by a person.  Could the Minister say if a doctor's practice, which is disposed of after 15 or 20 years, is subject to capital gains?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes if the goodwill has a capital value.  I accept what the Deputy says about the difficulty of calculating goodwill and in the very rapidly changing world we now live in goodwill seems more difficult to calculate than it might have been in more stable days.  Nevertheless, if a person's assets include the goodwill of his profession, practice or business and it is disposed of for a capital sum that may become liable to capital gains tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many aspects, as I am sure the Deputy appreciates, in valuations, including location, trade and so on and the return on capital investment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I refer the Minister back to the example he gave us under section 28 and under the British system?  Stage 3, which was the last one he described in each case, was the situation where the taxpayer was no longer investing the proceeds of sale in a business.  Then the liability to tax arose.  Would the Minister carry this a little further to stage 3½, where the taxpayer is carrying on a business but dies?  By his will he leaves the assets <Col N="559" /> involved, which at that stage are invested in the business, to a legatee. What is the position of the legatee at that stage?  If he continues the business and continues the assets in the use of the business presumably the roll-over relief will apply to him the same as it applied to his predecessor in title.  If he did not continue in business would his liability be the same as that of the deceased, if he was getting out of business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Irish system a person would be deemed to be taking over an asset worth £100,000, assuming it had not been revalued at the date of death.  Under the British system the person would be deemed to be taking over an asset of £90,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am not making the query I have in mind clear to the Minister.  A considerable amount of concern has been expressed at the possible effects on succession to business, which is arising all the time, if the situation comes about under section 28 that the successor to a business finds himself with a latent capital gains tax liability.  This could in some cases be very substantial and perhaps even be a quarter the market value of the assets.  It has been suggested that to avoid this kind of latent liability for capital gains tax the liabilities of the deceased, both on capital and income, should be finalised in his estate so that the successor in the business would take unencumbered assets without contingent liabilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister may think this is getting back to death duties but if he remembers his inheritance tax it may console him.  The real point at issue is that because of the provisions for roll-over relief going on and on everybody who succeeds to a business is in fact taking on a contingent liability and as the years go on this gets bigger and bigger.  This in the longer term could have a seriously inhibiting effect on business and it would be better to determine exactly what the liability is on the death and dispose of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No question of liability would arise at the time of death.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But the argument is that it should arise on death because the consequence of its not arising is that you have a contingent liability growing year after year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be further growth because of further capital gain but any liability on death which is deferred does not itself grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But as the assets are replaced the liability is almost certain to grow and ultimately somebody is going to be responsible for capital gains which accrued perhaps a generation or more before.  This kind of thing, apart from perhaps in the long run creating a greater objection and outcry than arose in relation to death duties, could have an inhibiting effect as regards succession in business.  At least there ought to be consideration given to having the option of clearing the liability on death rather than letting it carry on.</P>

      <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would look into it.  There is another matter I want to raise on this section.  I understand that the wording in subsection (1) is taken from section 33 of the British Finance Act, 1965 and it contains the phrase &ldquo;used and used only&rdquo;.  I believe that phrase has been interpreted in a case in Britain in which the British High Court judge dealing with the case said he was not prepared to give any definition in regard to the words &ldquo;used&rdquo; and &ldquo;occupied&rdquo; which is in subsection (6) of the British section 33.  The result of this was a refusal to allow roll-over relief on an asset, which was land, acquired for the trade and disposed of on proving unsuitable for the purpose.  The suggestion has been made to me that the section should apply to assets acquired for the purposes of a trade and not used for any other purpose unless it was incidental to the trade so as to avoid <Col N="561" /> the kind of situation which arose as a result of that decision in Britain.  I do not know if the Minister has received any representations on this but it does seem to me to be a valid point.</P>

      <P>This subsection makes provision for further apportionment where consideration applies to assets because some are and others are not subjects of a claim for relief. The consideration has to be apportioned between those which are and those which are not.  The apportionment is to be in such manner as is <Col N="562" /> just and reasonable.  Perhaps I should make simplicity more confused by giving an example.  An apportionment on a just and reasonable basis is to be made where the old assets were used for business purposes during part only of the period of ownership.  Here is an illustrated example.  In January, 1975 a trader buys for £20,000, including expenses, a building which he uses for his trade except for the top floor which is let.  For a just and reasonable apportionment the part which he occupies for the trade is four-fifths of the whole.  In January, 1977 the letting of the top floor ceases and he takes in the top floor for the trade.  In January, 1985 he sells the building for, say £32,000 and uses the whole proceeds to buy a new building for his trade.  The gain made is £12,000.  Four-fifths of the building was used for the trade for the whole period of ownership while one-fifth of the building was occupied for the trade for eight years out of the whole ten years.  The appropriate fraction is, therefore, four-fifths plus one-fifth multiplied by eight-tenths which equals 24-fifths.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is just and reasonable is that he did not occupy the upper floor of the building for the first two years.  The amount of the gain to be deferred is, therefore, 24/25ths multiplied by £12,000 which equals £11,520 and only £480, which is attributable to the upper floor which was not let for two years, would be charged at January, 1985.</P>

      <P>I assume from the fact that the subsection says it will be apportioned in such manner as is just and reasonable there is no mathematical way of laying down the manner in which the apportionment should take place in such cases.  What this is saying, in effect, is that the Revenue Commissioners will do it so that there will not be an enormous advantage either to Revenue or to the taxpayer, or conversely, no enormous disadvantage to the Revenue or the taxpayer. Is that really what the intention is?</P>

      <P>I have received some representations in regard to this section. The Minister may have received them, too.  According to these representations, this section requires that tax be paid on all profits where the capital is not used wholly or mainly for the restoration of the asset.  In certain cases of injurious affection no restoration can be effected.  For example, where a portion of the front garden of a residence is taken over for road widening the house would require to be physically moved back the requisite number of feet to bring about a restoration of the prior situation. Alternatively, the asset could be a unique painting or work of art <Col N="564" /> which could prove equally irreplaceable. It is suggested that in such cases the application of the provisions of the section would be unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the bit of the front garden for the purposes of road widening would be concerned that would be the disposal of part of a private residence and would not give rise to a taxable charge.</P>

      <P>It was somebody's front garden which was suggested.  We dealt on an earlier stage with the question of the compulsory purchase of property.  In so far as it is part of a private residence it would not be liable to tax in any event.  With regard to the painting, if it is valued at under £2,000 it would be a tangible movable asset and would not be affected.  If it is above that figure it would be the same as the disposal of it.  It might not be exactly the way the person contemplated disposing of it to burn it, but, nevertheless, it would be a disposal, and the cash return would be similar to the return the person would get if the painting was sold on the open market, assuming the painting was adequately insured and that compensation for the appropriate amount was paid.  If not the gain would be correspondingly less.  I assume from the fact that a painting is mentioned that it is not a wasting asset.  There are probably many works of art which have wasted or are wasting.</P>

      <P>Subsection (5) provides that the section shall not apply in relation to a wasting asset.  I presume a motor car could be described as a wasting asset.  If a motor car is damaged in an accident as a result of the negligence of someone else and the owner brings a claim for damages for the value of the car, does the fact that the section does not apply to a wasting asset mean that the compensation for the destruction of the car or the damage to it would be subject to capital gains tax?</P>

      <P>If we did not have that subsection there I could hear it being argued that because we had not got it there it would be chargeable to compensation received in respect of such property.  In order to clarify the position and to put it beyond any doubt, it was thought that it was better to state that there.  It might have said that the section shall not apply to compensation received in respect of the destruction of a wasting asset or something of that nature but I do not think those words would be any stronger.</P>

He receives £4,000 compensation and spends the whole on restoring the asset.  He claims roll-over and the asset is eventually sold for £12,000.  The position then is as follows: cost £10,000; deduct recovery, £4,000, which is deemed to be a part disposal, leaving a balance of £6,000; and expenditure on reinstatement because he applies the money received in compensation on reinstatement, £4,000, which gives an adjusted cost of £10,000; the sale proceeds are £12,000, less adjusted cost £10,000, leaving a chargeable gain of £2,000.</P>

      <P>Before the EEC Retirement of Farmers Regulation, 1974, came into effect, there was a scheme which the Department of Lands had in operation for some years, admittedly not a very successful scheme, to encourage older farmers to retire.  Not many farmers took it up but there were a few hundred in the country.  Basically, it was the same sort of scheme as the EEC scheme but probably less generous because there were no outside grants.

Presumably they have disposed <Col N="569" /> of their interests by now in any event, but if any should come to light and we saw that it conflicted with the principle of this section, I am sure we could deal with it retrospectively, but short of pursuing the people in question to ascertain any probable liability to capital gains tax, we could not deal with it.

      <P>In page 31, after line 22, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) In this section &lsquo;capital distribution&rsquo; means any distribution from a unit trust, including a distribution in the course of terminating the unit trust, in money or money's worth except a distribution which in the hands of the recipient <Col N="570" /> constitutes income for the purposes of income tax and in section 32 &lsquo;distribution of capital&rsquo; shall be construed in accordance with this definition.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  The words &ldquo;capital distribution&rdquo; were used in subsection (3) of section 31 and the words &ldquo;distribution of capital&rdquo; were used in subsection (2) (b) of section 32.  The amendment provides the required definitions of these expressions.  The words &ldquo;capital distribution&rdquo; in relation to a company were defined in paragraph 1, Schedule II, and the wording of this definition is now suitably adapted to cover a distribution from a unit trust.</P>

      <P>Why not use the same phrase?  The Minister seems to be going to some lengths to define it when he means the same thing.  The definition of capital distribution would appear to confirm a point I raised on this part of the Bill on Second Stage. Apart from a distribution in the course of terminating the unit trust, is there in reality any distribution of this kind envisaged in the case of Irish unit trusts?

      <P>Is the Minister aware of cases in which there would be a distribution of 80 per cent of the trust net income which is one of the requirements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has in mind the fact that unit trust regulations would appear to stop distributions of the kind to which this section <Col N="571" /> is directed but there are substantial doubts that they operate in that way. Certainly, unregistered unit trusts which may not come to notice are believed to have been established. They could operate as we visualise and we consider it safer to make provision in this Bill to cover such situations rather than to be closing the door when the horse has already bolted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a little difficult to deal with this section without some reference to section 32.  The Minister will recall that on Second Stage I queried whether the provisions in the sections in relation to unit trusts were of any practical value, particularly the special arrangements envisaged. On the information I had, it seemed that no unit trust could meet the conditions that were being laid down. One of the difficulties involved is the proviso that trusts would come within the conditions for making these special arrangements with the Revenue Commissioners if they distributed 80 per cent of their net income and chargeable gains.  To the best of my knowledge in practice unit trusts do not distribute surpluses on the realisation of investments but rather they reinvest these sums.  Has the Minister any knowledge of cases to the contrary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of schemes have come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners which warrant these sections.  Of that I am satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the position that conditions are being laid down which on the face of it appear to be incapable of being met?  While special arrangements are envisaged and spelled out in considerable detail there is no known case that can come within the conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are dealing with here is the value of distribution of capital by unit trusts to unit holders to be treated as part disposals of units in the same way as capital distribution by companies, in respect of shares in <Col N="572" /> the company, is deemed to be part disposals of the shares.  We are ensuring that unit trusts and companies are put on an equal footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is difficult to discuss this without referring to section 32 I will raise the point in more precise form on section 32.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The section seems to make the trustees of the unit trust chargeable for chargeable gains and they, presumably, would pay the capital gains tax on it.  The section then goes on to provide that where a person receives or becomes entitled to receive a capital distribution he will also be treated as if he had, in consideration of a capital distribution, disposed of an interest in the units and, therefore, be liable for tax on it.  Is there not a danger there of the same gain basically being taxed twice, first in the hands of the trustees and secondly in the hands of the individual unit holder?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, there are two elements in both unit trusts and companies.  First of all, there is the company itself and then there are the shareholders.  Shareholders get benefit because they avail of the benefit which coming together confers on them in the company and, in companies which make capital gains, the companies would be liable.  Afterwards, if the capital is distributed to the shareholders, the shareholders will, according to their several responsibilities, be liable if personally they are liable.  Unit trusts are being treated in exactly the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>But in fact special provisions are being made for unit trusts that are not being made for companies.  Therefore, to that extent are they being treated in exactly the same way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will have to be separately mentioned.  The treatment of them is similar to that of companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Colley asked, is there ever, in practice, a <Col N="573" /> capital distribution from a unit trust? Surely the capital appreciation is reinvested and increases the value of the units.  The whole point of the unit trust would be to operate in that way rather than to distribute to the members as special distributions out of capital.</P>

      <P>In page 31, subsection (1) (c), line 29, after &ldquo;managers,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In replying to the debate on Second Stage I undertook to look again at the conditions laid down in this section which would have to be satisfied before a unit trust could enter into a special arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners.  I now feel that the condition in paragraph (d) of subsection (1) might impose a severe restriction <Col N="576" /> on a unit trust desiring to enter into such an arrangement particularly in so far as it relates to the distribution of capital gains.  Therefore, by this amendment I propose to delete this condition.  I take it the House has the amendments concerned before it and that I do not need to read them out?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>In regard to amendment No. 34a, the definition of &ldquo;distribution period&rdquo; is no longer required following the deletion of paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 32, by amendment No. 34, and accordingly the words &ldquo;distribution period&rdquo; are being deleted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to the amendment.  It would be difficult to envisage any unit trust distributing 80 per cent of its capital gains and income in a particular year. It would be a somewhat improvident unit trust that would do that.  The condition being imposed would have made it impossible for the unit trust to comply with it and I begin to wonder whether some of the other conditions in subsection (2) may be difficult to comply with.  The other two amendments apart from the deletion of paragraph (d) seem to be consequential and they do not call for any comment.  I take it that no requirement is being made about the retention of any particular percentage or the payment out of any percentage of the aggregate of the income on chargeable gains of a unit trust for a year or a distribution period?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>From my limited knowledge of unit trusts, I do not know if any of them could comply with subsection (2).  Possibly they could comply with it for a while, but they would reach the stage when they would no longer be able to do so.  The first condition says:</P>
      <P>not less than 80 per cent of the units were held by persons who acquired them pursuant to an offer made to the general public,</P>
      <P>I assume that is an advertisement inviting subscriptions.  The majority of unit trusts are quoted not on the Stock Exchange but by their managers giving weekly or monthly buying and selling prices.  In that, there is an implication of an offer to the public.  After a while, less than 80 per cent of the units held may have been bought, not as a result of the original offer or advertisement, but in the course of normal trading by people watching the fluctuating price of the units.  That is not an offer to the general public in the normal sense.  Is it to be regarded as such?</P>

      <P>But they are not advertising all the time.  They are simply quoting in the list of unit trusts which are published in the <i>Financial Times</i> and other papers their buying and selling prices each Thursday or Friday. They are not holding themselves out to the public as such, or if they are, presumably <Col N="580" /> everyone who buys is buying pursuant to an offer made to the general public.  Therefore, the question of &ldquo;not less than 80 per cent of the units being held by persons who acquired them pursuant to such an offer&rdquo; could arise.  Could the Minister tell me exactly what &ldquo;pursuant to an offer made to the general public&rdquo; is?</P>

      <P>The object of that provision is clear enough&mdash;to prevent people having their own private unit trust and using it as a method to avoid liability for capital gains tax.  In my view, Deputy O'Malley has a point. The phrase &ldquo;not less than 80 per cent of the units were held by persons who acquired them pursuant to an offer made to the general public&rdquo; would seem to suggest that even if one accepts that once they are on offer that does not necessarily mean an advertisement. How does one ensure that a person who wants to operate this for his own benefit will not acquire them &ldquo;pursuant to an offer made to the general public&rdquo;?  This could be done and what the Minister is trying to achieve here would be defeated.  The phrase &ldquo;acquired pursuant to an offer made to the general public&rdquo; is sufficiently ambiguous to cover either situation&mdash;the one suggested by Deputy O'Malley or the situation I am suggesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>I shall do my best. This section includes two main measures to prevent avoidance of capital gains by the use of arrangements entered into by what are called connected persons.  The first measure provides that an acquisition or disposal between connected persons is to be treated as not being a bargain made at what lawyers call arm's length or an agreed bargain in the open market place.  In those circumstances, market value is to be substituted for the actual consideration because it is considered that the actual consideration is not the open market value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second main measure is that a loss on the transfer of an asset between connected persons will be allowable only against a gain made on a disposal to the same person.  A further measure provides that restrictive covenants imposed on an asset transferred from one connected person to another are to be given only limited weight in valuing the asset transferred.  The rules for determining if persons are connected follow those for income tax purposes contained in section 96 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Generally, connected persons include husbands and wives and their relatives, the trustee of a settlement and the settlor, partners of a partnership, apart from <Col N="582" /> acquisitions and disposal of partnership assets under a <i>bona fide</i> commercial agreement, and companies under the same control.  The House will see that &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo; is defined in subsection (7).  I can go into the subsection if the House wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision refers to &ldquo;companies under the same control or under the control of connected persons&rdquo;.  That comes into the definition of &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo; and it raises a point about companies coming under the same control.  That seems to be extraneous to the idea of a connected person.  As the Minister said, husbands, wives and their relations, trustees in a settlement and partnerships are all right, but we have this provision later on in subsection (7):</P>
      <P>(d) a company is connected with another company&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) if the same person has control of both, or a person has control of one and persons connected with him, have control of the other, or</P>
      <P>(ii) if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by one or more persons with whom he is connected;</P>
      <P>I know what the Minister and his advisers and the Revenue Commissioners are trying to get at but I am wondering how far legislation can pursue this point.  There are many ways of evasion.  The control of a public company with shares may be in the hands of a hidden trust, which would be quite easy to arrange.  If there is a group and if one person in the group is connected but the majority are not, is that the control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take a specific case.  If you had two companies with a public issue and if in effect one person was in a position to have an effective controlling interest in both, while that person could join others with him in the guise of trustees having control of one, and if he did the same thing in the other, the majority, say five in <Col N="584" /> each case but with only one connected person in each group, where are you?  Is that control or is it not? I know the Revenue Commissioners will have ways of getting after that by inquiring where the revenue is going and where the interest is going. My point is simply that prolixity and attempted exhaustiveness in legislation may be futile where the thing that matters is the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In this connection I find the wording of the explanatory memorandum, from a legal point of view, preferable to the attempts in the Bill itself at defining what is meant.  If a court were asked to construe the powers of the Revenue Commissioners or the rights of an appellant under this section, it is much clearer in the words of the explanatory memorandum which states that companies under the same control are under the control of the connected persons, and so forth. We are back to the old rule of law that operates so much in regard to testamentary depositions.  Where technical language is used, the matter is technically construed, but where one resorts to legal forms, then strict legality is applied.  Where general terms are used with common and general meanings, the court will look to the common and accepted meanings. There are cases where the general phrase is preferable to the other.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Apparently it is not deemed necessary to provide in this Bill for that contingency.  I know what the Minister is aiming at, to get the real market in this situation, but it may not be that easy to make this section work.  I can see certain injustices that could arise as regards the open market value.  Take the case of a man down the country who puts his farm up for sale and it is generally known that one of the relations will bid for that farm.  I have as good a knowledge of sales in the country as anybody else. Do we all not know that the open market value there will not be a true market value, because it is generally accepted that you will not bid against the relations?  Do I take it that the Revenue Commissioners will have to accept that value arrived at in the open market?  Even if the property is withdrawn, is that the market value the Revenue Commissioners will take?</P>
      <P>I should like to know how the Revenue Commissioners will assess the value of the property in a deal at an arm's length, a private deal.  What the property is worth in being transferred within the family and what it would be worth on the open market might be two different things.  The Revenue Commissioners might get the wrong end of the stick in trying to assess the value in a family circle.  Certainly if I were caught by that section I would put my property on the open market. It might be a rude awakening as to what the offer would be, but I take it that if a property is put on the open market for valuation purposes and there is an exceptionally low bid, the Revenue Commissioners will be compelled to accept that value.  That would be my reading of it, and I think that is the interpretation the Revenue Commissioners would have to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of value property in this country today and if it was put up for sale at this time it would not be worth half of what it cost to build.  In this present situation I think it would be legitimate for a family to put a value on property of half of <Col N="586" /> what it cost to build and that the Revenue Commissioners would have to accept it, just as I think the Revenue Commissioners would have to accept the valuation of a farm arrived at at a sale in which only the relatives are bidding for that farm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there are many influences upon the market: there can be a boycott; there can be fashion; there can be popular demand; there can be intrinsic value of the assets, many things, and probably nobody is better informed in these matters than the Valuation Office.  It is the Revenue Commissioners who make the decision and they could invoke the aid of the Valuation Office in coming to a decision.  However, it is provided in the Bill that disposals and acquisitions are deemed to be at market value, and if there is any reason to doubt that they are at market value, then they can be duly assessed.  If, of course, any person affected by an assessment does not like it, he has the right to appeal against the assessment by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come to the point Deputy de Valera made about the complex description of the several arrangements which can take place and the difficulty of defining what is a controlled company and what is not a controlled company, as he has himself acknowledged on previous occasions, the very complexity of statutes nowadays is a tribute to the ingenuity of people who can find ways around the Ten Commandments. <Col N="587" /> If they had been our first Statute Law here, I am sure by now we would have many volume explaining that the various liberties that people have taken in the interpretation of them were, in fact, contrary to the original spirit.  Indeed, I suppose the interpretation of these things is what a great deal of Christian thinking today is about.  It is not in statutory form but the very complexity of laws nowadays is due to the fact that people have used artificial legal persons between themselves and the Revenue Commissioners and there is no end to the number of such arrangements that can be made.  I suppose the more ingenious they are the more it may be necessary to close them off in legislation, because it may be found that the Revenue Commissioners, within their existing powers and permitted discretions, are unable to deal with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister on that latter point.  However, it is for this reason I would like to suggest that in new legislation of this nature it is better&mdash;this is a comment I make on the section as a whole fully realising that a last-minute change of the kind I am talking about may not be possible, and therefore I am not going to press the point too hard, although I think it is a valid and important one to make&mdash;to take the simple form I spoke of earlier and then close the loopholes quickly as they arise on the cases, because they would arise only on the cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to detain the House on this issue, but it is of some general validity for this type of legislation.  It is a mistake to try to foresee every case, because you complicate the issue both for the Revenue Commissioners and for everyone else and make administration all the more difficult.  I think the approach should be a simple general discretion coupled with the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners. If you do it the way I am suggesting the Revenue Commissioners have a wider discretion.  After all, it is they who will make the decisions; it is the other who will have to appeal. If they use their discretion in the way <Col N="588" /> they think it should be done, well and good; if the court upholds them, so much the better.  If somebody has found his way through, let them come in fast and deal with it.  If the thing is blatant enough I do not know&mdash; although it is against all the principles I have ever advocated in a case like this&mdash;that I would not put in a proviso in the legislation foreseeing the possibility of retrospection in the sense that you can attach a penalty to anybody who is found to have got away with something in that.</P>
    <P>I am recommending that approach because we are talking about anti-avoidance and this whole part of the Bill is bound to bristle with this kind of thing: where you attempt to foresee everything and to legislate for it you get complexities and, as you know, somebody will find a loophole.  I am urging this very much on the Minister. I know there are certain urgencies involved but I am almost tempted to urge strongly on the Minister that he take this part of the Bill and look at it again from the point of view I am advocating, to the extent that one would deliberately foresee that a case would go against the Revenue Commissioners and, if necessary, to be ready to deal with that situation on an emergency basis and even bring in some sort of general penalty clause in the case of a blatant breach of the intention shown on the straight words. I shall not labour that point further.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the section, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, can have consequences in regard to market value.  The Minister spoke about the Valuation Office, but one of the difficulties about relying too much on the Valuation Office by itself is that the Valuation Office is virtually part of the State organisation and if you put too much of a burden on it in a matter like this you put them in an <i>ex parte</i> position.  I would be careful to avoid difficulties about simply saying: &ldquo;The Valuation Office will give you the answer&rdquo;.  If the House takes that sort of approach with the Valuation Office or any other Department of State we must be careful that we are not merely passing the buck.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has a perfectly <Col N="589" /> good point about market value, but I do not see how one can get over it on the intention here because, obviously, we will not disagree that some safeguard in regard to connected persons is required and that what is stated in the explanatory memorandum on section 33 is reasonable.  It is not so much what you are doing but the way in which you are doing it that matters here.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) is all right until we come to the proviso which is:</P>
    <P>Provided that this subsection shall not apply to a disposal by way of gift in settlement if the gift and the income from it is wholly or primarily applicable for educational, cultural or recreational purposes, and the persons benefitting from the application for those purposes are confined to members of an association of persons for whose benefit the gift was made, not being persons all or most of whom are connected persons.</P>
    <P>Apart from why a proviso of that nature needs to be put in we come exactly to the point I am dealing with &mdash;&ldquo;all or most of whom&rdquo;.  The difficulty arises there because if it is not &ldquo;all&rdquo;, what is &ldquo;most&rdquo;?  Does it mean the simple majority?  That can be dealt with.  Perhaps I had better pause here to let the Minister say exactly why he feels this proviso is necessary, in this section, why if there is something substantive to be done in regard to this proviso it cannot be done in a positive way in the body of the bill and taken out of the anti-avoidance section.  You are really trying to put in a saver and that can very often be expressed positively. The less of this kind of thing you have in an anti-avoidance section, in the interests of those who have to administer this already very difficult and onerous code, the better.  Would the Minister comment on that proviso?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) limits the availability of the loss which accrues to a person making a disposal of an asset.  It may only be used against a gain made on disposal of an asset to the person who acquires the asset.  It is a restriction on the <Col N="590" /> use of the loss.  Where the disposal is done for these purposes which are deemed to be good purposes, deserving of encouragement, it is considered that the restriction should not apply. It operates to the benefit of the person making the disposal.  The Deputy raises this in the context of saying that the legislation should not be any longer than it need be and that we should await actual cases before spelling out any further details necessary to protect the revenue.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that. To come back to what we were talking about earlier, the definition of &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo;, we have, in fact, achieved a briefer definition of what is contained in section 96 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  In so far as we have any lengthy sections they are almost on all-fours with what is in the 1967 Act because here we are relying on experience and the need to draft them in this particular way. The one small amendment that there is something which has appeared to be necessary in the light of subsequent events.  You will find it in paragraph 7 (f) where the words &ldquo;or to acquire a holding in a company&rdquo; have been added.  They were not in the 1967 Act but a great deal has happened in the last eight years which justifies the inclusion of the additional words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) is most important because it could have effects on gifts which would not be equitable or, perhaps, foreseen by most people.  A disposal between connected people is a definition wide enough to cover the ordinary gift as between a father and son.  If a father makes a gift of something, the value of which is easily ascertainable, such as shares in a public company which are quoted on the stock exchange, and if, in making that disposal by way of <Col N="591" /> gift, he suffers a loss it is a <i>bona fide</i> genuine loss.  If he had bought shares a year ago at £2 apiece and at the time he made the gift to his son they were £1 apiece he suffered a loss of £1 per share and it is a <i>bona fide</i> loss. The value of the shares is ascertainable and it is a genuine value.  If he were selling them he would sell them at the price at which they are valued for the purpose of the gift to the son and there is no question, therefore, of their value on the day they are given to the son not being a genuine value. Why should that loss not be allowable except in relation to chargeable gains accruing to him on some other disposal of a different asset to the same person?  If a man has four sons and four different sets of shares of public quoted companies and on a particular day he decides to make a distribution to his four sons and two of the shares are showing a capital loss from the time that he acquired them and two are showing a capital gain, and let us assume, for the purpose of the argument, that the losses approximately outweigh the gains under subsection (3), you would have the position that the gains would be chargeable to capital gains tax but the losses would not be allowable against the gains.  I think that is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To bring it a step further, if there is a <i>bona fide</i> capital loss on a gift to one son and, at the same time, there is a <i>bona fide</i> capital gain on a gift to another son, why can one not be set off against the other?  If the father made a gift of something on which there was no loss he would be better off than he would be making a gift of something on which he is, in fact, incurring a capital loss; that, on the face of it, seems unfair and the proviso here to subsection (3) seems to apply only to gifts for educational, cultural and recreational purposes and so on where the beneficiaries are not mainly connected persons.  That would seem to indicate that a trust set up for the education of one's children or grandchildren by way of a gift of shares being put into a settlement and if <i>bona fide</i> losses are incurred on those shares on a particular day one is not entitled to set off the loss but, if <Col N="592" /> the settlement is for someone else's children or for general public purposes, one is entitled to set off the loss. That is too severe a restriction altogether on people who would wish to give gifts to their children or grandchildren, their nephews or their nieces.  Under subsection (3) they will find themselves in the position that, while gains will be chargeable for tax, the losses are not off-settable against the gains.  Would the Minister agree something should be done to allow a set-off of losses and gains on gifts when they are made to people of the same class?</P>

      <P>When a person sells stock on the stock exchange and loses on that transaction that would be a transaction standing on its own.  If subsequent to realisation a father decided to apply the cash by way of a cash gift to a son there would be no question of capital gains tax being applied.</P>

      <P>I understood the Deputy to have two cases in mind. The first was the sale of shares.  The loss there could be set off against any gain.  There would be no restriction at all.  The gift of money is a separate matter entirely.  As to the other case, the restriction is quite simple.  While there may be genuine cases, such as Deputy O'Malley illustrated, many other cases could be contrived so that people could arrange their disposals in the same way as they arrange their purchases and sales on the stock exchange every other day by engaging in a little speculation and after that using their skills and those of their brokers they make a little profit.  The people of substance could adjust the disposal of their property to one another so as to negative the whole purpose of capital gains taxation, which is to collect the tax on capital gains which are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the genuine case has to be caught because of the extraordinary inclination that wealthy <Col N="593" /> people, in particular, have to contrive cases to frustrate the intentions of Parliament.  So long as it is so I fear we must, in the words of St. Paul, see the innocent suffer for the guilty.  In regard to what the Deputy said, that it was done within the family, the father giving it away to his sons and that it should be treated in some special way which would distinguish it from others, if it was the case of the once only gift of father to son, because this was all his property, I suppose he might use the right day when he would pay least tax by having the right amount of loss to set off against the right gains.  He would be very fortunate to arrive at that particular arrangement.  I am afraid the whole system would be so open to a multitude of contrivances that we could not allow a free setting off of losses amongst connected persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister, in what he has said, has to some extent given the people who find themselves in this predicament the very solution to their problem?  If their loss is not allowable on, for example, a gift to a son of shares surely the solution is, as the Minister says, to sell the shares, incur your loss in financial terms and then hand over the money? So far as the child is concerned he has only immediately to re-invest the money and he is back where he stood but the parent has had the benefit of the capital loss which he can set off against any capital gains there may be on a gift to another child.  Why should people have to go through the only slightly laborious and rather roundabout system of actually having to sell the shares and then buy them back again in order to avoid the penalty which is imposed on <i>bona fide</i> transactions in subsection (3)?</P>

      <P>It is the anti-avoidance section that is so described and so intended.  I can see that situations, such as those described by Deputy O'Malley, may arise but this will only happen if some person wants specifically to set off a loss against a gain. If they are to gain an advantage, as is their intention by that particular cumbersome process, instead of transferring <Col N="594" /> the shares, so be it.  I do not think they are put to any great inconvenience. Is it such a terrible imposition if the purpose of their device is to avoid paying tax?</P>

      <P>No.  Deputy O'Malley was talking about selling shares so as to use the loss to set off against a gain elsewhere.

      <P>The Minister seems to assume that everyone who makes a gift to one of his children, a nephew or somebody like that, is engaged in tax avoidance.  He really has this on the brain, not just in this Bill but in all his other Bills.  He is always talking about evaders and avoiders.  If I want to give a gift to my son why should I immediately be labelled as a tax evader?</P>

      <P>The Minister says if anyone gives a gift to his son and there is a capital loss on that he cannot set it off against other capital gains.  He goes on to say that if tax avoiders want to sell the shares and hand over the money instead let them do it.  People giving gifts to their children are not tax avoiders.  The Minister seems to think that everyone who does anything naturally is doing it for tax avoidance purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking about people who do not know what this section or Bill is about.  They do not even know what capital gains tax is but possibly at this moment they are in the process of giving a gift to a son.  That gift will mean a capital loss to them. People think that in this country we have won freedom so dearly that it is all right to give gifts to one's children.  Those people will discover to their horror in about six months' time that there was a capital loss involved in one of the gifts and capital gain was involved in the gifts to the <Col N="595" /> other children.  Those people will be charged capital gains tax as well as the various other new taxes on the gifts to their other children but will not be allowed to set off the capital loss in the gift to one child against the gifts to other children.  That is seriously wrong.  It is also wrong for the Minister to allege that people only give gifts to their children in order to evade tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat the problem and it is a very definite problem that arises on subsection (3) of section 33 in connection with perfectly ordinary <i>bona fide</i> gifts by a parent to a child.  If a gift is made on which there is a capital loss at the disposal &mdash;the example I have given is publicly quoted shares&mdash;that capital loss is offsettable or allowable only against gifts on which there is a capital gain to the same person and not, for example, to other members of the same family or to other persons connected with the donor.  This can be extremely unfair because capital gains tax can be chargeable on a gift to a particular child of a donor because the value of the shares or other assets on the particular day of the gift were higher than they were on the day on which they were acquired by the donor.  Capital gains tax would be payable accordingly.  If, on the very same day, another gift is made to another child on which there is a capital loss shown that loss is not offsetable or allowable against the capital gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I have discussed the obvious way there is around this. The donor sells the shares, and hands the money to the son.  The son buys back the same shares at the same price and the loss is allowable to the donor.  I can see no possible justification for having to put people to the <Col N="596" /> slight extra trouble and extra expense of doing that.  Why not allow a man to give his own child a gift and if a loss is incurred or entailed thereby let that be offsetable?  I am sure there are many Members of this House, the Members who only visit us now and again by courtesy of Deputy Lalor or others, who do not realise that a capital gains tax is payable on gifts to children.  Very few people in the country realise it.  Capital gains tax is payable in those circumstances on gifts to children and where a capital loss is incurred in a gift to a child it is quite wrong that it is not allowable against whatever other capital gains might arise on other gifts to other children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was listening to the Minister's response to the case made by Deputy O'Malley on subsection (3) and it seemed to me that the Minister was agreeing that Deputy O'Malley had a valid point.  Indeed he was going even further and agreeing that there was a way around the difficulty, perhaps presenting a certain amount of problems for people but not a great deal.  Nevertheless, he said so be it because this was designed to prevent avoidance of capital gains tax.  I doubt if that attitude is really justified on the part of the Minister.  It is one thing to say that the subsection is necessary to prevent avoidance and to say that it is unfortunate that genuine cases will suffer as a result. One could discuss that proposition but the Minister is going further and saying there is a way around this. In the case described by Deputy O'Malley the father can sell the shares.  Thereby he will establish his capital loss and be able to set it off against his capital gains, give the money to the son who can purchase the shares at the low price and the object is achieved.  Despite that the Minister says he must retain this subsection. Would the Minister examine that a little further?  If it is so easy to get around the anti-avoidance measure in subsection (3) and if at the same time it is creating problems for genuine cases, is it really worth retaining this provision or is it the position that far wider avoidance <Col N="597" /> could be indulged in if subsection (3) were removed?  If that is so, perhaps the Minister would tell us in what way this could happen?  On the face of it it would appear that it is a nominal anti-avoidance measure but ineffective and at the same time creating problems for genuine cases.  In those circumstances, the Minister should either show us that there is a good deal more involved than is already indicated or should take away this ineffective anti-avoidance measure.</P>

      <P>I doubt if, in any year, there would be as many as half a dozen of those hypothetical cases occurring.  There might not be one in six years.  A father who on the one day has four sons that he calls together and says: &ldquo;Now, my dear children, I am going to dispose of my assets to you but, unfortunately, I am going to make a loss in disposing of some stocks and shares to you, Johnny and Paddy, and I am going to make a gain on what I am giving away to you, Mark and Anthony, and the terrible injustice has been done by Oireachtas Éireann that I cannot set off those losses against those gains&rdquo;.

We either discourage avoidance or else we allow it to operate freely.  It seems to me to be making a mockery of our whole society to say that we are introducing a capital gains tax and have a Bill which provides no means by which the Revenue Commissioners can stop avoidance.</P>

      <P>No.  I said that the case with which Deputy O'Malley began was one in which a person <Col N="598" /> could take steps to use the loss against some gains being made somewhere else.  This word &ldquo;loss&rdquo; that we are talking about here is a notional one in many respects because this device will only be used by somebody who is making a gain elsewhere.  The loss will be used to reduce tax liability. It is not a crushing blow to the person's net fortune if the loss occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a gain is being made elsewhere the position is net. It is neutral.  The person who decides not to give his stocks and shares because there is some loss on them which he cannot use in whatever way he wants against some particular gain he knows of, will sell the stocks and suffer a loss and then make a cash gift.  The person who gets the cash gift, according to Deputy O'Malley, then proceeds to purchase the shares back again.  The market might be right and in the end they might finish up in a less advantageous position than if they had taken the shares directly.  There are too many uncertainties here, too many imponderables. We are really spending a lot of time &mdash;I am not querying the right of Deputies to do so&mdash;on a situation which people of substance will find some way around if they really want to by adjustment, by waiting, by forecasting, by consulting tax advisers, by getting their stockbrokers to advise them, by reading the newspapers.  We are not dealing with a once and for all situation which faces the average family.  We are asked to amend the law in some way or other to deal with this hypothetical case.</P>

      <P>It is a discouragement. It is not everybody who will go to the trouble of going to the Stock Exchange and run the risk of a sale and an ultimate purchase which may <Col N="599" /> be in another loss-making situation when he can simply assign the shares over to his son and not involve himself in any capital gains tax.  If a loss has been made or if no gain has been made, the transfer to the child will not involve any capital gains liability. The only case we are asked to consider is the case in which there are four sons and where there is a loss on the shares transferred to two of them and a gain made on the transfer to the others.</P>
      <P>This section is designed to prevent people from contriving situations which any person engaged in the stock market could easily arrange between connected persons by, as it were, perpetually keeping all balls in the air so that none falls to the floor because the one which falls to the floor might involve a tax liability.  If you are a good juggler you can keep them up in the air all the time.  Here we are asked to amend this legislation so that people can let the balls fall on the floor if they want to without any tax liability.  If people want to keep juggling so as to engage in tax avoidance, I say let them; but let them expend their own energy on it and do not let us waste any more time in Parliament on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has fairly aptly described the section.  Before introducing this Bill into the other House he should seriously consider what I have suggested.  The Minister talked earlier about the 1894 Act.  Nowadays the courts will get away from the idea that the Revenue Commissioners are, so to speak, the publicans of the gospels to be anathemised. They are a very important element of the State.  All citizens realise that the functioning of our lives to a large extent depends on their efficiency.  The court would get away from the idea that everything must be severely interpreted against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If simple anti-avoidance provisions were put in here and if more reliance were placed on the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners the courts would uphold them in the appropriate cases.  It is very hard to recollect a case that went unreasonably to the <Col N="600" /> courts from the point of view of the State.  I would strongly urge on the Minister that since he is having a rethink on capital taxation there should be a rethink on our whole approach to the duties of the Revenue Commissioners. We are talking about tax avoidance and we are thinking, rightly, about the too clever people who will take advantage of the law at the expense of the community.</P>
    <P>We do not give enough thought to the fact that we may be looking at the Revenue Commissioners from the point of view that they might be exceeding their powers, which is the traditional point of view and the wrong one in the present context.  I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider this part of the Bill and to try to bring in a new concept to promote the idea with the public, the courts and the House that the Revenue Commissioners are an essential, constructive and important part of the State service and that it is the duty of the citizens to uphold and protect them.  They should not be regarded as criminals when they come into court.  They should not be regarded with suspicion.  This is the traditional approach to the taxman. It is an old approach.  Things have changed.  That approach may have been appropriate 50 or 100 years ago. If we trust our Government&mdash;I am talking in general terms now; I do not mean the present Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If we trust our Parliament, our Government, our civil service, as we do, why single out the Revenue Commissioners in this way? We facilitate avoidance by this kind of legislation, by tying their hands. The interpretation I am suggesting would be made in the courts in favour of the State and of the commissioners reasonably and <i>bona fide</i> doing their work, as they do.  A whole rethink is desirable on these anti-avoidance measures.  I appeal to all judges and to all the people concerned to adopt the appropriate approach to this problem. If we are rethinking our social policy and putting it into effect in regard to capital, perhaps we should <Col N="601" /> think about the enforcement and collection end as well.  There should be a complete rethink on this part of the Bill.</P>

He realises, and so do his advisers, that where a code like this is concerned, especially a new one, ingenuity will find answers if there is enough money involved.  Why not take the other chance?  If he is being forced to take that chance, why not take the chance that, if he makes it general enough, the courts, the public as a whole and the House will support the Revenue Commissioners and will be less tied by technical details and freer to do the good job they do?

It has been suggested that I am obsessed with avoidance and evasion.  I am not; I am as inclined as anybody else to pay no more tax than I have to pay, and I do not expect anybody to pay any more tax than the law requires, but I also have a sense of duty to the public to ensure that laws which require taxes to be paid are given sufficient strength, or to use the colloquial word, teeth, to ensure that the tax is collected, and it would be wrong in the present state of the law and the public attitude and without disrespect to the courts, the courts' interpretation of law, to leave it to the recital of a simple phrase which would simply say that the Revenue Commissioners shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that no person thought to be liable to tax will avoid it by measures which go against the spirit as well as the letter of the legislation.</P>

I would say of those who said that that they were not aware of how short the Ten Commandments are.  We live in an age when it becomes more and more difficult for parliamentary draftsmen to interpret our simple wishes in simple ways and I have experienced, as has every other member of this and previous Governments, the terrible frustration of expressing a simple thought in answer to a public demand, to meet some public demand, and then to see it come out in blurred pages of incomprehensive print, and one wonders how it became necessary to express oneself in that way.  It is because we live in a democracy.  If we had dictators who could issue simple edicts and depend on their cohorts to carry them out without question, the laws could be made simple, but I am afraid that as long as we live under a system of democracy which allows people to avoid the laws as well as respect them, we will always be faced with rather lengthy provisions.</P>

      <P>The Precepts have since been modified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Take one of these Precepts&mdash;but no, I will not take any of them because we cannot afford to be facetious.  This is too serious a matter.  I want to illustrate what I mean and then I will leave it.  Instead of this whole section, at the end of which you have, fair enough, a definition of &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo;, though I did criticise the wording and did say that &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo; are better defined in the explanatory memorandum than in the Bill&mdash;define &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo; and then simply say in some form or other &ldquo;advantage shall not be taken by connected persons of the fact that they are connected to avoid the provisions of this Act&rdquo;.  There is literally an off-the-cuff anti-avoidance provision.  In the interpretation of this Act, the Act will be so construed that advantage must not or shall not be taken by connected persons of the fact of that connection to effect avoidance of the provisions of this Act.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that, suitably dressed up, that off-the-cuff section which I suggest would be much more effective than this long, very expert and very commendable effort of the draftsman, and I am sure that both the Revenue Commissioners and any advisers the Minister had have had some agonising hours trying to perfect this provision, all stemming from the fact that tradition, so to speak, has put them in the dock and not the person who should be in it.</P>
      <P>In the deserving cases a simple provision like that would sway the court and bring the court 100 per cent in favour of these deserving cases.  I speak as one who has had experience of courts as had the Minister and Deputy Colley.  We all know that such a simple provision would ensure that in all reasonable cases the Revenue Commissioners would have no trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, as a lawyer, knows well that when a case comes to advice lawyers look to see where they can concatenate or disconnect complex provisions.  One either builds a fence by connection for protection or, by disconnection, opens a way to get <Col N="605" /> through.  The thing one can never get through is a simple straightforward statement that is unlimited.  I commend to the Minister that for connected persons the simple provision should be inserted.  The explanatory memorandum, in its definition of connected persons, is ideal.  Having defined connected persons we should say that advantage should not be taken by connected persons of the fact of their connection or to avoid the provisions of the Act.  I know that is not sufficient and it needs more thought.  If the Minister does something on those lines he will have done a great job for the public and will have helped considerably to ease the burden of those administering this onerous load we are about to place on their shoulders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach recommended by Deputy de Valera has much to commend it and the sheer simplicity of it is its most attractive feature if it were to work.  There is not any doubt but that it would work to the advantage of the Revenue Commissioners and the genuine taxpayer who was experiencing difficulty.  I realise a number of the difficulties involved but, nevertheless, it is a most interesting approach which could produce dramatic results.  In the meantime, however, we are faced with the traditional situation which means that we get complex sections which produce, in some cases, pretty silly results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On principle I have an objection to enacting the kind of provision contained in subsection (3).  On the Minister's own admission this will be ineffective in preventing avoidance.  It will merely create difficulty for those who want to avoid tax and will not be effective or even half effective.  At the same time it will create difficulties for the genuine case which the Minister agrees exists.  Having regard to the fact that this does not purport to be an effective anti-avoidance subsection the Minister ought to take it out.  Why should we enact a provision which we know is ineffective?  It is not a question of surmise in this case because it is clear that it is ineffective in dealing with avoidance measures by taxpayers. <Col N="606" /> I have had suspicions of this kind about some provisions but I do not think I have ever come across a provision that was so clearly ineffective before it was enacted and, at the same time, was going to create difficulties for the genuine case.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason for enacting a provision like that?  If there is not&mdash; I do not think the Minister has tried to convince us there is&mdash;why should we enact it?  Is it not making a mockery of the whole effort at anti-avoidance to enact a provision which without any difficulty can be got around?  The Minister told us that this can be got around by virtually anybody. What is the point of enacting that type of legislation?  It is not a question of convenience or otherwise because in principle it is wrong to enact that kind of provision knowing it will not work and that the only people who will suffer are genuine cases not engaged in avoidance at all. The Minister should think again about subsection (3).  He has not attempted to tell us that it is necessary except on the grounds of making life a bit difficult.  That is not enough.  Unless it will be effective in dealing with people trying to avoid liability there is no point in enacting it.</P>

      <P>The only case that we have been discussing for more than an hour is the question of a father bringing together four sons to distribute stocks and shares.  That is only one form of asset that can be passed on, but there are cash gifts, land, business interests and so forth and all those arrangements are caught by these sections.  Very few if any of those will involve a loss situation.  We have had a most interesting debate which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Deputy de Valera has referred to my preoccupation with the Ten Commandments, and I am one of the poorest observers of them, but this part of the Bill is concerned with those who seek or are concerned with the Eleventh Commandment and I do not have to recall that for anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And my reply also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he would explain the thinking behind section 34 and possibly give us an outline or example of the kind of case with which he is trying to deal here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section contains an anti-avoidance measure to prevent a device by which a valuable asset could be disposed of in separate parts, so that the sum of the value of each part is less than what the property would command as a unit.  In these circumstances the amount to be taken is the larger market value apportioned rateably over the separate disposals. The section would normally apply to transactions made by way of a gift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the following example will prove of some assistance.  For instance, take a piece of land worth £50,000.  If sold in five equal lots to <Col N="608" /> connected persons at £8,000 each, the aggregate value of the sales is £40,000, which is £10,000 less than if the aggregate had been sold together.  To deal with this situation section 34 provides that the value to be placed on each lot for capital gains tax purposes is £10,000 instead of £8,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose is clear enough; it is quite clear since the Minister gave that example.  But it seems to me that one or two questions arise therefrom.  The section provides that if a person is given or acquires from one or more persons with whom he is connected by way of two or more transactions, assets, etc. &mdash;as far as I can see there is no time limit laid down in respect of the two or more transactions.  Presumably, this could be a series of transactions extending over, say, 20 or 30 years. Apart from the question of uncertainty that that introduces, I am wondering about its practicality.  In the example given by the Minister, if the first portion is sold at £8,000, presumably the capital gain involved is based on a market value of £8,000 in the first instance.  Subsequently, and perhaps over a long period, other portions are sold.  But to determine what is the correct amount of tax payable in respect of each portion sold, presumably one has to wait until the last portion is disposed of and then go back, on the earlier transactions, to levy additional tax.  I do not know if I have the picture right.  Is this really a practical proposition as far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there are administrative difficulties here.  Of course, connected persons are connected during their respective life spans, I suppose, and no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>How many parts were there in the example the Minister gave?</P>

      <P>Five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, there could be five connected persons connected to the original person but they need not necessarily be connected to each other, need they?  It is only the person <Col N="609" /> disposing of the share who needs to be connected with the receiver of it; is not that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct but it is not improbable there would be a connection through him with each of the others.  I accept that the Deputy has a point when dealing with the time span over which one would deal with this situation because I can see that one could hive off part of a land holding in, say, 1975 to a connected person and might not dispose of any more for another 20 years, in which case, would one connect what happened in 1975 with what happened in 1995?</P>
      <P>This is a matter, like so many others, where the Revenue Commissioners would have to examine the facts of the case to see if the transactions were related, apart from the relationship which might exist between the persons.  It is an area in which, as Deputy de Valera said discretion should be left to the Revenue Commissioners.  We cannot, in legislation, determine matters of that kind. But, where there is a clear case of a hiving off of land, say, in a matter of a couple of months, to eight connected persons, then I think there can be no serious argument about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, there is no problem there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another problem might arise if, for instance, somebody purported to sell half a house to one and half a house to another, in which case there cannot be any dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are questions of degree and it is very difficult to lay down rules here. If we tried to lay down rules, the only result would be that people would wait until they had complied with the rules and, an hour afterwards, proceed to do the very thing this section is designed to discourage.  We have to leave it to the common sense of people in general and the Revenue Commissioners, in particular, to ascertain what situations come within the ambit of section 34.  The probability is that there will be transactions of that kind which do not come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners.  On the other hand, if they do, the Revenue <Col N="610" /> Commissioners should be empowered to deal with them, and that is really what section 34 does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister about the difficulty perhaps about spelling out rules in this regard. Nevertheless, we ought not pass the section without some consideration being given to the consequences.  The consequences in so far as the connected persons are concerned do not worry me too much, because presumably this section will be invoked only where the object of the exercise was to avoid tax, though I can conceive of a situation in which some of the connected persons might be virtually innocent parties to it and find themselves, long years afterwards, being saddled with a bill for tax in respect of a transaction on which they thought they had discharged all of the tax. Nevertheless, I do not think there is any way round that.</P>
      <P>I should like to be fully satisfied of the position of a purchaser for value from one of the connected persons in respect of that person's share.  Can we be quite sure that no liability in respect of the additional tax that might be assessed at the end of the series of transactions, no liability whatever for that, can attach to the land or to a purchaser for value from one of the connected persons?  Is that so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister mentioned a requisition, one of the problems which arises here is that <Col N="611" /> there will be, presumably, a standard requisition to the effect of whether there is any outstanding claim for, say, capital gains tax.  The normal reply to that would be: not to vendor's knowledge.  How helpful is that in regard to a purchaser for value in due course?  In fact it may be that, to the vendor's knowledge, there is not such a claim although he may have knowledge of the fact that there could be such a claim if another piece of the original holding is sold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that it will be a matter for determination by the Revenue Commissioners on the facts of all cases, but if there is a division of property after a passage of time, which I would not be in a position to define tonight, they become such separate properties that one could not reasonably argue they were one.  It would be necessary to go back in time and to merge them together to calculate market values. These are matters that must be determined by the ordinary laws of common sense and business practice. They cannot be spelled out here.  If a portion of land is given by way of a gift to a son and if another portion is hived off after several years that is quite different to disposing of one property within a matter of a few months to several connected persons. In that case one could reasonably assume an intention to break up the property and to divide it as one transaction. It will have to be left to common sense to interpret this and if anyone considers the Revenue Commissioners are acting unreasonably they will have the right of appeal. If it can be shown the Revenue Commissioners went back 20 or 30 years to try to merge the properties that had become separated properties, I <Col N="612" /> am sure they would get little sympathy from the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to take from the tributes paid to the draftsman but I have a criticism to make in relation to the structure of this section and I am afraid the same complaint could be made of much of the finance legislation.  Indeed, there is a suspicion that it was deliberately done to make interpretation difficult.  I cannot see why in the preliminary part of the Bill it is stated: &ldquo;&lsquo;controlled company&rsquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 35 and &lsquo;control&rsquo; in relation to a company shall be construed accordingly&rdquo; while in the middle of this complicated section there is a definition that is obviously required for the whole Bill.  Why was it not possible to put the definition in the subsection into the preliminary part? That would have simplified the drafting and it would tidy up the legislation.  It could be put into section 2.  It makes me wonder why these definitions are put into tax avoidance sections only. These sections should be simplified, but a contributing factor to the complication is the specific discussion of a definition of this nature.  Since the definition is referred to in section 2 and presmably is required in relation to the entire Bill, I submit it is out of place here.</P>

It might be no harm if we had a round table conference of members <Col N="613" /> of all parties with the parliamentary draftsmen to see if it is necessary to have these forms of expression to achieve the objectives of the Government and Opposition.  If the answer was that there was no other way of doing it we would have to accept that, but we do not have available to us in the House the parliamentary draftsmen who are strangers to the discussions that take place here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>All the people concerned with controlled companies or transactions by controlled companies are connected persons.  Can the Minister state why it is necessary to have the provision in this section when it appears to be covered by section 33? If there is a transfer for less than the arm's length value, the revenue are entitled to value it at market value. Why is this elaborate procedure necessary about putting charges on the shares of the controlled company which makes the transfer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because we are dealing with shares which are something different from the company.  The section ensures that the anti-avoidance measures relating to connected persons are operated in full when the transfer of an asset at less than market value is a company under the control of a small number of persons.  If we did not have this section there would be a limitation on the effect of anti-avoidance measures.  On a transfer of the kind I have described, the value of the company's assets would fall and the value of the shares would fall <i>pro rata.</i> The further step needed if avoidance is to be wholly prevented is to make a compensating adjustment in the value of the shares.  Therefore, the section provides that in a case where a controlled company transfers an asset other than by way of bargain at arm's length, the cost attributed to the shares in the company when they come to be disposed of will be reduced by a proportionate part of the difference between the consideration for the asset and its market value.</P>

      <P>If under section 33 <Col N="615" /> there was a disposal to a connected person and the Revenue exercised their right under section 33 to calculate the capital gain on the basis of the market value, even though the transfer was by a control company, and imposed a surcharge of the difference between the market value and the actual price envisaged by section 35, would we not then have double taxation?  Revenue would have already got their full capital gains tax by virtue of the revaluation of the transfer to a connected person under section 33.</P>

      <P>No.  Supposing the asset had been transferred at its full value in the first instance, the shares would maintain their full value.  There would be a capital gains tax payable by the company on the disposal of the assets in the first instance.  The shares would be disposed of and would still be at their cost.  They might or might not according to the circumstances of the recipient or owners of the shares, be liable to tax.  One must ensure that the full gain is reflected in the shares at the time the shares are ultimately disposed of.</P>

      <P>My point is this: if Revenue know the control company is transferring an asset at below market value, they have power to calculate a tax on the basis of the true market value.  If they do that, can they not collect their tax?  Instead of collecting the tax as they would on a transaction between connected persons under section 33, why delay collecting the tax and collect it in the roundabout way by putting a surcharge on the reduced value of the shares in the control company?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of section 36 is to provide anti-avoidance measures against transferring capital to controlled companies abroad.  It enables Revenue to look through the non-resident controlled company to see if it has resident shareholders and, subject to certain exceptions, to assess them to capital gains tax on their share of the gains made by the company. The exceptions are when the gain is distributed to shareholders within two years; gains on tangible property or a lease on it used only for a trade carried on abroad; gains on the disposal of foreign currency or a credit in a foreign bank if used for a trade carried on wholly outside the State; and gains chargeable on the company itself as, for instance, on land or mineral rights or branch of a business in the State.  The essential things here is that we have to look through the company to see who are the resident beneficiaries and to make them liable to tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not answer my question.  I appreciate that it is necessary to be able to look through the company to the resident shareholders. Having done that, in a case similar to that described by the Minister under the last section where an asset is disposed of at an artificially low value, even if the tax is paid on the basis of the true market value as the Minister said in the previous case, nevertheless the value of the share would be reduced and unless the matter were carried further, the shareholders would be able to claim a loss which had been artificially created. My question is, is there provision in this section to deal with the shares so artificially reduced in value in the same way as there is in section 35?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The non-resident company is not taxable and therefore has less cause to engage in avoidance or in the disposal of assets at less than their value.  They would not be liable to Irish capital gains tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Accordingly, the value of the shares should reflect the absence of that liability to tax and the true value of the disposed assets, and accordingly the resident shareholders will eventually be taxed on the full value.  We do not live in an isolated world.  Non-resident companies, with increasing probability, will be located in countries that have their own capital gains tax system and they may be subject to such taxes in other countries. The Deputy may be assured that these are matters that will receive our attention in any agreements we have with other countries in order to avoid <Col N="618" /> double tax liability.  In doing so, we will have a better policing of these operations so as to put both the resident and the non-resident company, as far as practicable, on an equal footing.</P>

      <P>That is what I am coming at, whether they are being put on an equal footing&mdash;at least whether the shareholders of a resident and a non-resident company, shareholders who are resident in the State, are being put on an equal footing in these two sections of the Bill.  On the face of it, it seems to me they are not in so far as the Minister said that in the case of a resident company the shareholders having paid tax calculated on the full market value of an asset disposed of would in addition have this charge added on to their shares so as to prevent them claiming an artificial loss; but in the case of shareholders in a non-resident company who are resident in the State, would they be in a position to create an artificial loss of the kind that section 35 is designed to combat and would the Minister be able to do anything about it under section 36?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very good reason indeed for it.  It is because in this part of the Bill we are dealing with anti-avoidance and we do not want to facilitate the use of losses generated by non-resident companies for setting off against gains generated domestically.  Subsection (7) provides:</P>
      <P>(7) To the extent that it would reduce or extinguish chargeable gains accruing by virtue of this section to a person in a year of assessment, this section shall apply in relation to a loss accruing to the company on the disposal of an asset in that year of assessment as it would apply if a gain instead of a loss had accrued to the company on the disposal, but shall only so apply in relation to that person; and subject to the foregoing provisions of this subsection, this section shall not apply in relation to a loss accruing to the company.</P>

One has to see, without giving any favourable consideration to them, that at least they have basic justice meted out to them, and I wonder whether that is being done here.  It may be, but it is not quite clear to me.  When the Minister is talking about the properties concerned, is he talking about Irish resident shareholders in non-resident companies and their right to set off losses incurred in this country against gains in this country?  That, on the face of it, would appear to be a reasonable proposition, but the Minister seems to be saying that such persons, if they were unable to set off all their losses in this country against their gains in this country, could artificially create an avoidance situation.

      <P>It probably is the wrong word, I do not wish to be acrimonious about this, but, as Deputy Colley has said, people have rights.  I <Col N="624" /> spoke earlier about not having the Revenue Commissioners in the dark but let us not swing the pendulum to the other extreme and automatically put the ordinary citizens in the dark. There may be reasons for having such a company other than tax avoidance. Because of tax avoidance possibilities are you going to penalise the legitimate? Have you taken into account that a greater probability is that where such a company would be set up there will be local taxation and that the question really arising on this matter is one of multiple taxation rather than tax avoidance?</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister but I trust he will not take it amiss if I protest if we are drifting into a certain attitude of mind here in regard to this matter.  The Minister did say that he wished to discourage the formation of controlled companies extra-territorially. I do not think Deputy O'Malley was present when the Minister made this point.  There may be good social reasons for that apart from tax avoidance but let that stand on its own merits.  To say that we should use the brute force of the State and that everybody should mind himself if he can is the very attitude of mind against which we must guard.  It shows the pendulum swinging to the opposite extreme.  Let us remain in the equitable middle.  I do not want the pendulum to swing against the Revenue Commissioners or against the citizens either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at what is involved in a controlled company.  In such a company there will be capital gains or capital losses.  The gains will certainly be adding to any gains that accrue to the relevant resident taxable persons. Why should not the losses equally accrue in the same way?  That is my question.  So far, the only valid reason the Minister has given is tax avoidance in the first place.  I shall not repeat all I said on that because the repetition would be specific in relation to the futility, perhaps, of some of these provisions.  The question of multiple taxation as a certain protection comes into it.  Tax avoidance is one defensible reason the Minister has given although it is not to be pushed to the extent to which the Minister <Col N="625" /> pushed it in his remarks.  The other reason was a social reason.  If so, the place for dealing with this type of operation is, perhaps, not in a Capital Gains Tax Bill but under some other provision.  I wish to protest strongly at this late hour against our drifting into an attitude of mind which has been so conspicuously and commendably absent so far from our approach to this Bill on all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>Genuine foreign business activities are protected by subsection (4) (b): the remainder of the section deals with non-resident companies, tax havens and evasions of that nature which have primarily a tax avoidance purpose.  We are taxing the share of gains made abroad. We are allowing losses made abroad to be set off against those gains.  That is an equitable way of dealing with the matter.  If there is a genuine profit or a genuine business transaction, it is not affected.</P>

      <P>Specifically, no, but the agreements refer also to, and I quote, &ldquo;any identical or substantially similar taxes&rdquo;.  Capital gains tax is not identical or similar to income tax or corporation tax so special arrangements will be necessary to cover these new taxes, but most of the countries with which we have agreements have capital gains tax and we do not anticipate we will have any difficulty in resolving the issues.  Of course, as has happened in relation to other double taxation agreements, they can be made retrospective so that there will not be any loss to any person affected as a result of delay in completing agreements.  In fact, the practice is invariably to anticipate what the ultimate agreements will do.</P>

In other words, while they would normally be given free, subsection (1), presumably envisages the possibility of their being given at a nominal price.  Subsection (2) seems to say that in the circumstances of an asset forming part of settled property if any sum at all is paid, then the benefit of this section will not apply.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the disposal is made otherwise than under a bargain at arms length, the normal rule in section 9 is not to apply.  Instead there is no consideration for the disposal, that is if there is a pure gift, or if the consideration is less than the allowable cost of the asset giving a loss, then the transaction will be treated as resulting in neither a gain nor a loss and the body acquiring the asset will be deemed to acquire it at the same time and at the same cost as the person disposing of it.  Where the amount of the consideration results in a gain that gain will be a chargeable gain but such an eventuality is unlikely to arise.  Where there is a subsequent disposal there will be an occasional charge.  But as the State and most of the other bodies will be exempt the charge will apply mainly to charities set up for a limited period only with a view to obtaining the benefits of the section and with the real object of disposing of the transferred assets at a later date.  In this event the body concerned will be charged to capital gains tax on the whole gain computed by reference to the original cost of the asset to the person who originally transferred it to the body, thus negativing the relief afforded under the section.</P>

      <P>This section deals with a trustee or assignee in bankruptcy or under a deed of arrangement. It provides that vesting of the assets in the trustee or assignee or any subsequent retransfer of assets to the bankrupt or debtor are to be disregarded for capital gains purposes. Any chargeable gains accruing on disposal by the trustee or assignee are to be assessed on him.  Where the bankrupt or debtor dies the trustee or assignee is regarded as acquiring the assets as a personal representative of the deceased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the assignee sells certain assets are they to be subject to capital gains tax and, if so, would the Minister not consider it somewhat unfair in as much as the State is taking a guaranteed share of 26 per cent <Col N="637" /> of the capital gain out of limited assets where the estate of the debtor is insolvent and where the creditors will have their dividends correspondingly reduced by the amount of the tax which the State will get on the disposal by the official assignee or the assignee in bankruptcy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no more unfair than to say that the State is entitled to claim whatever income tax or VAT or any other tax which may be due to the State under the existing code. Either the State is entitled to be paid or it is not and if the liability to tax arises the obligation cannot be wiped clean simply because the person liable to pay the tax becomes bankrupt.  The State's claim is as good and not less worthy than the claim of any other creditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must see that the State's claim for income tax or VAT would have arisen before the insolvency and, therefore, before the vesting in the official assignee.</P>
      <P>In the case of capital gains tax, the capital gain could only arise not on the vesting in the official assignee but on the disposal by the official assignee for the benefit of the estate and the creditors of the estate.  Therefore, the indebtedness to the State for capital gains tax can only arise after the insolvency and the vesting in the official assignee take place.  It is quite different from liability to income tax or VAT which would have arisen before the insolvency.  I suggest that, if the vesting in the official assignee and any possible revesting of the assets in the original debtor should be free of capital gains tax, the disposal by the official assignee to a third party for the benefit of the creditors should equally be free.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter tonight.  I am conscious of the fact that it was raised before in the House.  I am raising it tonight because in my constituency it has become an extremely bitter topic.  I outlined the situation on 11th February and at that time the Minister indicated to me that his decision was held up in relation to the appointment of a headmaster in the Portlaoise vocational school.  This has been at issue for 12 months now. The Minister said he would make his decision when a copy of the legal advice which was being given to the Laois Vocational Committee was available to him.</P>
      <P>Last Tuesday I asked the Minister for Education if he had, as yet, studied the legal advice offered last March to the Laois County Vocational Education Committee in relation to its dispute with him and if he would announce his decision on the matter.  The Minister said he had seen the legal advice in question, that it was discussed at a meeting of the vocational educational committee on 14th April and that their views were conveyed to him in the minutes of that meeting.  He went on to say that he was now considering the views of the committee and that he would be in touch with them in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairman of the committee is quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 19th May, in an article which went into this matter in detail.  The chairman said that the legal opinion had satisfied him that the majority of the committee were right.  This committee are at present at loggerheads with the <Col N="639" /> Minister for Education.  In the article the writer recounts the strange history of the dispute between the Minister and the Laois Vocational Education Committee.  The article says that behind it&mdash;and &ldquo;it&rdquo; is my question&mdash; lies a long and bitter dispute which has brought the vocational education committee to the point of self-destruction and all on the apparently minor issues of the regulations governing the appointment of headmasters.</P>
    <P>The article goes on to discuss the possibilities.  There was a possibility that the Minister might dissolve the committee and take all decisions himself or that he would stand down and allow the committee to dictate to him. The third possibility was that he would allow it to drag on.  The article said the indications are that the Minister will choose the third possibility and the strange thing is that nobody, least of all the committee, seems to be concerned.  As a representative of Laois-Offaly, with particular emphasis on Laois because I look upon myself as a Laois representative, I want to say that a great number of people are interested.  The longer this goes on the greater the damage being done to education in County Laois.</P>
    <P>In a letter which he wrote on 18th September last the Minister said, as reported at Volume 278, column 167 of the Official Report, that it was essential in the interests of the pupils concerned that the vacant post of principal of Portlaoise vocational school should be filled immediately in accordance with the provisions of Memorandum V.7.  The committee refused to appoint the man they should have appointed.  He is the only person qualified. The Minister has said this.  I might point out that there is no dispute between the Minister and myself on this.  We both agree on what should be done.  I feel the Minister is shirking his responsibility in this regard. I know it is a difficult thing for him to do.  As a responsible Deputy for the area.  I do not want to see the Laois Vocational Education Committee being dissolved.  On the other hand, if we are to avoid having a miniature dictatorship set up, it is the only thing <Col N="640" /> to be done.  I am sorry for the responsible people&mdash;and there are a few responsible people&mdash;on that committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan is chairman of this committee.  I am sorry that he is not here tonight.  As the Fianna Fáil Whip I am aware that the reason for his not being here is that he is celebrating his birthday.  Deputy Flanagan knows me well enough to appreciate that anything I have to say about him I am willing to say to him.  I am sure he was aware that this matter was coming up tonight and that he was free to be here.</P>
    <P>This has now become a very serious issue.  Deputy Flanagan and the man I described before in the House as his sidekick, Councillor Keenan&mdash;unfortunately that reference was passed on to a reverend gentleman on the committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that his name is in the quotation.  There is a particular friend of Deputy Flanagan's on the county council. Both those people have set themselves up as virtual dictators in County Laois at county council level and vocational education committee level, and indeed at county committee of agriculture level, to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annoying feature about it is that in this article the writer goes into the possibility of the Minister dissolving the local education authority and says: &ldquo;The dissolution of a local education authority on the rather slender grounds of disregard of regulations which may not be regulations at all&rdquo;&mdash;this is according to the legal advice&mdash;&ldquo;will be a difficult decision politically, particularly for a Minister who has made a virtue of his desire for consultation and local <Col N="641" /> democracy.&rdquo; I do not want to take from any name or claim which the Minister may have in this regard.  I fully accept that we can have local democracy but for goodness sake, do not let us have local dictatorship.</P>
    <P>The last time I spoke in the House about this I spoke about the fact that previously on the old vocational committee, which was completely monopolised by one political party, Fine Gael, there were four members who supported doing the right thing, the adoption of the memo and the carrying out of regulations.  When the new vocational committee were constituted, those four representatives were removed from that committee by dictatorial action.  One of those people, this is the most horrible feature of it &mdash;I can name him because he is here in the House&mdash;was Deputy McDonald who wanted to do the right thing, to do what I want the Minister to do now, but who was removed by more powerful forces in his own organisation from that vocational committee simply and solely because he wanted to abide by the regulations which the Minister and his advisers had laid down.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister in this regard but I want to put on the records of the House the common belief of the people of my county as to the reason why the hands of the Minister are tied in this matter.  That common belief is that the Minister cannot rule in this issue on proper lines against the wishes of Deputy Flanagan, the chairman of the vocational committee, because the Taoiseach has a letter from Deputy Flanagan setting out what the alternatives will be if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This question was down on Tuesday last and I had repeated calls from <i>The Leinster Express</i> and <i>The Nationalist,</i> the two principal papers circulating in my area, on Thursday to know what was the outcome of the question because peculiarly enough, the Government Information Services had on Thursday last rung the local paper in Portlaoise, <i>The Leinster Express,</i> to say that the Minister was making a statement that day in connection with the headmaster appointed in Portlaoise.</P>

The question was put down for Thursday and it was not reached&mdash; questions stopped about four steps from this question.  It came up on Tuesday and the local Press wanted the answer because they know that their readers and the parents particularly in Portlaoise area are most interested in seeing this problem resolved and I ask the Minister to resolve it.  I know he is anxious to resolve it.  He has spelled out quite clearly, and it is on the records, his position in this matter.  I would probably go off course by talking about the indecisiveness of Government Ministers in the overall and of this being the reason for our economic problems and everything ele at this time and would be out of order.  I find this discussion difficult from my point of view because I know that on the principle and on what the right thing to do is, the Minister is of the same mind as I am.

      <P>I will not go so far as to say that he has not got the courage, but it is a difficult decision for him to make if what I hear by way of rumour is correct.  I have no doubt that the Minister wants to do the right thing and basically what I sought permission <Col N="644" /> to do tonight was to ask him to do the right thing as soon as possible because this vacancy has been there for the past 12 months and the longer it drags on the worse it is getting.</P>
      <P>The Minister is on record as saying in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday last that &ldquo;there is some confusion about the regulation on teaching experience&rdquo; and he conceded this last week. On Tuesday in the House he did not concede that&mdash;I am quoting from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday last and the full paragraph reads: &ldquo;The Minister says this will not work&rdquo;&mdash;that is, putting it back long enough so that the man whom a couple of people on the vocational committee say is the right and the best man will qualify on the five-year basis&mdash;&ldquo;as the five years must be completed at the time of the competition which was last summer&rdquo; and in inverted commas, there follows &ldquo;There is some confusion about the regulation on teaching experience, he conceded last week.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I fully accept that.  The Minister reiterated that view on Tuesday when he said there was no confusion and that the regulations were spelled out.  We have the legal view which says that the Minister's memo V7, according to advice given to the VEC, has no standing.  I would be interested in the Minister's observations on that.</P>
      <P>The Minister should tell the House and the interested people represented by Deputies Flanagan, McDonald, Enright, but particularly by Deputy Connolly and myself, that he will reach an early decision on the matter so that there will be a headmaster at that school.</P>

      <P>I dealt with the history of this matter in detail when I replied to the debate on a motion on the Adjournment by the Deputy on 11th February last.  My reply is recorded in the Official Report of that date and I do not propose to go back <Col N="645" /> over the information I gave to the House at length at that time.  I concluded my reply on that date by stating that the position, as I then understood it, was that the committee were seeking legal advice as to the propriety of their own actions in the matter and I expected to be informed of the outcome of their inquiries without delay. I stated then when this information was conveyed to me I would then be in a position to make a determination in the matter.  In the event, the opinion of senior counsel, dated 7th March, 1973, did not reach the offices of the County Laois Vocational Education Committee until the day before the ordinary monthly meeting of the committee on 10th March, 1975.  In the circumstances the committee unanimously decided that &ldquo;it was a long and intricate document which would require serious study&rdquo;.  It was decided that a copy of the document would be made available to each member of the committee and that the matter be put on the agenda for discussion at the committee's meeting in April.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to recount in detail the advice of senior counsel to the committee.  It will suffice to say that he concluded his opinion by a statement in relation to the Minister's position where he has had to decline to approve the proposal put to him.  This statement was generally in conformity with the request which I, as Minister, had made to the committee in relation to the filling of the vacancy and which a reading of my reply on the Adjournment debate will clearly illustrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the essential conclusion which had been reached in the legal opinion which the committee had sought, the committee, having considered that opinion at its ordinary meeting on 14th April, 1975, adopted, by a majority decision of nine votes to five, a motion reaffirming its decision to continue in the capacity of acting principal of Portlaoise Vocational School the person whose appointment in that or any other capacity as principal I had been unable to approve.  I had been unable to approve of that on the grounds that <Col N="646" /> he did not satisfy the requirements for appointment to the post, whereas another candidate was available who complied with the requirements in full.  That candidate was, therefore, qualified for appointment to the post on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>As I stated in reply to the Deputy's question to me on 20th May, I am considering the views adopted by the committee as presented at its meeting on 14th April and I propose to be in touch with them in due course.  It would not be appropriate for me to anticipate, in a statement from me in reply to this debate, my communication to the committee of the decision which I may make in relation to the matter.  I am not precluded, however, from pointing out that the committee's attitude presents me with a situation where certain action which is open to me to take within the provisions of the Vocational Education Acts is one which a Minister for Education would hesitate to adopt until all attempts at reaching a solution based on reason and conciliation has failed.  I hope the Deputy and the House will appreciate my concern that every effort should be made to avoid the necessity for resorting to such action in the particular circumstances of the case in question.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Deputy has confirmed and put on record that he, a Deputy for the area, does not want to see the County Laois VEC dissolved.  The continued pursuit by that committee of the attitude it has adopted in this case seems to me to be entirely irrational. It does not accord with the undoubtedly high standard of performance which has hitherto characterised its discharge of its functions and duties.  I would be very sorry to be forced into the position of taking action that would reflect on the persons concerned.  I trust it may still be possible to prevail upon the committee to understand that no good can come from an unyielding stand in an indefensible position.  They should consider how intransigence on their part may be harmful to the interests of the very important area of education in which they play such a vital part in common with other vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I am sure the committee would not wish to persist in any action which <Col N="647" /> would perceive to be a disservice to vocational education generally.  The Deputy has invited me to do the right thing as soon as possible.  He has expressly excluded dissolution of the committee as one of the options.  He has not spelled out in detail as to what is the right thing to do in the circumstances. It is not his duty to do so; it is my duty as Minister to do so but I would like the benefit of the Deputy's point of view in this matter, personally or privately.  He has not put it on the record of the House but I want to <Col N="648" /> assure the House that I shall, as I have tried to do since the beginning of my term of office as Minister, try to do the right thing.  However, the question is, what is the right thing in this matter?  The Deputy has excluded dissolution of the committee but there are other options and we will take them in due course when I communicate with the County Laois Vocational Education Committee.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was not qualified for old age pension on age grounds until the qualifying age for pension was lowered to 67 from 1st April, 1975.  When the social welfare officer's investigation had been carried out and his recommendation for award had been received on 20th May, 1975 a pension order book at the rate of £8.85 a week was issued on that date with effect from 4th April, 1975.</P>
      <P>Delay in completing the investigation in this case arose from the large number of claims received following the budget announcement of the reduction of the qualifying age and the easement of the means test for old age non-contributory pension.</P>
