      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister to elaborate a little more in regard to some points in subparagraph (1) which provides that where a person receives or becomes entitled to receive a capital distribution he is treated as if he had disposed of an interest in the shares.  The question of his being treated as if he had disposed of an interest when he became entitled to receive it after distribution as distinct from when he would receive them requires explanation.  I should like to know as well whether the reference to a company in the second line of the subparagraph refers either to a public or private company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the reason for providing that a person who becomes entitled to receive a capital distribution as distinct from actually receiving it is treated as if he had disposed of an interest in the shares?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Once a person acquires a right to receive a capital distribution, that person has an acquisition which is of value.  Even if not actually transferred at that time, the benefit he would receive is something which a person can dispose of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This question will come up again under a subsequent provision, <Col N="1499" /> but what is the position if a person becomes entitled to such a capital distribution but ultimately does not receive it or cannot receive it? Under this subparagraph he is treated as if he had disposed of an interest in the shares when in fact he has not received anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In which circumstances does the Deputy think this could arise?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>One example that springs to mind is if a shareholder becomes entitled to a capital distribution but subsequently it is discovered that because of, say, embezzlement in the company, the company is not in a position to make the capital distribution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if there is destruction of the assets by embezzlement, the entitlement would still be there and the benefit would have been transferred on the date on which the entitlement arose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing one takes the case illustrated, if the person actually received the shares and an embezzlement had taken place, they might be valueless, so the position is exactly the same.  I cannot understand the difficulty the Deputy is in where he sees that a different situation arises simply because an entitlement to receive shares is described as well as the actual receipt of the shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>An entitlement to receive shares, where in practice one does not receive anything, seems to me to be different in kind from being in receipt of some capital distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Once entitlement arises, a right to dispose of that entitlement either by way of a gift or for value to another would also arise, and, therefore, the same benefit accrues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of treating this as if the person had disposed of <Col N="1500" /> an interest in the shares presumably is to bring about a liability at that point for capital gains tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a gain.  I am assuming that, in the case I have mentioned where because of embezzlement, a person does not, in fact, receive anything, liability for capital gains tax would arise because he became entitled to receive a capital distribution.  That being so, I am also assuming that if he did not receive anything, for the purpose of the assessment of capital gains tax nothing would be assessed against him in respect of what he did not receive. Nevertheless, as distinct from that, if there had been a gain in the value of the shares and a gain to the shareholder, he would there and then, I think, become liable to capital gains tax on a disposition which is purely imaginary.  He did not dispose of them at all and nothing happened that would enable him to dispose of them. That situation is distinct from that in which he actually receives a capital distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, because a person could receive a capital distribution of shares which, because of the reasons described by the Deputy, could be valueless at the time he acquired them, and the process of the calculation of the gain or loss would be exactly the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that he becomes liable at that point in time as though he had disposed of his interest, when, in fact, he had not.  It is one thing to become liable when you have received a gain, when there has been some disposition, but here there is an artificially created disposition which produces an immediate liability for capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the acquisition of the right to dispose of those shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The acquisition of a right which is not worth anything is purely an artificial concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1501" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the receipt of shares which are worthless is also an artificial concept for the purpose of the calculation of a capital gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they would not be worthless if there is a capital distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the right to receive capital would be entirely worthless, but the actual receipt and the right to receive, if they are of value&mdash;and both could be of value&mdash; are equivalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If you receive a capital distribution you are receiving something, but if in the circumstances which I outlined, because of embezzlement, the money is not there to distribute, then there is not, in fact, a capital distribution and a person would not receive a capital distribution. However, under this subparagraph the fact that one was entitled to receive a capital distribution which did not exist, produces this situation of an artificial disposition, therefore, a liability to capital gains tax on a gain which may have accrued earlier and which the shareholder did not intend, perhaps, to dispose of at all or certainly did not intend to dispose of at that time.  There is a distinction between the receipt of an actual capital distribution and the right to receive a capital distribution which does not exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Why put in the word &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; there?  I can see Deputy Colley's point that you can be entitled to something but when the full transfer takes place, after debts and various things, the company might be almost bankrupt and the shares would be valueless.  I think the fact that the word &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; renders a person liable to capital gains tax is what concerns Deputy Colley more than anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A person might elect not to receive the capital distribution but to use it in some other way, to assign it immediately instead of receiving it.  One has to provide for a <Col N="1502" /> situation in which a person does not, of his own election, actually receive it.  The right confers a benefit even if it is not exercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a benefit, I accept that that is so, but the situation arises under this provision that, even though there is no benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with a tax on actual benefit.  If there is no benefit, obviously there will be no tax.  The gain has to be established before&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not going to pay tax on a gain which does not exist, I agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but this triggers off a liability to capital gains tax on some gain that may have arisen over the previous 20 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Deputy has been describing a situation in which the shares are valueless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in which the proposed capital distribution is valueless, which will be, of course, on top of the existing value of the shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall look into what the Deputy says.  Offhand, I am unable to understand the cause of his anxiety. It seems to me that, once a person acquires an entitlement as a right, that itself confers a benefit which must be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister examine it, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter I am in a slight difficulty about; I think I mentioned it already, but I have not got the Official Report yet and I am not absolutely certain.  I shall just mention it briefly in case I have not mentioned it already.  It is in relation to paragraph 1 of Schedule 2.  Under that provision it would seem that where a shareholder receives a capital distribution no matter how small in relation to the share-holding <Col N="1503" /> a charge to capital gains tax would arise, subject to the exemptions for individuals that are provided in the Bill.  This might well involve a great deal of time in pursuing quite trivial cases.  I understand that in such cases in Britain they treat distributions which are small in relation to the shareholdings as a reduction of the cost against the future disposal and this saves a great deal of unnecessary work on the part of the Revenue Commissioners.  I think I have made the point already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy did make the point before.  I pointed out that in Britain they have not got the £500 exemption which we have. Therefore, they have to make a special provision in respect of small distributions, but with the £500 exemption that we have it would exempt a substantial number of these capital distributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But would it still not involve the Revenue Commissioners in examining each case of a capital distribution to see if the exemption had been exceeded, taking into account any other gains which might also exist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would require the Revenue Commissioners to look at all of them, but certainly, nothing like the same number of companies as across the water. We have not the same number of capital distributions.  Even if those that do occur were to be examined it would not be a tremendous burden on the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not pursue the matter.  I mentioned it already and I merely wanted to draw attention to a possibility of reducing the burden on the Revenue Commission staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to apologise to the Chair for not being in the chamber when this debate was resumed as I was in possession on the last occasion.  I have been thinking over what I was saying then and I confess that to make the modifications <Col N="1504" /> that I think desirable would at this stage, I fear, amount to a substantial redrafting.  Perhaps it would be unfair to ask the Minister to undertake that in respect of the technical details of the Bill.  But I repeat my criticism: if we have a Schedule dealing with the particular matter, to say the least of it, it is untidy that sections that vitally affect the provisions within that Schedule should appear in another Schedule.  I was referring to paragraph 21 appearing in Schedule 1 which vitally affects the provisions and interpretation of Schedule 2 with which we are dealing.  Essentially that is a drafting matter but it is something that will mislead and it can produce future argument in the courts.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that this Schedule is an example of what some of us have complained about throughout the legislation: when it comes to implementing a simple provision to ensure that the law and the principles pertaining to capital gains attach to transactions in shares and in regard to capital or other distributions&mdash;or manipulation if you wish&mdash;of the capital funds of the type of body corporate known to our law as a limited company, it becomes necessary to include these very complex provisions. Essentially they are anti-avoidance provisions, an attempt at the start to block possibilities of devices to avoid due payment of tax.  In so far as that is the Minister's intention and the intention of his advisers he will meet nothing but co-operation from us, but I join Deputy Colley in questioning whether these complex provisions will be really effective, whether some loophole will not be found in them in spite of all the experience there is as a guide and which is obviously availed of in the drafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I am more than ever apprehensive of the burden being placed on the Revenue Commissioners and the administration in this regard. I hope they have been adequately consulted, and I have no reason to believe that they have not, but since I think this House is prepared to accept the fact that our Revenue organisation is primarily concerned <Col N="1505" /> with the fair and just implementation of the intentions of the Legislature as laid down in law, if we lay down the law in clear terms, I think some general discretion&mdash;appealable if you wish&mdash;should be given.  I have made this point so often that I do not want to repeat it.  I have made it on practically every section dealing with these complex matters and I again appeal to the Minister and, through him, to his advisers that if there is any revision or codification of this legislation particularly in regard to the related legislation, the Finance Act, the approach I advocate should be adopted.</P>
    <P>I am straying into what, perhaps, should be comment on the Fifth Stage and I do not intend to delay the House because, on second thoughts, dealing with the individual provisions of it and attempting to readjust them would involve so much amendment as probably to be unacceptable to the Minister at this stage whether he agreed with me or not, unacceptable on the ground that it would not be practical politics for him to attempt drastic revision of that nature at this stage.  For that reason I do not wish to press the Minister on any further point but I support fully what Deputy Colley has said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise with what the Deputy has said but it is fair to remark that the paragraph to which he refers is not one which must be understood by a person of little education, sophistication or experience. It is dealing with an area where people usually employ professional advisers who would be in a position to understand the language.  That is not to say that it is easily understandable to the expert.  It is language that must be studied carefully but the Deputy being a lawyer, will know that very often lawyers are obliged to use language which to the layman may be incomprehensible but the necessity for which is apparent to the lawyer because to fail to use it would lead to certain ambiguities.  Although it may be difficult to get through to the precise meaning of some of these sections, if they were not expressed as <Col N="1506" /> they are, there would be ambiguity and imperfections in regard to them. Therefore, we find ourselves in the dilemma of having to resort to language not comprehensible to the layman and often not easily comprehensible to the expert, but which if not used would lead to great difficulty.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's views regarding the desirability of simplicity but, unfortunately, we are not living in a simple world.  Rather, we are in a very complex world and dealing with complex situations and we must use this difficult language to which people, understandably, take exception.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned also that we debate in Parliament at great length many Bills but that we never have available to us the Parliamentary Draftsman.  We have those who ask him to interpret in legal form the wishes of Ministers but we never have immediately available the person who puts those wishes into legislative language.  Perhaps this is a matter for study by a select committee of the House but it is not something that can be resolved across the arena of the Dáil Chamber in the course of a public debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's difficulty in this and all I would say is that we should not try to increase the complexity and rely on technical advice.  There is already a sufficient superstructure of that nature in the community.  We want to stimulate productive activity.  I am sorry if I have trodden on toes by that remark but since Deputy Colley is smiling I must explain.  The imbalance in the community is not affected beneficially by the approach the Minister indicates in the matter although I agree with all he says.  The Minister will appreciate that I have some little experience of this technical language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that in provisions of this nature, particularly where bodies corporate are concerned, the Revenue Commissioners would have sufficient discretion, notwithstanding our tight legislation, to do justice.  It is not that I am worried about the Revenue Commissioners not having power to use a device to prevent the evasion of payment of a tax due in equity and <Col N="1507" /> justice, but what I am afraid of is that this type of approach will so tie their hands and the hands of their inspectors that they will be unable to use their discretion to do justice where the law because of its technicalities and technical phrasing may do injustice. I am concerned that in giving power to deal with abuse we are taking away the power to do justice because of the shackles imposed by the provisions of legislation.  This is one of the great apprehensions I have about this type of complexity in the law.</P>
    <P>We are all with the Minister in giving the authorities proper powers to deal with abuse and to prevent exploitation but in so doing let us be careful that we do not deprive them of the power to do justice and equity in exceptional cases where unforeseen circumstances arise which would cause severe hardship or injustice.  In his Finance Acts the Minister has gone a long way to removing a situation that we found in regard to death duties under previous Acts.  He will appreciate the point I am making.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 1 deals with a lease of land which has 50 years or less to run and it provides the rules for determining the portion of the cost of acquiring the lease which may be set against the premium received for the assignment.  The cost is to be regarded as wasting away during the period of the lease at the rates set out in the Table at the end of the paragraph. When a short lease is assigned only the residue of the remainder has to be deducted from the consideration received for the assignment.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 1 provides that the lease of land becomes a wasting asset when it has 50 years or less to run.  Subparagraph (2) deals with a case where a lease is acquired, subject to an existing sub-lease, not at a rent of full value.  In such a case the head lease even though a short lease, may not really be a wasting asset as its value may increase as the sub-lease draws towards an end.  The subparagraph, therefore, provides that if the lease is subject to a sub-lease but not at a rent at the full value of the land the value of the head lease at the time the sub-lease falls in but estimated at the time that the head lease was acquired, is greater than the consideration paid for the head lease, the head lease is not to be treated as a wasting asset until the end of the sub-lease itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give an example. &ldquo;A&rdquo; took a lease of a shop for 40 years in 1960 at a rent of £500 per annum.  In 1970, ten years afterwards, he ceases business and sub-lets the premises to &ldquo;B&rdquo; for ten years at an <Col N="1509" /> annual rent of £800 per annum.  In 1977 &ldquo;A&rdquo; sells his interest in the property to &ldquo;D&rdquo; and because it is expected that by 1980 the shop will fetch a rent of at least £1,100 per annum he, &ldquo;A&rdquo;, can hold out for a price of £5,800, taking the going rate of interest at 6 per cent net.  &ldquo;D&rdquo; pays £5,800 for an interest which immediately will produce a net income of only £300 per annum&mdash;that is the rent receivable, £800 less outgoings of £500&mdash;in the expectation that after three years he will be able to increase his net income to £600 per annum&mdash;the rent receivable, £1,100 less rent payable £500.  In fact the property will be worth £7,300 in 1980. Consequently, the expenditure of £5,800 will not be regarded as wasting until 1980 although in 1977 the lease has only 23 years to run.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the explanation he has given which makes what is intended to be achieved by subparagraph (2) a good deal clearer.  In regard to subparagraph (3) of paragraph 1 which provides:</P>
      <P>In the case of a wasting asset which is a lease of land, the rate at which expenditure is assumed to be written off shall, instead of being a uniform rate as provided by paragraph 9 of Schedule 1, be a rate fixed in accordance with the Table . . .</P>
      <P>Why is this so?  Why is it not to be deemed to be written off at a uniform rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subparagraph (3) provides that the rate at which expenditure on a lease of land which is a wasting asset is deemed to waste away is to be determined in accordance with the Table instead of the straight-line basis which normally applies.  The percentage rate of wastage is in accordance with the normal fall in the value of a lease with the passage of time, ignoring any change in the value of the property which is the subject of the lease.  In general, the manner in which the expenditure is written off under the Table is more favourable to the taxpayer than the <Col N="1510" /> straight-line basis since at any point in the Table the residue of original cost will be larger than it would be on a straight-line basis.</P>
      <P>A short lease is one with 50 years or less to run and a long lease is a short lease when the remainder of its term is reduced to 50 years.  A long lease is treated as a permanent asset whereas a short lease is treated as a wasting asset so that when a long lease is assigned full acquisition cost is allowed whereas on the assignment of a short lease only a proportion of the acquisition cost, proportionate to the term of the lease which remains, is allowed.  The reason for this difference in treatment is that in the case of a long lease the fact that the term is running may have no effect on its value.  A person usually would be prepared to pay the same for a leasehold property where the lease has 95 years to run as he would if it had 99 years to run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dividing line between a long lease and a short lease may be said to be where the running of time makes a significant difference in value and this difference can be very marked in the case of a short lease.  To take an extreme case there is a marked difference in value between a lease that has five years to run and one with only a year or less to run.  The major problem of a short lease is that the running of the same period of time can produce a significantly different result, depending on the amount of expired length of the lease at the time the transaction affecting it is entered into.  The running of a period of three years may have only a marginal effect on the value where a lease has 50 years to run.  The same period will almost completely eliminate the value where a lease has only four years to run.  On the assignment of a short lease the amount of the consideration will be determined by reference to the remainder of the term.  Our basic philosophy behind the proposed legislation is to determine the allowable expenditure on the sale of assets so that it is possible to compare like with like for the purpose of capital gains tax and to exclude the wastage of expenditure that has already occurred <Col N="1511" /> at the time the transaction is entered into.</P>

      <P>On the calculation, on what base was this Table compiled?  What formula was used? In the earlier part of the Schedule the Minister embarked upon arithmetical exercise which is interesting, but we should have the basis of it. On what formula was this tabled? I have not gone to the trouble of graphing it to see what the nature of the curve is but this table was obviously arrived at on some basis. It is not a uniform one.  Is it an exponential one?</P>

      <P>If it is an exponential decrease, I would like to ask the Minister why is an exponential wastage taken.  An exponential decrease in its very nature gives you a very rapid decrease.  It is fair enough from the point of view of convenience but I wonder if it is altogether equity for a reason that I shall give in a moment.  What it really means is that the logarithm of the table is a straight line and that also facilitates calculation but I wonder if it is the best. Let me see what principles the Minister is operating.  He is presumably operating on the principle&mdash;correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that it is not a wasting asset until the lease reaches 50 years from termination, that a lease, no matter how long, when it comes to 50 years within termination <Col N="1512" /> becomes a wasting asset and equally a lease for 50 years or less is by legal definition under this section a wasting asset.  I am right in that, I take it. I have to ask questions like this as I go along.  There is no use in developing an argument on false premises. Would the Minister please correct me if I ask a question and I am wrong? Assuming that is the case, then the Minister's philosophy is that presumably you have a better chance of getting money for a lease if it is, say, in the 40 to 50 bracket than if it is about five years from expiring.  Is that not the Minister's philosophy in this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, he has adopted an exponential formula which fairly well fits that approach, I have to admit, but there is a bit of a snag here.  I wonder has the Minister provided for it.  What about rights of renewal?  Has the Minister thought of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not, I am sorry to say, <i>au fait</i> with the details of the matter nowadays as it is a long time since I practised but there is what used to be called the landlord and tenant code and there is the Land Acts code. There is a code of legislation that gives rights of renewal of leases in certain cases and these rights of renewal are pretty extensive in the case of business premises.  If you depreciate a lease on that basis&mdash;I merely want to ask&mdash;I may have missed something here and I am merely focussing on this section at the moment&mdash;is there somewhere else in the Bill or in any other provision to safeguard that? The Minister may answer me that he cannot think of any such leases that I am talking about because I have not been keeping up with the details, but there is a premises and there is a lease and it is at the expiring stage at which it is getting the full benefit of the latter part of this table.  There may be attaching to it a right of renewal which itself may be very, very valuable.  It is extremely difficult to say how a right of renewal affects the value of the lease at any particular stage.  I know of a few cases in my former experience where renewals <Col N="1513" /> under certain circumstances were actually taken at an earlier stage and where it worked out very profitably as the market went.  For instance, a reconstruction or something like this. I have known cases where the environment deteriorated and values fluctuated.</P>
    <P>In the net, therefore, in the application of paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this Schedule has that factor been taken into account or is it of importance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A right of renewal is, of course, taken into account.  The right of renewal would be part of the residual value which would attach to the lease and, of course, I agree with the Deputy that it is something which has a considerable value itself.  If a right to renewal did not exist, obviously the value of a lease would be considerably less.  We dealt with the calculation of residual values in Schedule 1. Paragraph (9) in particular refers to residual values and defines what residual values are.</P>
    </Speaker>

This is an exercise in arithmetic that is to my mind dangerously precise for legislation. I am not going to delay the House on this.  It would be impossible to spell it out for the notetakers in any intelligible form.  There are two formulae given here that enter into the calculations, all based on the table and, as I say, the right of renewal may be a fluctuating thing in it.  I have raised the point.  I leave it at that.  I am wondering what the practical application will be in certain cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want, and indeed I am not competent, to get into the esoteric fields that I know Deputy <Col N="1514" /> de Valera is capable of going into in the mathematical aspects of this but he has raised a point which we ought to be a little clearer on than I personally am at the moment.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the primary purpose of the table set out in paragraph (6) is to establish in the case of the acquisition of a short lease the percentage of the expenditure, say, the cost of acquisition, which may be allowed as a deduction in calculating a gain.  For instance, if one takes it that the lease had 30 years to run according to the table the percentage of the expenditure allowable would be 87.3.  If a person acquires a business lease with 30 years to run, there is no doubt he would calculate he would have the right of renewal.  How is the right of renewal dealt with in the assessment of the gain and in the assessment of the cost of acquisition? Unless I have misunderstood the Minister, I do not think he was saying the table takes account of that.</P>
      <P>I think he was saying it is taken account of under the previous Schedule in the residual value of the lease.  Perhaps he would elaborate on what happens to the calculation where somebody acquires a short lease under the terms of this Schedule and where such a lease has, or is likely to have, a right of renewal at its termination. How does that affect the calculation of the gain, both in what can be assessed as the gain and what can be deducted by way of expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The table takes account of net expenditure.  Paragraph 8 of the Schedule 1 has provisions in respect of the residual or scrap value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would elaborate a little further on what would happen in a case of the kind I described where somebody acquires a lease of duration less than 50 years but has, or will have, a right of renewal at the termination of that lease.  As I understand it, the table is used to determine the proportion of the cost of acquisition which he is allowed to deduct in arriving at the amount of the gain, but that takes account only of the lease and the cost <Col N="1515" /> to him.  It does not take account of the right of renewal.  Where there is such a right of renewal, the Minister has said this is dealt with under paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 which deals with residual or scrap value.  However, at the point of acquisition of a lease that may have 30 years to run, is it possible or necessary to determine the residual value of that lease in order to determine the liability for capital gains tax of the person acquiring the lease?  Presumably what must be determined at that stage is the vendor's liability and it will be necessary also to fix the base at that point on which calculations will be made of the cost to the person acquiring the lease so that if he disposes of it eventually it will be possible to determine what gain he has made.  How does one apply the provisions of paragraph 8 which relate to residual or scrap value to a transaction of the kind I have outlined, in conjunction with the table?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to paragraph 8 (3) of Schedule 1 which answers the query regarding the question of ascertaining the value of a right to renewal at the time of acquisition of a leasehold interest.  It states:</P>
      <P>The question what is the predictable life of an asset, and the question what is its predictable residual or scrap value at the end of that life, if any, shall, so far as those questions are not immediately answered by the nature of the asset, be taken, in relation to any disposal of the asset, as they were known or ascertainable at the time when the asset was acquired or provided by the person making the disposal.</P>

I admit uncertainties exist but they exist at present in relation to valuations of capital property.  They have had to be dealt with under estate duty law although I admit the complexities are doubled in relation to capital gains tax because there is a starting point as well as a concluding point.  Under existing law one is concerned only with the value on a certain date.  We are not dealing totally in a strange field.

If someone acquires a lease with 30 years to run and, if it is assumed in accordance with subparagraph (3) of paragraph 8 of Schedule 1, that both parties to the transaction contemplated a right of renewal, how does the operation of the Table and of the first Schedule affect that transaction in calculating gains and/or losses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could clarify my question a little.  I am assuming, first of all, that what happens in regard to the purchaser of the lease is that, by using the Table, one can determine what percentage of his cost of acquisition he is allowed to deduct in order to determine the actual cost to him so as to arrive at a base when calculating a gain or a loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the residual value of the lease, I am predicting that both parties assume the lease will be renewable so as to avoid complications under paragraph 8 of the first Schedule, if we assume that was in the minds of both parties then some value is attached to the right of renewal. How does that affect the Revenue Commissioners' calculation of the transaction?  First of all, as regards the vendor, if we assume the value and the right of renewal is £X, do the Revenue Commissioners then say, from the point of view of the vendor of the lease, <Col N="1518" /> that he sold for £Y and therefore they assume that £Y equal the cost of the lease for the 30 years still to run plus the value of the renewal and, therefore, the sum he received is the measure of the actual receipt by him to calculate his gain, if he had one; but, from the point of view of the purchaser, having made the adjustment provided for here under the Table, what does one do with this figure of £X which is the estimated value of the right of renewal? Does one say he paid so much but what he was acquiring had a lease of 30 years to run plus £X as the value of the right of renewal?  Does one therefore take £X and deduct that also in addition to the deduction provided for in the Table or does one add it on?  I am not quite clear as to what proportion is applied in dealing with the right of renewal and its value.</P>

The residual value or, if you like, the right of renewal is £8,000 and the balance of expenditure for the purpose of the allowance is £2,000. Might I refer Members to paragraph 9, subparagraph (1) (a) of Schedule 1?  That, of course, deals with a uniform rate of write-off but it is qualified by the Table on page 64.  To come back to the case I was using as an illustration, let us assume that the lease is assigned for 30 years, the calculation would therefore be as follows: 96 minus 50 over 96 multiplied by 2,000&mdash;that is as near as is practicable&mdash;980.</P>

      <P>I am with the Minister on that.  The 96 is the precentage related to 41 years.  What does the 50 represent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 41 years at the time the premium was paid and the assignment, as I said, is for 30 years.  There are 11 years and that gives us a percentage of 50, so it is 96 minus 50 over 96 multiplied by 2,000 and that gives us 980.  So we have 10,000 less 980 and allowable then would be 9,020.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>And the lawyers afterwards.  Let us look at a little basic law in this for a moment.  I find the Minister falling back on paragraph 9 of Schedule 1.  Is that correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have a careful look now at the drafting.  First of all, I will take subparagraph (4) before I come to paragraph 3 of the Schedule because I want to deal with something substantive.  The first thing to notice is that that subparagraph for the purposes of computation under Schedule 1 refers to paragraphs (3) (1) (b) and 3 (1) (a) of Schedule 1 but, when you come back to that particular paragraph in the Schedule, it starts with the words &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act the sum allowable . . . &rdquo;.  My submission is that that is occasionally a very necessary proviso in a section but it can be an extremely dangerous device and there are far too many sections in this Bill commencing with or embodying phrases like &ldquo;subject to the provisions&rdquo;. It is an attempt to save but as I pointed out earlier, you can have section X subject to section Y and section Y subject to section X if you are not careful with this device.  It is important to notice that paragraph 3 of the first Schedule is imported to Schedule 3 but its importation has a subjection to provisions in the Act.  It <Col N="1520" /> raises the whole question as to which provisions rule.  If I pursued this in detail we would have a technical, legal argument.  I will leave that to the courts and the lawyers, in due course.</P>
      <P>I now come to paragraph 3 where the Minister relied on paragraph 9 of Schedule 1, which is imported into Schedule 3 in subparagraph (3) of paragraph 1 which reads:</P>
      <P>In the case of a wasting asset which is a lease of land, the rate at which expenditure is assumed to be written off shall, instead of being a uniform rate as provided by paragraph 9 of Schedule 1, be a rate fixed in accordance with the Table to this paragraph.</P>
      <P>That does not translate paragraph 9 of the first Schedule into this Schedule. It simply says that the expenditure, instead of being calculated at a uniform rate as provided in paragraph 9 of the first Schedule, will be at a fixed rate in accordance with the Table.  It does not import the paragraph.  Paragraph 9 (1) of Schedule 1 states:</P>
      <P>In the computation under this Schedule of the gain accruing on the disposal of a wasting asset, it shall be assumed&mdash;</P>
      <P>Then subparagraphs (a) and (b) are given.  It does not go any further.  Does paragraph 9 (1) apply at all to Schedule 3?  It may be the Minister's intention but I do not think it applies. I am trying to help the Minister here. When he found himself relying on paragraph 9 in making his argument on Schedule 3 I was immediately alterted by the fact that as far as I can see on reading the two together paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 is not imported into Schedule 3.  Schedules are not sections of the Bill.  I suggest that the Minister might have occasion on a later stage to put in something to the effect that paragraph 9 shall apply, or something like that.  This is another incident of the type of thing one is perturbed about.  I hope I made the point clear to the Minister because I think there is some substance in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely a drafting matter.  I do not think it is any more than that.  I am not certain if we can <Col N="1521" /> make it any clearer.  Subparagraph (3) of paragraph 1 of Schedule 3 is rewriting paragraph 9 (1) (a) of Schedule 1 in so far as it deals with leases of land.  One could express the whole thing <i>in extenso</i> by saying in the computation of the gain accruing on the disposal of a lease of land it shall be assumed that any expenditure attributed to the asset under paragraph 3 (1) (a) of the first Schedule after deduction of residual or scrap value of any of the asset is written off in accordance with the Table of this paragraph.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I see something further on the point I made on section 3.  I think it has been assumed that paragraph 9 and the Schedule are parallel and, in a sense, related. In other words, this paragraph legislates in relation to leases of under 50 years, making them wasting assets.  It is intended to legislate in this paragraph with which we are dealing parallel to paragraph 9 of the First Schedule on wasting assets in general. That thinking has brought about the position that, since paragraph 10 excludes paragraph 9 in certain conditions, one needs exactly the same type of exclusion as in the case of paragraph 9, and that is all it does.  In other words, by applying paragraph 10 of the First Schedule to this paragraph one is simply making the same exclusion as one makes from paragraph 9, but one does not make any further relation of paragraph 9 to this paragraph than is there already in the section.  In no way does one connect paragraph 9, through paragraph 6, with this section.  It only applies to paragraph 10 in the same way as it is applied to paragraph 9.</P>

He wants a parallel, in the case of short leases, with paragraph 9.  He has enacted something of a parallel in this paragraph.  Unless there is something else in the Bill to capture it, there is a flaw in what I might call the drafting. The Minister would be well advised to look at the homogeneity of the sections.  It is another case of where a provision in a previous Schedule was imported into another Schedule by implication.</P>
      <P>It is an interesting legal point for the Minister, on the form of the Schedule in this Bill, to say what is really appropriate as a Schedule or what is a positive substantive enactment in the Bill.  On this Schedule, as a whole, the point can be raised, as on other Schedules, that we are getting very near the stage where some court will have to ask what is the difference between a schedule and a section or if there is any.  I do not know what may be the legal consequences of posing and answering that question.  Why are there many things in a Schedule and why are other things in a section?  Why, for instance, is paragraph 9 in Schedule 1 and this paragraph in Schedule 3?  Why is not the whole lot part of substantive enactment? This legislation is becoming extremely complex.</P>

      <P>In regard to subparagraph 6 also, there is another question I wanted to raise.  This subparagraph provides what is to happen if a lease is not for an exact number of years but for so many years and <Col N="1528" /> so many days or months.  It raises the question as to what is to happen if the duration of a lease is not fixed. If, for instance, it is a lease for a period of somebody's life, how is that dealt with in such circumstances?  I agree that is not a very usual situation but certainly it is not unknown.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know one cannot, with certainly, foretell what is going to be the duration of human life.  I am certain one cannot lay down any general rule on it.  The Revenue Commissioners would have to look at the facts of each case and, with the assistance of an actuarial table, work out what they would consider to be the most appropriate expectation of life and determine values accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will look at paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 again, he will see that it deals with settled property but it refers to a life interest.  Subparagraph (1) (d) of that paragraph says:</P>
      <P>a life interest in settled property shall not be a wasting asset until the predictable expectation of life of the life tenant is 50 years or less, and the predictable life of life interests in settled property and of annuities shall be ascertained from actuarial tables approved by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The same general rules in respect of life expectations would have to apply to leases for life as well.  As the Deputy says, it is not a common form nowadays but he is correct in saying it cannot be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour the point but, again, this raises the point that the assumption is made by the Minister, and I think also in the drafting of the Schedule, that the provisions of Schedule 1 are being imported and applied.  But, as far as I can see, under the Schedule, they are not.  In fact, they are being specifically excluded.  Here we are dealing with a lease of land which is treated as a wasting asset.  It is specifically <Col N="1529" /> provided that the rules applying to other kinds of wasting assets will not apply to these.  This Schedule is purporting to lay down rules to be applied to them.  Almost all the Minister's replies are on the assumption that one will apply the rules of Schedule 1 to this.</P>
      <P>I do not want to labour the point, but the more we pursue this and the more the Minister finds himself relying on Schedule 1, the more essential it is to make it clear that the rules under Schedule 1 will apply and the circumstance in which they will apply, to leases of land.  It is clear that that is the assumption they are applying although it is not clear from this Schedule that it is being applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not cover the point I raised.  It draws attention to the necessity for making clear what rules of Schedule 1 are to be applied, and what rules are not, in dealing with a lease of land.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2 (2) provides that</P>
      <P>In applying paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to such a part disposal, the property which remains undisposed of . . . shall be valued as at the time of the part disposal.</P>
      <P>For what purpose does one value the undisposed part of property as at the time of the part disposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give an example which will illustrate the application of the provision. &ldquo;A&rdquo; has a freehold house, previously let, which cost £10,000, including all allowable expenses.  When he obtains vacant possession he grants a lease for 99 years at a premium of £12,000 and a ground rent of £20 per annum.  The disposable value of the reversion at the time of the grant of the lease is virtually entirely the right to the rents, valued at £200, that is, ten years' purchase of the ground rent. Under the part disposal rules the chargeable gain is computed as follows:</P>
      <P Just="Center">£12,000</P>
      <P Just="Center">cost £10,000×&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; = £9,836.</P>
      <P Just="Center">£12,000 + 200</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> The chargeable gain is, therefore, premium, £12,000, acquisition cost attributable, £9,836, and chargeable gain, £2,164.  The acquisition cost has now been written down to £164, that is, £10,000 minus £9,836.  If, therefore, the reversion is later sold for £244, there will be a further chargeable gain of £80.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 3 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Where, under the terms subject to which a lease of land is granted, a sum becomes payable by the lessee in lieu of the whole or part of the rent for any period, or as consideration for the surrender of the lease, the lease shall be deemed for the purposes of this Schedule to have required the payment of a premium to the lessor (in addition to any other premium) of the amount of that sum for the period in relation to which the sum is payable.</P>
      <P>What is the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;for the period in relation to which the sum is payable&rdquo; when it is applied to a sum paid in consideration of the surrender of the lease?  The Minister referred to paragraph 3 (5) which reads:</P>
      <P>Where under subparagraph (1) a premium is deemed to have been received as consideration for the surrender of a lease, that premium shall be regarded as consideration for a separate transaction consisting of the disposal by the lessor of his interest in the lease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect the Minister to be able to deal with each point straight away and I do not want to harass him.  An interesting case can arise over the whole Schedule. First of all, one must ask a question in relation to a case where, for example, I have a lease and have a right of renewal but it does not suit me to exercise it: it suits me to forego that right and I simply let the lease fall in.  What is the position there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question No. 2 relates to the situation where I let the lease fall in and <Col N="1532" /> later, perhaps by a devious route, I acquire that property again, in effect renewing the lease in a completely separate transaction.  That is hardly what one would call during the currency of the lease.  What is caught there or has something slipped through?  What happens if I simply let the lease expire?  My renewal right is optional.  I do not know what the courts would decide if the Minister attempted to interpret that optional right as a mandatory one.  I think he would be in trouble.</P>
    <P>Following Deputy Colley's line of thought and having regard to the words &ldquo;currency of lease or premium&rdquo;, suppose by a simple operation I get the property back on another lease, what is the situation? One of the things this legislation will drive people to do, and this is one of my objections to it, is to collaborate &mdash;I do not want to say &ldquo;connive&rdquo;&mdash; to do perfectly legal things, to do nothing wrong, but still to defeat the intention in the Bill.  It is an old story as far as legislation is concerned. Shakespeare had it in the <i>Merchant of Venice:</i> if you go for your pound of flesh you will get it, but no more.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the impact of what we are doing in this legislation.  I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister who has to take it on single-handed&mdash;nobody has come in to support him&mdash;and he and his advisers must be extremely harassed and tired.  For that reason I am not pressing him for answers. I hope he will not take me as trying to stir anything up.  There will be another Stage of this Bill in this House and I am sure the same questions on this matter will be asked in the Seanad.  There are big interests involved in this and if the Minister feels he has not the answers now I will understand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A citizen has the right not to pay any more tax than the law imposes.  I am not too clear about the point the Deputy is making on non-exercise of the right to renewal.  If such a person later on were to obtain a new lease he would be paying a premium for the new lease or a higher rent than he might otherwise have been paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I could give a multitude of instances to get over that. The surrender is not a measurable right.  The tax people cannot get after that.  The Minister seems to be assuming that the surrender would be in circumstances where the lessor would be getting a free gift of the surrender.  I pointed out that this type of legislation encourages collaboration. People will have legal advisers and legal advisers have a way of settling matters, perfectly legally and above board, usually with the object of avoiding unnecessary expense for their clients and to give their clients the best service possible. My point is that this legislation is stimulating this kind of thing and I am drawing attention to the type of loophole that can be a fruitful source of trouble.  That is all.  Paragraph 4 deals with sub-leases out of short leases, and subparagraph (2) reads:</P>
      <P>In the computation under Schedule 1 of the gain accruing on the part disposal of a lease by way of the grant of a sub-lease for a premium (in this paragraph referred to as the actual premium), the expenditure attributable to the lease under clauses (a) and (b) of paragraph 3 (1) of Schedule 1 shall be apportioned in accordance with this paragraph, and paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 shall not apply.</P>
      <P>Again I refer to the qualification of paragraph (3) referred to already, which is, &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act&rdquo;.  It raises the interesting question: is the Schedule part of the Act or not?  That is a very broad and inaccurate way of putting it; of course it is part of the Act in one sense, but again that point is imported into this. Subparagraph (3) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> Out of each item of the expenditure attributable to the lease under the said clauses (a) and (b) there shall be apportioned to the part disposal&mdash;</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to deal with sub-leases out of short leases.  There again you have a mechanism which is designed to cover abuse, but it is doubtful if it does what it is intended to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, this is precisely the trouble because if the Schedules were looser they might be regarded merely as guiding rules, but because of that section they are substantive enactments and the pound of flesh of Shakespeare's <i>Merchant of Venice</i> becomes a warning in the matter of interpretation.</P>

      <P>As the Minister knows, while these may appear to be rules for calculating liabilities and so on in certain cases and allowable expenditure, a later Schedule actually imposes specific obligations on taxpayers, quite apart from calculations.  However, we shall come to that.  I would like to refer the Minister to subparagraph (6) of paragraph 3 which reads:</P>
      <P>Subparagraph (2) shall apply in relation to a transaction not at arm's length . . . .</P>
      <P>Why does that not say that subparagraph (1) shall also apply?  What is the distinction in this context between (1) and (2)?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In subparagraph (1) the terms of the lease itself would have been examined for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the lease was a genuine lease.  The subparagraph deals with anything which would be done under those terms which have already been tested, as it were, so it is not necessary to bring them into subparagraph (6) because they have already been subjected to test.  Subparagraph (6) is applying certain provisions where a transaction was not done at arm's length.  It deals with things which would be outside the terms of the lease.</P>

      <P>I would have thought that the provisions of subparagraph (6), in the event of a transaction not being at arm's length, should really apply to any transaction which is not at arm's length.  However, that is a matter for the Minister.  I want to refer the Minister to paragraph 4.  It is only a drafting point, if there is any validity in it at all.  Would the Minister look at subparagraph (2) of paragraph 4 where there is a reference to a premium, in this paragraph referred to as &ldquo;the actual premium&rdquo;.  Then (b) of subparagraph (3) starts off by saying: &ldquo;if the actual amount is less than the full premium.&rdquo;  Should that be &ldquo;if the actual premium&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies.  That is correct.  Subparagraph (5) sets out where income tax has become chargeable with reference to a premium.  It goes on to provide certain things and then says:</P>

      <P>I imagine that is the only reason.  I shall see if I can cause a change to be made.  It certainly does not help one's reading of the Bill and discussion on it not to have the lines numbered.  Subparagraph (1) of paragraph 5 deals with the case where the <Col N="1536" /> interest out of which a lease is granted is not itself a short lease and in computing a chargeable gain the normal rule for a part disposal applies.  The amount chargeable to income tax will be excluded from the consideration for the part disposed and in order to achieve the correct mathematical result it will also be excluded from the numerator of the fraction used for apportioning allowable expenditure in computing a chargeable gain on the part disposal.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should give an example. Suppose a freehold property is acquired after April, 1974 for £100,000. Four years later a lease for 21 years is granted at a premium of £25,000 subject to a rent of £8,000 per annum. The interest remaining undisposed of, that is the reversion, is valued at the time the lease is granted at £105,000. Income tax liability on the premium is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Which is the premium in that case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The £25,000.  The total premium is £25,000 less a fraction under section 83 of the Income Tax Act of 1967 which is 21 minus 1/50 multiplied by £25,000 which is equal to £10,000.  So, chargeable income tax is £15,000.  The capital gains liability is: total premium, £25,000, less the amount chargeable to income tax which is £15,000, leaving a balance of £10,000.  We deduct the proportion of allowable expenditure&mdash;that is £100,000 which is the cost&mdash;multiplied by £10,000&mdash;which is the premium less the income tax charged&mdash;over £130,000.  That is the premium plus £105,000 which is the value of the reversion.  That equals £7,692.  The chargeable gain therefore is £2,308.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that example.  I take it the effect of the subparagraph is that where income tax has become payable in accordance with section 83 of the 1967 Act account is taken of it both in assessing what is the gain&mdash;in other words, it is deducted from the gain&mdash; but it is also taken account of in assessing the part disposal calculation.

      <P>Is it over-simplifying it to say that because you paid income tax, if that were allowed in full and were to create a loss situation, you are not to be allowed to claim a loss situation?

      <P>I would ask the Minister to do that in relation both to subparagraphs (2) and (3) because it is an important departure from the principle laid down in the Bill and should not be adopted without very good reason.  Apart from that point, I would refer the Minister to subparagraph (3) and ask him whether he could explain and, perhaps, give an example, of how the proviso would work.</P>

      <P>Subparagraph (3) provides for the exclusion from the charge to capital gains tax of any sum charged to income tax under Case V of Schedule D by virtue of the special rule in section 85 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, for dealing with the sale of land subject to a right of reconveyance.</P>
      <P>In the case of a short lease the amount charged to income tax would be deducted from the gain as computed under subparagraph (2), subject to the same limitation, the maximum deduction, in subparagraph (2).  In other cases the amount charged to income tax would be excluded from the consideration under the same conditions as in subparagraph (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Effectively what is being done here is to provide that where income <Col N="1539" /> tax has become payable in respect of a premium in accordance with certain provisions of the 1967 Income Tax Act, the amount in respect of which income tax is paid is to be excluded from the consideration except where there is a part disposal.  This is provided for in relation to charges arising under section 83 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 and under section 85 of the same Act, but where such happens in relation to leases of a duration of less than 50 years, it would appear in either case that that is not the way it is to be treated and that the amount on which income tax is paid is to be deducted from a gain.  I am not sure as to why the proviso is drafted in this way.  Subparagraph (2) seems to be the proviso to subparagraph (1) and there is a proviso added to subparagraph (3).  As far as I can see the same thing is being done in each case where income tax becomes payable under either of those sections and the proviso here is having the same effect as subparagraph (2).  The point I am raising is the same as that which I raised on subparagraph (2) and which the Minister has agreed to look into. I presume that either he will change the provision or explain why it should be there.  On that assumption I will leave those points and refer the Minister to subparagraph (5) of paragraph 5 which reads:</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2 of Schedule I shall not be taken as authorising the exclusion of any amount from the consideration for a disposal of assets taken into account in the computation under that Schedule by reference to any amount chargeable to tax under Chapter VI of Part IV of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>

      <P>A acquires land for £10,000 and later sells it to B for £15,000 reserving the right to buy it back after five years for £12,000.  The <Col N="1540" /> amount chargeable to income tax is £3,000 less 5 minus 1 over 50, multiplied by £3,000 which is the difference between £12,000 and £15,000, that equals £240 and, consequently, £2,760 is chargeable to income tax.  The chargeable gain on the sale, is consideration for disposal, £15,000 minus £2,760 which equals £12,240 and the base cost of £10,000, which leaves the chargeable gain at £2,240.</P>
      <P>If the proviso is applicable, if &ldquo;A&rdquo; had a long leasehold interest with 40 years left to run, the computation for income tax would be unchanged.  The computation for capital gains tax under the proviso would be as follows: consideration received, £15,000; expenditure allowable per Table to the paragraph, £10,000, multiplied by 96 per cent, which would be £9,600; gain on disposal, £5,400.

      <P>It ensures that the general rule excluding sums chargeable to income tax from the consideration on the disposal of assets is not to prevent any amount being taken into account in a capital gains tax computation because it has been taken into account in a charge under Case V, Schedule D.  This provision is necessary to enable such an amount to be brought into the capital gains <Col N="1541" /> computation before the part chargeable to income tax is excluded to give the final amount chargeable to capital gains tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is not much clearer than paragraph 5.  Is what the Minister has just said not a breach of the general principle laid down in the Bill about the exclusion of amounts which can become liable to computation for capital gains tax purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that we are talking in different terms.  I should like to refer the Minister back to subparagraph (1) of paragraph 5 of Schedule D which reads:</P>
      <P>Whereby reference to any premium income tax has become chargeable . . . on any amount, that amount shall be excluded from the consideration brought into account in the computation under Schedule 1 of a gain.</P>
      <P>Does that not contradict what the Minister has just said?  That is the exclusion of the amount on which income tax has become chargeable from the consideration brought into account in the computation of capital gains tax.  That seems to be directly contradictory to what the Minister has said in relation to subparagraph (5). What I have just quoted from subparagraph (1) is the general approach in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>It is certainly not intended to be operated in the way the Deputy fears.  There appears to be some contradiction between subparagraph (1) and subparagraph (5) but the effect of subparagraph (1) is to ensure that there is no double charge.  Similarly, as far as subparagraph (5) is concerned, there will be no double charge but in order to compute the appropriate gains account has to be taken of the full amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just been listening to the discussion on paragraph 5 rather than taking part in it.  It strikes me that it is totally unsatisfactory that we have this situation once again on this Bill&mdash;no doubt we will have it several times more&mdash;that nobody in this House knows what paragraph 5 means. I am not blaming the Minister.  He is supposed to know because he brought <Col N="1544" /> in the Bill but I know as a matter of practice that it is not always feasible in financial legislation of this kind. Nonetheless the situation is that he does not know and because he does not know presumably the Revenue Commissioners do not know either because they are there to advise him.</P>
      <P>Are we not in a situation, therefore, that we are being asked to pass a Schedule which contains paragraphs such as this that literally nobody knows the meaning of?  So far as I can gather from this paragraph the general intention of it seems to be to exclude double payments of income tax and capital gains tax.  The examples and the explanations given seem, in fact, instead of excluding the double payments, almost to make provision for the double payments.  There seems to be some attempt to divide part of the gain or consideration in relation to some transactions into two sections part of which will be liable for income tax, part of which will be liable for capital gains tax.  Presumably the intention is that the two parts will not overlap, but there is no one here who can say with certainty that they will not.  The Minister cannot say it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley's suggestion that parts of the Bill, such as this, will have to be recommitted is one that will certainly have to be accepted.  This is probably the most technical legislation that ever came before this House. In my opinion it is going through inordinately quickly, if anything.  It is the biggest effort to change capital taxation in 81 years.  An effort is being made to close off in advance all kinds of difficulties and possible loopholes. Many people would consider that the better thing to do would be to bring in the simple principles and as loopholes came up to try to close them each year.</P>
      <P>In what is being proposed in paragraph 5 and the five subparagraphs of it the efforts to tie up possible loopholes are so great that the Minister has got himself and all of us into the situation that none of us knows now what exactly is meant and what exactly the effect will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the people who thought out all this are not in a position to say what <Col N="1545" /> it means, what will the High Court or the Supreme Court be able to do about it when some aggrieved taxpayer goes there at possible considerable expense to himself?  If the Bill had to be made so complicated that nobody, neither the Minister nor the Revenue Commissioners, can understand it, the sensible thing would be to withdraw it or, at least, to withdraw those parts of it that are beyond human comprehension at this point in time and have it brought forward again at some other stage.</P>
    <P>These Schedules are supposed to be only minor rules in relation to computations and so on&mdash;supposed to be. In fact, they form nearly half the Bill and they are of the utmost complexity, so much so that large parts of them are beyond the comprehension of the Minister and consequently of everyone else in the House.  Would it not be better to drop these Schedules that nobody can understand?  Is it necessary to set out in statutory form extraordinarily complicated rules?  Could this not be done by way of order which the Revenue Commissioners could make after some period of experience of the working of this Bill?</P>
    <P>At the moment, apart from the principles contained in the Bill, it is totally unsatisfactory that four or five people are here hour after hour after hour trying to decipher what is meant and finding it quite impossible to do it.  The responsibility for that situation, in all fairness, has to be taken by the person who brings the Bill into the House, and I do not think it is fair of him to expect the House to pass a Bill that, in his own admission, is beyond human comprehension.  The examples given are so complicated that I do not know that they can be followed, let alone the text or the other explanations given.</P>
    <P>What should be borne in mind at all times in relation to things like this is that ultimately they will have to be interpreted by the courts.  For the last 20 to 30 years or more the courts have been pretty scathing about financial legislation and how they are expected to interpret statutes.  The Finance Acts of the last 20 to 30 years are not a patch on this <Col N="1546" /> sort of stuff.  They are shining in their clarity by comparison with this Bill. If the courts got bogged down ten to 20 years ago, as they did, and complained bitterly about the gibberish that financial legislation had been reduced to, what will they say about paragraph (5) of Schedule 3 and the five subclauses thereto?</P>
    <P>I understand that there is a tendency nowadays on the part of those who have subsequently to interpret the legislation to read the Official Report and, while they cannot take the explanations given by the Minister or replies to questions in the Dáil into account in their interpretation, at least it generally puts them on the right track as to what to look for.  If they read the debate on this Schedule they will not be put on any right track.  In the circumstances, if they find, as we do and as the Minister does, that this paragraph is incomprehensible, they can just give the benefit of whatever doubt there is to the taxpayer.  In the interests of the Revenue Commissioners, would they not produce draft legislation which somebody can understand because the courts will have to give the benefit of any doubt there is&mdash;and there must be enormous doubts here &mdash;to an aggrieved taxpayer?</P>
    <P>We appreciate the fact that the Minister is prepared, as he says, to look again at this between now and Report Stage, but I wonder if it is enough.  Deputy Colley has drawn his attention to the fact that on a Report Stage, apart from the proposer of an amendment, any other Deputy can speak only once and there are only about five or six Members in the House who have any interest in this, all but one of them on this side of the House.  It would be impossible on a Report Stage, you will agree, a Leas-Cheann Chomhairle, looking at paragraph (5) and the five subparagraphs, so to resolve the difficulties and the doubts which have now come to light as a result of the debate on this paragraph by way of amendment or amendments.  It would be impossible for anyone to put down an amendment because it has been demonstrated clearly that there is <Col N="1547" /> nobody here who knows what it is about.  Would the Minister consider the possibility of withdrawing these appallingly difficult and complicated Schedules so that they might be recognised and redrafted in language that is comprehensible to people other than the draftsman?</P>

Throughout our discussion on this Bill the Minister has stated he will look at certain sections and will make some adjustments.  When Report Stage is reached it is important that Deputy Colley should not be restricted to speaking once on any section.  If we cannot get that undertaking we will not have good legislation.  If they are restricted to speaking once only Deputies on this side of the House cannot get from the Minister the necessary information.  The Minister has said that he would not place any restrictions on the debate and it is vitally important on Report Stage when we are discussing this and other sections that our spokesmen at least should have complete freedom to speak on any section.  I should like an undertaking from the Chair and the Minister in this regard.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 says in the clearest language that any money or moneys worth which is subject to income tax will not be subject to capital gains tax.  That provision affects the property we are talking about under Schedule 3.  We are providing that there cannot be a double exclusion. Deputy Colley has suggested that there is some conflict between subparagraphs (1) and (5) of paragraph 5.  I agree that a quick reading of the two subparagraphs might suggest that but, as Minister for Finance who is promoting this legislation, I assert there is no conflict.  I am asserting also that the money or moneys worth that is subject to income tax will not be liable to capital gains tax also.  If the operation of subparagraph (5) is to the contrary it would be a clear breach of this assertion and obviously <Col N="1548" /> amending legislation would be necessary. I am satisfied it will not be necessary but if it should be I shall be only too happy to promote it and I am sure my successor in office will do likewise.  I am satisfied that we need subparagraph (5) to prevent a double exclusion which was not intended.

I do not want to pursue this further but I would point out that merely to ensure that capital gains tax and income tax are not payable on the same gain or income does not quite answer the problem.  It may be that if it is done in a certain way the rate of tax payable will be higher than if it were done in another way. I mention this merely to indicate that an amendment on the lines indicated by the Minister may not be sufficient to enable matters to be discussed in an adequate way.  I am saying this without any offence to the Minister but merely to put on record the reason I am talking about recommittal.  The reason we cannot discuss this adequately is because we cannot get an adequate explanation for what is provided. <Col N="1549" /> To ask for recommittal in such circumstances is not unreasonable.</P>

      <P>This subparagraph provides for an adjustment of a capital loss where an allowance under the provisions of section 92 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is given for income tax purposes.  That section provides that where a person who holds property under a superior short lease and who grants a sub-lease is liable to income tax on the rent reserved and on the appropriate proportion of the premium he is entitled to a deduction of a part of the premium he paid to the superior landlord when he acquired the lease.  That part of the premium is calculated by reference to the part of the premium already assessed on the superior landlord under section 83 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The amount so assessed is treated as a rent payable accruing from day to day by the person granting a sublease spread over the period during which he holds the property under his superior lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> A proportion of the rent so deemed to be payable is then calculated by reference to the period of the sub-lease the amount apportioned to the sub-lease is the deduction to which the sub-lessor is entitled in adjusting the income tax assessed on him.  This paragraph provides for a corresponding adjustment in the computation of capital loss, and this adjustment is made by reducing the loss incurred on the grant of the sub-lease.  The adjustment is not in the end to convert a loss into a gain or to increase any gain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would again raise the point I raised earlier with regard to subparagraphs (2) and (3) of paragraph 4.  I am raising the same point in regard to the arrangement in this subparagraph which is not to convert a loss into a gain or to increase any gain.  The Minister undertook to examine the principle involved, and I am asking him to include in that examination the provision in paragraph 6 (1).</P>

      <P>I do not think I have.  This deals with an interest in land where it is sold in terms providing that it be sold or leased back to the vendor or a person connected with him and, in the case of a resale, an income tax charge is imposed on the vendor by treating the difference between the sale price and the price fixed for the resale back to him as a premium. As the price on the resale may vary with the date, the section provides that the price to be taken is the lowest possible under the terms of the sale and the vendor may within six years after the event be given an adjustment of the income tax assessment by reference to the facts as they eventually emerge.  This subparagraph therefore provides that where a statutory adjustment is made all such adjustments to capital gains tax computations as are necessary are to be made whether under this paragraph or under paragraph 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <P>That is an adjustment.  Paragraph 5 in the Schedule could not work, for instance, in such a way that that adjustment could become capitally chargeable.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer the Minister to paragraph 8 dealing with the duration of leases, particularly to subparagraph (2) which reads:</P>
      <P>Where the terms of the lease include provision for the determination of the lease by notice given by the lessor, the lease shall not be treated as granted for a term longer than one ending at the earliest date on which it could be determined by notice given by the lessor.</P>
      <P>Should there not be added to that, unless it can be shown it is implied, &ldquo;notice given by the lessor otherwise than for breach of covenant&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Every lease normally has a notice for determination on certain contingencies, breach of covenant being one of them, and quite common.  There is nothing easier than to put in some clause of determination by notice.  We should look carefully at the paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose you had a clause in a lease stating that the lessor, subject to some condition that the lessor had control over, could give a notice determining the lease.  Suppose he had a simple notice in it whether a lease which contained a notice of arbitrary determination by the lessor was a lease at all.  It is not the Revenue Commissioners who will decide it.  It is the Courts who will decide it.  Suppose you had the lease with the extraordinary term in it that the lessor can determine the lease at certain periods by notice in writing and still the lease were granted for a term of years the courts would have a nice question of intention there, which is something new.  This legislation is also new.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Colley said, this paragraph needs amendment and it may need wider amendment than has been suggested.  Why should we have to embark in this Act, taking all the provisions in regard to the duration of leases and the provisions with regard to leases, on defining how long a lease is?  We have determined the wasting asset aspect earlier in this Schedule.  Why do we have to legislate for the duration of a lease?  Subparagraph (5) of paragraph 8 states:</P>
      <P>The duration of a lease shall be decided, in relation to the grant or any disposal of the lease, by reference to the facts which were known or ascertainable at the time when the lease was acquired or created.</P>
      <P>That is another matter that could give fruitful cause for argument on appeal or ultimately in court.  I fear the psychology behind a lot of this.  The size of the interests involved are relatively small and nobody will go to the law so if we have this in the Act, fair or foul, we will get away with it. It will save a lot of trouble to have it in and we will put it in.  Is there some subconscious thinking of that nature behind it if we enact this kind of thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back to Deputy O'Malley's point, which is not something which is likely to arise in relation to big <Col N="1555" /> interests that will be taken into court. Although these are legal matters I have adverted to the type of interest involved is small enough to prevent any great inconvenience to the administration by resort to the courts. Is that not all the more reason why we should be rather careful about what we are enacting?  We should not enact certain things just for fear that there will be an evasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think duration of a lease is a very important thing to deal with because the whole character of the lease could very easily change by clauses allowing for determination of it by the lessor.  If we did not specify here that the determination of a lease by notice was the factor which would determine the length of the lease then we could have a situation in which the lease might be for a period of 200 years and yet there could be a clause which would allow its termination within a year or in a year's time.  Quite clearly such a lease could in reality be for 12 months.  We have been very specific in this connection. We have found in the past that failure to deal in a tight way with leases in legislation has multiplied the opportunity for avoidance.  It is very important that we be as specific as we can be in the legislation.  It is not put in for the fun of it.</P>

    <Title>Air Navigation and Transport Bill, 1974: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> The purpose of the Bill is to enable effect to be given in Irish domestic law to the convention for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of civil aviation which was drawn up at Montreal on 23rd September, 1971.  The convention came into force internationally on 26th January, 1973 after the tenth ratification was made and is now in operation between 59 states.  Many of the states with which we have regular air services, for example the US, the UK, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands have already ratified.  Two previous conventions, the Tokyo and Hague, dealt primarily with offences committed on board aircraft particularly hijacking and the development of a uniform international legal code to combat the hijacking problem.  The Montreal Convention deals with sabotage and other offences against civil aviation.</P>
    <P>The Tokyo Convention which was drawn up in 1965 was intended as a means of international co-operation to make offences aboard aircraft amenable to law.  It conferred certain powers on aircraft commanders as regards treatment of offenders.  The convention also dealt with hijacking offences and the obligation of states with regard to an offender.  It did not, however, require that an offender be punished.  Not surprisingly, it was felt that the convention did not deal adequately with hijacking offences and a further convention was drawn up at The Hague in 1970.  This provided for the definition of hijacking as an international offence, the establishment of jurisdiction over it and its punishment by heavy penalties.  Both these conventions were given legislative effect by the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1973.</P>
    <P>The Montreal Convention deals with a wider range of offences against civil aviation including armed attacks and other forms of sabotage against aircraft and aviation installations and facilities.  It provides that a person commits an offence if he performs an act of violence which is likely to endanger the safety of an aircraft, damages or destroys an aircraft or places a device on board which would <Col N="1557" /> endanger the aircraft's safety.  It is also an offence to destroy air navigation facilities or to communicate information known to be false, thereby endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight.  A person also commits an offence if he conspires in any way with someone who commits any of the offences specified.  As in the case of The Hague Convention, the Montreal Convention creates international jurisdiction for the offences and all offences are punishable by severe penalties.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes offences against civil aviation which I have outlined, amenable to Irish law irrespective of where they are committed.</P>
    <P>This gives full effect to the convention and is similar to the provision in respect of hijacking in the 1973 Act. As in the 1973 Act, the Bill goes beyond the terms of the convention in that it extends to offences committed against aircraft and installations used for domestic flights; the convention confined itself to offences of an international nature.  The Bill, therefore, gives the greatest possible protection to all forms of civil aviation.</P>
    <P>The 1973 Act dealt comprehensively with powers of a commander as regards restraint of a person who jeopardises the safety of an aircraft.  While the Montreal Convention does not require such provisions, the Bill does give the commander additional powers to prevent a suspected person from boarding an aircraft or to remove him from it. It further required the commander to notify the appropriate authority that he had done so.  The Bill, Deputies will notice, also contains similar provisions to the Act of 1973 as regards extradition arrangements.</P>
    <P>As you will see, the offences covered by the Bill are quite comprehensive, and coupled with the earlier Act of 1973, provide a very marked deterrent to the potential hijacker and saboteur and bestows effective powers to deal with those guilty of such crimes.  However, while this legislation goes a long way towards making civil aviation safer against security threats, it cannot be expected that it will remove such threats entirely.</P>
    <P>Civil aviation has proved itself highly <Col N="1558" /> vulnerable to attack world-wide in recent years.  Apart from the implementation of our international obligations, which this Bill will complete, we are taking all practical measures possible to secure the safety of air transport.  It would be inappropriate for me to detail these measures but the House can rest assured that the security forces of the State, Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and other interests concerned are fully alive to the dangers involved and are taking effective measures to deal with the situation.  In order to co-ordinate our efforts and keep our security measures under constant review, I have set up a National Civil Aviation Security Committee representative of the Government Departments concerned, including the Garda and Defence Forces, Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and the Irish Airline Pilots' Association.  In addition local airport security committees are functioning at each of the three airports. The measures being taken cause considerable inconvenience to passengers but this is inevitable and passengers must, and do, accept that safety comes before convenience.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House. The Bill is not a controversial one because, as I have stated, its main purpose is to give force in Irish law to the provisions of an international instrument designed to promote aviation security on a world-wide scale and in particular to protect the safety of passengers and air crews who are at such serious risk in all forms of attack on civil aviation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government can be assured that they have our full support on this Bill as they had for the previous Bill in 1973.  As the Minister said, this Bill gives effect to the Montreal Convention, and we agree with what is contained in it. It is our duty, as it is the Government's, to ensure the safety of all air passengers and to try to eliminate the threat of hijacking which has been so prevalent in recent years, and to ensure that adequate punishment is meted out to those who are involved in it, whether for political reasons or monetary gain which is also the objective of some of the potential hijackers and of some of those of whom we <Col N="1559" /> have had experience in the past in different parts of the world.</P>
      <P>The best possible facilities should be made available to ensure that we play our full part in civil aviation. We are a country which is very much involved internationally because of our situation, with an airport which is the nearest to the north Atlantic countries.  Our concern should extend to air traffic control which was recently in the news.  The question was raised whether we should be involved in Eurocontrol.  We believe we should. When we were in Government we believed we should be involved in Eurocontrol and we took the necessary steps to set it up here and welcomed it as something for the good of air navigation all over the world. Moreover, it was run and paid for by the EEC.  We welcome the opportunity of our own trained air traffic control personnel of working for Eurocontrol and being paid in accordance with the standards enjoyed by their European staff in other places.</P>
      <P>Recently we were disappointed at the announcement that we were not going to participate in Eurocontrol, as was originally envisaged on 1st January, 1976.  The reasons put forward did not impress us on this side of the House or the people who were directly involved, the personnel who work there.  I understand there is already an investment of something in the region of £4 million by Eurocontrol in the western part of the country in their endeavour to comply with what was originally agreed and is to start on 1st January, 1976.  The personnel would be mainly Irish, some of whom are already trained and, naturally working for Eurocontrol, they would be paid by European standards and would be fully entitled to be so paid.  We believe this project should go ahead as originally intended from 1st January next.  No obstacle should be put in its way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave as his reason that it would have an adverse effect on our employees in the public service if the staff transferred from air traffic control to Eurocontrol were to be paid <Col N="1560" /> by European standards.  We do not accept that.  Any such statement is contrary to the EEC concept as to how the Community will function. There are many instances of people working here for European concerns who are paid by European standards and we see no evidence of adverse effects on the pay structure of other public servants in our employment.</P>
    <P>One example which compares with Eurocontrol is the Foundation for Improvement of Living and Working Conditions which was announced recently and welcomed by the Minister for Labour.  The headquarters of this foundation are to be in Ireland and the personnel will be mainly Irish but will be paid by European standards. Nobody thought that would have an adverse effect on public employment here.  Another Minister also welcomed it.  We find it difficult to see how participation in Eurocontrol could have the adverse effect the Minister fears.  This is the sole reason he gave, as far as I know&mdash;the adverse effect on other public employees in the present inflationary situation.</P>
    <P>I understand our own air traffic control personnel are not paid as well as other nationals in this sphere, not nearly as well paid as their counterparts employed by the British.  There is serious need for a proper grading system because they are vital to our air traffic and to other airlines as well as to our own.  We cannot understand why they should be deprived of this opportunity of bettering themselves under Eurocontrol at the expense of Eurocontrol, not at the expense of our own Government, when already the foundations have been laid for this project and substantial investment already undertaken in it even to the extent of training some of the personnel.  At Woodcock Hill in Creeslough about £500,000 have been invested by Eurocontrol.  There is a radar installation in the Minister's county, in West Cork, which cost £1.25 million and there are further investments in equipment, I understand, to the extent of £1.75 million. This is now to be written off or the project is to be put on the long finger and the only reason given is the serious <Col N="1561" /> adverse effect paying people in the Shannon or West Cork regions at Eurocontrol level would have on other employees in the public sector.  This reason is not adequate because we already have people here who are paid under EEC on European standards with no adverse effect on the remainder of the public sector.  This reason for not going ahead with Eurocontrol does not reflect any credit on whomever thought of it.  It is wrong to deprive Irish people who are already trained of this opportunity. It is Eurocontrol policy to employ Irish people as far as possible.  They would get a better standard of living on higher pay in the West of Ireland and their purchasing power would benefit the entire community in their locality.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a serious error and should do something to remedy it and ensure that we participate in Eurocontrol from 1st January next as originally agreed.  We supplied the President for 1969 or 1970 fully intending to go ahead with this project. We now find a different picture and for a totally inadequate reason not justified by experience of the effect that European standards of payment have had on our economy or on the public service payment structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to intervene <Col N="1564" /> briefly and, without annoying Deputies opposite, to draw the attention of the House and I hope of the country to the fact that the Bill before the House today which has been welcomed so generously by Deputy Barrett is a Bill which is intended to give effect to the principle of extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction.  If that principle were established in our Irish law for all offences&mdash;if it were an ordinary part of our domestic law that all offences could be treated automatically as offences against our law &mdash;this Bill would not be necessary. However, that is not the case and, as the House knows, the kinds of case in which crimes committed outside the limits of the State are punishable by Irish courts exist only within narrow limits and, on the whole, are exceptional.</P>
      <P>This Bill creates a further set of exceptions to meet the exceptional circumstances of a modern age in which the growth of savagery&mdash;ex-emplified by the holding of innocent hostages, by the hijacking and destruction of aircraft and by the commission of dangerous acts on board aircraft merely to make a political point&mdash;has reached a situation where it was necessary, almost four years ago, for contracting parties to the Montreal Convention to undertake to extend the domestic laws of their own countries so as to render offences of this kind punishable in their own States wherever such offences were committed.</P>
      <P>In common with the Minister.  I regard the extension of national jurisdiction in this way to be totally justifiable and necessary, because the people of the world have a common interest in combating savagery and barbarism, and in establishing a fact which seems everyday to be cast under more doubt, that is, that man is the superior creature on the planet, that something separates him from the animals.  It is in response to that necessity, which all sides would recognise, that this Bill is before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle which we are accepting so uncontentiously today is exactly the same as that which has proved a subject of such serious contention <Col N="1565" /> in connection with another Bill that is before the other House and which, I hope, will be before this House shortly.</P>
    <P>I admit that this Bill contains no special provisions regarding the taking of evidence of a kind which is to be found in the other Bill, that is, the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill. I admit, also, that there are difficulties and complex technicalities in that Bill which the Opposition would be perfectly right to thrash out so as to ensure that we get it right before it becomes law, but the principle behind that other Bill is exactly the same as that behind this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary that this hardly arises on this Bill.  While he has made a very good point I do not think it is relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir.  Let me say in connection with this Bill that it does not contain any special provision in regard to the taking of evidence.  Therefore, unless there is something in the Bill which I have missed, I presume that the ordinary laws of evidence will apply, in the case of an offence with which someone is charged under this Bill after it has been enacted, namely, rules of evidence whereby evidence, apart from exceptional circumstances, would be oral evidence given before the court at the normal place of sitting and which would be capable of cross-examination and so on.  However, it must be admitted that anyone trying to enforce this Bill will be faced with difficulties of a practical nature.  If, for example, somebody commits a dangerous act on an aircraft flying, say, over Bulgaria and the aircraft subsequently lands at Shannon it may not be all that easy to get evidence from Bulgarian pilots or, in the event of the plane landing in Bulgaria, from Bulgarian airport officials as to what exactly went on. In the absence of such evidence all the court here could do would be to acquit the accused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome Deputy Barrett's acceptance of the Bill, and without <Col N="1566" /> intending to annoy him or any of his colleagues, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Bill is not self-executing.  There are difficulties connected with its application which will show up in practice.  It is because these difficulties might be particularly sensitive and severe that in the other legislation to which the Chair has allowed me to advert briefly, special provisions which have caused such difficulties for the conscience of others had to be introduced. I, too, commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the Air Navigation and Transport Bill, 1974, which is merely a ratification of the Montreal Convention.  It is designed to safeguard air passengers and crews, owners of airlines and their property, and the rights of individuals operating on planes and around airports.  I should like to join with my colleague, Deputy Barrett, in welcoming this Bill.  Any international agreement which gives protection to air passengers and crews is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's views on the question of arrest as provided for in section 4.  This section provides for arrests by gardaí, but it should be remembered that airports are under the control of special security staff.  Would it not be better to extend this power of arrest to this security staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is reason for this, and I will give the Deputy that reason when replying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us are anxious to support legislation that will lead to delays at airports, but air travellers have no objection to delays if those delays mean they can board an aircraft with a feeling of security. I should also like to bring to the attention of the Minister the provisions of section 7.  Under that section the commander of an aircraft is liable to a fine of £100 if he does not report an incident which occurs during the flight.  In posing this question I am thinking of the traveller who, after having a few jars, becomes obstreperous. It is open to interpretation whether that traveller, by his actions, was endangering the aircraft or whether he was simply causing a nuisance.  A pilot who fails to report such an incident is liable to a fine of £100.  To impose such a fine on a pilot is severe.  They have enough responsibility and worries about the various navigational and other mechanisms involved in an aircraft without having to concern themselves about <Col N="1568" /> an interpretation of a section of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Barrett in relation to Eurocontrol.  During the course of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power I raised this matter and I was informed by the Minister that I had made a mistake.  We have a European control zone here and the staff employed there should be paid at the European rate.  The device used by the Minister in order not to pay the European rate means that Ireland operates this on an agency basis with Irish staff who are paid at the Irish rate.  We should get as much as possible for our people, and the Eurocontrol staff should be paid European rates.</P>
      <P>The Minister informed me that if the staff were paid European rates it would cause certain social difficulties, but his reasons would apply to all other European agencies here.  However, some staff employed by European agencies here are paid at the European rate.  I hope that when further European agencies are established the Irish staff recruited will be paid the proper rate.  The Minister should reconsider his stand in this regard.</P>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill I should like to state that I abhor the asides of the Parliamentary Secretary who made an attempt, a cheap political manoeuvre, to make a Second Stage speech on the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Bill.  If the Parliamentary Secretary was so concerned about this he could have had the debate on this Bill in this House rather than chasing after the Seanad and ensuring that the Second Stage of it was passed when the two Government Senators who spoke against it were not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the measures in this Bill.  In general most democratic states have been easy or soft on people who committed acts of piracy in the last few years.  No determined attempt has been made to stamp out that activity.  Such acts always make the headlines and gain a lot of publicity for the individuals or the extreme organisations involved. <Col N="1569" /> The measures in the Bill are necessary but I should like the Minister to ensure that, as far as his jurisdiction goes, the convenience of passengers is taken into consideration at all times.</P>
      <P>In travelling to Europe we experience a great difficulty going through Heathrow.  It is absolutely unnecessary that passengers from here en route to Europe should have to go through three security checks and two passport identity checks while in flight. While I agree with the necessity for stringent security and checks on passengers there is a distinct discrimination against passengers travelling from here at Heathrow.  That is wrong. Citizens of the Irish Republic, whether they have Irish passports or Community passports, are forced by Her Majesty's Forces, rightly or wrongly, to fill in identification forms.  This is despite the fact that under many of the Articles of Accession there is supposed to be free movement not only of workers but of parliamentarians.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter.  It should be possible to have special provision made for transit passengers.  It is most inconvenient for passengers on the new bigger aircraft to have to queue up for up to three-quarters of an hour to have luggage checked.  This happens three times in a flight that takes no more than two and two-third hours.  It is unfair.</P>
      <P>The fare has escalated almost 100 per cent in the last couple of years. Yet passengers are being victimised and are getting a bad service.  Having regard to the cost of the security checks and the services, it ought to be possible to have more regard shown for passengers and to treat them with a little more respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly hold no brief for persons who use violence for political ends.  We have experienced it in both parts of this country.  It is quite noticeable that on occasions when dastardly deeds such as bomb attacks have been carried out in the UK&mdash;I sympathise with those who have been injured or maimed on such occasions&mdash;some of the people manning security check points, in the UK especially, treated persons holding <Col N="1570" /> Irish passports in a very harsh manner. This is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The transit lounges are separate from the others and it should be possible to ferry passengers in and out without their having to stand for three-quarters of an hour each time one lands.  We have experienced great difficulty in getting to some European meetings.  When going to Strasbourg one must go over London or Paris. Of late we have endeavoured to get connections through Amsterdam which is possibly the most efficient airport in the Community though perhaps this is a little more costly.  It has taken up to sixteen hours to get from Dublin to Strasbourg although the flying time is less than three hours.</P>
    <P>We recognise that security is essential and we feel happier when it is rigorously carried out.  Nevertheless, there should be some element of refinement in it.  I should like to know if the Minister has a figure for the percentage of the increased cost in fares represented by the security measures that have been adopted over the past few years.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 6 of the Bill I should like to see even more severe penalties imposed.  Taking into account remissions for one reason or another the period that a prisoner sentenced for life serves is sometimes as short as three-and-a-half years. This would appear to be a rather light sentence in a case where the lives of hundreds of people have been endangered. Regard should be had not only to the number of lives lost but to the hardship involved for relatives and families of victims.  More severe penalties should be written into the Bill as a deterrent.  We may expect greater utilisation of air travel, and people who must get from one place to another as quickly as possible in the interests of economy and the pursuit of their business are entitled to security.  The Minister should impose penalties to the extent that they will be a real deterrent even if they might appear to be draconian.  There is no point in providing penalties if people who inflict suffering, hardship and heartbreak can get away with a couple of years in prison.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> I strongly support the Bill.  It is most desirable.  I am glad that our country is part and parcel of this convention. I hope that the enactment of the Bill will mean that there will be an improvement in the facilities here and increased safety and greater ease for commuters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Bill giving effect to the Montreal Convention.  Like my colleague Deputy McDonald, my involvement in the European Parliament gives me an acute awareness of the necessity for safety in the air, whether that is in reference to anti-hijacking measures or air traffic control.</P>
      <P>My primary purpose in speaking on this Bill was to refer to Eurocontrol.  I appreciate that you, a Cheann Comhairle, have ruled against a discussion on Eurocontrol but I should like briefly to bring to the attention of the Minister and the House a motion that was passed by the European Parliament on 13th May.  The motion urged the Council of Ministers of the EEC to consider any specific proposals concerning the future role of Eurocontrol in the context of the Commission's communication to the Council on the development of a common transport policy.  The members of the European Parliament expressed grave and great concern at the attitude of certain member States, including Ireland, that Eurocontrol should be phased out.  This causes me great disquiet also, especially having heard the Minister's rather ambiguous intervention a while ago.  I should like to ask the Minister what is his attitude in relation to the future of Eurocontrol. I understand that in recent months the future of Eurocontrol has been under serious discussion.  Two lines of thought prevail.  The first is that Eurocontrol should develop and be totally responsible for the upper airspace traffic control.  The second school of thought holds the view that Eurocontrol should be reduced merely to a co-ordinating body and that trade traffic control should be handled by national authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bureaucrats in certain member States are anxious not to lose control of the <Col N="1572" /> upper airspace.  It would be a tragedy if Eurocontrol disappeared, not merely for Ireland but for the development of the common transport policy.  We would incur a substantial net loss and Shannon Airport would suffer redundancies. I understand Shannon Airport operations track air traffic 200 miles out into the Atlantic and the information is fed to Prestwick.  In fact, this tracking operation could be done from Prestwick itself and this would eliminate the need for Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>If the second school of thought prevailed and if Eurocontrol were brought back under the mantle of national governments Shannon could become superfluous and Prestwick could take over.  Therefore, the Minister should not rock the boat.  If Eurocontrol were brought under the mantle of national governments Shannon Airport would be outpaced by its counterparts in Britain.  Prestwick and other airports would outpace us in the technological race and the result would be that Eurocontrol activities at Shannon Airport would be superfluous.  I should like a clear statement from the Minister on his and the Government's attitude in regard to the future of Eurocontrol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the reception given to this Bill.  As a number of speakers have pointed out, the necessity to deal with people who hijack an aircraft or who commit offences on board an aircraft has become an enormous problem for civil aviation authorities throughout the world.  It is regrettable that a fast, convenient and relatively cheap mode of transport has caused such inconvenience to travellers in the last few years.  As Deputies Herbert and McDonald mentioned, it is necessary to have conventions such as the Tokyo, Montreal and The Hague Conventions to deal with hijackers. I realise the inconvenience caused to passengers as a result of the extra time now involved for passengers but the alternative would be much worse.  It is quite unthinkable that because of a lack of tight control someone bent on hijacking an aircraft or committing an offence is allowed on board, perhaps to wreck <Col N="1573" /> the plane and plunge 400 innocent people to their deaths in a jumbo jet. Any amount of inconvenience travellers may have to suffer on the ground is preferable to that.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable and is a reflection on the way the world has drifted in the last ten years that a convention such as the Montreal Convention has been necessary.  It may be that this present legislation may be found wanting and we may have to introduce another convention and new legislation at a future date to deal with any loopholes that may be found. I realise that Deputies on both sides of the House are conscious of the necessity to deal with this problem as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy R. P. Burke asked about a man under the influence of drink who may be more of a nuisance on an aircraft. He wondered if that man would be removed by the commander of the aircraft and if the latter would be liable for a fine of £100 if he did not report the matter.  This legislation deals only with acts of violence.  If a passenger who was under the influence of alcohol committed an act of violence and was removed by the commander the latter would be bound to report the fact to the gardaí and would cover himself in that way. However, if he refused to take on board a man who was drunk he would not be bound to report that and, consequently, he would not be bound under the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Kelly, referred to the rules of evidence.  The ordinary rules of court evidence apply in this regard.  Arrest by the Garda Síochána is incorporated in all laws and, therefore, it applies in this case.  The question of giving further powers to security people at airports is being considered by the Civil Aviation Security Committee set up by me.  The committee are representative of Aerlínte who are responsible for security, Aer Lingus, the Airline Pilots' Association and the various Departments concerned, including my own Department. They may be given some further powers in this regard but the House will appreciate that the Government <Col N="1574" /> should be slow to give powers of arrest to people outside the ordinary security forces.  One would not like to see this extended too far.  There will also be the question of training in the law and the people concerned will have to get virtually the same training as members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDonald referred to the check carried out three times on a flight to the Continent and he said the journey took 13 hours although the actual flying time was only two-and-a-half hours.  We would prefer to avoid this but in the interest of security it is necessary.  Even at the risk of inconvenience to passengers we must always ensure that safety is of paramount importance.  Deputy Kelly spoke about an internal flight in Bulgaria where the person who attempted to hijack the plane and to command it sought refuge in this country.  Under this legislation he could be charged in our courts because, for the purpose of this law, that would be considered within the jurisdiction of Irish law. There is also a provision in the legislation for those countries with whom we have extradition arrangements that should a country wish to charge a person in their own jurisdiction there is power to have such a person extradited and charged under the ordinary domestic law of his own country, if that be so desired.</P>

It is considered that the corresponding percentage figure for 1975 will be of the same order of magnitude as that for 1974.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Manpower Service have been interviewing the workers to be made redundant with a view to seeking to place them in other employment or arranging for retraining by AnCO for those who so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say how many redundant workers there are, or there will be, and how many have been interviewed by Manpower and would he also indicate what alternative opportunities are likely to be available for them in the Blarney or Cork area in the foreseeable future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand a replacement officer has been interviewing workers over recent weeks in an effort to inform them of any suitable or alternative employment that may become available.  There is a prospect that the hosiery section will be restarted apart from Martin Mahoney and something like 45 workers could be reabsorbed there.  There is also Irish Polysacs, established in Blarney last December.  They will build up their work force from 45 to about 114 later this year and this should afford some outlet for redundant workers. We are, of course, endeavouring to expand the training facilities in Cork city and I think the entire work force of the factory amounted in all to 250.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 250 mentioned by the Minister is on the conservative side.  Could I ask him whether he expects the remainder who are anxious to be employed will be able to get work in the foreseeable future?  Would he ask his Government to show some concern for an area so long dependent on this industry and not just let it die and the area continue to experience what it is experiencing at the moment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows the ills of the textile industry did not commence today or yesterday and the Deputy is aware of <Col N="1578" /> reports which pointed to the difficulties the industry is presently undergoing which were available to both management and the unions as far as the early sixties.  The Deputy will concede, on the figures I have given, that there is within the foreseeable future very reasonable prospects of employment for 100 workers in the immediate area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a guarantee he will take a personal interest in the provision of employment for the 40 odd people who were engaged in hosiery and in an expansion of employment in Irish Polysacs and will he use his influence to ensure as many as possible of the redundant workers will be absorbed there?  Would he also impress on his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the necessity for keeping the hosiery industry going, even on a smaller scale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Government that does not work very much on influence.  Apart from the figures I have given the Deputy, the National Manpower Service and placement officers will continue their work of obtaining suitable employment for the employees.  I have given two instances in which there are immediate prospects of employment.  For those who cannot be absorbed practical training in the Cork area will be extended.  The textile industry has been a problem throughout Europe and the difficulties in the industry have been common knowledge throughout the Irish industry for the last 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is satisfied that recent measures to shorten AnCO courses with a consequent increase in the number of trained persons becoming available for employment will not have the effect of flooding particular labour markets thereby causing disappointment to many young trainees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>At my direction AnCO are making arrangements to increase the number of trainees they will cater for in 1973.  About 7,000, including apprentices, will be trained in 1975 as against 4,500 in 1974.  The <Col N="1580" /> funds available to AnCO in 1975 for retraining are expected to amount to £9.0 million against £4.6 million in the nine months to December, 1974.  As part of the measures to increase the intake of trainees certain courses have been shortened in duration.</P>
      <P>In my view industrial training is a valuable instrument of manpower policy which should be used as intensively as possible in times of high unemployment.  The aim is to give the workers concerned additional skills which will enable them to benefit from the employment opportunities arising when the economy starts to recover from the recession.  Even if expansion of training leads to some short-term disimprovement in the placement of trainees in employment, the policy is justified by the longer term benefits for the workers trained and for the economy generally.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can be absolutely satisfied that this situation, in which we have growing unemployment, continues to be our concern and we will continue in our general budgetary policy to correct the situation.  This relates to questions previously asked in the House and which no doubt will be asked again. As the Deputy knows, a great deal of our present malaise in the economy is caused by factors beyond our control. This does not minimise the hardships involved for those who suffer unemployment, but this hardship on their part is shared by many thousands throughout every country of the European Community.  The Deputy was anxious to have information on this.  It does not get away from the fact that in general our policy continues to maintain training at the highest pitch possible, to train as many as possible and our investment in this area, as I indicated already, is the highest ever.  I think this is the correct policy even if certain people, because of the recession, do not immediately find jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of assistance from the European Social Fund applied for by AnCO in respect of its 1975 operations was just over £5 million.  The bulk of the AnCO application, involving £4.2 million was recommended for approval in full by the advisory committee of the fund at its March meeting.  It is understood that it has now been approved by the European Commission, though formal notification is awaited.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the AnCO 1975 application will be considered by the fund committee at its June meeting and should be decided by the Commission shortly afterwards.  It is not possible to say at this stage what the Commission's decision will be.</P>
      <P>The total amount applied for by AnCO in respect of 1975 is more than twice as much as the amount approved for 1974 and three times that approved for 1973.</P>
      <P>Two further grants from EEC sources have been approved towards the costs of pilot schemes being undertaken by AnCO, one from the social fund amounting to £12,510, of which £6,255 has been paid in 1975, and the second from the EEC Directorate for Regional Affairs for £10,000, of which £4,000 has been paid.</P>

      <P>No.  It is another question.  What the Deputy probably has in mind is that at our council meeting later this month I will be attempting to see how funds can be diverted towards the young unemployed, those unemployed who had no previous work experience and whom the regulation of the fund would presently debar from participating in any training programme. We are seeing how we can remove this regulation.  I hope to get the co-operation of my colleagues at our June 17th meeting to see if this can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that a regional base in a southern or a western area with more local contact would not in fact be a help?

If the Deputy is referring to that kind of knowledge that is essential, and it is not necessary that that is gained in a regional context, it could be equally claimed that too much regional or local connection might disqualify an industrial relations officer from being so effective. It is an Irish trait, as the Deputy knows, not to have much faith in the local man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>About 2,000 youths are being trained at present by AnCO and CERT, the majority of them on craft courses.  In addition, CERT have trained 750 young people this year for seasonal employment in the hotel and catering industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are facing a rather unusual situation this year in relation to the employment of these young people, would the Minister consider getting together with his colleague, the Minister for Education, <Col N="1590" /> AnCO and the teachers' organisation to provide a two-month educational course for these young people for which they would be given some payment? Unless we take some serious action and show that we do care and want to do something for them we may pay for it very dearly afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Already we have been holding short courses around the country to provide what we refer to as inductions to industry courses, but I agree this is not a sufficient response to the situation with which the Deputy is concerned.  At present the training facilities, which is my direct responsibility, are not open to those who have had no previous work experience.  We are attempting to change those regulations so that people who in the present recession have not had the opportunity of having a job can enjoy the training facilities which other workers enjoy at present.  Though our response has not been totally adequate to the serious problem before us, I think it is only fair to say that we are spending more money on training than we have ever spent before.  The officials in my Department both at European level and here at home are continuing their efforts to see how young people, in particular, can be helped at present.</P>

We shall continue all efforts to see how, within existing regulations, we can get both the assistance of the European Social Fund and of local Exchequer resources in order to provide worthwhile training for young people so that they can <Col N="1591" /> begin their working careers with some level of skill once international conditions pick up.</P>

      <P>Seo mar adúirt mé leo.  Dúirt mé i gcás Chorca Dhuibhne go molfainn don Rialtas ceantar <Col N="1601" /> Chlocháin Bréanainn a tharraingt isteach sa Ghaeltacht.  Rinneadh é sin.  Ina dhiaidh sin mhol mé don Rialtas go gcuirfear ceantar Seana Phobal i nGaeltacht na Rinne sa Ghaeltacht.  Rinneadh é sin.  Maidir leis an dá áit atá i gceist anseo, sé sin Cill Bheathach agus Cill na Martra, fuair mé achainíocht i dtaobh na gceantar sin; thug mé cuairt ar Chill Bheathach.  Mhínigh mé an scéal go soiléir do na daoine go raibh coinníollacha ann agus go gcaithfeadh muintir na h-áite sin na coinníollacha a chomhlíonadh, sé sin, ní féidir aon áit d'aithint mar Ghaeltacht oifigiúil muna mbíonn an teanga mar ghnáthurlabhra ann.  Má deintear iarracht i gCill Bheathach chun an teanga a chur chun cinn nuair a bheidh na daoine réidh cuirfidh mé cigire de mo Roinn amach chun an caighdeán Gaeilge a scrúdú ann.</P>

      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take these two questions together.</P>
      <P>The difficulties which have arisen derive from the refusal of the Irish Veterinary Union to agree to the introduction of trained lay personnel to take blood samples from cattle under the brucellosis eradication scheme.</P>
      <P>My original proposal was to introduce lay personnel in all areas to which the scheme applied but, following prolonged discussions and in an endeavour to meet the union's viewpoint I decided to confine their introduction to the six north-western counties in which brucellosis has been eradicated but where control measures must of course, continue to apply.  I have, therefore, already modified very substantially my original proposal, and the only further step open to me would be to withdraw my decision altogether.  The union on the other hand have shown themselves unwilling to depart in any way from their original and adamant opposition to the introduction of lay blood samplers although such samplers have been operating in Northern Ireland and Britain for a number of years with the full agreement of the veterinary profession and the Royal Veterinary College.</P>
      <P>There is an adequate number of veterinary officers on my Department's staff to service the meat factories so that farmers need not be inconvenienced or the meat trade disrupted during the period of the dispute.  While the requisite staff have been instructed to report for duty at meat factories, some staff association problems have arisen.  These problems will fall to be dealt with in the context of the Civil Service Regulations Acts and the conditions of employment of the officers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that if the present problems are connected with the brucellosis scheme that was also the position at <Col N="1610" /> the beginning of April last when I asked him a parliamentary question alerting him as to the present position and he told me that he was not aware that there was any likelihood of there being unemployment arising out of it?  The Minister would accept that on 10th April I tabled a similar question to him alerting him as to the position and he told me that as far as he was aware there was no danger to employment in abattoirs or factories.  That was in connection with the slaughter premium scheme.  What change has occurred since April to make him attribute everything to the brucellosis scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that there is a misunderstanding and that Deputy Tunney is dealing with a separate matter altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question I asked the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble in relation to the matter which Deputy Tunney has raised is that it is really a local authority matter.  The inspections of meat in the normal way were carried out at these local abattoirs and slaughter houses by the local authority veterinary inspectors.  In the normal way there was supposed to be ante-and post-mortem examination. I understand now from the developments that have taken place that ante inspection did not take place by the local authorities although that would be a normal thing for them to do, and the question arises.  They then sought additional remuneration for doing this extra inspection but in my view at quite an unreasonable rate, for instance, £2 a head in Dublin county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Eighty pence in Dublin city.  There is this sort of discrepancy. I have told the butchers, the people concerned, that the slaughter premium will be paid.  So, there should be no disruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister now telling me and the House that in respect of the administration of a <Col N="1611" /> scheme for which money is available to us from the EEC under FEOGA grants, it is the responsibility of the local authority and not the responsibility of the Department to administer that scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If the local authorities were doing the inspection as it should be done there would be no necessity for an additional inspection and an additional expense.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Schedule 3, as amended, be Schedule 3 of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with paragraph 8 (3) of Schedule 3 when we adjourned the debate.  I pointed out to the Minister that it seemed to contain a most extraordinary provision if I read it correctly.  The subparagraph reads:</P>
      <P>(3)  Where any of the terms of the lease (whether relating to forfeiture or to any other matter) or any other circumstances render it unlikely that the lease will continue beyond a date falling before the expiration of the term of the lease, the lease shall not be treated as having been granted for a term longer than one ending on that date . . .</P>
      <P>The question of whether it is unlikely that a lease will continue beyond a particular date is, on the face of it, a most peculiar provision.  Here it specifically spells out that it is unlikely because of circumstances relating to forfeiture or any other matter and I am asking the Minister how it is decided in relation to a lease that the terms relating to forfeiture are such that it is unlikely the lease will continue beyond a certain date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the condition under which forfeiture would take place is certain to be fulfilled at a specific time, clearly there would be an identifiable termination point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state what kind of circumstances would produce that situation?  The nature of forfeiture is not the ordinary termination of the lease.  It is the compulsory <Col N="1615" /> termination of the lease by the lessor because of certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If some very onerous imposition is placed on the tenant then it would be improbable that the tenant would continue.  If, for instance, the tenant were to apply for permission to rebuild and the permission were given subject to some onerous condition, in such circumstances it might be open to construction that a forfeiture was likely to take place because the onerous condition would be unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That raises a few questions but I want to keep to the main one for the moment.  Surely, in the circumstances described by the Minister, what would be likely to happen would be that the tenant, finding the terms too onerous, would simply carry on without rebuilding. Why would forfeiture be a likely result in such circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>Suppose you had a lease for a certain term or for the life of the lessee, whichever was the earlier, do you judge it then on the health of the lessee as to whether it was likely to determine?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision says &ldquo;or any other circumstances render it unlikely that the lease will continue beyond a date falling before the expiration of the term&rdquo;.  The term can be tied to the life of the lessee and, if it is, then you would have to have a Revenue doctor after the lessee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of the word &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; is unlikely, if I may put it that way.  Quite apart from that, I <Col N="1616" /> am still not clear as to how it could happen that a forfeiture of a lease prior to its termination in the ordinary way was a likely event determining for the purposes of this subparagraph the date on which we calculate the lease will expire, with the results that flow from that.  There is a specific mention of forfeiture, and this is what intrigues me, in the subparagraph as one of the matters which could render it unlikely that the lease would continue beyond a certain date.  Despite the Minister's suggestion of an example, I do not think that really answers the question, and I would guess that the Minister is himself a little bit puzzled as to why the word &ldquo;forfeiture&rdquo; could be deemed to be likely to occur on a particular date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One might reasonably argue that the words in brackets are, perhaps, unnecessary because they say &ldquo;whether relating to forfeiture or to any other matter&rdquo; but forfeiture involves a termination so I suppose to that extent the draftsman considered it would not be inappropriate to put in the word &ldquo;forfeiture&rdquo;. I agree it is difficult to give an illustration of specific circumstances.</P>

Is there no possibility of this legislature and the judiciary getting, under the Constitution, a consensus of approach to this type of legislation so that the reasonable thing can be done where the intention is clear and get back to Acts of Parliament which are clear in intent letting, if necessary, the judiciary intervene.  Stop the game of Cowboys and Indians which is sure to develop.  In fact, it is there already.  I fail to see the definiteness of this.  I fail to see exactly what the Minister is after in wanting to make sure a long lease will not be granted.  What is the objection to a long lease?  Why is it so necessary to take the view that a <Col N="1618" /> lease must be of the shortest possible duration?</P>

      <P>Dare I again make the point I made earlier?  This particular provision could apply to a lot of relatively small interests who would not be prepared to take the risk of seriously disputing the matter.  If it was one of those provisions likely to go for the big fellow or anything like <Col N="1620" /> that I would be with the Minister.  If we pass this I am afraid we are putting ourselves a little bit in the position of the big fellow doing the heavy. I can see the Minister coming back and saying that this device of leases might be used in the bigger interests and why not put an upper limit to cover that or do it differently?  I agree with Deputy Colley that the word &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; could possibly operate very unfairly in relation to the smaller interests who would not find it economic to assert their rights, and with the larger interests it is an invitation to litigation and incurring costs for the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The thinking behind it is sound.  I do not think we can make it any more certain than it is. We have in mind circumstances in which people would be providing alternatives for the duration of a lease, ones spelt out in terms of years other than related to certain circumstances and events and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the worst possible view of the situation.  If there are alternatives provided, whichever one is operated for the purposes of the law, he is stuck with that.  He cannot be chopping and changing from one possible course to the other, presumably. From the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners presumably what is sought to be prevented is a lease which is really a long one, being dressed up to look like a short one. On a long lease he could deduct the total expense of acquisition whereas on a short lease he could not.  I presume that is what is behind this. This subparagraph, as phrased, is making it easier rather than more difficult to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1622" />
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are beginning to lose sight of what the Bill is all about.  If it is a question of capital gains why not attach the gain and the reliefs to the actual disposal of the property?  If it is a long lease and for some devious reason it is made to be a short lease and you attach the excess that is lost, so to speak, if there is any such, to the falling in of the lease, surely in the long-term there is nothing very much lost, and you do attach a deterrent.</P>
      <P>What the Minister is really doing in this Bill is legislating for what the interpretation of a lease is to be without specific reference to the problem in hand, and the problem in hand is capital gains.  Would the Minister not relate these provisions to the purposes of this Bill, to the accrual of gains, and if it is a question of allowances that is all right?  If through the operation of some term of the lease an excessive allowance or credit is taken or there is some loss in capital gains, let that attach to the lease falling in. Therefore if the lease is a long lease it is a long lease, but if it is a long lease dressed up as a short lease, then attach whatever should have been attached to it as a short lease when the lease falls in and have that go from disposal to disposal.  In other words, any vendor and purchaser of a lease will have to be put on notice that it will be a requisition matter. They would be on notice of the condition or the circumstance; of course, &ldquo;circumstance&rdquo; is so indefinite that, taken with the word &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo;, I do not know what one could make out of it.  I do not know how one would even frame a requisition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right. When someone accepts a title with that answer to a requisition, he accepts it with the full implications it carries, and that it was not in the vendor's knowledge will not stop the Revenue Commissioners from stepping in and getting their due rights at whatever stage they should.  I would suggest <Col N="1623" /> some such approach rather than the one the Minister is taking.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, in fact, the process of making the decision and it will involve the Revenue Commissioners. I was wondering, when Deputies were asking for a different approach, whether or not one could provide that the Revenue Commissioners might, if in their view the lease was &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; to be a long one, come to that conclusion, but I do not think it is going to get you any further to specify the Revenue Commissioners as the decision-making authority when in fact they will be, subject to the right of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy de Valera has been advocating is on a much broader scale than this.  I think the Minister by now must accept that this subparagraph as drafted is uncertain, may even be void for uncertainty, that it is unsatisfactory because of the uncertainty attaching, and that at least the drafting of it should be changed, apart from the matter already mentioned about forfeiture, and possibly the thinking behind it should be <Col N="1624" /> changed.  I do not want to delay on this, but one could develop the question of what happens if one determines a particular lease to be a short lease, what happens in practice to the lessor and the lessee and their claims for allowances against capital gains.  However, I am asking the Minister to have another look at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think my approach is contradictory.  The provision says it shall not continue beyond &ldquo;a date&rdquo; falling before the expiration of the lease ending on that date.  It does not provide a specific date. Not only is &ldquo;circumstance&rdquo; arbitrary, not only is &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; arbitrary, but the date is arbitrary.  Take the case of a hydro electric scheme that was scheduled for completion by a year. Under that paragraph you could say the 31st December of that year was a likely date for the purpose of this paragraph.  To take the Minister up on his argument, it would be much better to leave it completely to the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners, as Deputy Colley says, to decide whether a lease was <i>bona fide</i> a long one or a short one, and I would be happy to let the Revenue Commissioners decide that question, which is the whole crux of the matter.  But this provision, instead of giving them discretion, ties them to a technicality and also threatens them with litigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>One would be surprised.  It is when they exercise <i>bona fide</i> discretion that they can be sure of the support of the court.  When there is reliance on a specific provision, then the court will scrutinise it in the spirit of <i>The Merchant of Venice.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis that the Minister is going to have another look at this subparagraph, I want to proceed to subparagraph (5) which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duration of a lease shall be decided, in relation to the grant or any disposal of the lease, by reference <Col N="1625" /> to the facts which were known or ascertainable at the time when the lease was acquired or created.</P>
    <P>I think I know what is in mind here but would the Minister give an example of how he would see that subparagraph operating in practice?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is so obvious that I cannot add anything to what is in the section itself.  It is one of the simpler paragraphs in the schedule and even in the whole Bill. However, what are relevant are the facts which were known or could have been known, which were ascertainable at the time the lease was acquired or created.  In other words, that is the term, what was in the mind of the grantor of the lease, not something that could happen afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It may seem simple but let us push it further and see what the Minister says.  Suppose the lease is for the life of the lessee and the lessee is of advanced age and in poor health&mdash; is that a fact which was known or ascertainable at the time and is to be taken into account in determining the duration of the lease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Revenue Commissioners would not consider a matter of that nature as relevant.  It would be an ordinary incident of human life and &ldquo;to hell with the person&rdquo;.  But if you take out paragraph (3) which we were arguing a minute ago and put into this paragraph &ldquo;the duration shall be decided at the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1626" /> as to the <i>bona fides</i> of the contracting parties&rdquo; or some such provision, the subsection would be less objectionable than as it stands, particularly when taken in relation to paragraph (3).  The omission of paragraph (3) would strengthen this one.</P>
      <P>We are travelling along the road&mdash; which the Minister has travelled in the next Bill we are to discuss&mdash;when there will be a penalty on the doctor for not telling the Revenue Commissioners that the lessor has an incurable disease.  Already, there are penalties coming up in the Wealth Tax Bill for non-disclosure of information and if we continue in this direction it will not be long until we find it here.  I cannot see why under the heading &ldquo;Duration of leases&rdquo; there cannot be a reasonable general provision about depending on the <i>bona fides</i> of the transaction and relying on the courts to uphold the decision of the Revenue Commissioners when they have all the reasons for that decision, as they would have when it would come to court.  I have yet to see a case where, on the actual merits, the Revenue Commissioners could be badly faulted.  There are many cases where they have been technically wrong in law and where they have lost cases because of legal interpretation, but I can recollect very few cases in tax history where there was unfairness or anything like it.  It is through the attempt to administer the letter of the law that the costs, expenses and defeats of the revenue authorities here and in England have occurred.</P>

      <P>I do not accuse the Minister of concealing information from the House but I suspect that his attention may not have been drawn to what is probably the real reason for this amendment, that is, that under section 176 an agreement was reached between the Revenue Commissioners and the Incorporated Law Society whereby it would not operate in respect of previous years because it was inoperable.  This applies only to income tax.  If it had been applied here the problem would arise in regard to capital gains which had accrued since, say, April, 1974.  I would agree to the amendment but I think that what I have referred to is a relevant factor in the proposed deletion of the words concerned.</P>

      <P>In page 76, paragraph 11, subparagraph (1), to delete &ldquo;being such assets as are mentioned in&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;falling within the provisions of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment in subparagraph (1) is to make clear that what is involved in paragraph 11 of Schedule 5 is the charge to capital gains tax by virtue of the provision of subsections (2) and (6) of section 4.  This is being done by emphasising that it is any disposal falling within the provisions of these subsections that is at issue instead of stating merely that the paragraph is concerned with assets mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 55:</P>
      <P>In page 76, paragraph 11, to delete subparagraph (3) and to substitute the following subparagraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where any such payment as aforesaid is made by or on behalf of any person, that person shall forthwith deliver to the Revenue Commissioners an account of the payment, and of the amount deducted therefrom, and the inspector shall, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, assess and charge that person to capital gains tax for the year of assessment in which the payment was made on an amount equal to one-half of the payment at the rate specified in section 3 (3).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 11 of Schedule 5 is designed to provide a means whereby tax charged on non-residents who are liable to capital gains tax on certain assets in the State and who sell such assets may be recovered out of the purchase money paid by the purchaser.</P>
      <P>The series of amendments, Nos. 55 to 59, proposed in relation to paragraph 11 is intended to give a more effective machinery of collection in these cases and to enable the vendor to apply for a certificate of clearance where he has accounted for the liability arising on the sale of the asset.  The substantial changes are those relating to subparagraphs (3), (4), (5) and (6).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically on amendment No. 55, as the charging provision stands in subparagraph (3), an assessment could be made on the purchaser of the assets in the amount of half the purchase consideration. The subparagraph does not make it clear that it is intended that the assessment may be made without waiting until the expiry of the year of assessment and that it is distinct and separate from any charge on the purchaser on gains from the disposal of his own assets.  The subparagraph proposed in substitution for the existing subparagraph (3) would leave the latter substantially unchanged up to the point where it is required that tax should be deducted from the payment, that is, to the words &ldquo;deducted out of the payment&rdquo; in the existing subparagraph <Col N="1631" /> and &ldquo;deducted therefrom&rdquo; in the revised subparagraph.</P>
    <P>The final part of the new subparagraph specifies that the year of assessment for which the charge is to be made is the year in which payment is made for the asset and that one half the payment is to be charged at the flat rate of 26 per cent provided in section 3, subsection (3). This puts beyond doubt the intention that the charge is a special one distinct from the purchaser's liability on any disposals of his own so that he cannot set off against this special assessment any losses or reliefs for which he may be entitled personally.</P>

      <P>Again, some of these amendments are going very much to the root of what is intended to be achieved in paragraph 11.  As I have indicated, I have grave objections to paragraph 11 but, while within the rules of order one might pursue some of those points on these amendments, it would be more satisfactory to do so on the discussion on the paragraph where one can consider the overall picture of what is involved.  Subject to that I am not raising any objection to this amendment or to the others associated with it, but I wish it to be clear that that is on the basis that the real objection I wish to express remains, that it applies to the whole paragraph and that acceptance of the amendment does not in any way imply agreement with what is sought to be achieved in paragraph 11.</P>

      <P>In page 76, paragraph 11, to delete subparagraph (4) and to substitute the following subparagraph:</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The inspector may, where, in relation to any such payment as aforesaid, any person has made default in delivering an account required by this paragraph, or where <Col N="1632" /> he is not satisfied with the account, estimate the amount of the payment to the best of his judgement and, notwithstanding section 5 (1), assess and charge that person to capital gains tax for the year of assessment in which the payment was made on an amount equal to one-half of the amount so estimated at the rate specified in section 3 (3).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The revision in subparagraph (4) is in line with the revision proposed in subparagraph (3).  The opening clause, that is, up to the words &ldquo;so delivered&rdquo; is unchanged but it is proposed to change the final part, to make clear, as in the previous subparagraph, that the assessment is a special one and not part of the purchaser's personal liability.</P>

      <P>As subparagraph (5) is at present it might be interpreted as giving the right to the purchaser to claim relief. The purchaser will have fulfilled his obligation by paying the tax to the Revenue and will not have suffered any loss.  The vendor is the person who should have the right to set off relief or repayment and this has to be made clear in the draft subparagraph. It is proposed to do this by specifying that the claim for relief or repayment is to be made by the person chargeable in respect of any gain on the disposal&mdash;the vendor.</P>

    <P>The amendment is designed to enable the vendor and not the purchaser to take the initiative and get a certificate from the inspector that the transaction is free from any capital gains tax burden.  As the draft is at present the initiative was left to the purchaser with the result that a vendor might be deprived for a long time of the use of part of the money due to him and at the same time not be able to do anything to get the balance of the money.  Under the new provision the vendor alone may ask for a certificate and he will thus be put in the position that he may obtain clearance as soon as he wishes to clear any liability on the particular transaction.

      <P>The purchaser.  He has a duty to withhold the money to ensure that tax is paid.  We are dealing here with disposal of assets by non-residents and we want to ensure that the tax is paid.  Otherwise purchase money could be handed over to a non-resident, a vendor, and the revenue would be at the loss of the tax which would be payable, so it is to ensure that the tax is paid while the resources to do so are still in the country that we have to have the provision, but the vendor is disadvantaged until such time as the tax is paid and a certificate produced which enables the purchaser to hand over all the money to him.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The paragraph provides against a potential difficulty in the collection of capital gains tax in a case where an interest in land or minerals in the State or rights attaching to an asset situated in the Continental Shelf is disposed of by a non-resident. The charge to tax on such disposal is imposed by subsections (2) and (6) of section 4, but there is a danger that sale moneys may be paid away before a tax assessment is made, thus leaving no means of recovery to the tax.  The proposal is to treat 50 per cent of the consideration in the same manner as an annual payment is treated under the Income Tax Acts, thus requiring the purchaser to deduct capital gains tax from that sum and account for it to the Revenue Commissioners. When the appropriate tax is paid, the vendor will apply for and get a certificate which will confirm that he has paid his tax.  It does not matter whether or not half of it has been received via the purchaser or where the money has come from.  The certificate will simply be evidence, and will be given to the vendor as the person affected, that the tax has been paid.</P>

      <P>I had a note to ask the Minister the meaning and effect of subparagraph (7) because as far as I could make out, taking the Bill as drafted, it seemed to me that what it was saying was that when the tax has been paid the purchaser may then get the certificate.  What use is the certificate to the purchaser if he cannot get a certificate before the tax is paid?  How does it affect him in saying that he does not have to deduct his profit under subparagraph (2) if he has the certificate because he can only get the certificate after the tax is paid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cases in which the vendor will not be liable to tax at all.  It would be a loss-making situation.  Nevertheless, a purchaser would have to discharge the obligation under subparagraph (2) unless and until the certificate is produced to him which shows that any tax payable by the vendor has been paid.  I cannot say what would be the precise wording of the certificate.  Presumably, it would be on the lines that the vendor has discharged his liability and that would be an indication to the purchaser that he was relieved of the obligation of making a deduction in accordance with subparagraph (2).</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This will slow down the process of transfer of property.  At what stage would the assessment be made by the Revenue Commissioners? If a non-resident sells property he must go to the Revenue Commissioners. I cannot see the assessment being made within seven or eight weeks, which is the period it normally takes to sell property.  This certificate deals with property sold within the State.  The State wants to be sure that it will get the capital gains tax in case the money moves out of the country. Will this certificate be issued where debts are outstanding in respect of capital gains made outside the country? Will the Revenue Commissioners give a clearance although there are debts outstanding that legally will not be repatriated?</P>

Suppose there is a consideration of £200,000; the original cost to the vendor was £160,000; the gain is £40,000 and the appropriate capital gains tax on that gain would be £10,400.  Subparagraph (2) imposes on the purchaser the obligation in the <Col N="1639" /> absence of a certificate to deduct from the consideration the tax on half of the total consideration.  Tax on one-half would be £26,000, the amount the purchaser would have to deduct.</P>

      <P>Is that the machinery visualised in order to get it?  Clearly, if the £26,000 has been paid then the tax and more than the tax on the transaction has been paid.

Quite apart from any question of a certificate, in the example the Minister gave I forget what he said the correct amount of the tax was, but let us say it was £5,000, he would be looking for a refund from the Revenue Commissioners of £21,000 and should get it there and then.

      <P>In most cases the purchaser will not know the liability of the vendor and the Revenue Commissioners will not know until they have full information.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am a little confused.  Ignoring for the moment the amendments the Minister has introduced, what was visualised in the Bill as originally drafted was that the purchaser would apply for the certificate and that certificate would be evidence that the tax had been paid and no <Col N="1645" /> further tax was payable in respect of the particular transaction.  There was a proviso that, if the certificate was obtained by fraud or otherwise failure to disclose material facts, then it would not discharge any person from liability to tax but the <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value would be protected, that is, a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser from the purchaser in the sense we have been using it earlier in regard to the transaction from which the tax arose.  There must have been some purpose in providing a certificate and in providing that a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser from the original purchaser would not be affected.  It is now proposed to delete that.  I should like to know why the provision was there in the first place and why it is now being deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is assuming that the purchased referred to in the proviso in subparagraph (7) is a purchaser from the purchaser.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision originally provided that the original purchaser was the person who had to make the deduction, pay the money to the Revenue Commissioners and apply for a certificate.  If he applied for a certificate in all good faith and got it, why was it necessary then to go on to say this certificate would protect him if he were a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser acting at arm's length? Surely to say that the purchaser referred to there is the original purchaser seems to be defeating the purpose for which the certificate was originally intended.  After all, in order to get the certificate the purchaser had to have actually paid over what amounts to 13 per cent of the total consideration which, as the Minister indicated in the example he gave, <Col N="1646" /> could be well above the actual tax due.  In order to comply with the law as the section was originally drafted the purchaser had to have deducted that money and paid it over before he could get a certificate so that, at that stage, how could any question arise of the purchaser not being a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value and, since he had paid over more than the tax due on the transaction, why does he need a certificate?  The only purpose I can see for the certificate issued to the purchaser is so that he can deal with another purchaser and show he has a clear title free of any claim for capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purchaser in the Bill as originally drafted was under a certain liability.  He had the responsibility of applying for the certificate. Now he is free of all responsibility so there is no need at all to refer to the purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But, as the Minister says, under the Bill as originally drafted the obligation was on the purchaser to deduct the money, pay it over and apply for the certificate. Why was he applying for the certificate under the Bill as originally drafted?  What was the purpose of the certificate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So that he could pay over the purchase money.  On the example I gave, he would have deducted the £26,000 and he still owed the £26,000 to the vendor but, on getting the certificate, he could then pay it over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>How would he get the title to the asset or the asset if he said: &ldquo;Wait a minute now.  I want the asset.  I am going to pay the Revenue Commissioners and now I have got my certificate and here is the certificate and here is the purchase money&rdquo;.  He could not do business like that.  Was one of the purposes of the certificate not to protect the <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value and are we not deleting that protection here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not required because the <i>bona fide</i> purchaser will not be under any liability.  Any failure to <Col N="1647" /> disclose the fact would be a failure of the vendor and he is subject to the ordinary penalties for failure to disclose the facts, not the purchaser, and no liability is attaching to the asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister is now switching it around and putting the onus on the vendor, how does this operate if the transaction has been completed?  In the case the Minister mentioned the consideration was £200,000; £200,000 is supposed to be paid over by the purchaser to the vendor but, instead of paying the £200,000, the Minister visualises his paying over £174,000 and now, as the Bill is redrafted, he will not have a certificate.  He will just say: &ldquo;Here is so much and the balance I am going to pay to the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest again, in order to try to achieve some order in <Col N="1648" /> our discussions on this, that we might take the Schedule paragraph by paragraph. Subparagraph (2) of paragraph 2 states:</P>
      <P>In particular and without prejudice to the generality of subparagraph (1), the provisions of the said Acts specified in the Table to this paragraph shall, subject to any necessary modifications, apply to capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>Is this provision necessary or wise? To specify precisely the various sections and parts of Acts involved as is done in the Table and to start off and say &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of subparagraph (1)&rdquo; and then to go on and specify that these will apply to capital gains I suggest to the Minister is unnecessary and unwise.</P>

      <P>Capital gains tax shall be under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Will the staff of the Revenue Commissioners be adequate to carry the responsibility imposed by this section or will there need to be augmentation of the staff to deal with this matter?</P>

      <P>I visualise the possibility but we must remember we will <Col N="1649" /> in time be in a position to relieve staff now assigned to deal with estate duty so that there need not necessarily be an increase in the total number of personnel. They will be redeployed in their duties.</P>

      <P>I understand the burden is so heavy in certain departments and on certain personnel that even if there is a relief of work through the Finance Act that the burden will be almost intolerable.  I wonder if this has been taken into account by the House in passing this subparagraph, which is a substantive enactment?  Has the Minister any idea of the cost of administering this Act through this provision? What will be the additional cost of putting the care and management of capital gains tax under the charge of the Revenue Commissioners? It is bound to involve cost.  Has the Minister any estimate of the additional cost which this subparagraph will impose on the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give a figure at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it is a very relevant point to the question of the net gain of the exercise to the community. Subparagraph (2) states:</P>
      <P>Assessment under this Act shall be made by the inspectors or such other officers as the Revenue Commissioners shall appoint in that behalf.</P>
      <P>These will all need to become experts in this legislation.  Will the Minister ensure that their status and remuneration is adequate to the burden put on them?  I am not asking that in relation to furthering the claim of any particular group but from the point of view of keeping the expertise within the civil service.  It is quite obvious that the course the Minister has embarked on with this legislation will constitute a direct incentive to outside interests to make very attractive offers to experts within the civil service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has already been a problem where income tax is concerned and it will be a double problem under the Minister's next three Acts.  In implementing subparagraph (2) of paragraph 1 is the Minister prepared to take <Col N="1650" /> the necessary practical precautionary measures to ensure that the undesirable consequences I have suggested do not follow?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inquire whether I am addressing Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde?  I am not primarily concerned with the individual but with the smooth working and the continuity of the State machinery for the collection of revenue.  The fairness and the justice of the administration and also the efficiency in collecting the revenue depends very much on this.  I do not think there is any further comment to be made on subparagraph (3) of paragraph 1 although the comments made on the other two subparagraphs are relevant.</P>
      <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Application of income tax administrative provisions&rdquo;. Paragraph 2 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>The provision of the Income Tax Acts relating to the care, management, assessment, collection and recovery of income tax shall, subject to any necessary modifications, apply in relation to capital gains tax as they apply in relation to income tax chargeable under Schedule D.</P>
      <P>That is simply a general provision which says that the existing mechanism, duly adjusted and expanded, is to be invoked; it is merely a mechanical supplementation of subparagraph (1) of paragraph 1.  I think I am right in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Colley in regard to subparagraph (2).  Although it may be of some help in a handbook or anything else, I doubt the wisdom of particularising certain sections, because when one particularises there is always the suggestion, from the point of view of legal interpretation, that what is not particularised is omitted.  There is, shall I say, a <i>prima facie</i> assumption that if you <Col N="1651" /> particularise like this, this is what is intended and nothing more, and therefore the remainder is excluded.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of subparagraph (1), the provisions of the said Acts . . . &rdquo; and so forth&mdash;that does not help you.  At best, you are trying to have it both ways; at worst, there is an ambiguity.  Like Deputy Colley, I do not think it is necessary.  I take the Minister's point that there is a certain advantage in having such a list but I think it would be better catered for in say, a simple handbook or explanatory memorandum issued by the Revenue Commissioners through the Stationery Office for anyone who wanted one, rather than to embody it in an enactment of this House.  I know that when the Minister proposed his capital gains White Paper, and later when the texts of these Bills were circulated, many of the larger accounting firms in Dublin furnished very intelligible and relatively simple digests of the content of the legislation and of these Bills.  The Minister himself furnished explanatory memoranda. All these are helpful but I would strongly endorse Deputy Colley's point that, perhaps, to have the generality might be the safe legal course and if that generality is not sufficient, to supplement it and would, to an infinitesimal extent, I am afraid, having regard to the volume of the Bill and the Schedule, give some appearance of simplicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Returns and information&rdquo;, is in itself a section.  The application of law is a relatively simple thing for which to legislate, but for returns and information a certain discretion is needed. A general and fair criticism of the State in recent years, not only under the Minister's Government but in the past, is that there has been a tendency for the State service&mdash;in that I include the Government, and the responsibility rests with the Government and with the Minister who puts through the legislation and ultimately, with this House&mdash;to yield over-much to administrative convenience and almost to pander to fear; in other words, to get a fixation on evasion <Col N="1652" /> and other such problems and finally &mdash;it started with PAYE&mdash;to turn the citizen himself and private organisations into the tax-collecting agency.</P>
    <P>I know the difficulties of tax collection and nobody will quarrel with requiring all reasonable returns, but in our approach to this part of the Schedule we should be on our guard against going too far.  This is going very far now.  On the one hand, the individual is being completely exposed and, on the other, people are required to be agents, where they are not personally liable, for the State, even to the extent of being intelligence agents. This is a very bad mentality to develop and it will surely bring adverse results.  I make that comment under the heading &ldquo;Returns and information&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, paragraph 3, relating to the making and delivery of income tax returns, is a fair provision.  Before we pursue this in detail I shall content myself with making these general points on the Schedule so far, so that we do not mistake the wood for the trees.</P>
    <P>There is a Table on page 71, under subparagraph (2) of paragraph 2, which is headed: &ldquo;Income Tax Provisions Applied to Capital Gains Tax.&rdquo; That is the table that Deputy Colley has rightly suggested is unnecessary, and I would go further and say it is unwise and should be left out.  Why do we have to have a table labelled &ldquo;Further Income Tax provisions Applied to Capital Gains Tax&rdquo;?  Why separate the two?  What is the purpose of separating the two?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but here again you have the needlessness and also the undesirability of doing this and also the separation of what is really a single task, the applying of the income tax revisions where relevant to capital gains.  The very fact that you divide it up by sections gives force to the suggestion that I have made, that there is the possibility that this procedure may lead to the interpretation that the rest is excluded <Col N="1653" /> notwithstanding subparagraph (2) of paragraph 2.  There is something to be said in detail on the returns and information section so that perhaps we might pause there and go into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister first of all about subparagraph (2) of paragraph 3 at the bottom of page 71 and over on page 72.  It is provided there that certain things are deemed to be included in Schedule 15 to the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Could he tell us what is the effect of that subparagraph?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 3 adapts the penalty provisions of the Income Tax Acts to cases where there is failure to furnish returns for capital gains tax or where through fraud or neglect incorrect returns are furnished. In the income tax code the amount of the penalty is graded depending on the type of offence and the person who is liable for the penalty. For example, if an individual fails to furnish his personal return he is liable to a penalty of £100 and a further penalty of £10 for each day in which the failure continues after judgment has been given against him.</P>
      <P>On the other hand if he fraudulently makes an incorrect return the penalty is much more severe.  It is £100 plus twice the difference between the tax actually charged on him and the amount which would have been charged if he had made a correct return.  Where a company fails to make a return the penalty is £500 plus £50 a day for continuing failure after judgment has been obtained.  Fraud in the case of the company attracts a penalty of £1,000 plus twice the difference between the correct tax and the tax charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> The different penalties are set out in sections 500 and 503 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, while the various income tax provisions requiring the furnishing of returns and information are listed in the three columns of Schedule 15 to that Act.  The penalty where a particular section is contravened depends on the particular column in which the section is listed. The sections listed in columns 1 and 2 attract the penalties provided by section 500, that is the penalties for failure to make a return.  Where the offence is the furnishing of a false return under the sections listed in columns 1 and 2 the penalties are provided in subsections (1) and (2) of section 501.  The sections listed in column 3 of the Schedule deal mainly with persons liable to deduct tax and pay it over to the Revenue Commissioners, and failure to comply with these provisions attracts the penalty provided in subsection (2) of section 501.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 4 to 8 and paragraph 11 of Schedule 5 provide special rules for furnishing returns and information on capital gains tax and by inserting references to these paragraphs in Schedule 15 of the 1967 Act, failure to comply with these rules will attract the same penalty as if the failure had been a failure under the Income Tax Act.  Failure to supply returns required under paragraphs 4 to 7 will attract the same penalty as would failure to comply with any of the sections listed in column 1 of Schedule 15.  Failure to comply with paragraph 8, that is to furnish information in connection with appeals, will be dealt with in the same way as failure to comply with the sections listed in column 2, and failure to account for tax under paragraph 11 will be penalised as would a like failure under the sections listed in column 3 of the Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are plenty of cases where information is furnished to the Revenue Commissioners which would disclose financial particulars about the affairs of persons other than the people directly involved.  For instance, section 174 provides for the production of accounts and books. The very accounts and books of one taxpayer might disclose information about the affairs of another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that, although I have not got section 174 in front of me at the moment and without even seeing it, it does not correspond to this.</P>
      <P>Section 174 says that where a person was being duly required to deliver a statement of the profits or gains arising to him from any trade or profession fails to deliver the statement, or the Revenue Commissioners are not satisfied, they may serve on that person a notice in writing requiring him, and so on.  I want to suggest to the Minister that there is no comparison between that and subparagraph III which requires a person on whom a notice is served not only to give information regarding his affairs but if the notice relates to income or charitable gains of some other person of any assets acquired by that other person. I am trying to find out where is the corresponding provision in the Income Tax Acts.  Section 174 is not a corresponding provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that it goes a good deal further than that. I must confess that I cannot regard this subparagraph, or indeed subparagraph VI which ties in with it, with anything other than the gravest suspicion.  The whole import of this portion headed &ldquo;Returns and Information&rdquo; is that the Income Tax Act provisions are being applied to capital gains tax.  This subparagraph refers to a notice under any of the provisions of the Income Tax Acts as applied by this paragraph.  Any ordinary person reading that could&mdash;and I think is calculated to believe&mdash;that what is being done here is what is already in existence under the Income Tax Acts.  That is not so at all.  There is a wide and major extension being proposed in subparagraph (3), an extension which would impose an obligation on any person to furnish information, if they receive a notice requiring it from the Revenue Commissioners, relating to the income or chargeable gains of some other person and of any assets acquired by that other person.  This is a totally new requirement going far beyond anything in the Income Tax Acts.  I suggest that it is being done in this subparagraph in a way that is totally misleading because it is prefaced by the notice, &ldquo;under any of the said provisions of the Income Tax Act, as applied by this paragraph&rdquo;.  I regard that as totally misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one refers to subparagraph (6), we find that there is provision for penalties.  It begins with the words &ldquo;Where any person has been required <Col N="1658" /> by notice or precept&rdquo;.  It is not the person who is liable for the tax; not even an agent of that person, but any person who is served with a notice by the Revenue Commissioners requiring him to give information about some other person's capital gains or assets acquired by him and where he fails to comply with that he is liable to penalties.  At the end of subparagraph (6) dealing with these various penalties, it says that they shall apply to that person for the purposes of capital gains tax as they apply in the case of a like failure to act for the purposes of income tax.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that is a further step in the misleading facade which is being built up in this Schedule to pretend that what is being done here is only what is already in operation in relation to income tax, when, in fact, that is not so.  It would have been a great deal more forthcoming, to use the least offensive word I can find, to have picked out the new powers that were required and to set them out clearly, and not in the Schedule, but in the Bill.  I take an extremely poor view of the way this matter is being handled in these subparagraphs.  I am not blaming the Minister for this, because he did not draft it, although he is, of course, responsible to the House. I am not personally blaming him.  I am not saying that he directed that this should be drafted in this way but I am saying it is totally misleading to draft subparagraph (3) in the way that it has been drafted and, indeed, a great deal of ingenuity went into it to have it suggest that the powers contained in subparagraph (3) are already in existence under the income tax code when they are not.</P>
    <P>This impression is further strengthened by the phrase at the end of subparagraph (16) dealing with penalties, where it refers to the case of a like failure or act for the purposes of income tax when what we are dealing with in subparagraph (3) is something quite new and quite without precedent under the Income Tax Acts.  Indeed the ingenuity which went into it raises a question in my mind, from a legal point of view, as to whether in fact any penalty can be imposed on a person <Col N="1659" /> who fails to comply with such a notice because there is not provision for a like failure under the Income Tax Acts.</P>
    <P>I want to point out in this context also that subparagraph (4) says:</P>
    <P>The particulars required under this paragraph may include particulars of the person from whom the article was acquired and of the consideration for the acquisition.</P>
    <P>Read that in the light of what goes before it and you are being asked to give details and particulars of the person from whom the article was acquired and of the consideration, in relation to another person's business, another person's acquisitions, not a person for whom you have been acting as an agent even but somebody about whom you might happen to have some information, a neighbour, say.  You are being obliged under pain of penalty here to furnish to the Revenue Commissioners, if you are given a notice, details of that neighbour's acquisitions of property, from whom he bought them if you know it, what he sold it for and what he bought it for, if you know that, and any other information the Revenue Commissioners consider relevant.</P>
    <P>This is totally unacceptable.  It is reprehensible to seek to have it put through in this guise because that is what is happening when it is being put through in the Schedule under the guise of corresponding to the provisions of the Income Tax Acts.  It is unacceptable and reprehensible.  As far as I am concerned, unless the Minister can indicate that he is prepared to delete these provisions, I for one am not prepared to support or accept the provisions in subparagraphs (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this Schedule.</P>

      <P>I want to point out to the Minister, as I think I have done already, that he has deleted section 176 from the table, so that he cannot rely on that as being the one in question. Anyway, such persons are in receipt of moneys from the taxpayers concerned.  This provision here need have no connection with the taxpayer concerned.  He may just be a neighbour or an acquaintance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the situation now where a number of very pertinent questions have been asked in relation to this Schedule 5, and in particular to paragraph (3) (6) of it by Deputy Colley.  They have not been replied to by the Minister, except in a vague and rather mumbling way. He referred us to two sections, one <Col N="1662" /> of which applies only to a man's own income and own returns and the other section rather ominously has already been taken out of this paragraph by one of the Minister's amendments for some reason best known to himself. The only reason we have been given was that it was not necessary, but it was not specified why it was not necessary.</P>
      <P>There is in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph a very disturbing situation.  These two provisions are tucked away near the end of a terribly long and complicated Bill as subparagraphs in a remote Schedule. They are in a kind of cave that people reading the Bill might not look too hard at.  They are shoved in here, I suggest, so that they will be glossed over, so that their implications will not be realised.  These are the kind of major new provisions which should appear as sections in the body of the Bill proper so that they get the attention they deserve, but instead of that, the Revenue Commissioners and the draftsman&mdash;and the Minister must take responsibility for the activities of both&mdash; tuck away these ominous provisions on page 72 of a long Bill in the middle of the Fifth Schedule, in the hope that by the time the Members of Dáil Éireann come to deal with the Fifth Schedule so much time and talk will have passed that they will be weary and will not bother with them.</P>
      <P>In particular, it is hoped that because by now the country is totally bored with capital gains tax, the Press is totally bored with capital gains tax &mdash;they do not report anything of what is said in the House about it&mdash;and because everyone is bored and tired and sick of it and waiting for it to end and because it is in the Fifth Schedule that this sort of thing might be slipped through.  We cannot stop it being slipped through because the Minister has 70 people who will follow him blindly through the Division lobbies even though half of them know in their hearts that all these taxation measures are disastrous and that before they are passed at all have a serious effect on the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish that some of the people who used to be eloquent when they sat on <Col N="1663" /> these benches would apply their minds to the implications of subparagraphs (3) and (4).  The situation is that not alone can the Revenue Commissioners under these provisions serve any notice they like on anyone to obtain any information in relation to his affairs and his financial transactions, they can serve any notice they like on anyone to find out about someone else's affairs and financial transactions.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced last year and guillotined through when we could not discuss it, the concept of doing this in relation to solicitors and their clients.  He is now proposing to extend it to every one.  If through some chance or otherwise an individual happens to know something about the financial affairs of his neighbour, whatever the source of his information, a notice can be served on that person and he is obliged by law and will commit an offence if he does not disclose to the Revenue Commissioners what he knows about his neighbour's affairs.  Is this House going to allow this type of thing to go through to get no satisfactory explanation from the Minister but just because we are all tired and bored let this happen?</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Revenue Commissioners of Soviet Russia have this kind of power.  I doubt very much if any civilised democratic country has this kind of power.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (4) reads:</P>
    <P>The particulars required under this paragraph may include particulars of the person from whom the asset was acquired and of the consideration for the acquisition.</P>
    <P>This is a whole new concept in snooping by the Revenue Commissioners.  If it was not, it would not be necessary to put it in because it would have been applied by the general application of the Income Tax Acts.  Because it is set out specifically it is new.  If the Revenue Commissioners now discover that you have a motor car they are entitled to find out from you how much was paid for it.  They are also entitled to find out from you from whom it was bought and the amount paid for it and when it was paid. <Col N="1664" /> They can then ask the vendor where he got it and how much he paid for it and when he bought it, and so on. If somebody sells property to me, in particular moveable property other than land, they will not be very pleased if I inform them that under the provisions of this paragraph I will be obliged to inform the Revenue Commissioners that they sold it to me and what I paid for it and if I fail to do so I commit an offence.  This forced snooping by neighbours on one another may be all right in the eyes of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan but I venture to think that if a large number of people were aware that these provisions were in the Bill they would not think it all right.  Unfortunately they do not know.  It is very difficult in such a technical Bill to get across to people that there are such provisions.  If they could or would read the Bill they would see them.  It might be necessary in many cases to explain the provisions to them.  The provisions are totally new.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners will have achieved a major step forward in their powers and abilities to obtain information in relation to people if this Bill is passed in its present form. Paragraph 4 sets out in detail in respect of three particular classes of persons how that information can be obtained and the extent to which notice serving and snooping by the Revenue Commissioners will be carried on if this Schedule is passed.  An issuing house, a stockbroker or an auctioneer will have to return to the Revenue Commissioners on notice being served on them, details of property sold by them, to whom it was sold and for how much.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister what he thinks the consequences of this will be, for example, for stockbrokers.  If I am aware that my stockbroker will give full information about my affairs and activities to the Revenue Commissioners I will not employ him.  I will go to England and employ a British stockbroker who will not give this information to the Revenue Commissioners because he cannot be compelled to give it.  Do stockbrokers realise the obligations that will be <Col N="1665" /> imposed on them and the damage that will be done to their reputation and their business by the provisions of paragraph 4?  Do auctioneers realise the implications for them?  Do issuing houses issuing shares on behalf of other companies realise the consequences of this?  Do people who are now subscribing to issuing houses for shares in Allied Irish Banks and in Waterford Glass under their recent rights issue realise that before they have those shares in their hands the Revenue Commissioners will know all about them?  All the Revenue Commissioners have to do is send a two-line letter to the registrars of issuing houses concerned&mdash;Allied Irish Banks in respect of their own issues and the Bank of Ireland in respect of Waterford Glass&mdash;and get a list of where the ten million shares in each case were issued.  Are people aware of this and what the consequences will be? Does the Minister realise what the consequences will be?  We will have the most perfect information gathering machine in the world.  There is no doubt about that.  That will be Deputy Richie Ryan's legacy to the country. The Revenue Commissioners will be as efficient in obtaining information on every citizen as the KGB or the CIA.  Will that do the country any good?  Possibly the Minister for Finance thinks that it will.  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of thousands of people, if they realised what the Schedule contained, would not think so either. This will not worry the Minister unduly. He will regard it as his great achievement that no one can have any form of secret any more in the country.  No longer will it be possible to have any form of privacy without the Revenue Commissioners being entitled to find out.  If they see your neighbour looking over your fence they are entitled to serve a notice on your neighbour compelling him to disclose what he saw, how many chickens there were in your back garden. If somebody inadvertently finds out something about someone else a notice can be served on that person compelling him under penalty of law to disclose what he inadvertently found <Col N="1666" /> out.  We had in this House a few months ago an effort by Deputy Colley and various Deputies on this side of the House to put a stop to what the Minister had done to the relationship between solicitor and client but it failed.  The Minister stoutly defended the right of the Revenue Commissioners which he was giving them to compel solicitors to disclose anything and everything in relation to their clients' business.  The Minister finally put the seal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so and the Deputy knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He put a seal on the end of the confidential relationship between a solicitor and his client.  At that time we pointed out here that if the Minister was prepared to terminate the privileged and confidential relationship of a solicitor and client in aid of the Revenue Commissioners trying to collect more tax, then if he were logical he was far more entitled to do it if he or the Government were trying to find out something about a serious crime, for example, which is far more serious than simply the collection of tax.  Of course we were pooh-poohed and told it was all imagination and so on and it could never happen.  We pointed out that there were other confidential relationships which could be smashed when the relationship between a solicitor and client had been successfully smashed by statute of this House and we were pooh-poohed again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have a situation in paragraph 3 or 4 in which the relationship of solicitor and client is no longer necessary.  It can apply also to any relationship.  It can be the relationship of confessor and penitent, of doctor and patient.  People who are ill and worried have been known many times to discuss aspects of their financial affairs with their doctors, apart from solicitors or accountants or anyone else.  I am sure doctors regularly in the course of their practices acquire information given to them in confidence about the financial affairs of their patients.  They will be compelled under these sections to disclose that information to the Revenue <Col N="1667" /> Commissioners when notice is served on them.  Does the Minister seriously seek to stand over that kind of situation? Does he approve of it?  Did he realise what was in it, and now that he does realise, does he propose to do anything about amending it?  Are we going to have the ridiculous situation once more that 70 people over there will walk through the division lobbies behind him, half of them revolted in their stomachs at what they are forced to do and a lot of them not slow to tell one in the privacy of the corridors of this House how revolted they are?  Are we going to go through this charade again?  Are we going to pass into law measures that abominate us, which the present Minister for Finance would have spent hours on his feet trying to stop if he were on this side of the House and Deputy Colley or any other Fianna Fáil member were on that side?</P>
    <P>It is strange how the journey of five yards from one side of this House to the other side can cause a man to forget so quickly much of what he espoused for so long.  The earlier provisions of this Schedule are bad enough but there are provisions in paragraph 11 that Deputy Colley will deal with later that are even more appalling.  I do not want to deal with them now; I am dealing simply with paragraphs 3 and 4 and with the situation that arises under them, where anybody can be compelled now to give any information about anyone else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just for capital gains.  It specifically says income as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a lame attempt a minute ago to suggest that somewhere at the beginning of this Schedule it stated that a notice can be served for the purposes of this measure&mdash;I think it was in section 51 or one of the earlier sections&mdash;and he tried to suggest that the information that would be obtained on the service of all these notices could or would be used by the Revenue Commissioners only for the purpose of assessing people to capital gains tax.  I will <Col N="1668" /> pay the Minister the compliment of believing that he is naïve enough to believe that.  I do not think anyone else is.</P>
      <P>It is a well known fact that if the Revenue Commissioners obtain information under any of their various branches or headings they will distribute that information to all the other sections or divisions of the Revenue for the purposes of trying to screw the taxpayer under every possible heading.  There is the example which I deal with daily&mdash;the question of death duties&mdash;where as soon as the local inspector of taxes becomes aware that somebody has died he starts writing to the executor or the solicitor concerned looking for the schedule of assets.  This is examined and if anything turns up on the schedule which the inspector did not know about a big investigation is held and, as I well know and have seen it happen to a number of people, the deceased man's financial affairs going back to six or 12 years if necessary are scrutinised.  His estate is reassessed for income tax right back over that period.  The Minister cannot be serious in suggesting that the information that would be got under all these notices, that can be served on literally anybody, would not be used for any reason other than for the purposes of capital gains.  Of course it will be used. It will be used for income tax, for wealth tax, for inheritance tax, for gift tax and for VAT.  It will be used for anything else that the Revenue Commissioners can rake up and let nobody be under any illusions in relation to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that if any small fraction of what Deputy Colley and I have had to say about these paragraphs is reported that people will come to realise what they do not know already.  They do not know that there are huge, sweeping new powers proposed to be given here in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Schedule 5 to the Revenue Commissioners, compulsorily to make inquiries under legal penalty from anybody in this country to find out anything about the financial affairs of anyone else.  I cannot stop that.  We cannot stop that.  All we can do is to point <Col N="1669" /> out, which we are doing to the best of our ability, that this is happening and hope to goodness that the Minister will see reason or that some of his backbenchers if not publicly, will at least privately go to him and point out the foolishness of this and the resentment it will cause throughout the country and see if these paragraphs can be dropped or amended in some way.</P>
    <P>I ask him in particular to think of the situation of people like stockbrokers, who are now going to be compelled by the Revenue Commissioners to return every transaction to them, with the names and addresses of everyone who buys or sells shares through them and the amount involved. I ask him to think of the position of auctioneers selling moveable property, who will have to give exactly the same information and who will suffer all the penalties of law if they refuse.  I ask him once again to think of the position of issuing houses.  Who will have to give all this information in relation to shares that are being issued?  On this very day&mdash; ten million rights issues of Waterford Glass and the Allied Irish Banks are being issued.

    <P>These are serious and important matters; they are matters which we should not now be discussing in the recesses of the Fifth Schedule to this Bill.  These are matters that should be discussed in the open as sections in the main body of the Bill so that people would realise what is involved and we could have a proper debate on each of these paragraphs.  As it is, we are restricted from voting against the paragraphs individually; we must take the whole Schedule which, like all the other Schedules, is a very lengthy one, running into 9½ pages.  Because the speeches must range over the whole Schedule and because only one vote can be taken on the provisions in the Schedule as a whole, a quite false view can be obtained by many <Col N="1670" /> of the real effect of the Schedule because a great deal of it may be innocuous enough.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment I dealt with all points raised by the Deputies opposite and I thank them for their welcome of this Bill. I think everybody would welcome a measure designed to ensure that the people who hijack aircraft do not go free.</P>
      <P>There was one point raised which the Ceann Comhairle ruled was outside the scope of the Bill, but a number of Deputies commented on it and I think I should very briefly refer to Eurocontrol and my decisions regarding it.</P>
      <P>Eurocontrol was originally set up as an organisation to control the movement of aircraft in the upper air space.  This did not work out as envisaged by the original convention and it was watered down to some extent a number of years ago.  The United Kingdom and French Governments said they would not allow Eurocontrol personnel to operate in their air space.  A number of other countries may also have doubts about this.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the President of Eurocontrol about a month ago.  The relevant paragraph in my letter reads:</P>
      <P>I now wish to inform you that I am unable to agree that Eurocontrol should assume responsibility for the operation of a Shannon centre from 1st January, 1976, and in agreement with the Director-General it is my intention that for the foreseeable future the present arrangements should continue under which the exclusion of the air traffic control of the Shannon upper air space control is performed by the staff of my administration on behalf of the Euro control agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> That means that the Eurocontrol installations at Shannon and at Bantry will still be there but they will be operated by Irish personnel.  If Eurocontrol came in, there is no guarantee, because Eurocontrol would be in charge, what the nationality of the personnel operating the installations would be.  The trainees referred to earlier by Deputy Barrett were not trained by Eurocontrol; they were trained by the Irish Government.  The point about the pay rates, which are at present the subject of an investigation into pay relativities of air traffic control personnel, is that the people employed by Eurocontrol at Shannon &mdash;not necessarily Irish personnel, though we could expect to have a number of our personnel employed by Eurocontrol, but they could be working elsewhere in Europe&mdash;would be working alongside Irish personnel in the Irish air traffic control, who would be controlling the lower airspace and be doing exactly the same work for two different rates of pay.  Everybody will understand the difficulties this would pose for this or any other Government in relation to relativity of pay in the institutions or organisations under my control.</P>
    <P>That was one reason, but the primary reason why I decided that from 1st January, 1976, this should remain under the control of the Irish Government was that we would ensure that Irish people would operate and control the movement of air traffic in the upper airspace over Ireland.  I think that was the correct decision to take.  If, in the future, Eurocontrol either evolves or even moves back to the original concept in the convention, then we can re-think the position again because the facilities are there&mdash;they have been provided by Eurocontrol&mdash;but they must be operated by Irish personnel.  I think that is the correct thing to do.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to thank Deputies on both sides of the House for the welcome they have given this Bill.  The expeditious manner in which the Second Reading was debated underlined the problem posed by hijackers and the necessity for all <Col N="1672" /> Governments to take steps to contain their illegal activities.</P>

      <P>During today's debate, the Parliamentary Secretary in his speech drew a parallel between this Bill and the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, particularly in regard to extradition and so forth covered by section 5.  No parallel can be drawn between the two Bills.  Section 5 is in compliance with the Extradition Act, 1965.  We reject completely his allegations regarding our approach to this Bill as compared with that on the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill.  They were completely unwarranted.  As my colleague stated today in the House, <Col N="1673" /> the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach had an opportunity of having the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill debated in this House recently and he preferred to send it to the Seanad.  That was the time for him to introduce it here and have a full debate on it instead of trying to come in the back door, as he did here today, and draw a parallel between it and this Bill and our approach to the two Bills.</P>

      <P>On this section a person guilty of an offence under section 3 of this Bill shall be liable on conviction <Col N="1674" /> on indictment to imprisonment for life or for such other term as the court considers proper.  We are in full agreement with stiff sentences for hijacking in any form and the risk it places the lives of innocent people in.  Will there be consistency between the contracting countries to this Convention? In Article 3 of the Schedule it says &ldquo;each contracting State undertakes to make the offences mentioned in Article 1 punishable by severe penalties&rdquo;.  I feel there could be a great discrepancy between sentences in the different countries.  There should at least be some consistency. If there is life imprisonment in one country for an offence such as this, it should apply to all the contracting countries and not have an inconsistency between the sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The stiffest sentence which can be imposed under Irish law is a life sentence.  In fact some of the signatories to this Convention have death penalties as well and the severe penalty they may choose to impose may be that.  Under our law the most severe penalty we can impose is a life sentence and we have put it up to the limit of what is possible under the law.</P>

      <P>I think the point made by Deputy Barrett was that while we have put it up to the limit of our severest penalty of life there are others that could have the other approach to it and make them minimum penalties rather than severe.  You have to question the relevance of the word &ldquo;severe&rdquo;.  Is a year severe in the context of one country?  Would two years in gaol be considered severe in one country?  Surely there must be some consistency between the various countries.</P>

      <P>I imagine the approach of all countries and the attitude of all Parliaments would be the same as the attitude of this Parliament to it.  I think every country, who are conscious of their obligations internationally to sign this Convention and to ratify it, will incorporate in the legislation for the Convention severe penalties.  We have done our part by making the penalty as severe as possible <Col N="1675" /> under our law.  I am sure every other country will adopt the same attitude.  I see the point Deputy Burke is making.  I do not think there is much danger that someone taking the crime of hijacking seriously enough to sign this Convention would consider giving what might be a trivial penalty for the crime.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section and the Eurocontrol, which the Minister has mentioned again in his reply, as far as we understand it the policy of Eurocontrol is to employ Irish staff, where at all possible and where they are qualified.  We also understand that our people are qualified to operate Eurocontrol in the same way as other nationalities are.  Some of them have already received the necessary training. As the Minister has stated we are now operating as an agency and running Eurocontrol with Irish staff. We must assume from that that they are fully qualified to operate Eurocontrol installations here and that they would be employed if Eurocontrol took over complete responsibility for it, as was originally intended.  That as a reason does not stand up very well in our opinion.</P>
      <P>The reason the Minister put forward to the President of the Commission was that by the introduction of Eurocontrol staff at Shannon in particular, where most of it would be operational, these people paid at Eurocontrol levels and working beside Irish controlled staff discharging similar duties at substantially lower levels of remuneration would increase unrest among the air traffic control and related grades of the Irish aviation administration. This unrest, because of the established relationships with remuneration of corresponding grades in other Departments of the Government, would likely extend rapidly throughout the entire public service and stimulate sharply the inflationary wage and salary situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> This is the only reason that we know of that was put forward for not complying with the original agreements under Eurocontrol from 1st January, 1976.  We believe the people who are now operating as agency on our behalf for Eurocontrol should be entitled to the full benefit of the rates of pay which are available anywhere Eurocontrol will be operating, in other words, by European standards.</P>
    <P>We know of no reason why this should not be made available to them. They are fully entitled to it because they are now doing, and will continue to do, work at a lower rate of pay than the people directly employed by Eurocontrol would be getting for the same service.  We do not believe that there would be an escalation of salary increase claims all over the public sector if this were to happen.  It is already happening and it is accepted by people in the public sector that the people employed by European institutions or Eurocontrol and paid at European standards get the proper rate and the rate available from these institutions for the work.  We already gave as an instance today the foundation for improvement of living and working conditions announced by the Minister for Labour which will be here in this country.  It is a European foundation.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy, but I fail to see the relationship between what is developing in respect of wages and conditions of employment and section 7, which is a very brief section.  I simply cannot relate it to matters appertaining to wages and conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned it today and we already debated it.  However, with respect, a Cheann Comhairle, section 10 of the Air Navigation Eurocontrol Act, 1973, is specifically mentioned here, hence the references to Eurocontrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interests of giving the best possible facilities and service to air naviation, as a participating nation we should ensure that this is made available. If Eurocontrol take over and run these installations, pay the same <Col N="1677" /> people at the higher rates of pay now prevailing under Eurocontrol, they should at least be allowed to do so. Irish people are now running this as an agency at lower rates of pay, and as the Minister said will continue to act as agents for Eurocontrol.  We do not believe they should be expected to do this, whereas by complying with the original agreement under Eurocontrol they would be paid by European standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister on Second Stage to indicate Government policy in relation to the future of Eurocontrol; whether he wanted it phased out or developed and I did not get a satisfactory answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>To take Deputy Herbert's point, we do not want it phased out.  We would like to see it grow, as it was originally decided it should grow, in 1963.  However, this has already been watered down, and we felt that because of the watering down and of the fact that the United Kingdom and France had not accepted the Convention as drawn up in 1963, we should also protect the interests of our workers and see that we retain as much control as possible over the operations of upper air space control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the points made by Deputy Barrett.  Eurocontrol would get their revenue from the users of the upper air space.  Therefore, the higher the charges being levied for the use of that air space, the higher would be the charges to the aircraft.  That would include Aer Lingus, who would be one of the prime users of our upper air space.  The higher the level of the costs of Eurocontrol within the Shannon region, the higher the level the charges would be to Aer Lingus&mdash; raising their costs and air fares for a large number of Irish people.  The prime purpose of our refusing to go ahead with Eurocontrol on 1st January was the protection of jobs for Irish people.  It is true that some people at Shannon at present could be recruited into Eurocontrol, but there was no guarantee they would all be recruited, nor was there any <Col N="1678" /> guarantee that anybody who was recruited into Eurocontrol would be given employment at Shannon: they could be employed wherever Eurocontrol has a base.  I believed it was preferable to ensure that those who are presently working in upper air space control in Shannon should be retained in their positions.  That was one of the reasons I refused to go ahead with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the people we are talking about &mdash;the air traffic control officers at Shannon&mdash;find the conditions under which they would go into service in Eurocontrol acceptable to them?  From my discussions with them and my knowledge of the situation there, they are all in favour of it, and they do not see any reason to be afraid that their employment will be interrupted or that their conditions of employment will disimprove in any way.  They are the people directly involved and it would be acceptable to them.  The Minister says we are protecting their employment, but they will continue to work as agents for Eurocontrol at the lower rates of pay, whereas they are willing to go under the umbrella of Eurocontrol for the benefit of the higher wages, and to continue to do the same work.  They do not see any risk involved about shifting around Europe. They are people who usually go into minute detail about most things but have no fear of this happening.</P>
      <P>With regard to the higher charges for the upper air space, surely the Eurocontrol air space charges would be in line with other areas throughout the world, where our national air line has to fly.  Where our country is concerned, as far as I am aware, it would mean that the responsibility for the upper air space would be from West Germany to midway across the Atlantic.  Surely, this would bring honour, as well as better employment, to our nation to have it operated from our shores.  We have already done a lot of the initial work by having the installations completed. We fail to see the reasoning of the Minister and we believe that we should go on with our commitment to Eurocontrol from 1st January, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1679" />
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically the last point made by Deputy Barrett is wrong. Under Eurocontrol we would operate from about 15º west to about 5½º west.  Eurocontrol is an umbrella organisation over the whole of Central Europe and we would then pass out of that into other Eurocontrol centres in Europe.  There would be no question of us operating this because the radar or other instruments would not extend to Germany and would not be technically capable of doing that.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the point about people being recruited to Eurocontrol. It is true that the people at Shannon now are perfectly capable and the terms of employment with Eurocontrol are very acceptable to them.  However, I wish to make the point that there would be no guarantee that they would be employed by Eurocontrol, nor if they were employed, is there any guarantee that their place of employment would be in Ireland.  While they are under Irish control and while we operate as agents for Eurocontrol we can guarantee them employment.  If they transfer to Eurocontrol, we could not guarantee them employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>These people would be willing to transfer to Eurocontrol and take their chances.  As far as we are aware, it is the declared policy of Eurocontrol to employ nationals here or anywhere else, where such people are available.  We see no reason why they will suddenly depart from that policy.  Our people would accept the risk, even though&mdash;as the Minister says&mdash;they would be taking a chance. They are confident that they would be employed and would be&mdash;as the Minister agrees&mdash;capable of doing the work.</P>
      <P>I am afraid we must again disagree: the reason put forward does not warrant our fulfilling our commitment, as a nation, to Eurocontrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that it is Eurocontrol policy to employ local staff, when they are available? They only employ non-nationals where there is not sufficient local qualified staff.  The Germans, the Belgians and the Dutch are concerned about the <Col N="1680" /> future of Eurocontrol.  They want to see it expand, as was the original intention.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister how Eurocontrol is financed?  Is it a percentage of the GNP of the member states?  I would ask the Minister what was our contribution to Eurocontrol last year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I have not got that figure, but as regards the Dutch wanting to see Eurocontrol expand, one of the Eurocontrol centres is in Holland, so the Dutch Government have not passed over the control of the upper air space to Eurocontrol, even though the Eurocontrol station is in their own territory.  I am sorry I have not got the figure for our contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points I should like to make on this.  One is the question of Article 1.  It was a point I raised earlier regarding the responsibilities that are being placed on the shoulders of the pilots as the commanders of the aircraft. The Minister in his reply on Second Stage mentioned the question of a man, for example, having a few drinks; if violence arose the pilot would have to consider for himself what was hijacking and what was violence.  If you look at Article 1 of the Schedule you will see that in respect of any person who commits an offence, the responsibility for dealing with the situation is placed on the pilot at all times.  If the pilot, in the ordinary course of his flight report, reports an incident on a flight, is that sufficient notification under this measure to the police?  Is the responsibility then on his employers, the airline company, or does the pilot himself have to go along personally and notify the police?  What would be the interpretation of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If somebody even attempted to attack or commit an act <Col N="1681" /> of violence on the plane the pilot would decide to have him removed from the plane, and he would then be bound, under this Bill, to report that fact to the Garda who would take whatever further action was necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>But the point I am trying to get at is if the pilot, after an incident such as that, comes back and reports to his own airline, is that sufficient notification if, for example, the airline did not pass on the message?  In that case would the liability go back on to the pilot?  Does the pilot have to go to the local Garda station after getting off the plane to notify the guards of an incident on the plane or is it sufficient to notify his own flight control?</P>

      <P>Speaking on the last day I put forward some of our objections on this side of the House to this proposed agreement.  Since that time there have been added reasons for looking at this matter again.  This document is dated &ldquo;3rd November, 1974, Brussels&rdquo;, and since then we have seen quite a lot of changes in the supply and demand of oil and gases.  There is one basic weakness and that is that I do not believe the Government have proceeded in the right way to set up proper machinery for the handling of (a) imported oils and gases or (b) oils and gases found on our own territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This failing is not confined to this country alone.  Indeed, much bigger countries have shown that they have not perfected their organisations to handle this very important facet of our whole economic life.  Our Government have failed also to set up State machinery or a State Department which would guarantee to the utmost extent possible that our whole approach to the development of natural gases and oils would be done in the best possible manner.  I do not think we have the organisation here to do this and we shall pay for this very, very dearly in the future unless the Government decide to go about the matter in a different and a more expert way, because we are on the threshold of tremendous changes in the whole field of vital supplies of gas and oil for this country.  I note that this agreement includes 17 countries including very, very powerful countries like the United States and Japan along with others who are not quite so powerful.  In fact some of them are about our own size but by now most of these countries are taking this whole matter very seriously indeed. They are not just rushing into this agreement.  I do not know what their final attitude will be on it, whether it is at variance with the House of Parliament in the various countries, but from past experience we know that some of these countries are noted for the way in which they perfect their organisation and the whole attitude in their own interests.  Nobody would blame them for looking after <Col N="1683" /> their own interests, but we in Ireland might well look carefully, before we enter into this agreement, at the home scene, and see what we can do to become good members of some international body which will have as its prime object some kind of equity in the distribution and the development of natural resources.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow morning if we were to be told that there was plenty of natural gas and oil on the east coast, apart from the Celtic Sea, if it came further north as far as Dublin, I wonder how we would go about it, because in my opinion we have not got the organisation which is capable of fully developing or finding these resources. In saying that I am quite conscious that we have not got the finance or the personnel to go out and search for oil and gas.  Therefore, we have to come to some agreement by perhaps joining multi-nationals so that they will do the work of finding these resources and having done that and having entered into an agreement with them, we can then decide to develop these resources in our interests and on a world-wide level.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister confident that we could handle this great problem?  If he is not satisfied would he take steps to build up this organisation?  To my mind this should be given top priority as regards any Government reorganisation. I feel we are on the brink of a great breakthrough.  If the oil and gas is there in sufficient quantities our whole economy will be changed.  We could become a fairly affluent country. If because of our own negligence we had to forego some of nature's gifts in the form of gas and oil because we did not take the trouble to recruit extra personnel, to allocate special moneys for planning, we entered into an agreement with six other countries because they will do the job for us, this is a mistake.  We have to develop our own resources. Since this was first given to us things have changed rapidly.  I feel the Government are not monitoring sufficiently the developments in the finding of gas or oil.  I am convinced that when they do find it it is not being <Col N="1684" /> put to the best use.  I am sure the Minister has acted on the best advice he could get as to how natural gas should be used for conversion into electricity or should NET be given an allocation.  It has been pointed out to the Minister that this is a very wasteful way.  There are other ways of using natural gas which would give a far better return.  To convert into electricity only a 40 per cent return is obtained.  To convert into gas 80 per cent return is obtained.  The Minister may well say that we have to cut down our oil imports.  Therefore he says to the ESB: You take this oil and cut down your oil imports.  At the other end of the scale you are paying for it because a return of more than 40 per cent is not possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have looked at all our resources, whether turf, coal, hydro schemes or tidal waters. He should have a director of fuel resources who would have special powers to enable him to pin-point certain things, such as examining the use of tidal waters or ascertaining if our coal resources can be used. It was said some years ago that it was uneconomic to use our mines.  At the time that statement could have been justified.  It could be said that we could buy coal outside much cheaper; that coal here costs too much to mine. Those days are gone.  Our economy is now depending on these resources.</P>
    <P>We are worried now about the destruction of the environment when we see our beaches littered with rubbish. Some countries are generating electricity from the rubbish they burn. This is no startling new invention.</P>
    <P>I remember that in my own area we had an electricity station which was using the rubbish from the streets in order to generate electricity.  That was the old Pembroke Urban District Council power station at Ringsend. It is now owned by the ESB.  They do not use rubbish now to produce electricity: we import oil or use the very scarce natural gas to do it.  We could produce energy from our rubbish: it was done in Dublin 30 or 40 years ago and it worked reasonably well at a time when engineers had not <Col N="1685" /> got the expertise in this field that they have now.  Our streets would be kept cleaner by removing all the rubbish from them and by destroying it in an incinerator which could generate the steam to generate electricity.  The records of what they turned out are there for the Minister to see.  The ESB have all these records.  With the scarcity of energy fuels we may well have to use this type of fuel to fire generating stations.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  We are saving oil and gas and by destroying this refuse we are generating electricity.</P>
    <P>I feel we have been rather cavalier in our attitude to the use of oil.  The Minister some time ago levied 28p on petrol.  He explained to the House that we were the only nation in Europe which had not done this type of thing. It was a rather brutal method of making us cut back on our use of oil and petrol.  Had the Government looked at this properly they would have seen that a selective system of rationing industry&mdash;which was prepared but not put into practice&mdash; would be carried out.</P>
    <P>By his action he may have made us cut back on our use of oil and gas but he also cost many people their jobs.  Industries were hit by this increase in the cost of oil and petrol and they cut back in turn by sacking people.  The Government have not tackled this whole problem of energy and fuel conservation very wisely.</P>
    <P>When we are drawing gas from Kinsale we must realise that we will interfere with the balance of nature on the sea bed there.  We will do some damage.  The oil which has lain there for a million years and has suddenly been taken out must upset the balance of nature.  Have we thought of what to do to counteract that?  It may be said that other countries have had this problem: what have they done to solve it?</P>
    <P>Other countries are paying the penalty today for the mistakes they made when they began to reap the benefits of their mineral wealth.  We can learn from their mistakes and ensure that we do not fall into the same traps.  I would suggest to the Minister that he <Col N="1686" /> set up this committee.  No doubt the men studying this whole question of mineral exploration are competent but we must ensure that there is an adequate number of people involved and that these are of the highest calibre possible.  With the prospect of oil and gas resources our whole approach to life is changing.  We are entering a new era.  However, every step possible must be taken to ensure that this wealth from sea and land will not result in the despoiling of the sea and the countryside.  The temptation is great for the Government to grab some of this oil or gas as soon as they possibly can.  It is understandable that they should have that attitude but it would be very very wrong indeed if we are to play any part whatever in the despoilation of the environment so as to enrich ourselves with these resources.  Partly because of a shortage of essential materials many of our people are unemployed but we have now an opportunity of planning for the future.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the Government examined this whole agreement with the companies concerned before deciding that we should enter into it.  Perhaps they are having second thoughts on it now.  The discussion began in November last.  Since then things have been changing and soon we may see the oil rigs in the sea around us but have we built up a structure here which can control the exploration of these resources?  Have we studied the best use to which they can be put?  I shudder at the thought of any of the oil or gas being wasted. Whatever stocks are there are not inexhaustible and future generations would condemn us were we to squander these resources.  Therefore in this serious business of exploration and development the onus rests with the Government to take every possible step to ensure that we do not waste any of the oil or gas.  It is all right entering into these national agreements but once a shortage comes the 90-days' supply that we must maintain can be used very quickly.  Once oil becomes scarce one has no guarantee that a country like ours would be given any great consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1687" /> People here have found to their cost that although they had made contracts for supply of oils in peace times under normal conditions they did not last very long when these became scarce.  Therefore, I say to the Minister that before we begin operating this agreement the Minister should have a through examination carried out of all our resources to see what can we use apart from oil or gas, which are so very valuable.  We must spare our resources as much as possible. When I was at school we were taught that there were no minerals under our soil.  In recent years we have found that this is not so.  While we look forward to the future with confidence we also have fears for the future.  The Government have failed in their duty to build up a section of the Government to deal solely with the development of these and other resources.  This criticism I make of the Government may be well justified because some other countries have admitted that they failed to plan properly, that they became so excited at the thought of having natural gas or oil, they went almost berserk in their rather brutal assault on these resources. They will pay in the future for their mistakes because nature will never allow a wastage of resources without hitting back in some way.  We may find that in 20 or 30 years' time whoever is standing here discussing our energy problems may well look back and say that it was in this decade we found natural gas, that we got oil from our seas but that we missed a great chance of benefiting the country because we did not take the time to study how these resources should be used.  We must have higher ambitions.  From our natural oil resources we may get enough petrol for our car but much more can be done with oil.  The Government can achieve a twofold purpose if, even at this late hour, they study what can be done to develop our existing resources and to develop the potential of our mineral resources.  They can make us almost self-sufficient.  They can provide employment by utilising our own resources. <Col N="1688" /> As has been suggested, the refuse from our streets can be used to generate electricity and therefore this would result in a reduction of oil imports.  We should be able to dispose of refuse by turning it into the production of electricity.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he ask this committee to examine this possibility.  Experiments were carried out at Ringsend many years ago with the generation of electricity from refuse. The point was made that it was uneconomic, but it is not uneconomic. Many people today are finding out that the use of electricity is uneconomic for the pursestrings and they cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he can do a very good job in the development of our resources, but his own Department must prepare the ground for the building up of a proper organisation for the development of energy and ensure that the resources will not be wasted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion set out that Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Agreement establishing an International Energy Programme.  My purpose is, in association with Deputy Barrett, our spokesman, and the other Fianna Fáil Deputies who spoke on it, to try to persuade Dáil Éirann and the Government not to endorse Irish participation in the International Energy Programme.  We think that the Government are being arrogant in forcing this agreement through the Dáil with their majority of votes.  We think the whole attitude of the Government has been wrong, that they took this position because they did not see, from the beginning, the implications of this agreement and the agency and all that goes with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, whose pigeon, so to speak, this was, did not treat the matter seriously in the Dáil.  He made a very brief contribution and, in a kind of throwaway line, said that its effectiveness could be judged by the possibility that it would never be needed.  Uncharacteristically, I might say, because normally he is a man of some courtesy, the Minister for Transport and Power on another <Col N="1689" /> occasion attacked Deputies Barrett, O'Malley and others and accused them of being ignorant and not having read the agreement.  I have a feeling that the raw nerve was exposed by the spotlight which the Fianna Fáil speaker put upon this agreement, the dangers contained in it and its implications for the future.</P>
    <P>The whole idea seems to have been that we weighed in with people because of what happened when oil prices were raised, with resulting panic in the industrial western countries and the developing countries as well.  The Minister at the meeting of the agency in Paris said that one of the effects of the policies being pursued in joining the agency and subscribing to this agreement would be that greater control over the economic destinies of the countries concerned would be achieved. In fact, this statement shows that the Minister either does not see the implications or does not choose to reveal to the public what the implications of this agreement are.</P>
    <P>Deputies from this side have teased out this whole problem very carefully and have pointed out the dangers to the Government.  The Minister promised to throw light on the subject in his speech.  All we have had so far is obfuscation, and we hope that this light will come.</P>
    <P>We do not think that a cynical approach to the contributions from this side of the House is the proper attitude to adopt.  We do not think that in the past 18 months or more the Government have had a viable fuel and energy policy and this is illustrated by the attitude which the Minister and the Government have adopted with regard to this International Energy Programme Agency and all that it involves.</P>
    <P>It was quite clear, earlier on, that the large oil companies were playing a very profitable game for themselves. This was highlighted in the debate by Deputy Barrett.  Deputy Barrett went on to make positive and practical suggestions as to how we could counteract this problem and work for our own particular benefit.  The present time, as Deputy Moore said, is one which is full of hope for the country. <Col N="1690" /> We are on the verge, we hope, of an achievement which may set the country on a very prosperous road in the near future.  That being so, it becomes all the more important that every step we take in relation to energy should be taken carefully, with due thought and consideration.  The oil exploration has got under way and gas has been discovered.  This puts an obligation on the Government to be extremely careful on what they do.  We do not think they are going the right way about handling the situation at present.</P>
    <P>What are we doing?  We are being asked to join an organisation which, in effect, is controlled by the United States.  Dr. Kissinger and President Ford have been over in Europe to show their concern.  It is a type of OECD.  A major European Economic Community member opted out.  Why? France has for a long time been pursuing a quasi-independent energy policy and France opted out because France is suspicious that it is not her interests which will be pursued in the International Energy Agency.  They have a nuclear policy of their own. They were accused of pursuing this policy for narrow patriotic reasons at the time and, again, people are suspicious of them in this regard.</P>
    <P>I do not think it should be a matter of criticism for France or any country to pursue its own interests in such a vital field.  Admittedly, their first go-it-alone energy policy, with regard to atomic energy, collapsed in 1968.  They had to go back to purchase enriched uranium from the country they suspected might try to control their energy policy.  They had this gas graphite reactor technology fairly well advanced at that time but, on purely economic grounds, it collapsed.  I know there is supposed to be a reaction against production of nuclear energy for any purpose, civil or military or otherwise, in France at the moment but it would be interesting to speculate as to whether they may go back to the gas graphite technology again.  The only reason it collapsed before was that it was too expensive to produce energy in that way at that time because oil was so cheap.  They <Col N="1691" /> may go back to it now.  I do not know. The gas graphite reactors formed natural uranium at that time and this was available in France and in the franc zone.  I am using this as an illustration that we are advocating our own views on this.  We are advocating our own policies.  We do not want to be drawn in with the times, to be drawn in with people whose aims may not be our aims.  What serves them may not serve us.  We are asking the Government to take cognisance of this.</P>
    <P>The United States and Canada are very strong countries.  I am not indulging in what Seán O'Faoláin once called auto anti-Americanism, which is a tendency among some people, both thoughtless people and people who have their own particular ideological axe to grind, in doing this.  You must be practical.  You are dealing with large companies, powerful companies, whose only interest is profits.  If there is a way for dealing with this situation, it is the duty of the Government to deal with it in such a way that we ourselves will benefit.  We are not really worried about other strong economies in this particular agency. If one is to read the discriminating journals on the matter of energy even in the last week one can see that the real puzzle in this international energy agency is what does America want, what does America think, how can that be modified by others who wish to modify it <i>et cetera?</i> American policy is changing.  In the very beginning they had one policy.  Recently the policy is to up the price of oil.  The President has imposed $2 per barrel import duty on oil.  He is going to decontrol prices.  This is the policy now.  That is the one that suits the United States as of now.  What I am saying is that our policy should be geared and formulated in such a way that it will suit us.</P>
    <P>The political aspect of this is very important.  We are a small country. The Minister for Foreign Affairs claims that we have a good reputation as honest brokers in places that are important now from the point of view of oil.  There is the danger <Col N="1692" /> that we will be identified with a power bloc because economics in this matter and policies are all mixed.  There is no easy way in which they can be separated.  We cannot keep the economics of energy in one box and political policies in another.  If you belong to an agency in which there is a country which says: &ldquo;If we are running short of fuel we may go to war&rdquo;, some of the odium that comes from a statement like that will rub off on everybody that belongs to that agency. There can be no doubt about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been making flights into Egypt and the Middle East recently and the hat he was wearing was that of the European Economic Community.  Possibly when he is relieved of the duties, which are heavy duties, that are imposed on him by that office he may be able to fly out there and test his own theory that we are acceptable in the area as honest brokers, as people without an imperial past, who suffered from imperialism, as people who will be listened to, and use that kind of situation to the economic advantage of this country.  But it will be more difficult for him if he is identified with people who have different axes to grind, however justifiable the grinding of that axe may be with regard to the individual interest of the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Minister had some kind of insight when in the Middle East he forecast that there would not be any increase in crude oil prices.  The Shah of Persia would have accompanied him on tour around the Middle East and if he had listened to him he would have probably heard him say that by next autumn there will be a further increase in Middle East oil prices, and the Shah of Persia has been moving around, interestingly enough, in South America as well.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister for Transport and Power could convince me or convince this side of the House that through membership of this agency, through subscribing to this agreement, we can gain an advantage for ourselves and that this advantage will offset the suspicion that we will <Col N="1693" /> draw on ourselves through our association with groups that are economically much stronger than us, some of them self-sufficient practically in oil.</P>
    <P>Last autumn I spent a considerable time discussing the oil situation, in particular that aspect of the energy problem, with members of the Federal Parliament of Canada, and Canada is a member of the Agency.  The Canadians, I was told by these men, are self-sufficient in fact in oil.  They export oil all right from the western part of Canada to the United States but that at that time was simply because the transport of oil from the western part of Canada to the eastern part was more expensive, and would make the oil more expensive than importing it from the eastern part of the country concerned.  I am not in any way denigrating Canada but this is the bed fellow in this agency that we are dealing with.  If they washed it out of the sands of Athabaska, there is more oil in the sand than would do this country for a thousand years.  I am trying to make the point that if you are in an agency you must see that you will profit by membership of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett has been urging continually that we increase our refining capacity.  This would, of course, also imply greater storage.  I cannot see why the Minister and the Government have not already taken steps in this regard.  We may have to increase storage perforce through belonging to this agency, or we may have to get somebody else to store for us.</P>
    <P>During the last war we were depending totally on Mincing Lane for our tea&mdash;and the Minister may know something about this.  Seán Lemass was very anegry that when the pressure went on, the self-interest of another country which then had control, saw to it that we got damn all tea at that time.  Afterwards, he refused to have any dealings with them and said that he made a gentleman's agreement but he would only make a gentleman's agreement with gentlemen.  When the hard economic facts, profit and loss, a country's need and industry's need, are uppermost, <Col N="1694" /> then a particular country will serve itself.  For that reason, this side of the House has urged on the Government to get a programme for extra refining under way.</P>
    <P>I am informed by Deputy Barrett that 2½ million tons are refined in Whitegate, 1½ million tons in Belfast, and that there is leeway for about five million tons more for the country altogether, that is, about nine million tons altogether. This is a Government who have five Labour Ministers, and here is a suggestion that would give more independence to this country with regard to oil and all the development that comes with oil, the provision of energy for heating, lighting, industry and development.  It would give more independence, more employment on the ground, more chance of downstream development and petro-chemical industries.  Above all, it would leave the country in a position that it could stand on its own in times of crisis.  Finally, if our oil comes on flow, we will have the capacity to refine it and to develop our own industries.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, it has been said that one of the reasons we cannot increase our refining capacity is that we might have to export.  What is wrong with that?  The Minister for Finance is shouting at us that we must export or starve.  What is wrong with exporting?  I cannot see it.  I am not being simplistic; if we have something to export, why can we not export?  In the meantime, Deputy Barrett has pointed out, time and time again, that we can buy the crude oil much cheaper than it is being bought at the moment for our own refinery.  I am saying &ldquo;in the meantime&rdquo;, before we have our own oil, as we all hope we shall have in the not-too-distant future.</P>
    <P>We are not asking the Government to set up a Government refinery but to set up a refinery about which they will have information and where they will know the costings.  At present this is not true, even of the refinery we have.  The refinery at Cork, apparently, never becomes the owner of the crude oil which it refines itself. <Col N="1695" /> It only acts as an agent.  This is the way the international thimbleriggery goes on.  It acts as an agent for different shareholders.  There is no control over the cost of the crude oil, and the refined products are then distributed by the Irish-based subsidiaries of the foreign-owned companies, again on an agency basis.  If we had our own refinery the Government would know exactly at each stage what were the costings.</P>
    <P>Everybody realises that when the first meeting was held in Paris, Dr. Kissinger tried to bulldoze his own way through and would have nothing to do with the raw material producing countries.  He then had to change his attitude somewhat at the next meeting.  He now sees that some <i>modus vivendi</i> will have to be worked out because the OPEC will not have it any other way.  If he develops an antagonism to the whole idea among the OPEC countries he is damaging this agency and he is damaging us as a member of the agency.  This is the thesis that I have been pushing all the time.</P>
    <P>There was an old football supporter in Cavan who had a very telling phrase: he advised against picking a very young man for a football team. He might be good but a bit young and immature.  He always said &ldquo;It is not a good thing for a gossoon to hang up his trousers among men's clothes&rdquo;.  That is what we are doing, if we join this type of agency.  It is ridiculous for anyone to claim that the interests of Ireland can be identical with the interests of large countries who are almost self-sufficient in oil and energy or who have oil or enriched uranium to sell.  It is ridiculous to think that our interests would necessarily correspond.  I am not indulging in what an Irish writer called &ldquo;auto anti-Americanism&rdquo;.  On the contrary, they have never really got credit for what they did for Europe.  After the war, 3 per cent of their GNP was spent in trying to set up Europe again.  I am simply saying that in matters such as this where there are large multi-national companies&mdash;I do not want to identify the <Col N="1696" /> companies as all American because they are not&mdash;you must be in a position to watch their proceedings and be in a position to be as independent of them as possible.  This side of the House is advocating that.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, talked about a co-operative dialogue between oil consuming countries and oil producing countries, and he referred also to the importance of bringing in the developing countries in this dialogue.  These are sentiments of which we approve, but the Minister himself could see from that first meeting in Paris how difficult it was to get that idea across to the more powerful members of the agency.  At the second meeting there was a slight a very slight, change.  The idea of setting up a commission, and so forth, was partially accepted, but it is as well to reflect that the OPEC countries have the whip hand and a very strong whip hand at that and if they decide that there must be&mdash;using the term that is being used now&mdash;indexation, a linking of raw material prices and oil prices <i>et cetera</i>, if they pursue that with enough skill and enough will-power it will have to be conceded to them.</P>
    <P>This country should, in view of its own economic history, apart from political history altogether, think favourably on the OPEC countries and on the developing countries in this regard because one of the most moving reasons for me personally and for many others supporting the idea of a European Economic Community was that no longer would this country be a food-producing country for which it would be paid the bare minimum by industrially developed countries.  This is an analogy.  It is a parallel case.  If we are forced by members of this agency to line up with people who will fight very hard before they will allow indexation, before they will allow the link-up of raw materials for industry or food for consumption, I think we will not be true to ourselves or true to our own political or economic history.</P>
    <P>When the Minister in his opening speech was recommending acceptance of the agreement, he referred to the <Col N="1697" /> idea of developing alternative sources of energy and said that this would be part of this agency's business.  This is highly desirable but France has, as I said already, for its own reasons decided to join and France has launched a very good programme of development of alternative sources of energy.  There have been recent articles pointing out that they are investing in the development of geothermal energy, solar energy and other sources of energy, such as wind and water, and even the use of waste for the production of energy.  If this particular aspect of energy activities can be dealt with by a country like France without joining the agency there could not be any very compelling reason for us to join.</P>
    <P>In a country such as ours, where there are limited resources available for research and development we, and we are entitled to do so, can take advantage of the result of research and development in other countries and we should hope that, even outside this agency, the results of research and development for alternative sources of energy in every country, apart from those within the agency, will be available to us.</P>
    <P>The original idea of the Americans, the major partner in this international energy agency, was to try and frighten the OPEC countries, to try and frighten the Arabs.  They had a definite policy that if you were tough enough with them&mdash;a kind of 19th-century type of Palmerston attitude, bring in the gunboat attitude&mdash;you would break them down or they would quarrel among themselves and in this way some kind of economic advantage would accrue to the west or to the agency, which is OECD plus.  I do not think the Arabs will wear that kind of thing any longer.</P>
    <P>We should get back to the suggestion made over the months by Deputy Barrett on this side of the House that the Government should start now planning extra refining capacity.  Admittedly, it is an expensive operation. If the Government cannot get the money for remedial teachers it is a bit ridiculous, I suppose, to be talking <Col N="1698" /> about providing money for the development of a refinery now.  But I am not saying that the Government should necessarily do it; the Government should encourage it, and encourage it in such a way that the Government will know what is going on in the oil business at every stage from the crude oil to the finished product or products.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points I should like to make.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his contribution at column 1997 of volume 279 of the Official Report, said:</P>
    <P>What has not emerged at all from the Opposition speeches is that the agreement is designed to cope with the situation than can arise if there is either a general boycott and reduction in supplies or a discriminatory boycott against particular countries because producer countries dislike their politics or dislike what they conceive to be their politics or their views.  I would have thought the need for that was evident.</P>
    <P>That, in fact, is an admission of our thesis on this side of the House.  What he is concerned with is a boycott on other powers.  I use the word &ldquo;powers&rdquo; deliberately because it is a question of power politics.  He is concerned with other powers.  There have been colonial powers in the past in Europe or other places.  That might be, because of their political involvement in the Middle East, regarded as hostile by the Arabs.  We have nothing to gain from association with such powers.  We have everything to gain by using whatever unique position we have if we have it&mdash;and the Minister for Foreign Affairs says we have&mdash;to our own advantage.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 1st June, 1975 states:</P>
    <P>More temporate doubts centred round Kissinger's failure to make clear how, if at all, the three commissions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>These three commissions are to deal with the whole idea of the developing countries, the OPEC countries, raw materials, indexation and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" />&mdash;&mdash;were supposed to interact with each other, or what relation their work would have to the eventual Energy Conference which, in one form or another, remains the goal of all the participants.  Garret FitzGerald, the Irish Foreign Minister, expressed considerable scepticism that the proposals were sufficient to get real negotiations off the ground.  President Giscard revealed on Friday that he had told President Gerald Ford at the NATO Summit in Brussels: &ldquo;There is no question of treating the three subjects in a parallel but totally separate fashion, there must be a global discussion on all of them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the genesis of Dr. FitzGerald's scepticism was.  I hope that it started off due to the line taken by Deputy Barrett and the speakers from this side of the House, the doubts that were expressed here about the wisdom of the whole idea, about the danger of antagonising the OPEC countries by associating with other groups, which for political or economic reasons may have incurred either the distrust or the hostility of the Arab countries.  I hope that Dr. FitzGerald was learning from the attitude that was taken by this side of the House.</P>

      <P>The conference in April was initiated by the French Government, by President Giscard. This is what Deputy FitzGerald is referring to.  It has nothing to do with the IEA.  It was coincidental that the NATO Conference and the OECD Conference followed on the IEA Conference. They were separate things.</P>

      <P>I know M. Giscard told the second conference what he had told President Ford at the NATO Conference.  What I am really concerned with is that obviously the French see it in much the same terms as we see it, namely that if the OPEC countries say: You must take into account the developing countries, the price of raw materials, we must try and link the whole thing up and the Americans say no, then if you are in <Col N="1700" /> the American camp, by association, you are bringing some suspicion, some slight hostility or distrust from the people who are producing the oil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit Dr. Kissinger did this because he saw that his original attitude, which was the attitude of his administration generally, had failed.  When he could not get everybody to agree on the price of raw materials, which had nothing to do with the price of oil, with the producers of raw materials, who are being championed in the developing countries by the OPEC countries, he fell back, as a good diplomat, on line No. 2.  He now wants three commissions to discuss among other things raw material prices and so on. M. Giscard wants a global meeting, where the whole thing is taken into consideration, where they are all inter-linked.  Dr. Kissinger still wants oil on its own and he also wants to dominate the policy of the IEA.</P>

      <P>The French went to Washington and the Minister for Foreign Affairs was there.  At that time they were not taking a global American view and they have not since.</P>
      <P>My basic thesis is that we have nothing as a country to gain from being in this agency.  In fact, we have all to lose and I pointed out the reasons why. I pointed out positively what Deputy Barrett has been pointing out since the crisis arose in the beginning, that there is a positive policy we can pursue. We are urging the Minister to take cognisance of what we are saying, that he realise how important it is to have refining capacity for the reasons I gave. The trade unions, I hope will weigh in behind our policy and push the lethargic and phlegmatic Labour Members of this Government into making sure that we have our own refinery to cope with the rest of our needs, get us out of the outer zone syndrome so that when our own oil comes on flow we will have the capacity to refine it. When we have this particular refinery, unlike the one we have now, we will have more information about the costings of oil production and the other ancillary industries.  We will be able even to export oil in the future and thus enrich our own economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose contributing to the debate is not to fill in time but to endeavour to show the Minister that we are sincere in our belief. We feel the Government have made a mistake in asking us to be a party to this International Energy Programme Agreement.  I read the Minister's speech twice and it is simply words. It is pickled with clichés, contains no ideas that would convince me that it would be wise to enter into this agreement. To my mind it is a monument to departmental thinking.  I often wonder why we spell the word &ldquo;departmental&rdquo; as Dept. in the abbreviated form and leave out the &ldquo;mental&rdquo;. I can see &ldquo;mental&rdquo; was left out in this case because this denotes an attitude that whoever was responsible&mdash; the Minister must bear the brunt of <Col N="1703" /> the responsibility&mdash;has applied themselves to this problem with a very closed mind.  I can see no sign of a breath of fresh air in this.  It is the product of this gregarious instinct that herds us in along with other people. We feel we must do what the majority of other people do.</P>
      <P>The agreement is another indication that this is a Government of reaction, rather than a Government of initiative. They appear to react to every crisis rather than to take any action that would allow us to be the masters of our own destiny in any way.  We are all aware that oil is a big factor in our economy and that an increase in oil has had a detrimental effect on our economy.  Much of our progress over the last number of years is dependent on the price of oil, but what have we done to counteract what has happened with regard to oil recently? The Minister in his brief mentioned that international co-operation was necessary.  I am in harmony with him there, I am positive that there must be co-operation between the oil producing and consuming countries.</P>
      <P>When we look at the matter with a detached view we see that the Arabs have produced oil at a certain price, have sold that oil to us but we, in different stages, have added a tax to it that is greater than the price that they got.  We are prepared to make a profit taxwise here for that oil.  Those oil producing countries are only right to have a rethink about the resources they are selling to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This co-operation is badly needed and it is important that we do not polarise the two sections.  I agree with Deputy Wilson who said that because we are aligned with the USA, whose attitude&mdash;it may have mellowed a little lately but it was not so mellow in the beginning when they waved the stick&mdash;did not help us and that it will rub off on us too.  The Minister mentioned that it will cost us £7,000, which will be voted to Foreign Affairs, to be members.  But Deputy Barrett pointed out that the cost of our entry does not stop at £7,000; to my mind it is like a cover charge that will merely admit us to the club.  The <Col N="1704" /> other incidental expenses will come later.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued with the evasive way the Minister dealt with our voting strength.  I should like to quote from the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>The voting weights assigned to each country for the purpose of those decisions which the agreement specifies are to be taken by majority and are designed to ensure an overall balance between the interests of the various groups of member countries.</P>
    <P>That is a very euphemistic way of saying that we are going to be the pinkeens as far as this agreement is concerned.  We have three votes to the 57 votes the USA have.  They have 17 times more votes than we have.  We are classed with Luxembourg on the three-vote mark.  I note also that the agreement is for ten years.  Were we wise, if the statistics of our future as an oil and gas producing country are correct and if the forecasts are any indication of the future of our economy, to enter into an agreement of ten years?  I know it will be reviewed after five years&mdash; there should be an annual review&mdash; and that countries cannot opt out until a period of three years has elapsed and then they must give 12 months notice.  So we are tied to it for four years.</P>
    <P>We were not wise to accept those conditions viewing our future as it is. The Minister's concern and terms of reference are to do what is best for the people of Ireland.  If he pursued that as well as other countries pursue what is good for them I would be happy, but I am afraid that policy has not been pursued.  Maybe I am being parochial or national, but that is what the Minister is elected for.  The avowed aims of the Ministers are to develop our energy supply and to restrain energy demand, the only words from the Government up to now.  There is no evidence to indicate that they have developed the energy supply or restrained our energy demand. The Minister mentions that in recognising the objective of reducing imports of oil, a policy should be developed <Col N="1705" /> to promote the accelerated development of alternative sources to oil.  One of the obvious and natural alternative resources we have is turf. Some turf was considered uneconomical to produce when the price of oil was low but the increased price of oil must have changed our thinking on this.  I can see no evidence in the Government's outlay on capital to help us to produce more turf, to develop our bogs or to enable roads to be built into bogs.  The Minister should back up his words by showing what action he took.  He should show us that he is sincere.</P>
    <P>Great stress is laid on the fact that oil sharing in time of crisis is something we will benefit from.  The biggest crisis I remember&mdash;I was a schoolboy at the time&mdash;was the last war.  We should draw on our previous experience in time of crisis and find out who shared with us at that time.  The people with whom we were friendly although we did, thanks to Eamon de Valera, maintain a proper neutrality, did not share with us and we were left to ourselves and to our own devices.  We found that when economic considerations and other considerations entered into that we had no friends.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we are to provide 90 days supply.  Deputy Barrett pointed out the storage difficulties attached to this and I hope the Minister does not gloss over the fact that somebody will have to pay for this supply and the facilities for storing it.  It sounds foolish that the customer would pay for storage facilities the seller wants to have.  The shopkeeper is the man to provide the storage until such time as the customer wants the product and for shopkeeper we could substitute the big oil companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell the House what has happened to the conservation programme.  We were exhorted on every side to burn energy wisely but has this had any effect?  There is plenty of evidence of talk but no action of a helpful nature.  I hope that, even though my contribution may be insignificant as far as the Minister is concerned, it proves helpful.  In fact, most contributions only warranted the <Col N="1706" /> presence of the Minister.  Members in the opposite benches appear to have reacted to this with a closed mind. Their mind is made up no matter what helpful suggestions are made by this side of the House.  They will not be listened to.</P>

    <Title>Capital Gains Tax Bill, 1974: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Schedule 5, as amended, be Schedule 5 of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking before the adjournment of this debate I drew attention to the problems that are created by paragraphs 3 and 4 of Schedule 5.  Many of the same sort of difficulties are created by subsequent paragraphs such as paragraph 5 where nominee shareholders will be compelled to disclose the beneficial ownership of the shares which they hold in trust and so on, and paragraph 6 relating to returns by a party to a settlement and so on.  I do not propose to go into these later paragraphs at this stage because paragraphs 3 and 4 in themselves are paragraphs of the greatest significance and of considerable novelty in our tax law.</P>
      <P>One of the things that perhaps I did not advert to sufficiently when I was speaking before the interval was the fact that under subparagraph (3) of paragraph 3, in contradiction of what the Minister stated in the very short remarks he made in relation to these paragraphs, the notice concerned, which the Revenue Commissioners will be entitled to serve, relates not just to chargeable gains but to assets and, very significantly, to income, and the words are there in subparagraph (3):</P>
      <P>(or if the notice relates to income or chargeable gains of some other person of any assets acquired by that other person)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It clearly gives the lie to the suggestion by the Minister that notices that would be served by the Revenue Commissioners under this Act, or <Col N="1707" /> under this Schedule in particular, would be served for the purpose of obtaining information with a view to charging capital gains and with a view to that alone.  As I said earlier, anyone who has any experience of dealing with the Revenue Commissioners in more than one of their spheres knows perfectly well that is not the way they operate, and the proof of it here is the use of the word &ldquo;income&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;if the notice relates to income&rdquo;&mdash;in subparagraph (3) of paragraph 3.</P>
    <P>The manner in which paragraph 4 is drafted is extraordinarily wide, particularly so far as stockbrokers are concerned, because it provides</P>
    <P>(4) A member of a stock exchange in the State may be required to make a return giving particulars of any transactions effected by him in the course of his business in the period specified in the notice requiring the return and giving particulars of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the parties to the transactions.</P>
    <P>(b)  the number or amount of the shares or securities dealt with in the respective transactions, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the amount or value of the consideration.</P>
    <P>What appears to be envisaged there is not a notice relating to any one individual or any one company.  It seems to relate to every transaction that was carried out by the stockbroker during whatever period would be specified in the notice.  The only limitation on the period of the notice seems to be contained in subparagraph (7) which confines it to transactions from the 6th April, 1974, onwards or to transactions within three years of the service of notice.</P>
    <P>I suppose we are expected to be very grateful for that, but we have here an obnoxious type of retrospective legislation back to this date when shares, in particular, were perhaps at their lowest ebb, so low that gains are almost inevitable on a large number of them from that date.  That is <Col N="1708" /> the only limitation.  It is not even the date of the passing of the Act.  Therefore, the width of the provisions of subparagraph (4) are almost frightening, so much so that I am surprised that stockbrokers have not expressed their concern about it to a much greater extent than seems to have been the case.</P>
    <P>The provision about giving information is not confined simply to stockbrokers. It extends, by virtue of subparagraph (5) to any person registering transfers in shares or acting as an agent of the State in transactions in shares and securities.  That would include solicitors and accountants who sometimes do this work; it would include secretaries of companies and, above all, it would include banks, who do this work through their legal and other departments on a fairly wide scale.</P>
    <P>The only solution I can see, at first sight, to the enormous problems that are created by this paragraph would be simply the employment of stockbrokers elsewhere to carry out the transactions, and it is not even certain in the case of Irish companies that will be sufficient, because it may be possible under the terms of the paragraph, which is so widely drawn, to compel the secretaries or registrars of companies to give details of transfers of shares.</P>
    <P>I do not think the general public are at all aware of provisions such as this, and there are equally bad ones to come later in this Schedule. If they were aware of these provisions I think there would be a major outcry. As it is there is an outcry but on a muted scale because the sort of people who realise what is involved are not the people who are given to street demonstrations or the like. They are endeavouring privately and quietly and in a dignified fashion to express their deep concern, but up to this I am afraid they are not having a great deal of success.</P>
    <P>It is particularly regrettable that when important matters such as this are being discussed, when major innovations of a frightening character are being pushed through the House by the Minister, when the Opposition in response <Col N="1709" /> to their duty to point out the seriousness of these innovations, outline them in some detail, there is regularly nobody on the Government side of the House other than the Minister to listen to what is involved, even though the Whip which appears to apply to this Government is an abnormally strong one which seems to stifle most if not all dissent, nonetheless there must be some people of sufficient intelligence and decency on the other side of the House who feel that this is going far enough, that amendments should be made to this, and that we should not continue to have a situation in which any person in this country, whether he be solicitor, bank manager, stockbroker, auctioneer and so on, or simply a neighbour or friend or relation or acquaintance should be compellable, at the whim of the Revenue Commissioners, to give information about either his client or his customer or his relative or his friend and his financial transactions.</P>
    <P>I know my colleagues will have a good deal to say about this matter. Like myself, they will be hoping the Minister will see reason on these provisions and that we can expect some major amendment of them on the next Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not follow Deputy O'Malley's provocative remarks suggesting that the purpose of this section is to break the seal of the confessional. I had hoped that we had left emotive vulgarity of that kind behind us some weeks ago.  We have had a very constructive and objective debate for some time past and I think that is the level on which the people would expect us to discuss a serious and complicated Bill of this kind.  It is relevant to our consideration of the matter that other countries have similar provisions in relation to their capital gains tax to those we are providing in this Schedule.  I refer in particular to the British Finance Act 1965, Schedule 10 of which provides that a notice could be served requiring &ldquo;particulars of any assets acquired by the person on whom the notice is served or, if the notice relates to income or chargeable gains of some other person, of any assets acquired by that person&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1710" /> There is no point in asking Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann to pass a law to tax capital gains unless machinery is provided which will ensure adequate disclosure.  There is no point in pretending to tax capital gains and leaving massive loopholes so that people may engage in avoidance and evasion, because that is what Deputy O'Malley suggested would be the consequence of this legislation&mdash;that we would be encouraging evasion.  There are many people now aware that evasion will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the difference between avoidance and evasion, and recently I was studying the French attitude towards these activities.  It is interesting to note that in France what is called evasion here is called fraud, and what is called avoidance here is called evasion.  If the law requires&mdash;as it does&mdash;that the Revenue Commissioners be given full details of people's incomes and the obligation to furnish that information lies on employers who are obliged to give full details as they know them of their employees' incomes, I cannot see how people wax indignant about the provision in the law which requires information to be given about capital gains.  What is the philosophy which puts that on a higher level, which suggests that capital gains must be immune from inquiry, which says it is wrong to give the Revenue Commissioners the means by which they can ascertain capital gains while it is right to have provision in the law to disclose the incomes of even the poorest people to the Revenue Commissioners? I cannot see how one can say it is right to oblige people to give information about the incomes of others but it is wrong to require people to give information about the capital gains of others.  I should like to hear somebody justify giving special exemption to those who have had the good fortune to make capital gains while denying that exemption to people whose only source of livelihood is their income.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I am prepared to look at this subparagraph to see if we could use a form of words which would not leave it open to mischievous <Col N="1711" /> interpretation by Deputy O'Malley.  To suggest in a sovereign Parliament that the objective of legislation was to break the seal of the confessional is to make a suggestion which is beneath contempt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not entertain it and nobody of any decency would suggest that such a matter was ever in contemplation or prospect.  The purpose of the section here and as it exists in other countries is to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners are properly seized of the necessary information to make the capital gains tax work fairly.  That is its only objective. The purpose is to ensure that when capital gains are made they come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners. Is anybody suggesting we should have capital gains tax but should not give the Revenue Commissioners the means to enforce that tax?  That would be making a mockery of the Legislature.  I gather from some of the remarks that have been made here this evening that that is the thinking behind the suggestion of Deputy O'Malley&mdash;that we should pretend to have a capital gains tax but should not provide the Revenue Commissioners with the means of enforcing the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley has given voice to the long-standing position of detestation of tax collectors.  It existed in biblical days and is still with us but, on the other hand, we have very properly recorded in this House by Deputy de Valera, Deputy Colley and others a respect for the Revenue Commissioners. They have very properly asserted, and I support their assertion, <Col N="1712" /> that the Revenue Commissioners act reasonably and apply the law fairly. This has always been the position in Ireland and I am sure always will.  It is unfair that we should have heard from Deputy O'Malley a quite unjustifiable attack on the integrity and impartiality of the Revenue Commissioners. Some of the charges which he made against them both as to their motivation and methods of operation should not have been made and I hope on reflection the Deputy will see his way to withdraw them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>While giving the Minister and everybody else credit for good intentions an objective examination of the principle of this paragraph will go a long way towards substantiating what is implied in what Deputy O'Malley said&mdash;that the powers of investigation already existing under the Income Tax Acts are being enlarged.  At this stage I think it is in the interests of the Minister and the House and the Revenue Commissioners that this matter should be analysed in detail.  Before I embark on that I should like to make this comment: there are two things in this paragraph.  First, there is the very natural desire to extend the existing mechanism to capital gains.  That, perhaps, would be accepted by all as a justifiable aim although, if time permits, I shall suggest doing this in another way.  However, there is something more.  Whether designed or otherwise, there is a positive extension of power to capital gains not only in this Act but also in relation to the income tax code.  Speaking objectively while giving credit for right intentions everywhere and realising the problems of tax evasion, it is objectionable to effect such an extension in the Schedule to an Act like this.</P>
      <P>I should substantiate this assertion in detail.  I would like to put on the record <i>in toto</i> subparagraph (3) of paragraph 3.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A notice under any of the said provisions of the Income Tax Acts, as applied by this paragraph, may require particulars of any assets acquired by the person on whom <Col N="1713" /> the notice was served (or if the notice relates to income or chargeable gains of some other person, of any assets acquired by that other person) in the period specified in the notice, being a period beginning not earlier than the 6th day of April, 1974, but excluding&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any assets exempted by section 19 (exemption of specified securities) or section 24 (miscellaneous exemptions), or</P>
    <P>(b)  any assets acquired as trading stock.</P>
    <P>The first point to notice in regard to this paragraph is that it refers to &ldquo;a notice under any of the said provisions of the Income Tax Acts&rdquo;.  The said provisions are not what might appear first&mdash;the provision of sections 500 to 503 referred to in subparagraph (2) of the paragraph in question.  The provisions are those referred to in subparagraph (1) which reads:</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Income Tax Acts relating to the making or delivery of any return, statement, declaration, list or other document, the furnishing of any particulars, the production of any document, the making of anything available for inspection, the delivery of any account or the making of any representation, shall, subject to any necessary modification, apply in relation to capital gains tax as they apply in relation to income tax.</P>
    <P>In other words, all the provisions of the Income Tax Act relating to these matters are what are referred to in the word &ldquo;revision&rdquo; of the Income Tax Act in subsection (3).</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not confined to the three sections mentioned in the previous subparagraph (2).  The objectionable part of this subsection is contained in parenthesis and reads:</P>
    <P>(or if the notice relates to income or chargeable gains of some other person, of any assets acquired by that other person).</P>
    <P>Surely that extends the powers of both Income Tax Acts and this Bill in two respects.  It extends where assets are concerned, where property is concerned and where the person is concerned. <Col N="1714" /> The specific relation to income imports that extension into the whole income tax code, being the Income Tax Acts and the subsequent Finance Acts.</P>
    <P>I am making this point purely in the legal sense.  It is not intended to be a political or any other sort of argument but is presented as I would submit it in court for interpretation and I want it on the record as such.</P>
    <P>The only exclusion to this extension of powers is in relation to paragraph 19 which deals with government securities in respect of which the information would be available anyway and, also, in relation to section 24 which is interesting because chargeable assets but not gains are referred to.  From a legal point of view one must read section 24 carefully to see the limitation of the exception here. The exception does nothing more than exclude information already available directly.  I have said that as well as extending to the person, the powers extended to assets.  In this context I refer the Minister to section 7 which reads:</P>
    <P>All forms of property shall be assets for the purposes of this Act whether situated in the State or not, including&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  options, debts and incorporeal property generally,</P>
    <P>(b)  any currency, other than Irish currency and sterling, and</P>
    <P>(c)  any form of property created by the person disposing of it, or otherwise becoming owned without being acquired.</P>
    <P>In other words, paragraph 3 extends the existing powers to acquiring from any person in regard to any property a notice which relates to income or capital gains.  That is the substance of the objection to that section.</P>
    <P>Let us look now at the Income Tax Act.  Section 176 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, was the section which became notorious as the one that compelled the agent of another person to disclose information, but the section is limited to &ldquo;Every person who, in whatever capacity&rdquo;&mdash;and that included lawyers, brokers and everyone <Col N="1715" /> else&mdash;&ldquo;is in receipt of any money or value or of profits or gains arising from any of the sources mentioned in this Act, of or belonging to any other person who is chargeable in respect thereof, or who would be so chargeable if he were resident in the State and not an incapacitated person, shall, whenever required to do so by any general or particular notice&rdquo;&mdash;given to him by an inspector&mdash;&ldquo;prepare and deliver, within the period mentioned in such notice, a list in the prescribed from, signed by him, containing&rdquo;&mdash; and then it specifies what should be contained in it and specifies for a declaration, and then there is a subsection which deals with a person acting jointly, but they are all persons who are specifically related to the transaction or the person chargeable. There is a specific relationship there, but this paragraph says &ldquo;some other person&rdquo; and &ldquo;by that other person&rdquo;, &ldquo;other person&rdquo; being totally unqualified. There is no qualification on what that person is to be.</P>
    <P>In face of that, I find it hard to disagree with Deputy O'Malley that there is not a very significant extension of power in this section under two heads.  &ldquo;Any person&rdquo; is made even more objectionable, as he pointed out, by subparagraph (4), but subparagraph (3) in itself extends not only to any person but to any property.  If I am wrong in that, will the Minister please give me the section?  I want to take this as if we were in court and I invite the Minister as a lawyer to reply to me in kind.  My submission to the House is that because of the fact that there is no qualification on the person who becomes liable to respond to a notice under this section, there is an extension of the powers conferred by the section because in the Income Tax Acts and the legislation to date the persons liable are in general in classified classes.</P>
    <P>The second point is that as far as I can read it under the Income Tax Acts the information sought is restricted to certain types of property and under this Bill the definition in section 7 of assets is so wide as to extend the scope of the section as to <Col N="1716" /> what information must be provided as well as to what persons are to supply that information.  That is my submission and I put it as objectively as I can.  I say that for that reason this section is objectionable, and particularly objectionable in the way it appears in the Bill.  Having regard to the nature of the rest of the legislation, it should not be buried away in a Schedule with the appearance of being just an extension of existing provisions of the income tax code to capital gains.  I am not in any way commenting on intention when I say this.  I am commenting on the legal effect, the legal consequences, the legal import of the wording of this section if it is passed into law.  I pass then to subparagraph (4)&mdash;&ldquo;The particulars required may include particulars of the person from whom the asset was acquired and the consideration for the acquisition&rdquo;.  I am not in a position to judge, but it certainly does not restrict the objectionable features of subparagraph (3) as I have outlined them.</P>
    <P>With regard to penalties subparagraph (6) applies Part 35 of the Income Tax Act which deals with penalties and assessments.  They would apply without the Minister having taken the trouble to include subparagraph (2) which seems to me to show an undue anxiety in regard to this matter.  The very fact that subparagraphs (1), (3), (4), (5) and (6) are in that paragraph under the heading &ldquo;Returns and Information&rdquo; is sufficient to capture everything so far as I can see in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph which appears to me to be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>A very interesting point arises on the Minister's exclusion of section 176, and here I have two points.  First, I have a question, and secondly, I have a very good illustration of what Deputy Colley and I meant when we pointed out not only the lack of necessity for including this tabulation but also the possible dangers, or should I say, the undesirability, of such explicit inclusion.  The opening paragraph of subparagraph (1) of paragraph 3, coupled in particular with the rest of the provisions, is quite enough to capture the whole of the <Col N="1717" /> income tax code in this regard and I may very legitimately ask now on the amendment, to which we agreed, what was the purpose of going to the trouble of excluding section 176 by an explicit amendment, leaving the rest in?  I wonder was it because it could have been interpreted on the income tax side as being in conflict with the extension affected by subparagraph 3.</P>
    <P>If I turn to section 176 of the Income Tax Act of 1967, I find a much narrower provision.  That section applies only to persons &ldquo;who are in receipt of any money or profits or gains arising from any of the sources mentioned in the Act of or belonging to any other person who is chargeable in respect thereof or would be so chargeable if resident in the State and not an incapacitated person&rdquo;and who shall whenever required to do so, and so on.</P>
    <P>The persons liable to notice and to make a response to a notice are limited to a very specific class in a relationship to the person charged.  The subject matter of the notice is also qualified and restricted.  That is in direct contrast to the expanding provisions of this paragraph.  I am not making and do not wish to make any imputations, but from a legal interpretative point of view it was a significance that that section should be omitted by specific amendment from the Bill while this provision is in.  I would be permitted to use that as a yardstick for judging the legal intention of the section.  I hope that in what I have said I have convinced the Minister that this section needs reconsideration from that point of view.</P>
    <P>Here is a real extension of the powers of enquiry by notice both in regard to the person subject to the enquiry and the property the subject of the enquiry. I accept what the Minister says, that as far as capital gains is concerned, you want to extend the income tax provisions here.  You do more than that.  You extend powers under both headings that were not there; you import new powers.  This section is objectionable because of the place it is placed in and the forms in which it appears.  We could have missed it if <Col N="1718" /> it had not been for the alertness of Deputy Colley.</P>
    <P>The Minister is wise to reconsider what he is doing in this.  If it is his intention to widen the powers under both codes, let him say so and then we can debate it as such.  I do not think we should allow this to pass unnoticed.</P>
    <P>This section raises another type of question.  I will make two comments. The deletion of section 176 from the table that follows was an ineffective gesture in so far as it was a gesture but it might have done a great deal more; it might have imported something into the Bill much wider than section 176.  Secondly, the penalties under Part 35&mdash;I am referring now to subparagraph (6) of paragraph 3&mdash; are all imported.  Whether paragraph 2 subparagraph (2) is there or not, they are all imported to capture any person who is captured by the parentheses in subparagraph (3) of paragraph 3.  This kind of thing raises a very wide issue which I will just touch on now.</P>
    <P>We must not forget that we have a Constitution and that under our Constitution&mdash;there are citizens who are beginning to say fortunately&mdash;we have an independent Judiciary and under Article 34 justice shall be administered by the courts established by law and by judges and the High Court and particularly the Supreme Court are empowered under the Constitution to enforce the administration of justice by adjudging laws and the provisions of laws in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. There are provisions in the Constitution such as Articles 40 and 43.  I shall not expand further on it.  There are provisions that would amply justify our courts embarking on the course that the American Federal Court was forced to embark on.  If this House does not protect the individual citizen, eventually a situation will arise where the courts will take it upon themselves to declare just how far the Executive can trespass.  We here, although the system is very similar to the British system, have a balanced system of executive, legislature and judiciary in a constitutional set-up <Col N="1719" /> that can in many ways be analogous to the set-up in the United States of America, and if this House fails in its duty&mdash;I have complained about this very often and this is not the occasion to expand on it&mdash;if the executive is going to roughshod through provisions for administrative convenience, even if it is done with a cry of tax evasion and all that, the courts will find themselves invited to intervene. This is where we are heading. This is not the time to expand on that theme, but the warning is here in this provision.</P>
    <P>I am not attributing <i>mala fides,</i> nor am I attributing any ulterior intention. I am dealing with what this section will do.  In these circumstances, therefore, I would strongly ask the Minister to reconsider this provision. If he wishes to extend powers, by all means let him extend them but it should be by way of a substantive section in the Bill.  Then we can debate it as such.  As this paragraph stands it is an invitation to a development that probably would not be altogether a happy solution.</P>
    <P>The fault is in the failure of this House.  Let no one make a scapegoat out of anyone in the administration. It is the executive who carry the responsibility for marching the majority of the sheep around the corner.  Let us be frank about this.  We are not blaming anyone else.  It is the Minister and the Members of this House who share the responsibility.  I disagree with placing the responsibility, as had been done on other occasions, on advisers or anyone else.  It is our responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rightly complained of the denigration of the administration, particularly that part that carries out the vital job of collecting the revenue that makes the State function, and that has to carry the unenviable burden of legislation like this.  The least we can do to support them is to have legislation that is frank and forthcoming.  If there is anything that lends itself to being a stick that beats the Revenue Commissioners it is a provision like this.  It should not be there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> I have said it is objectionable.  One of the greatest reasons it is objectionable is that the provisions of a section like this are buried away in a certain obscurity in a Schedule and an important extension is contained in a parenthesis.  The psychological effect on anyone who studies it, whether a professional person or someone who reads the Official Report, will be unfortunate to say the least.  I would strongly urge the Minister to take this paragraph out and if he wishes to extend the powers let him do so.  If he does not, and if it has been done inadvertently or in an effort <i>ex maiore cautelae</i>, let us correct it.</P>
    <P>In the presentation of this Bill and the extension to the Income Tax Acts a general mistake has been made.  The Bill is a bulky one but the Income Tax Acts, particularly the Act of 1967, are even more bulky.  It would probably have been better to confine oneself to a general provision as in paragraph 3 (1) and afterwards, instead of legislating by reference to the Income Tax Acts, to take the corresponding sections, to modify them, section by section as might be required for capital gains and include them in this Bill. That would give two benefits.  First, it would mean the Bill was self-contained and that the nexus was a general one, ensuring there was one code, that there was mutual support and no contradiction.  Secondly, it would remove ambiguity and would make the Bill easier to deal with for those who will have to administer it and those who will have to comply with it.  It was a false economy to attempt to do what the Minister has done in this Schedule by making specific references.</P>
    <P>Much of what is in the Table is unnecessary. The Minister may include paragraph 3 (1) if necessary and where specific extension of powers to capital gains and capital taxation are required he could take the corresponding sections of the Income Tax Acts, rewrite them with the necessary modifications as separate sections and include them in the Schedule.  It may make the Bill more bulky but it will be a definite improvement.</P>
    <P>I have said that the extension of <Col N="1721" /> powers is objectionable in the present context but I accept that an extension of powers is needed.  If there is this type of extension of powers which is imported by means of a phrase in parentheses, preferably it should be a substantive enactment in this Bill and I suggest it might be imported into the Income Tax Acts through the Finance Bill.  The Income Tax Acts can wait until next year and it could be put into next year's Finance Bill if necessary.  If that were done there would be greater understanding of these matters by the House, the public and the courts.  The Minister will not give occasion to people to cast imputations on the Minister's advisers or on the Revenue Commissioners.  It is not too late for the Minister to consider such a programme in regard to this Schedule.</P>
    <P>It is only when one starts to analyse the Schedules that one understands the import of section 51 of the Bill. Subsection (1) of section 51 states:</P>
    <P>Schedule 1 (computation), Schedule 2 (companies and shareholders), Schedule 3 (leases), Schedule 4 (specified securities) and Schedule 5 (administration) shall have effect for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question on this.  That, of course, can only mean an assurance that the provisions in the Schedules were positive enactments on all-fours with every other provision in the Bill.  I do not think I am unreasonable in asking the Minister, if he is going to extend powers of this nature, powers that have traditionally been contained in explicit sections in the Income Tax Acts, why would he not do the same in this Bill and import them into the law by means of a specific section in the Bill?  It would be neater, franker and in every way a more desirable procedure.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister would like to comment on what I have said.  I want him to take my comments in a completely legalistic spirit.  I should like him to accept them, so to speak, as pleading in <Col N="1722" /> court and not as making either a political case or a popular case. Indeed, I am rather disturbed about the popular impressions arising from this in that they may not be what one would like them to be.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned penalties.  We come now to the further tax provisions applied to capital gains tax.  Having regard to the Income Tax Act, 1967, and to the deletion of paragraph 176 and having regard to the fact that that deletion does nothing except in so far as it does not potentially introduce a contradiction of the extension imported by the phrase in parentheses in subparagraph (3), if that is unnecessary, and the Minister himself has deleted it, why not drop the whole Table as we have suggested it should be dropped?  It is confusing. It is incomplete and, being incomplete, it is misleading.  The whole of the provisions of the Income Tax Act relating to returns are imported in by the first subparagraph of paragraph 3. Why pick out certain ones here&mdash;I nearly said &ldquo;ones that suit&rdquo;&mdash;especially when paragraph 176 has been dropped?  That is something the Minister should consider.</P>
    <P>We have the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, in this Table also: &ldquo;This Act may be cited and shall be construed together with the Income Tax Act&rdquo;.  The Finance Act, 1971 and the rest of the Finance Acts also provide for citation and construction with the Income Tax Acts. There does not seem to be any reason therefore for explicitly mentioning them either.  I am referring to section 29 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, referred to in paragraph 5 of this Table and that is the citation section.  It is also cited in the Finance Act, 1973, and it is part of the same code.  It is to be construed with section 98 as similar to section 98 of the 1973 Act.  On that argument it appears to me that it is not only incomplete but misleading to include this Table at all.  It seems to be totally unnecessary.</P>
    <P>In summary, then, the case I have tried to make is that the first subparagraph of paragraph 3, under the <Col N="1723" /> heading &ldquo;Returns and Information&rdquo; which we are discussing imports the provisions of the Income Tax Acts relating to returns and information. Consequently subparagraph (2) is unnecessary particularly in regard to subparagraph (3).  Then, because of that general importation of the provisions of the Income Tax Acts into subparagraph (3) and because of the phrase in parenthesis extending the scope to notice and responsibility both in regard to the persons captured and the property captured, this is a positive extension of powers under both these codes and it should not appear in this way.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to do this he should do it in another way and give his reasons for doing it; that in subparagraph (a) relates purely to property of the nature of Government securities where the information is already available; that paragraph (4) is also an extension of power and it is a further expansion and extension of the power contained in the parenthesis in subparagraph (3); finally, that the penalties under Part 35 of the Income Tax Act are extended to capture the extended class of persons provided for in subparagraph (3) and that, for all these reasons, the Minister should make up his mind as to whether he wants this extension of power.  If he does, it should not be where it is; it should be a substantive section in the Bill.  If he does not, then a drafting amendment is necessary.  Furthermore, I made a suggestion that a proper way to import the Income Tax Acts here by re-enactment would increase the volume of the Bill but it would make both codes tidier and interlink them more effectively. The partial tables should be omitted.  That will pretty well summarise the submissions I have made.  I hope the Minister will take it that I have attempted to do so in a coldly legal manner, including the constitutional point, and not in any emotive way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with this as I see it as an ordinary layman. I have not legal experience.  Everybody knows that the Bill before the House is complicated.  The ordinary man in <Col N="1724" /> the street is not aware of the complicated nature of this Bill and neither are the people who will be affected by it. When the Minister talks about people he may mean a next door neighbour. Will that person now be a spy?  Everybody knows if a legal transaction on the sale of a house, land or property of any nature takes place the auctioneer or the solicitor involved is called on under the Income Tax Act to make a return.</P>
      <P>What more does the Minister want? Why has the Minister to take it on himself to go to anybody he thinks fit to go to?  Most people would regard that the same as the HP people who want to know if you are solvent and what means you have.  It is well known the HP people have written to people asking how certain people stood financially. If that person was on unfriendly terms with you he could write a very bad report.  I have seen occasions where men with good means were refused HP terms.</P>
      <P>The person to whom the Revenue Commissioners can write to under this Bill can give any type of information he wants to give.  If the person does not reply I believe a fine is imposed on him.  If he fails to pay that fine he is prosecuted and brought into the courts.  The Minister referred on Part III of the Third Schedule to any assets exempted by section 19.  The exemption is securities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was.  We know that does not apply because the Revenue Commissioners, as well as everybody else, know, if you have securities, where they are and it will not be too long until they find out where they are.  I believe the people all over the country are not aware of the complications of the Bill.  They are not aware of the fine print that goes into a Bill of this nature.  When the Revenue Commissioners close in on them they will realise it, and also if this <Col N="1725" /> goes through in the form it is now before the House their neighbours may be spies or informers.</P>
      <P>We have all the machinery at our disposal under the Income Tax Act and that should be enough to cover all the necessary sections of the Bill. I cannot understand why the Minister goes out of his way to refer to persons or some other person when he does not define who that is.  I believe, as well as a lot of my constituents, that that can be anybody or whoever the Revenue Commissioners think fit to write to.  As I already said if they do not reply they have to face prosecution. I ask the Minister to amend this part of the Bill to the straightforward reading of a Bill and to specify who the persons are.  We know that the Incorporated Law Society have come to an agreement with the Revenue Commissioners to the effect that they will disclose all transactions concerning finance.  Up to March they were reluctant to do so but their attitude has changed since.  They will now give the Minister all the information he wants.</P>
      <P>The ordinary person would take a poor view of the Minister if he knew that the Minister has given power to the Revenue Commissioners to get neighbour to spy on neighbour.  The Minister may say that there has been avoidance, but we are going out of the way now to take away the privacy of our people.  No person can be involved in any transaction now without the Revenue Commissioners knowing about it.  I should like to remind the Minister that the farming community are very perturbed about this.</P>

As the Government benches have filled up a little I should like to ask those Members if they realise the effect this will have on the farming community.  Of course, many of the Government Members are not allowed to show their hand. <Col N="1726" /> As I am not a legal expert I cannot comment on the consitutionality or otherwise of this portion of the Bill but I have no doubt that the courts will come to the conclusion that it is unconstitutional.  In my view this goes outside the authority of the Minister for Finance and the Government.  The powers sought here are very far reaching.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing to be said about this type of argument, that it is the very best justification for the quick passage of this legislation, because until such time as it is law and in practice there will obviously be no limit to the number of outrageous suggestions being made <Col N="1727" /> about the way in which the legislation will operate.  None of these horrendous consequences flowed from similar provisions in the British Finance Act, 1965, or from similar provisions in other capital gains legislation across the world.  As I said earlier, if we have a capital gains tax we shall see to it that the Revenue Commissioners are given the weapons to make it work.  We shall not, as a Government, invite endorsement of legislation which is only a mockery.  We must ensure that, if capital gains are made, capital gains are taxed.  It would be completely inequitable to tax only easily detected gains and to allow these hidden gains to go tax free.  That would be both an inefficient and an inequitable tax, and we shall not be a party to it.</P>
      <P>Before Deputy Connolly came in I said I was disposed to look at paragraph 3 to confine the type of person from whom information could be sought to the type of person from whom it is intended to seek it, that is, persons who have been engaged with or on behalf of others in transactions which could give rise to capital gains. These stupid suggestions&mdash;that is the most polite word I can use&mdash;that some self-styled tax consultants have been spreading around the country so as to try to fool people into engaging them as tax consultants later on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is one principle of law that the court respects, even if the so-called experts do not respect it, that is, that the executive act reasonably and must be presumed to be acting reasonably.  If the executive or the Revenue Commissioners were to act unreasonably, as Deputy de Valera says, the court would not be slow in condemning them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand the Minister's reference to the particular tax consultants.  That is neither here nor there.  The simple fact is that the Revenue Commissioners are a reputable, responsible arm of the State service who carry out their duties responsibly and justly, but like all agencies of that nature they must have the power to do it.  It is all very well to talk about how they get their information, but it is necessary for them to get information in certain places in the best way they can, and I do not think it is appropriate for us to inquire in detail as to the methods they use, any more than we would the police.  The police have a similar job to do in another way and beyond the general control, which I am quite satisfied was there in regard to the Revenue <Col N="1731" /> Commissioners we should not seek, unless there is positive evidence of abuse, to go behind it.  It is bad for our own morale; it is bad for the morale of the country, and makes it very difficult for the Revenue Commissioners to function if we are to proceed on those lines.  When all is said and done, it is the Revenue Commissioners who will have the difficult and unenviable task of implementing this legislation and, I hope the Minister will agree that the necessary powers must be given but that the powers that need to be given should be given explicitly.  I do not need to repeat what I said before in regard to being prepared even to err on the side of giving discretion.</P>
      <P>I suggest we return to the provisions of the Schedule.  It is an undesirable thing to have the situation here which has arisen but, unfortunately, it has arisen just because of the method by which the powers legally contained in this subparagraph happen to be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>This paragraph has been covered more than adequately but a reasonable reading of subparagraph (3): &ldquo;(or if the notice relates to income or chargeable gains of some other person, of any assets acquired by that other person)&rdquo;is open to the interpretation which has been put on it on this side of the House, that it can relate to any other person.  My understanding is that the ordinary requirement under subsection (1) of section 500 of the 1967 Act is that any person required to provide information in relation to the income or assets must provide that information and that information can provide the commissioners with other information as to where the income was acquired and to whom assets were disposed of.  I believe this reference is too broad, the &ldquo;chargeable gains of some other person of any assets acquired by that other person&rdquo;.  This is causing concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we presume is meant here is that any person who has had dealings with a person who has made chargeable gains should be required to disclose those dealings.  Subparagraph (4) <Col N="1732" /> of the same paragraph 3 requires that particulars may include particulars of the person from whom the asset was acquired.  Any ordinary reading of that conveys that it is requiring a person to provide particulars about another person other than in relation to the assets, with whom the person had dealings. That is a reasonable interpretation of that sentence.  What is required from the Minister in relation to both the words &ldquo;some other person&rdquo; and &ldquo;particulars of the person&rdquo; is that he should spell out here what is intended by this and, if necessary, make some amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has any right to protest at the interpretation put on what is before us.  As indicated very clearly by Deputy Brugha, the sentence to which the Deputy referred bears no other reasonable interpretation than that which has been put on it.  When we find this vastly extended power proposed here is being imported in relation not only to capital gains but also to income tax we are entitled&mdash;indeed, obliged&mdash;to point out the consequences and possible consequences of what is before us.  If the Minister wishes to protest at this and wishes to convey that there was no such intention, he should not bring before the House a provision which gives such a power and if he does so, what can he expect from an alert Opposition but that the consequences will be pointed out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the Minister has tried to justify the kind of powers proposed in this paragraph of the Schedule on the grounds that not to give these powers would produce an inequitable tax situation.  I want to remind him that there are limits beyond which one is not entitled to go even to make a tax equitable.  If the Minister does not accept that proposition, I suggest that he turn his mind to the protections in the law for those accused of crime&mdash; for criminals in some cases and in some cases for innocent people accused of crime&mdash;and if the logic which the Minister is trying to apply here is to be extended, then all the protections in the law for a person accused of a crime will be abolished because the <Col N="1733" /> objective being to make those who are guilty of crimes suffer for them will justify the means.  The end does not justify the means and it is time that was said in this House.  That relates not only to taxation but to criminal law and to many other areas.  I think it is time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Coughlan's interventions may not be quite <i>ad rem</i> but they are welcome in the sense that we have had virtually no contribution from that side of the House other than from the Minister.  Even Deputy Coughlan's interventions are welcome for that reason.  I was saying it is time that this was spelled out clearly and particularly spelled out to the Minister for Finance who, I think, is losing sight of it&mdash;that there is a limit beyond which we cannot go.  We cannot trample on the rights of citizens in order to ensure that there is no avoidance or evasion of taxation.  We can go a great distance but there is a point beyond which we cannot go and that point is passed in this provision of this Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think what the Minister has said already indicates that he accepts that, but I want to make it clear that the fact that Deputies on this side are drawing attention to what is being <Col N="1734" /> done here is merely indicative of the fact that they are doing their duty.  It is quite unjustifiable to suggest, as has been suggested in some quarters, that it is an effort to aid and abet people in avoiding their tax liabilities.  I suggest that the implications of the inclusion here of the word &ldquo;income&rdquo; have not fully sunk in.</P>
    <P>The Minister said at an earlier stage in relation to income tax that the Revenue Commissioners have the power to demand information from anybody and he pointed out that they were not inundated with information nor were they inundating the population with notices seeking information. The fact is that the Revenue Commissioners have no such power and we have pointed that out to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>They always had that power.</P>

      <P>Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The power they have relates to persons who either themselves are liable for tax or are connected with persons liable for tax as agents or in receipt of money on their behalf.  We have asked the Minister to point out the relevant section in the Income Tax Acts which gives power beyond that and the Minister has failed to do so.  He has failed to do so for the very good reason that no such section exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications of including the word &ldquo;income&rdquo; here are that if this subparagraph is maintained with the word &ldquo;income&rdquo; in it, the Revenue Commissioners will be given power to serve a notice on any person and to demand from any person information in relation to income&mdash;as distinct from liability for capital gains&mdash;of any other person.  There is no use in the Minister protesting and saying that we are misrepresenting his intentions. If this is not what is meant by the subparagraph it should not be worded in this way.  The word &ldquo;income&rdquo;is dragged in here where the rest of the paragraph is dealing with gains and losses in relation to capital gains.  When one considers the manner in which this vastly extended <Col N="1735" /> power is proposed to be given not only in relation to income tax but also in relation to capital gains tax, that it is included in the last Schedule and worded in such a way that even the beginning of the subparagraph suggests it is only extending existing powers under the Income Tax Acts to Capital gains tax, one is entitled to wonder why it is being done in this way.  When one looks at the amendment which was moved by the Minister to delete the reference in the Table to section 176 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and in the light of what Deputy de Valera said in that regard, one is entitled to be suspicious about what exactly was going on here.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am not accusing the Minister of deliberately bringing in something which was hidden but which was in reality a vast extension of the powers of the Revenue Commissioners so as to enable them to serve a notice on anybody about any person's financial affairs.  As I have said, though, the Minister is responsible to this House for what happens.  I am distinctly unhappy not only because of the proposed extension of the powers but because of the manner in which this is being done.  Whoever was responsible for this ought to be made think again about this kind of approach.</P>
    <P>As has been said by others, if the Minister wants these powers he should say so clearly in a section of the Bill where everybody, apart from those on this side of the House whose duty it is to study it, can see what the Minister is doing and so that the principle involved can be debated.  The only reason why the principle involved is being debated here is because we adverted to what is happening under this rather well-concealed wording in subparagraph (3).</P>
    <P>I protest at that method of approach.  The Minister has indicated that he is prepared to look at the subparagraph again with a view to applying the power of the Revenue Commissioners to serve a notice of the kind dealt with here only on persons who are themselves liable or who are <Col N="1736" /> connected with such persons in the capacity of agents, for example.  That would be a considerable improvement in that regard but I would like to know whether, first, the Minister would intend to extend in any way the existing powers of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to income tax and, secondly, whether he would wish to extend the existing powers of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to income tax and to apply them to capital gains.</P>
    <P>One of the implications of what is provided here in regard to income tax is that some persons who are paying income tax under the PAYE system &mdash;and these are persons to whom the Minister referred as those who are having to make full disclosures and be asked why this should not apply to others&mdash;are also earning money outside that system by what are called commonly, nixers, or by other methods.  This is known to the Minister and to everybody else.  Some of those people are paying tax on that extra income while others are not.  In this House we must try to ensure that such persons pay income tax on those earnings but the question is how far we are prepared to go to make them pay.  Are we prepared to go so far as to give the Revenue Commissioners power to demand, under pain of substantial fine for failure to comply, the information of any other person who might have knowledge of such a person's activities outside the PAYE system so that the necessary income tax can be collected?  That kind of system, so extended without limitation, is too high a price to pay.  That is why I am asking the Minister to indicate whether the kind of review he has in mind would involve any extension of the existing powers of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to income tax.  To reiterate, the other question I am asking is whether he would propose in relation to capital gains tax to provide powers that would extend beyond the analogous and existing powers of the Revenue Commissioners in regard to income tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputies opposite are misreading the section. The purpose of obtaining information <Col N="1737" /> in relation to income or chargeable gains is in relation to capital gains tax liability and not to income tax liability.  These powers may be used only for the purposes of assessing liability to capital gains tax but a change in income or information about income may help to identify a capital asset which otherwise might go undetected if the income came from a capital source and not from the sale of labour, and that is the function of the word &ldquo;income&rdquo; in that context.  It is not an income tax context.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Colley and others fear that there is a sinister motive in putting this particular provision in the Schedule, I would like to assure them that they are wrong, certainly as far as the Minister for Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the parliamentary draftsmen of Ireland are concerned.  A look was had at the British capital gains legislation, and they deal with matters of this kind in Schedules and the same form is used because it was a convenient way to set out the rules which would be followed in relation to the administration of the tax.  It seemed to me very relevant indeed to have the provisions relating to returns of information in the Schedule which is dealing with the administration of the tax and have other provisions in relation to returns and information.  That is the only reason it is here, and there was certainly no intention to mislead anybody or to hide away this power which I have openly defended and which I consider it absolutely essential to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it can be more tidily defined so that it cannot be misused or used in an unreasonable way. Even though I am convinced, as I am sure are most Deputies, that it would not be used unreasonably, I accept the strictures delivered that we should not allow through any piece of legislation which could be used unreasonably, if it is possible to tighten it up.  I think the way I have in mind may be able to do that, but I do not want at this stage to be tied to any particular form of words.  I intend, if it is possible to do it, to ensure that the persons <Col N="1738" /> from whom the information can be sought are persons who can reasonably be assumed by reason of the transactions in which they have been involved to have the information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to resume the legal approach to this.  It is a question of intention in the legal sense and not intention in the sense of motive.  I do not think we are importing motive into it, though, as Deputy Colley says, the deletion of section 176 certainly gives colour to a construction. I want to resume the legal argument I made earlier, the basis of which was that under paragraph (3) &ldquo;any of the said provisions of the Income Tax Act referred to in subparagraph (3)&rdquo; means the provisions in subparagraph (1) of paragraph 3. That is the totality of the income tax provisions in that regard.  That point is vital.  It is not a restricted importation of the income tax code; it is an omnibus importation&mdash;all the relevant provisions of the income tax code&mdash; and I would suggest that it was the possible contradiction with the extension of power in the parentheses that brought about the deletion of section 176 from the table.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make is that the income tax code is imported in its generality, and it is not necessary for me to repeat the argument I made on that paragraph, but it is worth calling attention from a legal point of view to the point made by Deputy Brugha, that in subparagraph (4), the particulars of the person are in any reasonable reading unqualified and in fact from a legal point of view are unqualified. &ldquo;May include particulars of the person&rdquo;&mdash;those particulars might even include an inquiry as to whether the person ever had been in court on a charge of dangerous driving so that from a legal point of view Deputy Brugha's point has importance.  Lastly the importation of the penalties in Part 35 is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would invite the Minister to look at the end of the section which we have not touched on.  If this is not positive evidence of going beyond the capital gains code I am somewhat perplexed. Take paragraph 16 on page 78 which is <Col N="1739" /> headed &ldquo;Power to combine returns etc. with income tax documents.&rdquo;  It reads:</P>
    <P>Any return or assessment or other document relating to chargeable gains or capital gains tax may be combined with one relating to income or income tax.</P>
    <P>There you have a direct tie-up.  Read that paragraph from a legal point of view in conjunction with subparagraphs (3) and (4).  The effect of it is twofold.  On the word &ldquo;document&rdquo;, it certainly is any notice, but the second point connected with that is that the words &ldquo;relating to income or income tax&rdquo; clearly substantiate the construction earlier put by me and others on the phrase &ldquo;or if the notice relates to income or charitable gains of some other person of such assets acquired by that other person.&rdquo;  That is the phrase in parentheses in subparagraph (3) of paragraph 3.  If that does not positively substantiate on the two grounds a legal connection which effects an extension of the powers beyond the deleted section 176, I would like to hear a strong argument to the contrary.</P>
    <P>So much for paragraph 16, but I am not finished yet.  Look at paragraph 18 headed &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo;.  It reads:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Schedule, section 94 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, as applied by paragraph 3 (returns and information) shall apply to property or leases of property other than premises as it applies to premises or leases of premises.</P>
    <P>Here is another consolidated extension of the powers of the Income Tax Act because section 94 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 says:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of obtaining particulars of profits or gains chargeable to tax under Case 4 or Case 5 (b) of Schedule B by virtue of this chapter the inspector may by notice in writing require</P>
    <P>(a)  any lessor or former lessor of premises to give within the time specified by the notice such <Col N="1740" /> information as may be specified in the notice as to the provisions of the lease and the terms subject to which the lease was granted and as to payments made to or by him in relation to the premises;</P>
    <P>(b)  any lessee, occupier or former lessee including any person having or having had use of the premises to give such information as may be specified in the notice as to the terms applying to the lease, occupation or use of the premises and where any of those terms are established by any written instrument to produce it to the inspector for inspection;</P>
    <P>(c)  any lessee or former lessee of the premises to give such information as may be specified in the notice as to any consideration given in the grant to him of the lease;</P>
    <P>(d)  any person who as agent manages premises or is in receipt of rent or other payments arising from the premises to furnish the inspector with such particulars relating to the payments arising therefrom as may be specified in the notice.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that that section is limited to a particular class of person and to premises.  There is tucked away at the end of this Schedule with a quiet reference back to this subparagraph (b) a provision which says:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Schedule, section 94 of the Income Tax Act as applied by paragraph 3 shall apply to property or leases of property other than premises as it applies to premises or leases of premises.</P>
    <P>It goes far beyond the purposes of that Schedule because that Schedule is imported into the whole Act by section 51.</P>
    <P>We look at the definition of assets in section 7.  Assets include any type of property.  Subsection (18) does not say &ldquo;property and leases of property&rdquo;; it says &ldquo;property or leases of property&rdquo;.  In the context of the <Col N="1741" /> Bill the word property has a generality that goes far beyond what is contemplated by section 94 of the Income Tax Act.  Therefore subparagraph (3) not only extends the scope and powers of the deleted section 176 but also extends both as to classes of persons and as to property the provisions of section 94 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat puzzled as to why it was thought necessary to extend this section but I shall not confuse the argument at the moment.  I give the Minister notice that when we come to paragraph 18 of the Schedule he will be asked to explain why the extension of section 94 is sought.  That is a separate question which can be answered when we come to that paragraph.</P>
    <P>The point I am making here is in substantiation of the case first made by Deputy O'Malley and repeated by Deputy Colley and expanded by him and the point made by Deputy Brugha that in the context of the purely legal interpretation, the relevance of paragraphs 16 and 18 is that they completely support the case that there is a covert rather than frank importation of very extended powers, which the Minister admits and he says he will look at it, both in regard to persons and property by this subsection. I repeat the point I made that this is objectionable, from the legal as well as other points of view. I should like the Minister to bear these points in mind when he is revising it.</P>
    <P>I can understand what the Minister said, that it would not be practicable at this stage to accept my suggestion to redraft all the sections. I will not ask for that now.  Later, consolidation will be needed.  The sooner the better.  I would join with Deputy Colley in asking the Minister to indicate positively whether he wishes to extend the powers of the Income Tax Acts or feels that it is necessary to do so because he is applying them, legitimately, to capture capital gains.  Would the Minister say whether he feels it necessary to extend the powers?  We <Col N="1742" /> are with him that he must apply the powers, but remember the wording here.  There is a lack of frankness. The Minister uses the word &ldquo;applied&rdquo; in the tables.  I gather from the Minister's statement that his intention was to apply.  Naturally, the application would have certain modifications but application is a totally different thing from extension of powers.  Extension of powers can take place in two ways, either locally in reference to the capital gains code or more generally in respect of the income tax code.</P>
    <P>My submission is that if the Minister wanted to do it in respect of the income tax codes, why did he not do it in the Finance Act?  Would that not be the more frank and proper way to do it?  The Government were quick enough in the House to include a section&mdash;for political convenience&mdash; in the Finance Bill purporting to abolish death duties.</P>
    <P>When we were dealing with income tax we had not the extended powers that are buried in the last part of this Bill.  If the Minister is extending a power of this nature he should put it in as a substantive section in the Bill rather than put it into the provisions of a Schedule.  There has been an extension of the powers in relation to income tax.  The income tax code that was contained in the 1967 Act which was a consolidation measure, as kept up-to-date and amended by Finance Acts, is substantially affected by the scattered provisions in a schedule to a Bill that purports to deal with capital gains.  To say the least, that is sloppy legislation.  While I accept the impracticality of rewriting every section, I would ask the Minister to tidy up the matter.  I would go even further and ask him to confine any extensions here to capital gains.  If another extension is necessary, he should wait for the next Finance Bill unless there is a very good reason to act otherwise.</P>
    <P>Adverse comment has been made about this legislation but the fault does not lie with those of us who pointed out to the Minister what was in the section.  The Minister introduced the <Col N="1743" /> provisions here and he must carry the responsibility.  I do not think it is fair of him to complain that anyone else has been at fault.  I regret the adverse comments made as much as the Minister but we cannot be blamed for them. The case made by us is unanswerable. The method used by the Minister is objectionable.  At the beginning of this debate I said it was objectionable from a legal point of view but it has since been demonstrated that it is objectionable from every point of view.  It would have been better if the Minister had adopted a different approach.</P>

      <P>I must remind the House that the purpose of this Bill is to charge and impose on certain capital gains a duty of inland revenue to be known as capital gains tax.  Section 51 provides that the Schedule shall have effect for the purposes of this legislation, namely, for the purpose of capital gains.  There is no power in this measure which says that the Schedule can have effect for the purpose of income tax.  It is for the purpose of capital gains tax that the Income Tax Acts are being introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>So far as paragraph 16 is concerned, that simply makes it in order to obtain information about income and capital gains on the one form.  As I have already informed the House, the income tax forms in future will have a section which will enable the taxpayer to make a return of capital gains.  This is a matter of convenience that will suit the taxpayer as well as the Revenue Commissioners and it was considered necessary to provide for such an arrangement in paragraph 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as paragraph 18 is concerned, leases of property are being included <Col N="1744" /> to cover items such as plant and machinery that previously were not within the ambit of section 94 dealing with leases of premises and the like. Clearly, with capital gains chargeable on items other than premises it is appropriate that the provisions of section 94 would apply to such property.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister has said that in the new assessment form provision will be made for wealth tax, capital gains tax and income tax.  I do not believe that subparagraph (3) will apply to capital gains and wealth tax but will not apply to income tax. Eventually it will be one complete packet and the Minister knows well that is the idea behind it although he may say otherwise now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the new type of form and perhaps it is not unreasonable.  When paragraphs 16 and 18 are taken together they reinforce the argument on paragraph 3 (3).  By virtue of the provisions in paragraph 3 there is an extension of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The Minister has referred to the wording of section 51 which states: &ldquo; . . . for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo; As I pointed out before, that puzzled me because a Schedule is normally for the purposes of an Act.  The effect here is to make the Schedules a substantive portion of the legislation, to put them on the same basis as the other enactments, and to give these Schedules the same force and subject them to the same canons of interpretation as the rest of the Act and, therefore, applying the same canons of interpretation to this paragraph 3, regarding it, as section 51 makes me regard it, as part of the Act, I do not see that one can escape willy-nilly whether motivated or unmotivated in point of legal intention.  I do not think one can sustain the case that the Income Tax Acts are unaffected. That is the kernel of our dispute over the whole of that section.  It needs to be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of the words &ldquo;application of the Tables&rdquo; makes me say to the Minister again, if you want to extend powers, very good, say so explicitly. <Col N="1745" /> We have not been unreasonable about an extension of powers.  If the extension is involuntary, then contain them, but let us be clear on exactly what we are doing and, if the Minister positively wishes to exclude any effect on the Income Tax Acts or extension of the powers there, he will of necessity have to alter subparagraph (3) in some drastic way.  In fact, if he wishes to substantiate the claim that the Income Tax Acts are to be unaffected he will have to restrict both the property and the persons to the limitations contained in the Income Tax Act, 1967, and the subsequent Finance Acts amending it; in other words, he will have to restrict it to the existing contents of the income tax code.  I suggest that would be a reasonable approach where the two have to be tied up.  Any explicit extension necessary then in regard to capital gains only should be carefully drafted to capture capital gains only and, if any further extension other than some very necessary one is to be made in regard to the income tax code that should be held over until the next Finance Act or, if it is urgently necessary to act, a short amending Act should be introduced.  But if we are going to have a capital code and an income code as two separate things, let us try to keep them orderly and separate.  Do not let us enlarge one with the other; do not let us mix up one with the other.  This subparagraph does both and it is therefore objectionable.  The Minister should now give us some indication of what his attitude is in that regard.</P>

      <P>With respect to any acquisition of partnership assets, the particulars required by subparagraph (3).</P>
      <P>I do not know if that really is in conformity with section 70 of the 1967 Act or whether it is in addition to it. Subparagraph (3) provides for the serving of a notice requiring particulars of various kinds whereas this subparagraph seems to make this automatic in the case of a partnership. On the face of it it would appear that such details are required from an individual or a company, only if a notice is served.  I assume there is some reason for this difference in approach.</P>

      <P>No, but that is a point I might make although I must confess it was not the one I was making. The point I was making was that the particulars required by paragraph 3 I take to mean particulars which are required if a notice is served under subparagraph (3).  This subparagraph provides for the serving of such a notice if the Revenue Commissioners decide they should serve it.  Why is a partnership singled out as a taxpayer or a potential collection of taxpayers who are required to give such information even without a notice whereas <Col N="1749" /> other taxpayers must get a notice in order to be obliged to furnish this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The best way of dealing with this is to put section 70 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 on the record.  It states:</P>
      <P>(1)  The precedent partner of any partnership, when required to do so by a notice given to him in relation to any year of assessment by an inspector, shall, within the time limited by the notice, prepare and deliver to the inspector a return in the prescribed form of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  all the sources of income of the partnership for the year of assessment (in this section referred to as the preceding year) immediately preceding the year of assessment in relation to which the notice is given;</P>
      <P>(b)  the amount of income from each source for the preceding year computed in accordance with subsection (2);</P>
      <P>(c)  such further particulars for the purposes of income tax (including sur-tax) for the preceding year or the year of assessment as may be required by the notice or indicated by the prescribed form.</P>
      <P>I take it that the two additional paragraphs (a) and (b) in the Bill would be added to these.  That means you would add to that subsection the two provisions that are provided in this paragraph.  The section continues:</P>
      <P>(2)  The amount of income from any source to be included in a return under this section shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of this Act save that the computation shall be made in all cases by reference to the preceding year:</P>
      <P>Provided that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the case of such interest as is referred to in section 344 the computation shall be made without regard to that section;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  where, in the case of a trade, an account has been made up to a date within the preceding year or more accounts than one have <Col N="1750" /> been made up to dates within that year, the computation shall be made by reference to the period or to all the periods, where there are more than one, for which accounts have been made up as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>(3)  If a person delivers to any inspector a return in a prescribed form, he shall be deemed to have been required by a notice under this section to prepare and deliver that return.</P>
    <P>(4)  In proceedings for recovery of a penalty incurred under section 500 or 501 in relation to a return referred to in the preceding provisions of this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a certificate signed by an inspector which certifies that he has examined his relevant records and that it appears from them that a stated notice was duly given to the defendant on a stated day shall be evidence until the contrary is proved that that person received that notice in the ordinary course,</P>
    <P>(b)  a certificate signed by an inspector which certifies that he has examined his relevant records and that it appears from them that, during a stated period, a stated return was not received from the defendant shall be evidence until the contrary is proved that the defendant did not, during that period, deliver that return,</P>
    <P>(c)  a certificate certifying as provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) and purporting to be signed by an inspector may be tendered in evidence without proof and shall be deemed until the contrary is proved to have been signed by such inspector.</P>
    <P>(5)  In this section &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I wish to have that section <i>in toto</i> recorded on the record and I have this comment to make on it, which is somewhat similar to the one I made on the later paragraphs of the Schedule.  It seems to me that the first effect of paragraph 5 is to add the two subparagraphs (a) and (b) to subsection <Col N="1751" /> (1) of that section in the Income Tax Act.  When it does that the wider aspects of subparagraph (3) apply to extend the scope of section 70 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 in so far as partnership assets are concerned, but it is an extension.  I am again talking of legal effect.  Here again we have an involuntary extension of the scope of section 70 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, subsection (4), which specifically relates to the recovery of a penalty, is applied to everything captured by this paragraph.  I am willing to accept that what was intended was to add clauses A and B of subparagraph (5) to the clauses of subsection 1 of section 70, but having regard to what we said on subsection 3 and to the content of section 70 of the 1967 Act, it may be that something more is done than was intended. If justification and reason can be advanced for that, well and good but I should like Members to realise what we are doing in regard to this Schedule.</P>
    <P>Whatever is done in relation to subparagraph (3) will be <i>pro tanto</i> imported into section 70 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  This now becomes a matter of legal tidiness, legal intention and drafting but it is a matter that should be taken into account with the remainder of the provisions in the Schedule.  It lends all the more force to our plea to delete these Tables and I urge the Minister to do so.  Sections 70 and 94 are applied in the Table but why should this be so? Why are they applied when they are so affected and section 176, which was not affected, is left out?  From a legal point of view would it not be wiser to delete these Tables?  They are not necessary; they are misleading.</P>
    <P>I am attempting to seek the contradictions between the applications and the extensions and my intention to pursue that point later could be obviated if the Minister took my point and said that these extensions are probably more dangerous than useful.  If they serve no useful purpose, it would be much safer to delete them.</P>

      <P>I do not think so. They will help the practitioner to identify the most pertinent ones and it is clear that they are applicable subject to any necessary modifications and to the amendments which are spelled out in the paragraphs themselves.</P>

      <P>Am I to take it that this Table applies to section 94 as it is or am I to take that &ldquo;applied&rdquo; in the Table means applied and modified by paragraph 18?  Am I to take it that the section is applied and then modified by subparagraph (4) of paragraph 3.  I am aware that one can reconcile the interpretation but it does not seem to be a very useful thing seeing that the whole of the Income Tax Acts are applied in their relevant portions.  If section 176 is deleted, the Minister should also delete sections 94 and 70 from the Table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If one takes section 70 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which deals with partnership returns, by virtue of paragraph 3, subparagraph (2), and the Table that section applies.  By virtue of subparagraph 5 there is added to that particular section subparagraphs (a) and (b) of subparagraph (5) but because we strengthen it or make it relevant to assets in paragraph (5) there is no reason why we should delete it altogether other than for the argument that has been previously advanced that the Tables may not be complete.  We provide for that by saying that the Tables are without <Col N="1753" /> prejudice to the generality of subparagraph (1).</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The words, &ldquo;subject to any necessary modifications&rdquo; as used in subparagraph (1) of paragraph 3 cover a lot.  If the Minister asked himself what way a court would lean towards the interpretation of that clause, subject to any necessary modifications, he would get all the answers necessary in approaching the redrafting of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One simple answer would be that unnecessary modification would be where the words &ldquo;income tax&rdquo; appear in the original Acts that <Col N="1754" /> one would read &ldquo;capital gains tax&rdquo; for the purpose of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that under subparagraph (5) it refers to section 70 although it is in the Table, whereas in subparagraph (2) sections 500, 501 and 503 are referred to but they are not in the Table.  There does not appear to be any consistency about the way this has been done.</P>

      <P>A claim for unemployment benefit made by the person concerned on 18th February, 1975 was disallowed by a deciding officer for a period of six weeks under the provisions of section 17 (4) (a) of the Social Welfare Act 1952 on the ground that she had voluntarily left her employment without just cause.  She was notified of her right to appeal against this decision, if dissatisfied, but she did not do so.  The claim was allowed from 1st April, 1975 on the expiration of the period of disqualification.</P>

      <P>When the person concerned first sought unemployment assistance at <Col N="1607" /> his local employment office on 25th April, 1975 he was not the holder of a qualification certificate which is an essential requirement for entitlement to such assistance.  It was, therefore, necessary to have an application for a certificate completed by him and referred to a social welfare officer for investigation.  The officer's inquiries have not yet been completed, but every effort is being made to have the investigation concluded at an early date.</P>

      <P>Under its articles of association, An Foras Forbartha is empowered to grant pensions and retiring allowances subject to my approval and with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  Details of a superannuation scheme have been the subject of discussion between An Foras, my Department and the Department of the Public Service over a considerable time.  An Foras have been advised very recently of a text which is acceptable and can be approved straightaway if formally submitted.</P>
      <P>The question of benefits for the estate of any staff member of An Foras who dies prior to the introduction of a superannuation scheme would be a matter for An Foras.  I understand that An Foras accept liability that, in the event of such a death, benefits would be paid in line with similar benefits in the public service generally.</P>
