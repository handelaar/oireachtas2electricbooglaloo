    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 18:</P>
    <P>In page 18, to insert a new section before section 34 as follows :</P>
    <P>&ldquo;34&mdash;Section 59 (1) of the Finance Act, 1974 is hereby amended by the substitution of `reasonably require' for `think necessary'.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me briefly recapitulate on this amendment.  It is one which was put down to last year's Finance Bill but was not reached because of the circumstances in which the debate on last year's Finance Bill was concluded.  The amendment proposes to substitute the words &ldquo;reasonably require&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;think necessary&rdquo; in section 59 (1) of the Finance Act, 1974, that is, to require that the Revenue Commissioners or such officers as they appoint may by notice in writting require any person to furnish them within such time as they may direct, not being less than 28 days, with such particulars as they <Col N="172" /> think necessary for the purposes of section 57, 58 and 60.  The amendment is designed to change that to &ldquo;to furnish them...with such particulars as they reasonably require for the purposes of sections 57, 58 and 60&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister quoted at some length from the judgment of an English court on a case arising on wording, as I understand it, similar to the wording contained in the section. As I understand it, the Minister's purpose in quoting this judgment was to demonstrate that, although it is an English judgment, it is reasonable to assume that the same reasoning will be applied here and that the Revenue Commissioners are required in genral to act reasonably.  I think that was the point the Minister was trying to convey and that, therefore, this amendment was not necessary.  I pointed out to the Minister that it seems to me that a different test would be applied by the courts if the wording were &ldquo;reasonably require&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;think necessary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I also tried to point out to the Minister that, even if in his view the words proposed to be substituted make no difference whatever, other people take a different view and feel that the substitution of the words &ldquo;reasonably require&rdquo; would give a greater degree of protection and access to the courts than would be the case if the amendment were not accepted.  Therefore, since I assume that what the Minister wants is, in effect, what is sought in this amendment&mdash;but he says it is already provided&mdash;I am urging him to accept it even if it is his view that it does not make any difference.  If it does not make any difference he has nothing to lose by accepting it, whereas some people believe, rightly or wrongly, that there is something to be gained by accepting it.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment on those grounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask this question?  If some people think there is a gain to be made, by whom is the gain to be made?  Is it the people it is intended to prevent avoiding tax?  The sections in respect of which this power is given <Col N="173" /> are sections of the Finance Act, 1974, which are directed towards preventing the avoiding by individuals of their tax liabilities.  It is wrong that this Legislature should go out of its way to facilitate people in avoiding their tax liabilities.</P>
      <P>As I indicated last night, I am satisfied both from rulings of Irish courts and rulings of courts elsewhere, that the legal position is that this power may only be used by the Revenue Commissioners in a reasonable way.  If they act unreasonably the courts will condemn their action. If they use the power to acquire information they may use it only to the extent necessary to obtain the information for the purpose of stopping tax avoidance.  If they extend it beyond that then the courts will block the action they want to take.  I referred yesterday to the case of Clinch v.  The Inland Revenue Commissioners and I will now put on the record the following observations made in the House of Lords as reported in <i>All England Reports,</i> 1925.</P>
      <P>A person in whom is vested a discretion must exercise his discretion upon reasonable grounds.  A discretion does not empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is minded to do so.  He must in the exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought; in other words, he must by use of his reason ascertain and follow the course which reason directs.  He must act reasonably.  The words &ldquo;as they think fit&rdquo; do not mean &ldquo;as they choose&rdquo;.  The measure is not the volition of the person vested with the discretion.  It is the suitability or adequacy or fitness of the amount in the reasonable judgment of the person vested with the discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of the 1974 Act ensures that the Revenue Commissioners will act reasonably and it is not, therefore, necessary to dress up the words in what Deputy Colley regards as softer and milder language in order to ensure that the power is exercised in a reasonable way.  The amendment achieves nothing that the statute and the interpretation of the statute by <Col N="174" /> the court achieves and, in the circumstances, I would suggest the amendment is not deserving of support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asked who were the kind of people who thought that there was some advantage to be gained by inserting the proposed word and suggested that the only people who could be so concerned would be those who were trying to avoid, not evade, liability for tax&mdash;in other words, avoid liability in accordance with the law.  I do not know if such people are concerned in this matter, but many people do not find any great difficulty in getting around any provisions introduced in a Finance Bill.  However, I will tell the Minister the kind of people I know who are concerned.  They are those who are concerned with the rights and protection of citizens and they are not prepared to say that unlimited powers may be given to the Revenue Commissioners to enable the Revenue Commissioners to deal adequately, in their view, with people who are avoiding tax liability by using the law as it stands&mdash;not acting illegally, mark you, but acting within the law.  If the Minister does not accept that proposition, then logically he should simply have a section which says: &ldquo;The Revenue Commissioners can do anything they like in order to ensure that people do not avoid tax liability.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt if the Minister would be prepared to support such a proposition, though some of his proposals in other respects might make one wonder.  If he would not support such a proposition, then he is saying there is a limit beyond which one should not go and, that being so, it is simply a red herring on the part of the Minister to argue as to whether or not it is people who want to avoid liability who are concerned.  If the Minister is concerned for the rights of citizens, whether or not they are trying to avoid liability for tax, and if he accepts that there is a limit beyond which the Revenue Commissioners should not be given powers, then I suggest he is obliged to fall back on the argument he made himself that <Col N="175" /> the amendment makes no difference. That is a reasonable point for the Minister to make but I am concerned when he tries by a side swipe to make the case, without actually arguing it, that there should be no limit to the powers of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be under no illusions about this.  If one is prepared to grant unreasonable powers to the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;for instance, to get after the most blatant avoiders of tax&mdash;then it is only a short step until exactly the same powers will apply against all citizens, whether or not they are trying to avoid tax. I suggest there is an obligation on the Legislature in these matters, an obligation to try to hold a reasonable balance between, on the one hand, enabling the Revenue Commissioners effectively to do their job and, on the other hand, trampling on the rights of citizens.  I suggest that to provide that the Revenue Commissioners may seek such particulars as they reasonably require for the purposes of the later section is an attempt to do just that. It is certainly not an attempt to cramp the activities of the Revenue Commissioners in any way whatsoever. Neither can it be so represented but equally it is an attempt to build in some degree of criterion which can be applied by the courts in relation to the activities of the Revenue Commissioners in the light of the sections.</P>
    <P>If one ignores what I can only describe as the red herring introduced by the Minister, then effectively what the Minister is saying is that the acceptance of this amendment makes no difference whatever either to the Revenue Commissioners under this section.  If that is so, and I have reservations about whether or not it is so, then I am putting it to the Minister again: what has he to lose by accepting this amendment?  If the position is precisely the same whether or not the amendment is accepted, what has he to lose and why does he not therefore say : &ldquo;Right, I will accept it. It makes no difference, but I will accept <Col N="176" /> it, if it gives some people the impression they have greater rights and better protection under the law.  Even though they are wrong in that, I will accept the amendment.&rdquo;  That is what I would expect the Minister to say, but he is not saying that.  On the one hand, he is saying it makes no difference and, on the other hand, he is saying he will not accept it.  I do not think it is reasonable of the Minister to adopt that attitude if he really believes what he says : I would therefore urge him to consider the matter a little further and accept the proposition that this either makes some difference or it makes no difference beyond giving some people who are concerned for the rights of citizens grounds for believing that there will be greater protection for citizens in the courts if the amendment is accepted.</P>

      <P>I believe all taxpayers should receive equal treatment under the law in so far as it is possible to ensure that.  The overwhelming mass of people are affected by section 178 of the 1967 Income Tax Act, under which all details of an employee's income must be furnished by an employer to the Revenue Commissioners. It is as simple as that.  It must be done.</P>
      <P>Section 59 of the 1974 Act says that the Revenue Commissioners may by notice in writing require a person to furnish the information which they think necessary for the purposes of preventing the avoidance by individuals of tax liability by transfer of assets.  If the Legislature in its wisdom considers it necessary that employees do not avoid their tax liability and imposes on their employers the obligation of revealing full details of the employees' incomes, surely it is not unreasonable to require people who have information about the transfer of assets abroad for the purpose of tax avoidance to be under a similar obligation?</P>

      <P>What section of the 1967 Act did the Minister quote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is section 178 of the 1967 Act which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every employer, when required to do so by notice from an inspector, <Col N="177" /> shall, within the time limited by the notice, prepare and deliver to the inspector a return containing the names and places of residence of all persons employed by him and the payments made to those persons in respect of that employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That sets out precisely the information that can be sought. This section does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This sets out that it is such information as is necessary for the purpose of stopping tax avoidance by the transfer of assets abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister can see the difference between a section which sets out precisely the information which the Revenue Commissioners can seek and, on the other hand, a section like this which says they can seek whatever information is necessary?  There is an enormous difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to Deputy Colley that section 59 (3) sets out the information which the Revenue Commissioners may obtain. They cannot go beyond what this section gives them power to do.  Deputy Colley is not seeking to amend that. All he is doing is seeking to replace words which achieve the objective which he says he has in mind.  He says his only objective is to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners act reasonably.  I am saying that under the law they cannot but act reasonably. If they depart from that the courts can condemn them for it.  If we were to replace the words &ldquo;think necessary&rdquo; by the words &ldquo;may reasonably require&rdquo; the same test would be applied by the courts.  It would be no more and no less than that.  In fact what we are doing is having a general discussion on section 59 of the Finance Act, 1974, on its impact and its consequence and not really having any disagreement on the rights of the Revenue Commissioners to obtain this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, from time immemorial, since tax was first imposed, there has been a battle of wits going on between taxpayers and tax collectors.  If <Col N="178" /> that battle is won by a person who is liable to tax, then the burden on other taxpayers becomes so much greater. If the Legislature accepts its obligation to maintain equity, if it accepts it has an obligation to spread the load evenly, then it must strengthen the hands of the Revenue Commissioners to prevent tax avoidance.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Colley in this but I can see where the Minister can take his approach.  I can also see where Deputy Colley takes his attitude to this, as he also was a Minister for Finance.  The Minister never misses a chance of trying to knock one section with the plea that the employee or the poor ordinary taxpayer will be caught anyway.  I want to leave that kind of specious, political approach out of the matter as we are on the Committee Stage of a serious Bill.  The Minister is doing a competent job on this and I do not want him to read any slur or slight in my saying this.</P>
      <P>Does it not hang on what interpretations are there already?  What would a judge ask for if he had to deal with this?  The protagonists in this have legal experience.  What are the judicial interpretations in this?  The Minister has only mentioned one.  There have been cases and there have been interpretations.  What is the relevant state of the law from the point of view of interpretation in regard to this matter?  Those Bills are coming so fast that it takes a lot of time to pursue such a point.  The question of interpretation may cause trouble for all those Finance Bills which are before the House.  I know this is a technical point but I would like to take up a point Deputy Colley has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give some background to what I say on this.  I want, quite frankly, to confess my own conversion. <Col N="179" /> I have already referred to this in the House and I cannot bring home the point too clearly in the public interest.  I, like many others of the community, was too prone to adopt the point of view that the Revenue Commissioners were unreasonable publicans and tax gatherers in the gospel sense and that they should be anathema and defrauded and defeated at all points because they were grabbers.  I was appointed by the House to the Committee that reviewed the various Finance Acts and then I realised the truth&mdash;that we had in this organisation a very responsible and fair minded organisation which did its duty to the State, carried out its responsibility and respected the rights of the citizens as best and as fully as it could.  I am able to make this statement because in the course of the discussion, revealed to us in confidence without identification, were the actual problems the Revenue Commissioners had to face.</P>
    <P>I come now to the second matter, about which I was very vocal in the past whether on the far side of the House or this side, namely, that Ministers for Finance under any Government always appeared to be rubber stamps for the Revenue Commissioners. Then I realised that the truth was that it was an unfair charge against Ministers for Finance.  I realised that, with the information they had and the problems of the Revenue Commissioners, all the provisions, whether introduced by Deputy Colley or his predecessors or by the present Minister, had good reason and good ground.  I realised that the real reason was that it was compelling. That is the background and we should not pervert that background by having undue suspicions.</P>
    <P>The first principle for us should be to restrain the possibility for arbitrariness because there can be a slippery slope.  That can be said without the least reflection on the Government or the Revenue Commissioners. I emphasise this because it is a bad approach on our part if we give the impression that it is a reflection on <Col N="180" /> the integrity of either in a matter of this sort.  In the public interest we should be careful about this.  On good legal and legislative principle we should delegate as little arbitrary power as possible from this House. I believe that the public service who have the responsibility of executing the law would be glad to accept that principle. Arbitrary power is a responsibility that responsible and thinking people do not like to have and I am almost certain the Revenue Commissioners do not want to have arbitrary power.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Revenue Commissioners have got to have the power to do their job fairly; it is important to emphasise the doing of the job fairly.  In my view the Revenue Commissioners do the job to the best of any human ability.  What is the approach to that?  Where we have to make provisions of this sort the approach of Deputy Colley to err on the constrictive side and then to be prepared to meet the case where that is not sufficient is the better approach for this House.  It may be a bit irk-some to the officer who has to execute it, but it is the safer approach. For a short while in the public service I carried some responsibility that had arbitrary powers attached to it and I realised the temptation of a manager or an executive to get a job done.  That is one of the balances which on the constitutional scene is carried out by the courts.</P>
    <P>I am putting this on a matter of principle.  On the actual wording the Minister should be able to give a reasoned answer to the amendment from the point of view of legal interpretation. In that regard the Minister has not done enough.  Deputy Colley is entitled to say that the safer form should be used on the principles I have outlined.  This amendment is only one of a series of amendments and sections designed to give necessary powers.  I agree that the powers are probably necessary.  I use the word &ldquo;probably&rdquo; because I have not the information to say &ldquo;certainly&rdquo;.  I have no reason to doubt that, if I had all the information, I would not agree that the powers are necessary.  Our <Col N="181" /> Acts are now complicated by all this both from the point of view of the interpretation to be taken by the Revenue Commissioners for implementation, for understanding by the taxpayer and by Members but, above all for speedy administration.</P>
    <P>If this is the position why not face the problem now and introduce a general provision?  The Minister should take the safer course, safer from the constitutional and legal point of view rather than from the executive point of view, and accept Deputy Colley's amendment.  It could be accepted conditionally on the basis that the question of the powers of the Revenue Commissioners would be examined in an effort to find a general format.  The Revenue Commissioners can be trusted and we should remember that our Constitution is a control.  This is not necessarily the complete abdication it might appear to be on the surface because our Constitution provides for the judicial function.  The guardians of the judicial function, the judges and the courts, are jealous enough of their prerogatives and duties in this area and they would be quick enough to apply their correction if there was on overswing to the Executive side from the judicial side.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments against the Minister's provision&mdash;even Deputy Colley's amendment will not meet it &mdash;is that the multiplicity of these decisions will provoke or invoke legal action.  I imagine there is more on the Revenue Commissioners' files of legal difficulties and points and the solution of legal cases by settlement or agreement than ever appear in the courts, but that fact should not delude us.  It should not prevent us seeing that that fact arises fundamentally from the position where the courts stand in this.  With the multiplicity of these provisions and the fine distinctions the administrative process is greatly complicated.  Therefore, I shall be bold enough to say here : why not consider what general powers can be given to the Revenue Commissioners in a simple way realising that those powers, when they step beyond the administrative level, trespass the judicial province and, accordingly, will <Col N="182" /> be corrected?  Were it my function to appeal to our Judiciary, to our Supreme Court in a matter of this nature I would say that their duty would be to apply the principles and the matter might be solved.  Perhaps that sounds somewhat abstract but sometimes to get out of the maze of words and practical difficulties in which we get involved in this type of thing appeal to principle is the best course.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister not at this stage accept Deputy Colley's amendment as being the safer course, pending a broad examination of the situation from the point of view of the overall powers of the Revenue Commissioners under all these Acts, in the matter of getting information, of surmounting obstacles of evasion which, again, must be divided into two parts, first, the obtaining of information and, secondly, the use of technical devices to evade a provision?  There are two things involved here.  Let us take the question of the obtaining of information. If one can work out a simple formula which will work&mdash;again one must work in a practical way to achieve that&mdash;a great deal of heartache, and unnecessary energy expended on the files would be obviated and there would result a broader system of equity.  In other words, one would control tax evasion more surely and avoid the danger of trapping the honest.  There would also be a better understanding between the Judiciary and the Executive in these matters. That is my suggestion to the Minister. I do not know if it is acceptable to him.</P>
    <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me such latitude on what is a section.  I hope the Minister will appreciate that I am not merely trying to talk in the House.  I am making, I hope, a very serious and important point to him and, through him, to all others responsible and affected by this as a matter of some deep public importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to a great deal of what Deputy de Valera said.  Of course, one does not wish the administration of tax to be oppressive <Col N="183" /> or burdensome.  There is little evidence that, in fact, the administration of tax law here operates in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I would be as anxious as is the Deputy to keep a careful watch on the situation.  If occasion should arise which would indicate that its operation had acted oppressively, I would be only too anxious to invite the Oireachtas to change the laws.</P>
      <P>We are at present being asked to consider amending a section of the Finance Act, 1974 which was introduced for the purpose of ensuring that, as we were taking steps to stop tax avoidance by transfer of assets abroad, we would give the Revenue Commissioners sufficient powers to ensure compliance with the law.  It would be pointless for Parliament to enact a law and not give anybody the power to enforce that law. What we have done is no more than is necessary to enforce it.  I think Deputy de Valera may not have been here last evening when I cited some legal references.</P>

      <P>I can go back to 1938. I have a whole brief on the matter here.  In fact, I can go back to 1936, because the section in our 1974 Act is not dissimilar to what was introduced in Britain in 1936.  The wonder is that we took so long to move against tax avoidance by the transfer of assets abroad.  This is a practice which is engaged in by such people as have wealth surplus to their immediate requirements.  I saw quite recently where a journal read by financial people in Dublin carried large advertisements for a special magazine which gives people advice as to where they can get the best return in 37 tax havens in the world.  There has to be a perpetual surveillance by Parliament of actions taken by people with the intention of frustrating Parliament's intention. Every Finance Bill, almost without exception, includes provisions to close off loopholes which have been <Col N="184" /> identified.  This perpetual competition is an aspect of life that will always be with us.</P>

      <P>I would agree with the Deputy&mdash;as long as they have clients with an appetite sufficient to try to avoid paying tax.  Of course, at the same time, nobody is under any obligation to pay any more tax than the law requires.  But, because of the need to ensure that avoidance and evasion do not reach unacceptable limits, the Legislature must strengthen the hands of the Revenue Commissioners. It could well be that in exercise of the powers under section 59 of the Finance Act, 1974, the Commissioners might get information which would not disclose a taxable liability.  Nevertheless, if they have reason to believe that assets have been transferred abroad, surely it is proper that the Revenue Commissioners should take details of such assets because such assets, if transferred abroad and yielding an income, are liable to tax.  There is tax payable on the income derived from assets located elsewhere.  The Revenue Commissioners must ensure that there is a proper return in that situation, just as they have to ensure that there is a proper return of income from activities or assets within the State.  We have said that there should be no difference between them.  I think that is the correct attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that there is no difference of principle between us.  There is a request that the language be softened so that it might appear better.  But I am saying that section 59 of the 1974 Finance Act may be used by the Revenue Commissioners in a reasonable way only.  Before the Legislature agrees to make an amendment in the 1974 Act we would want to have evidence that section 59 was being used in a way which was oppressive or burdensome.  That evidence does not exist and case law is against the possibility of the section being used in an oppressive or burdensome way.  I think that is the best way in which to <Col N="185" /> leave it and not to be introducing language which, because it has not yet been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I must say the Minister's latter arguments are more compelling than were his first ones. In this context I would like to refer to two points he made.  This is more in aid of my general suggestion than the specific amendment and may be out of order.  He used the word &ldquo;burdensome&rdquo;. I agree that the ordinary honest, straightforward taxpayer has not any real complaint.  It should be borne in mind that the system is terribly burdensome now to the Revenue Commissioners.  The burden of taxation is burdensome to all of us.  But, as I said, the increased burden of a provision like this is on the Revenue Commissioners.  The second point is about disclosing information.  I know confidentiality is remarkable but the bigger the organisation and the broader its activities, the greater the difficulty of preserving the standards of confidentiality which exists and the greater the risk of information slipping out in an unwarranted way.  This is a great risk in modern life in the business world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has nothing to do with what we are discussing in this House but I came across reams of computer material&mdash;it had nothing to do with State business but belonged to a private company&mdash;that had fallen out of a car which contained a great deal of information, including names. Naturally, I returned the papers as quickly as possible to their source.  I could not help thinking that if I had been in that line of business&mdash;which I was not&mdash;there were a few interesting items in these papers.  As I said, the bigger the organisation, the bigger its ramifications, the more its administrative problems are itemised by legislation and so forth, the greater the difficulties in that regard.  In a nut-shell, Deputy Colley's amendment is preferable to what is in this section. I earnestly urge the Minister to consider <Col N="186" /> the proposition I have outlined in order to avoid amendments and provisions of this nature as far as possible in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to something the Minister said.  He suggested that unless there was evidence that the section as it exists is being abused we should not amend it.  I suggest that that is a wrong approach.  Our objective ought to be to ensure as far as we can that it cannot and will not be abused.  To do that I am suggesting this amendment.  The Minister says it will make no difference.  I believe it will make some difference.  It may be slight.  It may even be difficult to grasp the difference it can make.  I am satisfied, and so is the Minister, that it will not in any way inhibit the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise of their duties under this and previous legislation.</P>
    <P>The general proposition that the Revenue Commissioners may not act unreasonably is one thing but the proposition that they must, in relation to these particular sections, &ldquo;reasonably require information&rdquo; is different from &ldquo;information which they think necessary&rdquo;.  It may be a slight difference but there is a difference.  There is a level laid down which enables an aggrieved citizen to get some protection from the courts, in my view, a greater degree of protection than would be available to him if the section is as it is and at the same time, without inhibiting the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise of their functions in any way.  I, therefore, suggest that the Minister ought to accept the amendment on his own argument that he has nothing to lose. In those circumstances, to refuse to accept it smacks somewhat of unnecessary stubbornness.  Again, I urge him to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>As a lawyer, I am impressed by precedent.  I would prefer to use the language that is tried and tested than to embark upon a sea of novel language.  Briefly, I would like to draw attention to a number of cases so that any person who wanted to pursue this matter further will see where the support for my argument <Col N="187" /> lies.  They will also see that I am not engaged in something which is radical and dangerous.  I refer to the case of Howard de Walden v. the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, 25 T.C. 121 (year 1941).  There Lord Greene said :</P>
      <P>The section is a penal one and its consequences whatever they may be, are intended to be an effective deterrent which will put a stop to practices which the Legislature considers to be against the public interest.  For years the battle of manoeuvre has been waged between the Legislature and those who are minded to throw the burden of taxation off their own shoulders onto those of their fellow subjects.  In that battle the Legislature has often been worsted by the skill, determination and resourcefulness of its opponents, of whom the present Appellant has not been the least successful.  It would not shock us in the least to find that the Legislature has determined to put an end to the struggle by imposing the severest of penalties.  It scarcely lies in the mouth of the taxpayer who plays with fire to complain of burnt fingers.</P>
      <P>Again, there is the case of Latilla v. the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, 25 T.C. 107 (year 1943).  Viscount Simon said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Lords, of recent years much ingenuity has been expended in certain quarters in attempting to devise methods of disposition of income by which those who were prepared to adopt them might enjoy the benefits of residence in this country while receiving the equivalent of such income without sharing in the appropriate burden of British taxation. Judicial dicta may be cited which point out that, however, elaborate and artificial such methods may be, those who adopt them are &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; to do so.  There is, of course, no doubt that they are within their legal rights, but that is no reason why their efforts, or those of the professional gentlemen who assist them in the matter, should be regarded <Col N="188" /> as a commendable exercise of ingenuity or as a discharge of the duties of good citizenship.  On the contrary, one result of such methods, if they succeed, is, of course, to increase <i>pro tanto</i> the load of tax on the shoulders of the great body of good citizens who do not desire, or who do not know how, to adopt these manoeuvres.</P>
    <P>That was a judicial and not a political comment.</P>
    <P>In a dividend-stripping case in 1961, Johnson v. Jewitt, T.C. 40, 231, Lord Evershed said:</P>
    <P>I am quite unpersuaded that these transactions can properly, fairly, or sensibly be called anything but fantastic to the degree almost, perhaps, of impudence.  I am bound to say that were it otherwise, it would seem to me that the English law, and particularly the Companies Act would have been made mock of; and I only, on conclusion, express great regret that the engineer of this extraordinary scheme should be a member of the profession of solicitor.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Colley and I should bow our heads.  Judge Dankworth agreed with the previous view and said that the loss which was alleged to have been suffered was purely fictitious, that it was not trading but juggling with figures.</P>

      <P>No, but what was being contested in the cases in question from which I have read quotations from the judgements was the powers used by the Revenue Commissioners to stop tax avoidance and tax evasion.  There were objections expressed that the actions were unreasonable, but the courts took the view that the Legislature was doing no <Col N="189" /> more than discharging its necessary obligations to confer appropriate powers on the Commissioners of the Inland Revenue to ensure that the law is enforced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made Deputy Colley's case completely. The Minister has told us two things : first that on the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; the courts are decidedly in favour of equity and therefore lean towards the honest discharge of their duty by the tax collecting authority, that the Revenue Commissioners can rely on the sympathy of the courts, and, secondly, that that sympathy can be invoked fully and absolutely by the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; was recurring there as it recurs in all these things.  If the Revenue Commissioners can rely on the courts' sympathy in this matter and not only the courts but the vast bulk of the public, and if the most of the legislation and interpretations are based on the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, then surely that is the word to use and not the phrase &ldquo;think necessary&rdquo;, whether that formula has been tried out or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three of us here who have had considerable experience in arguing in the courts, and we know that when something is claimed, particularly by the State, which seems to be in the oppressive category&mdash;using the word &ldquo;oppressive&rdquo; more in the legal sense than in the accepted sense &mdash;then the court is apt to be suspicious at the start and to think that the provision is unreasonable.  The Revenue Commissioners and their legal advisers need have no fear but that in this context of tax evasion and tax avoidance the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; will be interpreted very favourably towards them.  I speak subject to any dictum or interpretation that the Minister may produce, because we should not be just debating here; we are making legislation and trying to help in this.  As I said, I was very impressed by the Minister's argument at an earlier stage, but is there not a danger that by using words like &ldquo;think necessary&rdquo; a court might be put on its guard and feel a little bit <Col N="190" /> nervous about that formula and might be tempted to interpret it more narrowly against the Revenue Commissioners than they would Deputy Colley's formula?  In the case that the Minister has cited, the sympathy of the courts is towards the tax collecting authority when the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is applied to their powers. Therefore, I say Deputy Colley's amendment is desirable, apart from the principles earlier adumbrated.  The courts might consider the words &ldquo;think necessary&rdquo; unduly restrictive and the Revenue Commissioners might be better off with Deputy Colley's formula.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to insert a new section before section 34 as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;34&mdash;Section 59 (2) (b) of the Finance Act, 1974 is hereby amended by the substitution of `with respect to which the Revenue Commissioners or such officer as the Revenue Commissioners may appoint may reasonably require information' for `which in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners or of such officer as the Revenue Commissioners may appoint it is proper that they should investigate'.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a considerable similarity between this amendment and No. 18 but there is also a difference.  This amendment also relates to the same section of the 1954 Finance Act.  Like the previous amendment it was tabled last year but was not discussed because of the guillotine motion used to terminate <Col N="192" /> the debate on the 1974 Act. Section 59, subsection (2) (b) of the 1974 Act reads:</P>
    <P>As to transactions which in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners or of such officer as the Revenue Commissioners may appoint it is proper that they investigate for the purpose of sections...</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;which in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners or of such officer as the Revenue Commissioners may appoint it is proper that they should investigate&rdquo; and to substitute for that &ldquo;with respect to which the Revenue Commissioners or such officer as the Revenue Commissioners may appoint may reasonably require information.&rdquo;  This is slightly different from the last one in that in this case the section refers to that which in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners or an officer of theirs, it is proper that they should investigate, whereas the amendment proposes words to the effect &ldquo;with respect to which they may reasonably require information.&rdquo;  The object here is to try to provide a basis on which the courts may act in the case of an aggrieved taxpayer.</P>
    <P>If the amendment is accepted any officer of the Revenue Commissioners who, perhaps for reasons of excessive zeal or otherwise, may be tempted to go beyond what is proper, would find that he must consider how the courts would interpret his action.  I suggest that he would be less inclined to be concerned with the question of whether the courts would interfere with his activities under the section as drafted than he would if this amendment were accepted.  There is no restriction involved on the legitimate activities of the Revenue Commissioners in their pursuance of the various sections.  All I am proposing is the laying down of some criteria to which the courts could have regard in judging the activities of the Revenue Commissioners in their investigations in cases where taxpayers might complain of their activities and believe that they had gone beyond what was reasonably required for the execution of their duties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> I assume the Minister would agree that the Revenue Commissioners should not go and are not entitled legally to go beyond what is reasonably required for the execution of their duties.  Therefore we ought to set that out clearly.  By so doing in the way proposed in this amendment we will be making it clearer to the taxpayer who wishes to consult the law with regard to his rights and also, making clearer for the benefit of the courts, if they are called on to interpret the activities of the Revenue Commissioners in the light of this section, the standards required by the Legislature.  The mere fact that this provision as amended would be in the law would tend to operate to prevent the over-zealous activities of the Revenue Commissioners which would amount to exceeding what is intended should be done by them in the exercise of their powers and duties in relation to transactions of the kind dealt with in the subsequent section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate we had last night and this morning applies in full to this amendment as it did to the previous ones.  The same issues are involved.  The question is that of the reasonableness of the actions of the Revenue Commissioners.  The constraints or the propriety of any investigation are set out in the 1974 Act. The Revenue Commissioners may not investigate anything other than that for which they are given power in sections 57 to 60 of the 1974 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person to whom notice is addressed considers himself aggrieved, that the Revenue Commissioners are overstepping their power, he can challenge the propriety of any such notice. Section 59 of the 1974 Act contains a safeguard to ensure the confidentiality of the relationship between solicitor and client.  There is even a limit on the amount of information which the Revenue Commissioners may obtain from a solicitor, who is confined to giving the name and address of a client, of a transferee of the person concerned, of a body corporate involved, of a settlor or of some person resident or domiciled outside the State to whom assets are transferred for tax avoidance <Col N="194" /> purposes.  The wording of section 59 is taken from the statute of another country and has been well and truly tried for 39 years.  Obviously there is merit in using language which has stood the test of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are slight variations.  Language used by parliamentary draftsmen must change from generation to generation in the same way as generations tend to replace yesterday's orthodoxy with today's slang, which tomorrow becomes respectable. There is this continuing change in the use of words but, in effect, the wording we have used here is that which has stood the test of time and which achieves what Deputy Colley attempted to achieve in the amendment.</P>
      <P>I should prefer to rely on the words which, as Deputy de Valera said earlier in relation to the other amendment, could be interpreted by the court more readily against the Revenue Commissioners than the wording suggested by Deputy Colley.  However we should endeavour to be precise in our language and there is more precision in the Act of 1974 than in the amendment suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the provision in this section relating to solicitors but, with due deference, I think those remarks relate to the next amendment.  This amendment relates to transactions which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners or an officer they may appoint, it is proper that they should investigate. It is not confined to investigation of activities by solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Deputy de Valera on the previous amendment probably has some validity, and the Minister accepts that also: that it is possible that the amendment might result in a more favourable interpretation by the courts for the Revenue Commissioners.  That is possible and I have no objection to that.  What I am concerned with is that the Legislature should lay down clearly for the courts what the Legislature wants and not depend unduly on decisions, particularly <Col N="195" /> decisions by foreign courts, on texts which are slightly different from the texts of this Bill.  The Minister knows that a slight difference can make all the difference in the interpretation. I believe it is far preferable that we should lay down in the legislation we enact sufficient to indicate without any doubt that we want to ensure that the powers being given to the Revenue Commissioners are exercised reasonably, that the specific powers as in this case to investigate certain transactions, are exercised in such a way as is reasonably necessary for the purpose of carrying out the duties of the Revenue Commissioners under this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a certain risk in relying unduly on interpretations in other countries of statutes which are slightly different.  The Minister may have available interpretations given by our own courts although he did not refer to them.  I think any applications he referred to were in English courts and related to legislation very slightly different in wording, but the difference in wording could make a considerable difference in the application of the legislation here.</P>
    <P>I see no valid objection from the Minister's point of view to this House spelling out clearly that what we want is to give these powers to the Revenue Commissioners but to make it clear that we are not giving absolute power to them, that we are not saying: &ldquo;Anything you think should be investigated, you may investigate no matter what the circumstances.&rdquo;  We want to say: &ldquo;You may investigate anything which you reasonably need to investigate to carry out the duties laid on you by these sections.&rdquo;  That is what both sides of the House want to say but it is not precisely what we are saying.  We would approach much closer to that if amendment No. 19 were accepted.</P>

      <P>I cannot add to what I have already said other than that I have now checked the wording of the 1936 British Act and find it is on all fours with the wording to which Deputy Colley takes exception, that <Col N="196" /> is that it requires the opinion of the Board of Inland Revenue and it would relate to matters which an inspector thought it proper that they should investigate.  So, in fact, we have the value of the support of experience for the words we are using.</P>

      <P>It seems there is a distinction between &ldquo;in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners or of such officer as the Revenue Commissioners may appoint it is proper they should investigate&rdquo; and what is proposed in the amendment.  It is, of course, a matter of interpretation and lawyers interpret things differently. It seems to be pretty broad.  The opinion of the board of the Revenue Commissioners may be one thing and the opinion of any officer could be something else.  This is very similar to the previous amendment in regard to anything one thinks necessary.  It would seem better if the Minister were to require the commissioners to spell out what they would think necessary.  There was a debate in this House some years ago which ran into many days over the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;. Here, there is a distinction between anything that one might think and Deputy Colley's amendment what may be reasonably thought to be&mdash;may reasonably require information. It is a matter of legal interpretation but it is important that the Minister should require that the matter should be reasonable at all times rather than that it should be&mdash; without any reflection on any officer&mdash; anything that any officer might think, bearing in mind that you would have different people carrying out the functions from time to time.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20.</P>
      <P>In page 18, to insert a new section before section 34 as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;34&mdash;Section 59 (4) of the Finance Act, 1974 is hereby amended by the deletion of all words after `business' to the end of the subsection and the substitution of `nor on a solicitor, barrister or accountant acting in his professional capacity to give any particulars whatever concerning any advice given by him to, or anything done by him on behalf of, a client'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This also is an amendment which was put down to the Bill last year and which was not reached for the reasons I mentioned earlier.  It is an amendment to section 59 (4) of the Finance Act, 1974.  The effect of the amendment would be that subsection (4) would read as follows:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this section shall impose on any bank the obligation to furnish any particulars of any ordinary banking transactions between the bank and a customer carried out in the ordinary course of banking business, nor on a solicitor, barrister or accountant acting in his professional capacity to give any particulars whatever concerning any advice given by him to, or anything done by him on behalf of, a client. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the relationship between a solicitor, a barrister or an accountant and the client should not be interfered with in any way; the relationship between a solicitor and client is a <Col N="198" /> matter that has received special legal recognition for many centuries.  The Minister may say the information that may be sought from a solicitor, for instance in circumstances such as are envisaged here, is limited and certainly it is limited in a certain way in an earlier part of the section.  There are two points: first, such information can be obtained by the Revenue Commissioners in other ways and, secondly, what would be lost if one were to interfere with the relationship of a solicitor and client&mdash;I am picking those two people as an example of what we are dealing with in this amendment&mdash; would far outweigh anything that could be gained by this section if it is amended.</P>
    <P>The effect of interfering with that relationship is not merely what is done in the section.  If it is done in this section it is only a matter of time until it is pushed further and further and such a relationship ceases to exist or to have any special meaning, particularly in law.  The consequences are that a person will find he cannot consult with his solicitor for advice in regard to certain courses of action because even consulting for advice without taking action ultimately could be something on which the solicitor would be obliged to report.</P>
    <P>The development of this kind of law may appear in the short term to benefit the Revenue Commissioners but, in fact, it is doing the exact opposite.  Apart from the much wider implications which apply far outside this measure, if the people whom these sections are designed to get after are of the belief that consulting their bank, solicitor, accountant, or a barrister through their solicitor, will mean that information concerning their activities will be given to the Revenue Commissioners by these people, naturally they will not consult them.  Any possible advantage that might have been envisaged disappears because such people will ensure that the activities they engage in will be unknown to their solicitor or their bank.</P>
    <P>There is a grave danger here but I suspect the Minister has not grasped it and this is illustrated by something <Col N="199" /> he is proposing to do in other legislation before the House.  There are a number of trusts which have been set up in this country, whose sole purpose is to ensure that the tax to be derived is paid to the Irish Revenue Commissioners and not to foreign revenue commissioners.  That is their sole purpose and yet the effect of a proposal before the House will be that they will be closed down and the revenue will go to other countries.  I am mentioning that to try to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that what may appear to be something that will aid the Revenue Commissioners may do a great deal more damage than any benefit that might accrue.  I believe that would be the result in this case.</P>
    <P>The advantage to the Revenue Commissioners involved in the section is, to say the least, minimal and that is as high as I can put it.  I do not think there is any real advantage but if there is it will be minimal. However, the disadvantage to the Revenue Commissioners ultimately will be far more than minimal, it will be very extensive.  In the meantime the whole question of the relationship of solicitor and client will have been attacked and undermined and that has implications far outside any Finance Bill or any activity of the Revenue Commissioners.  It can extend right across the board to the various activities in which our citizens engage, whether under the purview of the criminal or the civil law.</P>
    <P>It may be said it is a gross exaggeration to talk in these terms when the section does not deal with such matters.  The Minister should know a frontal assault on this relationship would be unsuccessful but a small assault on just one section of the relationship can be followed up by an extension of that beachhead further and further until the whole relationship and its position in law is eroded. Therefore, it is our duty to resist any such encroachment, in particular to resist it when the alleged excuse for it &mdash;in other words, the benefits that may accrue through the Revenue Commissioners getting certain information&mdash;is <Col N="200" /> artificial and fictitious.  There is no benefit for the Revenue Commissioners from what is provided here in regard to the information that can be sought. It is fictitious, something which will have no practical benefit for the Revenue Commissioners but which provides the beginning of the erosion of the relationship particularly between solicitor and client but also between banks and their customers. Both are vitally important not alone from the point of view of the rights of citizens but, in the case of a bank and its customers, to the effective operation of our economic system.</P>
    <P>We ought to be extremely slow in doing anything that would interfere with that relationship: we should be certain that what is being done is essential and that there is no other way of approaching the problem.  Even then, one should hesitate before touching these relationships.  In this case, the alleged justification for it does not exist.  There are subsections of this section which appear to play down the information that can be required, but when you examine them there is nothing involved.  The Revenue Commissioners can get the information otherwise and it appears to me to be a very thin excuse for what comes later, what amounts to an attempted erosion of the relationship between solicitor and client and bank and customer.  It is misguided to have the sort of provisions we see in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think from what Deputy Colley has said that section 59 of the 1974 Act did not provide special protection for relationship between solicitor and client.  Of course it does.  It specifically guards that relationship. It would be very interesting for any student of parliamentary manners to study why it is that emotion seems to spurt out of the mouths of Members of Parliament when seated in Opposition benches and that realism tends to be the order of the day on the part of those in Government benches.  That is part of the parliamentary experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make clear what the position is in relation to the provisions of the 1974 legislation.  The section Deputy Colley is seeking to amend <Col N="201" /> provides for a limitation of the information to be given by solicitors to the Revenue Commissioners.  No professional gentleman is entitled to any privilege whatsoever other than the privilege of his client&mdash;no solicitor may go into court and seek privilege for his own protection.  He may claim, and the court grant, privilege in relation to the protection of his client's interest.</P>
    <P>The people against whom this section is directed are those who are believed to be engaging in tax avoidance, who are failing in their statutory obligation to furnish information to the Revenue Commissioners, and it would be totally wrong for Parliament to allow any person who has an obligation to pay tax to shield behind a professional adviser.  That would be making a mockery of legislation, it would be creating a pretence of having an efficient tax system which could not be seriously entertained.</P>
    <P>Under the existing general law, lawyers, whether solicitors or barristers, are allowed to claim that information supplied to them in the course of consultation enjoys the privilege of confidentiality, and advice given by lawyers is under the general law and under the 1974 Finance Act absolutely privileged: no lawyer can be called on to give details of the advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is seeking to insert the word &ldquo;advice&rdquo;.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>`nor on a solicitor, barrister or accountant acting in his professional capacity to give any particulars whatever concerning any advice given by him to, or anything done by him on behalf of, a client'.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Advice is not something which the Revenue Commissioners can demand <Col N="202" /> particularly.  They may demand in respect of solicitors only the names and addresses of the transferor or transferee associated in certain operations, in other words the names and addresses of persons engaged in tax avoidance practices, so that the Revenue Commissioners may then go after the people themselves in the same way as they would pursue any person who is liable for tax.  I use the word &ldquo;pursue&rdquo; not in the sense of giving chase but in the sense of contacting people who have an obligation to furnish information.</P>
    <P>The only information being sought is that which would identify persons who may be liable.  That is all.  The professional person need not furnish any information unless and until the person concerned has the authority of his client to do so.</P>
    <P>The traditional privilege between banks and their customers in relation to transactions between them is also well established in law.  Because of the privilege that obtains between solicitors and their clients and banks and their customers, subsections (3) and (4) were inserted to protect that privileged position. To that extent, therefore, the Deputy's amendment in relation to advice given by a solicitor or barrister is met and is clearly seen to be met. Where, however, a solicitor has acted in connection with the actual transfer or any associated operation, then he must give the particulars I already mentioned, the names and addresses of persons involved.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year in the Seanad that I was disappointed the solicitors' profession did not acknowledge that their position was being protected under the Act.  Instead, some solicitors, and Deputy Colley today, have done a public disservice by insinuating that there was improper interference with the confidentiality that should exist between solicitors and clients.  Our neighbours in Britain are no less jealous of the confidentiality of relationships between solicitors and clients.  There has been no lack of trust in solicitors or barristers in England where the section to which such emotive exception has been taken here has been in operation <Col N="203" /> for 39 years.  Both Parliament and courts in England have said that it was a duty of everybody to pay a fair share of tax and that Parliament had a duty to ensure that consultation with professional people did not give a protection which ordinary citizens did not enjoy. The unrealistic nature of the criticism levelled against the provisions of the 1974 Act is illustrated by the fact that whereas Deputy Colley and some others on behalf of the solicitors' profession said that the section is unacceptable, the Institute of Chartered Accountants have sought to have applied to them the very exceptions and privileges which the section confers on solicitors.  It would be strange, if it was challenging a confidential relationship, that accountants should seek to enjoy the same privileges as have been conferred on lawyers by the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Privileges were not conferred.  Privileges were taken away by the section.  In the case of solicitors the privilege existed and the Minister knows that.</P>

      <P>The legal profession, like every other profession, have a duty to tell their clients what the legal position is and that duty involves informing clients if steps about to be taken by them infringe the tax law.  I am sure the Deputy would not wish to put the integrity of the solicitors' profession in doubt by suggesting that they should facilitate tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be quite clear on this.  He is talking about solicitors advising clients to break the law.  Can he not visualise a situation in which they are advising them as to what the law is and how to comply with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have said that it is the duty of a solicitor to tell the client what the law is and that <Col N="204" /> any action which he intends to take which is against the law is against the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Or is not against the law, if it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is a solicitor's professional duty and that is what he is trained to do.  Deputy Colley used the word &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; like the word &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; covers a multitude of activities.  &ldquo;Solicitor&rdquo; is defined by law.  They are the only profession to be statutorily defined as gentlemen. It has been said that was necessary or it would not be accepted. &ldquo;Barrister&rdquo; is also clearly defined by law.  &ldquo;Accountant&rdquo; is not defined by law and if one includes accountants should one debar tax consultants, tax practitioners, some of whom may not have an accountancy qualification of any kind?  The word &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; could be extended to book keepers just as &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; is a title sometimes assumed by mechanics.  It is much too loose a term to use in a statute apart from other reasons why it should not be included at all.  The law does not recognise that the same degree of confidentiality exists between accountants and their clients. The legal profession have a privileged position because it is the privilege of the clients which is being protected. That cannot be extended to activities which involve tax evasion and we could not contemplate extending to the accountancy profession a privilege which does not apply to the legal profession nor could we entertain at this stage or in a Finance Act the question of what should be the appropriate area of confidentiality existing between accountants and their clients. If there is to be legislation to counter tax avoidance by means of transfer of assets abroad, the Revenue Commissioners must be empowered to seek information to enable them to establish whether an avoidance operation has taken place.  That is axiomatic.  I trust nobody in the House would challenge that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the information which the Revenue Commissioners will seek under section 59 ought to come from <Col N="205" /> the taxpayer himself.  If he employs an accountant or an agent to look after his tax affairs and to deal with the Revenue Commissioners on his behalf, there is no reason why the information, which in the ordinary way would be sought from the taxpayer, should not be sought from and given by his agent.  There is no question of the accountant or the agent being required or expected to give the information without the taxpayer's knowledge. If the Revenue Commissioners seek information about tax avoidance operations from an accountant or agent, the accountant or agent will undoubtedly so notify the taxpayer and inform him that there is a legal obligation on him to furnish the information requested.</P>
    <P>If a taxpayer sets out to plan a tax avoidance device it would be expected that, in the course of the planning operation, his accountant or agent would advise him that the Revenue Commissioners were likely to look for information about the operation.  In the light of the purpose of the legislation, it is difficult to see why the Legislature should set up any barriers or obstacles to the implementation of the legislation by authorising a taxpayer's agent to withhold information or to refuse to give information in relation to avoidance operations.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment which would simply open the door to avoidance and evasion a year after we took action to close the door.  The undersirable possibilities which Deputy Colley has illustrated here have not materialised in Britain in 39 years.  I do not expect them to materialise here.  Considerable benefits have accrued to the Exchequer and consequently to the general body of taxpayers, because loopholes which facilitated avoidance by transfer of assets abroad were closed and because the information net had a smaller mesh and was cast further.  That is what this section in the 1974 Act achieved.  It ensures a better supply of information.</P>
    <P>No person who is not liable to tax has anything to fear from the powers given to the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="206" /> to collect information.  The only person who may be disappointed if the sources of information to the Revenue Commissioners are improved are people who have a liability to pay tax and who avoid it by withholding information which they have a clear statutory obligation to give and, indeed, a moral obligation as well.  Democracy has long since asserted that every person should pay his fair share of tax. Democracy requires that the Legislature will provide the means whereby the Revenue Commissioners can ensure that everyone pays a fair share of tax.  If we failed to give them that means we would be engaging in a sham and, quite frankly, I am not prepared to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said this amendment would open the door to avoidance and evasion.  I am quoting his exact words.  That is nonsense. Evasion is always illegal and nothing in this section or this amendment affects in any way the position in relation to tax evasion.  In regard to tax avoidance, when I was proposing this amendment I mentioned that I believed that the information which is being sought here from solicitors is available to the Revenue Commissioners anyway from other sources. Of course, it is perfectly obvious that, in order to be in a position to put a question about a particular taxpayer to a particular solicitor, the Revenue Commissioners must have something to go on.  They can put the question to the taxpayer and, if he gives false information, he leaves himself wide open to very serious penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated that I was not particularly tied to the wording of the amendment. I am conscious of the difficulties in regard to the definition of &ldquo;accountants&rdquo;.  The Minister is welcome to any point he wishes to make on that.  What the Minister is glossing over very carefully is the fact that this section as a whole, without this amendment or something on these lines, is taking away existing rights, existing privilege in the legal sense. He spoke as though it were granting such.  Of course, it is not doing any <Col N="207" /> such thing and the Minister knows that as well as anybody else.</P>
    <P>For very good, sound, historical and legal reasons, the relationship of a solicitor and client has a special position in law.  It is true, of course, as the Minister says, that a lawyer has no privilege himself beyond the privilege of his client.  That privilege was built up for good reasons over many years. When I hear the Minister saying he presumes everybody will accept the proposition that, in order to tackle tax avoidance, privilege of that kind must not be allowed to stand in the way, I wonder has the Minister thought about what he is saying and what he is doing.</P>
    <P>If someone commits murder and consults with a solicitor and discloses what he has done in the course of his consultation with his solicitor, I assume the Minister does not believe that the solicitor should there and then report the matter to the Garda&mdash;or does he? The position in this regard has been built up over centuries with the experience of what can happen.  The proposition that a solicitor&mdash;and I am taking him merely as an example; it extends further than that&mdash;who receives information in the course of his professional duties is obliged to hand over that information to the authorities is a most dangerous proposition.</P>
    <P>This is the thin end of the wedge. Without this section the information sought could not be obtained by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister seeks to justify it on the grounds that we are all against aiding tax avoidance. We are all against a great many other things too and yet the privilege of a client who consults his solicitor is preserved in law, and is jealously preserved. If the Minister has his way, there will be another section which will go further and it will all be justified on the grounds that we are against tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>There should be no misunderstanding of the position.  This section is taking away rights which exist in regard to the relationship of a client to his solicitor.  It is taking them away and whittling them down.  It will be extended further if this is allowed to <Col N="208" /> go on.  The Minister may talk about the position in Britain.  I am subject to correction but I think the provisions are not precisely the same but, even if they are, I assume the Minister knows what has been happening in Britain and that certain kinds of activities have developed which do not exist in this country which aid and abet tax avoidance.  The Minister is devising a formula here for the hothouse growth of such kinds of activities in this country.  He is driving people into that position.  That is precisely what will happen.  He will get no information of any value whatever from this section. He will create a situation in which people will not go to their solicitor, or their accountant, or their bank, and the Revenue Commissioners will know far less about what is going on than they do at the moment.  They will be far less effective in getting after such people.  It will go totally under ground with a number of undesirable consequences flowing from it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should know of some of the things that have happened in Britain as a result of this kind of legislation. He will have to reconcile himself to the fact that, in this perennial battle between those who are trying to avoid liability for tax&mdash;I say avoid, not evade; that is a different proposition&mdash; and the Revenue Commissioners, there are no final victories.  It goes on and on. If the Minister pushes the situation too far, as I believe he is doing here, he is so altering the ground rules that these people are getting out from under the ken of the Revenue Commissioners.  If it is not pushed too far the Revenue Commissioners can at least become aware of what is happening and close the loophole.  People will open further loopholes, but that is getting more and more difficult.  When you try to get information which is of no use to the Revenue Commissioners anyway by undermining the relationship between a client and a solicitor, as is being done here, all you are doing is driving the whole thing completely out of the ken of the Revenue Commissioners. You are losing out on a number of scores, and what have you got to show for it?  A section which says the names and addresses of people involved in <Col N="209" /> those transactions are to be given to the Revenue Commissioners by the solicitors concerned.  Is this rational?  Is this a real approach to this matter?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister seriously suggesting that this section will aid in any way the efforts of the Revenue Commissioners to get at people who have indulged in tax avoidance?  Does the Minister not know that these provisions are totally ineffective in so far as they relate to people who do not want to be caught?  He must know that from his own experience and, if he does not, then if he consults with some of his former professional colleagues, they will tell him very quickly what is happening.  This is totally ineffective but there is a price being paid for this ineffective result, a price which could be very high in the future.  The price relates to the privilege of a client who consults his solicitor&mdash;a privilege which has been preserved over centuries for very good reasons&mdash;and if that position is eroded the rights of citizens under the criminal law as well as under the civil law will disappear.  To say that this is going too far, that it is an exaggeration, may appear to be plausible, but the Minister must know that this section is taking away existing rights and if this is allowed to go unchallenged then it will only be a matter of time until it is carried further. If that can be done, then why not further again?  If the justification for taking away these rights can be the duty of everbody to assist in preventing tax avoidance, are there not very many other far more compelling reasons which can be put forward from the point of view of civic duty, far more compelling than that, which would justify further erosion of this position?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister not to take this step on this slippery slope and not to try to justify it by talking about an obligation to assist in combating tax avoidance because, if that is a good enough reason for taking away these rights, I can give him ten times more compelling reasons for taking away far more rights and we will then end up with no rights at all. A very dangerous precedent is involved in this section.  It is one which, <Col N="210" /> as the Minister said, has been resisted by many solicitors.  It is not being resisted by them because they have any privileges.  They have no privilege&mdash;it is their clients have the privilege&mdash; but they know better than anybody else what this kind of step can lead to in the long run.  I repeat that the value of this step to the Revenue Commissioners is minimal but the implications of taking it and attempting to justify it are enormous.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not seen the full implications and I do not want it to happen that this House would allow a section like this to pass without clearly enunciating the dangers involved and, in so far as it can be done on this side of the House, resisting this encroachment and the implications of the encroachment.</P>
    <P>It happened last year that we never got a chance of discussing this matter.  That is why I put down this amendment because I regard it as vitally important that we should get a chance here of discussing this matter and its implications and make our position as clear as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy hear me out?  Many forms of avoidance are no more than operations by the clever to avail of weaknesses in administration or imperfections in the language of the statute to frustrate the clear intention of the Legislature to collect tax arising out of certain profits or capital possessions. I do not think Deputy Colley would deny that.  If I am wrong in that contention, why is it that one Finance Minister after another year after year used the <Col N="211" /> Finance Bill to stop avoidance practices? Avoidance is not a transgression of the law but not infrequently it is a brutal bending of the law.  It conforms with the law because it slips in between the dot above the &ldquo;i&rdquo; and the &ldquo;i&rdquo; itself. Many of the practices of avoidance by means of transferring assets abroad are such as to run so close to evasion as to be properly termed evasion.  Indeed, since the 1974 Act obliges people to pay tax on income earned from assets abroad, not to do so is evasion and it is illegal.  I will not accept that it is contrary to practice and that there is an encroachment on the necessary confidence which exists between clients and their solicitors.  I would equally refuse to accept, speaking as a lawyer as well as a parliamentarian, that lawyers should permit their professional status to be used for the purpose of evading tax.  If that were to happen&mdash;it has happened to some extent&mdash;and if it were to encourage or facilitate evasion then the whole standing of the legal profession would come under a cloud.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1939 the same arguments Deputy Colley makes were produced in the British House of Commons when similar provisions were being discussed.  I was glad to note, however, that there was less emotionalism and more realism in the criticisms offered then in the House of Commons.  The Solicitor General replying to the criticisms had this to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...we are dealing here with an area where we are trying to prevent tax evasion by the transfer of assets abroad, and the Clause is really purely declaratory of the existing law.  It suggests that certain particulars must be furnished by persons or by their agents in relation to these transactions so that the transactions may be identified.  Subsection (2) to which the Amendment of the hon.  Gentlemen applies preserves for solicitors the privilege that they enjoy at present.  The only information that the Commissioners may request from solicitors will be information as to names and <Col N="212" /> addresses and nothing else.  They are not required to disclose documents or the instructions that they have received.  This is a privilege which the profession of solicitors enjoys under the existing law by reason of a long history of case law.  The accountants enjoy no such privelege under the law.</P>
    <P>The hon. Baronet is asking for a privilege for accountants which no other agent would be permitted to have, and which solicitors only enjoy by reason of the existing law. Privilege is a valuable thing to conserve, but it is a very dangerous thing to extend.  Privilege by its very nature means the obstruction of the truth.  It is a barrier between the investigation of the truth and the actual arrival at the facts.  It is not easy to justify in an area where you are dealing with deliberate evasion, and were it not for the fact that the privilege exists enabling a person to go to his solicitor for advice, and while it might be difficult to justify it, I should find it impossible to stand here and justify its extension to one particular kind of agent, who, in many cases, is the very man from whom you want to find out what he knows about the transfer of assets abroad.</P>
    <P>I believe those words can be used with as much justification in 1975 as they could be used in 1939.  We can also use them with the value of the experience of what has happened in Britain in the intervening years.  Confidentiality has been maintained between solicitor and client.  The Exchequer, the general body of taxpayers, have not had to bear the enormous costs of some avoidance practices which would have gone unchecked if that power were not there.</P>
    <P>If we want to discourage people from running contrary to the spirit of the legislation as well as to the letter of it, then we must ensure that if we are imposing obligations to pay tax we provide the Revenue Commissioners with the means to enforce those obligations.  If we fail to do so then we are continuing an unjust system in which the person of small means, who is an employee working <Col N="213" /> for an employer who supplies information about the income would have to pay his or her share of the tax while the clever and the rich, engaging consultants, could shelter behind them and avoid paying their share.  That is not a desirable thing to happen.  It need not happen as long as the powers conferred in the 1974 Act are not tampered with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying the anti-avoidance action of the 1974 Act will ensure that, to a greater extent than was possible before then, the clever and the rich will not avoid their fair share of tax.  I am prepared to acknowledge now, as on many other occasions, as Deputy Colley said, that the battle of the Revenue Commissioners against tax avoiders and evaders will go on forever.  There will never be a victor.  At most there will be a pyrrhic victory on one side or the other or a short-lived one.  As the courts have said on numerous occasions, people who engage in avoidance practices must accept that as they engage in them they are likely to suffer sooner or later the wrath of the Legislature, which will take action to prevent the continuance of the avoidance.</P>

    <P>People who engage in avoidance do so knowing that one of the occupational hazards is that legislation may be introduced to destroy their fun.  It has to be introduced, not for the sake of being a kill-joy of the person engaged in avoidance practices, but out of a sense of fair play to the general body of taxpayers who have no opportunities of avoidance, no discretion in the matter and no knowledge or skill which would enable them to avoid paying the full share of tax which the Legislature intended them to pay.  The people against whom this section is directed, the people engaged in the transfer of assets abroad, have a liability under the law now to pay tax.  This is one of the necessary weapons that must be given to the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that obligation <Col N="214" /> is complied with.  Failure to do so would create a sham, as I said earlier, and I could not be a party to that.</P>

      <P>I recognise it is the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to collect as much tax as they can. I appreciate they are told from time to time by Ministers to be less merciful than they might be if there was a better economic climate. Pressure is very often put on them to be a little bit harsh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am left with nothing else but to believe this because of the kind of legislation which is before the House now.  The Minister said he morally sees no difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance.  In fact the basic difference is that one is illegal and the other is legal.  It is illegal to evade and it is quite legal to avoid.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything wrong in a person seeking advice on how to make his or her tax return. The Revenue Commissioners can be co-operative but it is not their job to tell people what they can claim relief on.  In my view there is nothing whatsoever wrong in a person going to a tax adviser, who very often is a solicitor. If the Minister was out of government tomorrow and back in his practice or decided to give up politics and went back to his practice, would he refuse to act in an advisory capacity on a tax matter with a client? From what he has said here it seems to me he would refuse to talk to any client about how he might avoid a heavy bill for tax because he equates it with tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, having listened to Deputy Colley and others, that the Minister will breed a new kind of shyster lawyer, a person who will not comply with the will of the Legislature in this instance.  A number of companies will probably start business because they see a profitable venture in being tax advisers.  They may even be outside the country, where clients could go to consult them.  Those companies would <Col N="215" /> be authorities on particular tax systems throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that I believe as earnestly as the Minister does that people should pay their just taxes but I think it is wrong to state that a person is morally wrong if he seeks ways and means of avoiding tax payments.  A lot of the big taxpayers wish that the tax system was as simple for them as it is for the PAYE people who get their wages after tax has been deducted and have no worries about income tax later on.  It is important to stress here that it is not immoral for anyone to seek advice on tax avoidance. I believe in the Bible it is considered not to be a sin.  The Minister should give further serious consideration to the situation in which he is putting lawyers.  They are honest for the most part.  I do not think there is profession that is free of its rogues.  We have the good and the bad in every profession but in the main lawyers serve their clients well and they should be encouraged to do so by not divulging what is primarily a matter between the lawyer and his client.</P>

      <P>The difference of opinion between Members on this side of the House and the Minister seems to hinge on the belief on this side that different professional categories will be required to disclose information on behalf of their clients.  The Minister says they are not.  The Minister agrees with Deputy Colley that the battle will go on.  He said that Ministers for Finance come to this House annually and try to add to the number of means of closing loopholes.  That is correct and it is the function of the Minister on behalf of his financial and legal advisers in the Revenue Commissioners. On reading subsection (4) of section 59 of the 1974 Act it seems that the Minister is requiring professional organisations or people to provide information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister requires this, I believe that organisation will cease to carry out the function.  It is correct that the Commissioners have the power to require any person to disclose information regarding tax evasion but the <Col N="216" /> argument here is whether it is right for the Minister to give the power to require professional people to disclose information.  Deputy Colley's argument is that that is what is required here. Professional people have to retain the confidence of their clients.  In effect, if our argument is correct, the professional person, a solicitor or counsel, will have to say to the client: &ldquo;I do not want to know.&rdquo;  How can a solicitor who has traditionally acted on behalf of his client continue to do that if he also must act on behalf of the State? There is a conflict here which has not been resolved by the Minister.  He is acknowledging loopholes have to be closed and that he is justified in trying to do that from year to year as his predecessor did but he seems to be admitting also in his argument that in order to close the loopholes he is requiring people in a professional capacity to disclose information which is traditionally confidential.  If the Minister is not doing that, I do not see any fundamental argument against Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>
    <P>The power is with the Revenue Commissioners at any time to direct an individual or the responsible officer of any corporation to disclose the information they want.  Does the Minister not see a difference between a responsible officer or a person who is engaged in activities which the Revenue Commissioners wish to bring to an end and the person who is employed in a professional capacity, a solicitor, accountant or barrister, to advise an organisation, company or an individual?</P>

      <P>Deputy Brugha put his finger on the point I was trying to convey earlier when he said that this kind of section put professional advisers in the position that they just did not want to know.  That summarises the position.  The Minister should consider the consequences. What happens if the professional adviser does not want to know?  Where does the client go then?  The Minister is taking a shortsighted view of this.</P>
      <P>Earlier I suggested to the Minister that he should not equate evasion with avoidance but he went on to explain that that is precisely what it does.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that that is a most dangerous doctrine and he should disabuse himself of it quickly.  If we reached the stage where we do not distinguish between evasion and avoidance, in particular if the Minister for Finance does not, we will have reached a stage where somebody vested with authority by the people is trying to say that something which is a breach of the law is in exactly in the same category as something which is not.  If the Minister thinks this is high-faluting theorising I will give him an example which I hope will bring home to him that it is more than that.  The Minister recently indicated his intention of taking the EEC Regional Fund and using it in the Exchequer.  The Minister may be within the letter of the EEC directive in doing that but clearly he is in breach of the spirit.  I suggest to the Minister that that is a perfect analogy of the Minister engaging in avoidance, not evasion.</P>
      <P>If the Minister's theory is to be accepted, he should be treated as being in breach of the EEC directive because he is engaging in evasion.  I hope that example brings home to the Minister the dangers of the doctrine he is advancing; that it is the same whether one breaks the law or not if, in the view of the Minister for Finance, the things one is doing are equally reprehensible. It is true that some avoidance activities are reprehensible.  I have no doubt about that.  Nevertheless, to try to say that they are to be regarded and treated in the same way as matters which are in breach of the law is a most dangerous doctrine.  I would urge the Minister very strongly to get that idea out of his mind or we will run into a great deal more difficulty than we have in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a number of things he said the Minister suggested that there is nothing in this section that is not in accordance with the law as it has obtained.  I want to put to him that if this section did not exist the Revenue Commissioners could not, and would not, seek information from solicitors, for example, which they <Col N="218" /> now seek and obtain under this section. If that statement is true, then this section is not a restatement of the law.  As I said earlier, it is an encroachment on the existing privilege, a privilege which, as the Minister correctly pointed out, is one of the client, not of the solicitor.  If it is an encroachment, if it is being sought to be justified by the Minister on the grounds that it tackles tax avoidance&mdash;which, in his view, is the same as tax evasion; in other words, a breach of the law&mdash; then how on earth is there any basis for saying that that privilege has any right to existence at all?</P>
    <P>Logically, should it not be abolished rather than, as I indicated earlier, enable people who are guilty of crimes to be more easily and conveniently convicted by the State?  In fact, taking what appears to be the Minister's point of view, the existence of this privilege is unjustified socially in so far as it is a hindrance to the prosecution of offences and, in some cases, may indeed assist people in avoiding liability for their offences. That is the logic of what the Minister is saying.  That might appeal and make sense to a number of people who do not understand the implications and importance of the existence of the privilege.  But there is no such excuse for the Minister because he is, by training, a lawyer.  He knows just how important is that privilege to the rights of the citizen and the maintenance of democracy.  It extends to a far wider field than this Bill or any matter to do with the collection of taxes and the avoidance or even the evasion of taxes.  It is a much more fundamental matter than that and the Minister must know this.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disturbed to hear the Minister put forward the kinds of arguments he is putting forward to justify this.  It is one thing if the Minister says: &ldquo;Look, what is being done here is of minor importance&rdquo;, but if he tries to justify what is being done on the grounds that everybody has an obligation to assist in tackling avoidance of tax, then we are getting into much deeper water altogether. When the Minister adds to that some forms of avoidance which in his view <Col N="219" /> are exactly the same as evasion and are to be treated similarly, then the matter becomes more serious.  The implications of the Minister's thinking are extremely disturbing.  This seems to me to represent a total disregard of the rights of citizens.  One cannot justify ignoring the rights of citizens by saying: &ldquo;Look, we are dealing with people who are avoiding liability.&rdquo;  What the Minister is saying is that we are dealing with people who are acting in accordance with the law.  As he said, they may be bending the law.  They may be very clever and may have advisers who are very clever assisting them in doing this but, because what they are doing is reprehensible and, in the Minister's view is the equivalent of breaking the law, he is advising the doctrine that everybody has the obligation to get after these people irrespective of what that costs in the way of citizens' rights, in the way of the loss of the privilege attaching to the relationship between solicitor and client built up over centuries for the protection of the individual and the citizen.</P>
    <P>The Minister could not have thought out the implications of what he is saying or he would not have said what he did because from his own professional training he knows the importance of this matter.  I want to suggest again that the information, in the case of solicitors, which may be obtained under this section is that available otherwise to the Revenue Commissioners.  The actual information being obtained from solicitors under this is virtually useless to the Revenue Commissioners.  That is not the point.  The point is, if one can justify this encroachment on the grounds put forward by the Minister, then one can justify much greater encroachments on much more compelling grounds.  Once we start on that, there is no end to it.  The Minister cannot even justify it on the grounds of the necessity to obtain this information.</P>
    <P>Before the Revenue Commissioners would even seek to obtain such information from a particular solicitor they would have to have a particular client <Col N="220" /> in mind about whose activities they wanted information.  If they have that, they are going to get no information from the solicitor that is not available to them in other ways.  Yet, we have this serious encroachment, serious in its implications, being built into this section for purposes totally ineffective so far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned.</P>
    <P>In my view it is completely unjustified. As I indicated earlier, I am not tied to the wording of the amendment. The reason for the amendment is to try to indicate as clearly as we can that we do not support any action which is designed, for whatever reason, to erode the importance of this relationship to the citizen and to his rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this amendment and what Deputy Colley has said.  This amendment, in substance, is almost precisely the amendment which he and I had down to the Finance Bill last year, which in fact was never discussed by the House or taken because the whole second half of the Finance Bill was guillotined through by the Government without any discussion, coming up to the end of July, after there had been an abnormal delay in the publication of the Bill. It illustrates the danger of not discussing Bills of this nature adequately in the House because that section we sought to amend last year got through.  We are now, on this year's Bill, endeavouring to amend it by changing the wording, as has been suggested by Deputy Colley.  Unfortunately this is a Committee Stage of a particularly complicated Finance Bill.  It creates no public interest.  At the moment there is nobody in the Public Gallery.  There are probably one or two pressmen here.  As a general rule they do not report more than a few lines of what is said on the Committee Stage of a highly technical Bill, such as the annual Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out to anyone who might read the Official Report of this debate that the principle which Deputy Colley and this party are seeking not to establish but to uphold, is one of the most vital, fundamental principles that has run through our way of life, <Col N="221" /> not just since Independence but long before that.  It was recognised for centuries in the common law that there were certain people to whom ordinary citizens could go for advice and could open up their hearts about their problems and troubles.  The ordinary citizen had confidence that, come what may, whatever he said to his solicitor, barrister, confessor, doctor or anyone else in that position, that confidence would never be broken.</P>
    <P>Under a statute of the Oireachtas brought in last year by the Minister for Finance, that confidence and trust can no longer be regarded as being in accordance with the law.  If a solicitor, accountant or barrister does not disclose what was told to him privately on a totally privileged and confidential basis by his client, he will break the law.  Deputy Colley validly pointed out that this is simply a matter which is sought to be remedied in the eyes of the Minister by section 59 of the Finance Act, 1974.  This is simply a matter of tax avoidance.  It is regarded by the Minister as so serious from the point of the view of the State that he is prepared to force this House to legislate against the retention of that confidential and privileged relationship.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the House, and in particular to the Minister, that if he retains only one per cent of the liberal traditions on which he prided himself when he sat on this side of the House, to reflect on the significance of what was done in section 59.  If the State feels entitled to legislate away this confidentiality and privileged relationship in relation to a comparatively trivial thing like tax avoidance, <i>a fortiori</i> is not the State entitled to legislate it away in more important things, such as the crime of murder? If the police force have reason to suspect a certain individual of having committed a very serious crime, watches him, sees him approach a priest of his religion and discuss privately with the priest some matter, whether in the confessional or a situation that would be akin to it, is there not, on the basis of the Minister's argument, a greater justification for the police being given power to compel that priest to disclose what was said <Col N="222" /> to him than there is under section 59 to compel a solicitor to disclose information because the Revenue Commissioners suspect tax avoidance on the part of his client?  Murder is a far more serious matter than tax avoidance.  If the intervention of the State under section 59 is justified in relation to tax avoidance, can any of us say, if we agree with that, that it would be wrong to compel a priest, a solicitor, a doctor, or somebody who, in the course of his professional activity, learns something of relevance to a very serious matter?</P>
    <P>Can any doctor feel 100 per cent sure that if this Government forced through section 59 of the Finance Act, 1974, that the Minister for Health who is a member of the Government and presumably approves of this legislation, will not bring in comparable legislation to compel doctors to disclose certain facts which should be confidential between the patient and the doctor?  Is there any relationship left, after this principle is established, that can be regarded as safe, as sacred or as privileged?  The whole doctrine of a common law through the centuries preserved, often at great cost, the sanctity of a privileged relationship.  Section 59 of the 1974 Act destroyed that, and for the most trivial of reasons.  Therein lies the force of our argument.  If it is destroyed for a trivial thing like tax avoidance, surely one would be more justified in destroying it for more important things?</P>
    <P>On the benches opposite there is one person, the Minister for Finance.  He has 72 or 74 Deputies who support him.  We have rarely seen any of them. What we see now is the normal procedure in this House with this Government. I cannot talk to those Deputies. Perhaps if I could I might have some effect on some of them.  I can only talk to the Minister.  I can only remind him that when he sat on this side of the House we had long tirades from him about the protection of human rights, not alone in Ireland but in obscure countries all round the world.  Has he forgotten those days?  Has he forgotten the sentiments he expressed so eloquently and forcefully then?  Was that all a show or a charade?  Now that <Col N="223" /> he is in a position to do things and control matters, can he find nothing better to do but to destroy, at the request of the Revenue Commissioners, a privileged, deeply confidential relationship between solicitors and their clients?  Let him remember this: he is not doing any great harm to solicitors. All they have to do to comply with the law is to tell the Revenue Commissioners. The people being harmed are their clients and they are not all rich men.  Every client of every solicitor is potentially at risk now and not necessarily in relation to tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>But this principle having been established last year by default&mdash;because this House never approved of it; it was guillotined through&mdash;is it going to be continued?  We have come in here on Deputy Colley's amendment, the earliest opportunity we could get, which was the succeeding year's Finance Bill, to ask that what went through by default last year be taken out.  I cannot appeal to the empty benches I see opposite me.  I can appeal to only one individual, and I say to him that if he has even a fraction left of the sentiments he used to express on this side of the House, let him act on that fraction and accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>This law is not intended to deal with a mob, and it is not intended to deal either with the people described by Deputy O'Malley tuppeny-ha'penny tax avoiders.  We are dealing with tax evasion, an illegal activity.  Under the 1974 Act a person who has the benefit of assets which are transferred abroad is obliged to pay tax on them; prior to that, no, although it would appear that in any other country that I have had a look at, the Legislature has endeavoured long since to tax income from assets which were placed outside the domestic jurisdiction. However, for some reason we went from decade to decade allowing people to place their money abroad to <Col N="224" /> avoid paying tax here, but since last year they could do that no longer without committing a breach of the law. They would be evading tax.  There is wrong being done by any person who now fails to disclose his right to the benefit flowing from assets placed abroad.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has been very severe in his strictures on people who were not here during lunch time.  If he was here earlier, he would hear several arguments which I advanced against entertaining the amendment, including the one that section 59 of the 1974 Act contains privileges and exemptions which are enjoyed by the solicitors' profession and by nobody else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The obligation on solicitors is to furnish names and addresses.  If the people liable to pay the tax, if the people who have transferred assets abroad, discharge their obligations in the first instance by making the proper returns, there will be no question of having to obtain names and addresses from anybody else.  If they break the law and if other people have the information which would identify them, I cannot see that there is anything reprehensible or anti-liberal about it.  To my mind, the liberal ethic requires that one must not tolerate a situation in which certain people can get for themselves privileges that are not enjoyed by the masses.  There is no infringement of anybody's rights. There is a weapon to ensure that people discharge their duties, that and no more.</P>

      <P>I am quite certain. I was challenged because I enunciated views regarding some forms of avoidance.  It was suggested that I was saying something radical that had not been sufficiently thought over.  I would like to quote from an editorial in <i>The Times</i> of 1st April, 1938, which states as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A noble defender of the ethics of tax avoidance comes forward today in the person of the Provost of Eton.  No one will attribute to Lord Hugh Cecil an insensitive conscience, but when he writes that if the tax-avoider &ldquo;acts openly&rdquo; and above board, and clearly conforms to the law, I can see no reason why he should not do anything the law allows in order to lighten the load of taxes.  It may be that he uses the word &ldquo;law&rdquo; in an over-technical sense.  Law is the will of the people as expressed in Parliament; it is also the rules of conduct enforced by the courts. The two senses should coincide, but in practice they often diverge because Parliament has failed to express itself with sufficient accuracy or completeness.  The opportunity for legal tax evasion proceeds solely from this divergence and he who exploits it can only be defended on the ground that what is binding on the conscience of the good citizen is <Col N="226" /> not the well-recognised intention of the Legislature, but the technical imperfection with which it is expressed.</P>
    <P>There are some areas which so closely resemble evasion as not to deserve the impassioned moral defence that sometimes is advanced in their favour.  The fact that many of these practices are not defensible is recognised by the accountancy and legal professions themselves.  From time to time they suggest ways of avoiding tax, but they accompany their advice with a warning that a person who engages in a particular practice may well find the Legislature taking a different view of the legitimacy of the practice in which they are advised to engage.  Therefore, I do not think any practitioner or any parliamentarian could seriously challenge me when I say there is a grey area.</P>

However, if they come down from their moral high horse, I am sure they will endorse at least some of my remarks regarding the more reprehensible forms of avoidance activity. When one sees the wishes of the Legislature being frustrated, as a legislator, one must take steps to correct the situation and when one is giving power, as the Dáil and Seanad gave last year, to tax the profits on assets that are sent abroad, one must give power also to the Revenue Commissioners to enforce that law.  It is for the Revenue Commissioners to collect the taxes that the Legislature says should be collected.</P>

      <P>We have been invited to come down from our moral high horse.  At last the Minister has succeeded in convincing me that he is utterly amoral.  Why should we come down off our high horse?  This suggestion of the Minister is an admission on his part that he is being pragmatic and amoral in his approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am on a very important high horse.  The Minister will have no complaint with what <Col N="228" /> I said on an earlier section when dealing with certain principles in relation to my desire to help the Revenue Commissioners and the collecting authority but I am appalled that a Minister who, like two of his colleagues in this House, should appreciate the importance of what is involved, would take the casual, the amoral and the pragmatic attitude he has taken in this matter.  The Minister can hardly fail to appreciate the point I am making.  Therefore, in technical terms I must attribute to him, malice afore-thought. By a peculiar coincidence the people engaged in this debate so far are members of the legal profession, two of whom are practising.  As a barrister, I am a member of the other aspect of the profession although I have not practised for many years. Therefore, I should be absolved from any suspicion that I might be indulging in special pleading in an area of special interest.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Colley pointed out, there is a difference between the legitimate evasion of tax and criminal tax avoidance.  The Minister must appreciate that.  Secondly, the right of the Minister and the State to impose and collect tax rests solely on the statute, outside the legal content of which there is neither crime nor right.  That being so, the rest of the right is with the taxpayer and the State has no further right to interfere beyond the taxation rights conferred by statute.</P>
      <P>Surely, then, the citizen is entitled to seek legal advice and to try to ascertain his rights.  Furthermore, having ascertained his rights, he is entitled to act on them.  If a mistake is made&mdash;if he has overstepped the boundary where the State is concerned &mdash;the State has ample opportunity, much more than has the individual, for dealing with the case.  The first principle on which the privilege is grounded is that the citizen must have some protection against being penalised in the ascertaining of his rights and in protecting himself from an unreasonable infringement of his rights.  The question is whether a breach of this privilege is less important than the possible disability of the collecting authority of the State to get their facts easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> Deputy O'Malley has put the situation totally in perspective in this regard.  It is the whole tradition of our laws that a man is innocent until proven guilty.  The whole spirit of our law is that even the worst criminal is entitled to the best help he can get and there rests the privilege of solicitor and client in criminal matters. Extending that to civil rights, there has been the equal principle that a man as against the State should be in a position to preserve his rights as against the dominating power of the other side.  That was the whole spirit of <i>Magna Carta.</i>  The Minister will probably say that while he agrees with everything I say the position is that, in effect, a solicitor or the person concerned is an agent in the committing of the offence.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how you can escape the privilege without implying that the solicitor or the adviser involved is an accomplice.  If it is a question of fair enforcement and ascertaining of rights, if there is a doubt and if the solicitor or other adviser is in the clear himself, presumably he will not do anything that is a crime or even unlawful.  You can include penalties if you like for a solicitor who co-operates but you should go for the solicitor: do not go through the privilege.  You can only defend the section by going the whole way logically and what you are saying, in effect, is that the man is an accomplice. If you adhere to the principle that the citizen is entitled to certainty and enforcement of his rights in the law and that the State is only entitled to infringe his rights in law in accordance with the powers given by statute, the principle of privilege follows.  As Deputy O'Malley said, if it is to be breached for tax evasion&mdash;which he described as a most trivial purpose&mdash; what would happen in a serious case?</P>
    <P>I once took part in a murder defence case and I had some experience of how a matter of privilege could and did arise and the authorities on that occasion behaved with the utmost propriety.  But if we begin breaching the privilege that exists, on these grounds, we are opening a flood-gate as Deputy O'Malley said.  If the solicitor is acting <i>bona fide</i> professionally <Col N="230" /> or any other professional adviser is acting <i>bona fide</i> and doing it in accordance with professional etiquette and presumably is not breaking the law&mdash;if a solicitor makes a client commit a crime he is an accomplice&mdash;there is no defence for breaching the privilege.  Without going into the actual wording, the clauses in subsection (3) here are dangerous.  The Minister should really think again on this matter.  The fundamental mistake being made is trying to get at the client through the solicitor by breaching privilege when surely it is the business of the Revenue Commissioners, if they find the law against the client to get after the solicitor directly as an accomplice.</P>
    <P>I agree with everything Deputy Colley and Deputy O'Malley said but before leaving the question of the citizen's rights, it should be quite clear what his legitimate rights of action are. He should not be the butt.  The Minister is doing this in another Bill.  I know the Minister's line of thinking here: the onus of proof is being quietly completely shifted by the Minister in the whole financial code.  It is being done also in the Capital Gains Bill where the onus is being shifted from where it should lie&mdash;on the people enforcing the statute to ensure that they are within the terms of the statute and within their rights and proving that they are, if necessary&mdash;to the other side so that the State can do what it likes and it is up to the citizen to prove that the State is wrong.  That is what the Minister is doing, and in another Bill when he makes taxpayers assess themselves, that is what he is doing.</P>
    <P>The State is now being put in the position of the big bully and the ordinary taxpayer has to prove that the State is wrong with the whole probability being that the big fellow has all the advantages.  This is completely and absolutely foreign to the spirit of our law and I make no apology for being on a normal high horse in regard to this.</P>
    <P>I think this gallop will be halted in another way and I hope our judges will take note of what is developing now. When you breach a principle of such <Col N="231" /> a fundamental nature touching on the rights of the individual in the criminal and civil spheres you are getting very near fundamental rights and thereby coming very near constitutional issues. Up to this, because of the correct behaviour of Parliament and the Executive over 50 years, our Supreme Court has always taken a conservative view and as narrow a view as possible of its construction rights.  Beware that in a section like this you are not starting another process&mdash;one can thank God one has the Constitution&mdash;where the courts will do what the Supreme Court of the USA did and exercise its wider rights as the Judiciary and interpret its place in the Constitution as it is meant to be in principle as the guardian of the rights of both State and individual.</P>
    <P>This section and particularly this amendment touches an absolutely vital point.  Instead of helping law enforcement, instead of avoiding legal action, instead of bringing about harmony and preventing tax evasion, you may very well produce a situation where very restrictive elements may be introduced that may restrict this House as well as the Executive.  That may seem an alarmist statement but that situation can arise. I hope our judges take note of their power.  Sooner or later a case will be brought and I am glad our Supreme Court has a mind of its own, as we saw in some recent cases.  As sure as I am here, a case will arise where new principles will be developed and the Minister and his successors will rue the day that this approach was taken. He may call that a moral high horse but I stand on the principle.  I thank the Lord we have a Constitution and our Supreme Court to protect principles from amoral attitudes on ministerial benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can be as moral as the rest.  Perhaps it is because of the moral stand this Government have taken against tax evasion that they have come in for so much abuse.  I have heard against me all kinds of epithets, both colourful and doctrinal, which are not justified and which <Col N="232" /> history&mdash;which will speak more kindly &mdash;will not find merited either.</P>
      <P>I shall not endeavour to defend what was wrong by quoting another wrong because two wrongs do not make a right.  However, I should like to draw the attention of Deputy de Valera and others to section 176 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That section incorporated sections from the Acts of 1918, 1958 and 1963.  The 1967 Act was a codifying measure and Deputy de Valera was an active and useful member of the committee that prepared that Act for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only a consolidating committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am not saying he was a party to the decisions made but I suspect he voted with his feet in 1958 and 1963 for a section which is found in section 176 of the 1967 Act.  This section does not contain any savers whatever in regard to solicitors' privilege.  There are savers in the 1974 Act.  I wrote in special provisions which limited the information that could be sought from solicitors and, to that extent, I identified the privilege and respected the need to retain it.  Section 176 of the 1967 Act states:</P>
      <P>Every person who, in whatever capacity, is in receipt of any money or value, or of profits or gains arising from any of the sources mentioned in this Act, of or belonging to any other person who is chargeable in respect thereof, or who would be so chargeable if he were resident in the State and not an incapacitated person, shall, whenever required to do so by any general or particular notice, prepare and deliver, within the period mentioned in such notice, a list in the prescribed form, signed by him and containing (a) a statement of all such money, value, profits or gains; (b) the name and address of every person to whom the same shall belong; (c) a declaration whether every such person is of full age, or a married woman or is resident in the State or is an incapacitated person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> There is no question there of saying the solicitor would only give the name and address of persons to whom money is given.  The full value of the money had to be given.  It was an anti-avoidance measure to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners obtained particulars of income or money that people received in respect of activities within the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in respect of money received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Section 59 of the 1974 measure provides that where money is transferred abroad for the purpose of tax evasion or for the purpose of avoiding liability to tax, the name and address of the transferor or transferee be given.  It is not a terrible departure from section 176 of the 1967 Act, from section 66 of the 1958 Act or Part III of the 1963 Act except that I provide for limitation to the information that can be sought from solicitors.</P>
      <P>Words mentioned in the confessional box and the relationship between doctor and patient have been mentioned in the course of this debate. A certain parallel has been drawn between the criminal law and the tax law.  There are many aspects of the tax law that do not conform to the criminal law.  For instance, under criminal law every person is deemed innocent until proved guilty but under the tax law everyone is not deemed to be without income until the Revenue Commissioners are in a position to prove he has an income. If that were a principle of tax law the Revenue Commissioners could not issue assessment notices in advance of information received.  They would have to wait until they got information and I am sure every Member would be honest and pragmatic enough to admit the tax law would be wholly unworkable if that principle were introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was unfair to introduce elements in respect of criminal law and religious practices in the course of this debate or to suggest that what we did in the 1974 Act was the thin end of the wedge that will be tapped <Col N="234" /> further and further until more fundamental principles of human liberty or of religious convictions are offended.  It may be a good debating point to suggest this but it is unreal. We are simply providing the Revenue Commissioners with the weapon necessary to collect the tax that the Legislature, in its wisdom or otherwise, says should be paid.  It is no more and no less.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made some interesting points and, for the second time, I have to thank him for giving me my most cogent argument.  The section he has accused me of voting for states &ldquo;...every person in whatever capacity...&rdquo;.  It says nothing about solicitors or clients.  It is for the courts to interpret what the content is.  The only intent of Parliament that is taken cognisance of is the court's interpretation how far it goes.  Otherwise we would not have the provisions of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would go so far as to say that if the Minister is to stand on this section it should be enough for him to do so on his own argument and that he would not need to bring in a specific section to try to capture lawyers and so on.  &ldquo;Every person&rdquo; should be sufficient.  The courts would be careful to distinguish such socially and legally important principles in the relationship between solicitors and clients.  What the Minister <Col N="235" /> has thrown back at me does not answer one point.  By giving me this section he enables me to make the point as to why he did not take the simple course.  The answer is that it is not sufficient and that the Minister had to go specifically after the solicitor-client relationship to try to enforce his line of approach here.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in the contest of debate we all are somewhat over-emphatic and extravagant of phrase and when the Minister talked about moral high horses I was quick enough to come back at him but I was careful to attach my remarks to the office rather than to the man.</P>
    <P>In relation to this section, why not have it tested?  Sooner or later it will be tested.  Sooner or later issues of this kind will go to the Supreme Court and it is a good thing that what we say in Parliament will not be evidence of intent or of the slightest use in the courts.  I hope there will not be a Bill brought in to bring me before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to impeach me before the House for advocating tax evasion because it is a good thing that our ideas on this should be fully ventilated. As Deputies O'Malley and Colley have said, one of the objectionable features about the way the section went into the Bill this year is that it went undebated last year and that justifies the debate on this section now.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to take all this in the spirit in which it is given.  I do not think he or the authorities concerned can complain about our anxiety to assist the Revenue Commissioners in the use of their functions.  Deputy Colley, as a predecessor of the Minister, cannot but share his concern to get after tax evasion, mainly because it places an undue burden on the remaining honest sector of the community but also because of the cost to the Exchequer. All these things are equally valid.  However, I do not think this will be of much use in getting after evaders.  I would ask the Minister to restore fully the privilege I tried to <Col N="236" /> trace earlier and I suggest there should be a trial before a morass is created in this area because I have a feeling that sooner or later some cases will come before the courts and there might be very peculiar results.  I say that this is a step towards initiating a situation which I should not like to see develop, namely, that the Legislature in its anxiety to support the Executive would be compelled by the Supreme Court to undo it because of inroads on fundamental human rights.  That statement may appear to be extravagant but any of us who are lawyers, and the Minister himself, will know that the matter of privilege between solicitor and client is not by any means a trivial thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>We contend that section 59 requires persons engaged in a professional capacity in advising clients to reveal information concerning clients and thereby to break confidentiality. That is part of the structure of the relationship between solicitors, accountants and their clients.  The Minister earlier denied this was the effect of the section but later he said that persons should not be allowed to protect what he called evasion.</P>
      <P>I said earlier that the Revenue Commissioners have the power to direct any persons engaged in evasion of tax, whether he be a representative of a company or an individual, to provide whatever information the commissioners require.  We contend that a totally different issue is involved here and that is that a person employed in a professional capacity would be required to disclose information about his clients.  That seems to be a fundamental issue.  It has been covered amply by Deputy de Valera and other speakers.  The Minister has not yet satisfied me that this section does not require that of persons engaged in a professional capacity.  If it does not require it then there is nothing wrong with the amendment.  If it does require it, that should be disclosed.  The Opposition maintain that it does require it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us any information in regard to how <Col N="237" /> this section has operated since it was enacted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has only been enacted since last year.  I understand that a number of facts have come to light which would warrant the use of this section but it has not yet been used.  It took some time also to put into effect section 176 of the 1967 Act.  We have, of course, ample experience of how it has been used and challenged unsuccessfully across the water.  Deputy de Valera suggested that section 176 of the 1967 Act was unimpeachable because it did not mention solicitors whereas the 1974 Act did mention solicitors.  The 1974 Act mentions solicitors only to restrict the information which can be obtained from solicitors.  There is no restriction in the 1967 Act but there is a specific limitation on the information which can be obtained in the 1974 Act.</P>
      <P>It was not possible in the 1974 Act to spell out the several different types of situations which can be developed to engage in tax avoidance by transferring assets abroad so the information which the Revenue Commissioners are authorised to get is such as they think necessary for the purpose of determining whether or not funds have been sent abroad with a view to avoiding liability to tax. Having said that it then puts a limit on the information which a solicitor may be required to give.  There is much emotive comment about the fact that solicitors are mentioned, but people overlook the fact that they are mentioned in order to put a restriction on the information which can be sought and the information which must be furnished is only such as would enable the Revenue Commissioners to proceed to contact persons who <i>prima facie</i> are liable, people who under the law have an obligation to furnish the information in the first instance themselves.  That is not a horrific provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has now been fully ventilated.  I can express considerable sympathy and understanding with the various views that have been expressed here today.  No doubt we will be strengthened by this ventilation of <Col N="238" /> views.  If any person feels aggrieved because of the use of the section if and when it is applied he will have his remedy.  I personally would not feel any sense of disappointment if the courts took a view different from that taken by the Legislature as to the appropriateness and constitutionality of this section.  I accept that they are there as defenders of the liberty of the people.  I do not think that absolves us from the obligation of looking upon every piece of draft legislation to ensure that it does not offend against basic principles.  In the light of the 1958, 1963 and 1967 legislation which contains no safeguards so far as solicitors are concerned, we are entitled to say that this weapon is a very necessary one in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners and that it contains the protections which are necessary to ensure confidentiality of relationship between solicitors and their clients.  I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The question was raised by Deputy de Valera and in his temporary absence I was merely pointing out what I understood to be his case.  It seems to me that there is a major distinction between the 1967 Act and this provision in that the 1967 Act is dealing with a case where a person is in receipt of money. That does not arise at all in the section we are dealing with.  It seems to me that that constitutes quite a difference in the approach to the matter.  If the Minister is contending that this subsection which refers to solicitors was introduced in ease of solicitors, he is implying in that that if that subsection had not been brought in a client's privilege in consulting a solicitor would have been totally taken away.  Is that a reasonable interpretation of what the Minister said, that without subsection (3) the privilege would have gone completely?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is not correct, as I understand it.  It provides that a solicitor shall not be deemed for the purposes of paragraph (c) of subsection (2) thereof to have taken part in a transaction by reason only that he has given professional advice. That is the exclusion in relation to professional advice.  He is not deemed to have taken part in the transaction. Subsection (3), which is the one we are concerned with here, includes him if he has given advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister saying that if subsection (3) were not there the privilege of a solicitor and client relationship would have disappeared completely in so far as it related to any transactions, or advice in relation <Col N="240" /> to transactions, which could have been affected by sections 57, 58 and 60?</P>

      <P>It was debated at length in the other House and the matter was also aired in the newspapers. It has been fully debated last year and this year and, no doubt, we are all the wiser for having heard each other's views.  While respecting the right of Deputies, and having enjoyed the debate myself, we might move on to deal with the Finance Bill, 1975, rather than pursuing this matter.  I have discussed the merits of every argument put up by the Opposition and I think they are pretty well exhausted by now.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the Minister.  I would have thought that by now the Fianna Fáil Party would have seen how flimsy are the very exclusive and special pleadings they have been making here.  I have to declare my income to the Revenue Commissioners.  Three-quarters of a million workers have to declare their incomes, wages and salaries to the Revenue Commissioners.  We know the all-pervasive powers of the Revenue Commissioners to obtain such information from employers.  It strikes a rather hollow note to hear the Fianna Fáil Party claiming virtually absolute privilege for the special relationship between the client and solicitor.</P>

      <P>There is a certain element of hypocrisy in the approach by the Fianna Fáil Party to this section. I wish Deputy Colley would go out to what will be the new Clontarf constituency where he intends to stand and meet an audience of professional workers, public servants, wage and salary earners, and the whole host of people who must fill in their forms without the aid of solicitors and who must declare to the Revenue Commissioners all their income and earnings and who are obliged to pay tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that Deputy Colley would not be very wise in pressing this too publicly because, the more the public become aware of the exigency of this special relationship, particularly in relation to tax avoidance, the more acutely they will become aware of the double standards being applied by Fianna Fáil.  The Minister is perfectly right in having this in the Bill.  I do not think Deputy Colley is doing much good to his party, as a broadly based political party, in advancing that kind of special plea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the use of the words &ldquo;any person&rdquo; is not sufficient to capture it and the Minister is assuming that it is.  I say that if the matter were tested that would not be broad enough.  The Minister probably realised that possibility and solved this problem by assuming the general phrase removes the privilege and this writes back in three-quarters or most of the privilege and puts in a saver.  That is really what happened and that is really what the Minister is basing his case on.  As I say, this may provoke a chain reaction.  As well as that, the fundamental assumption that underlines that privilege is not valid.  For these reasons, apart from the other cogent reasons in relation to the section, we think it would be much better the other way, especially if it is a question of someone being an accomplice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a different approach.  I am talking now about those who participated in the debate and who knew what they were talking about.  There was, I think, an inversion in the approach but it does not get over the fundamental point made earlier and what the consequences may be even from the point of view of revenue collection.  Everybody is with the <Col N="244" /> Minister in seeking to have fair tax enforcement and not tax evasion.  The question is will the section do what it purports to do, if it is tested?  Will the consequences of the section being there be worth the disadvantages entailed? I referred earlier to the possibility from the point of view of fiscal policy generally of the desirability of this but, in the last analysis, it is a question as to whether the courts will take one view or the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made it clear that he will not accept this amendment and there is no point, therefore, in delaying the House any further.  I hope Deputy Barry Desmond's constituents in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will have noted his total opposition to the rights of citizens, in particular the rights of citizens to consult their solicitors without the State moving in to find out precisely what was discussed.  He told us he had listened to the debate.  Had he not told us that there might be some excuse, but he knows precisely what is involved here and his support for the section and opposition to the amendment means that he is supporting the first steps on the slippery slope at the bottom of which no citizen will have the right to consult a solicitor about any matter confidentially without the solicitor being obliged to disclose it to the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot get out of it like that.  He heard the debate and the attacked the privilege because he thought it was a solicitor's privilege.  It is, in fact, the privilege of the client, the privilege of his constituent, and he is trying to take it away.  He is welcome to do that if that is what he wants to do.  We do not agree with him.  We think every citizen is entitled to this protection <Col N="245" /> and we are doing our part to give that protection to him.</P>

      <P>I knew Deputy Colley as a young man in charge of joint labour committees in the Labour Court.  He was chairman of committees like the flour-milling committee.  He was an up and coming young man in the Fianna Fáil Party arguing for clean public life and clean open Government.  He tried to create that image in the early sixties.  I am sure he would not support the view that a constituent of mine or his should have the right to go into a solicitor and set out in a privileged position to evade tax obligations.  It is <Col N="246" /> to prevent evasion that this section is designed and the Government have set out to ensure here that essential information required by the Revenue Commissioners must be forthcoming. Deputy O'Malley reacts hysterically and undemocratically to this; he said he would never obey the law in relation to these provisions.  Deputy Colley knows my views and the views of the Government.  I would dearly love to hear him arguing, as he did here, before the cumann out in Donnycarney; he would have his ears pinned back by the wage and salary earners who cannot understand why they cannot get away with a few quid.  They have to pay through the nose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that a large portion of the recent increase in the price of milk delivered to creameries is not being passed on to the producer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent revision of EEC price supports for agricultural products included increases in the Community's intervention prices for butter and skim milk powder.  These increases in intervention prices caused corresponding increases in the returns available to sellers of dairy products on wholesale markets, who of course are normally either the manufacturers of such products or marketing bodies operating on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manufacturers of dairy products in this country are mainly co-operative societies of dairy farmers.  They pay for their milk supplies out of their receipts from the sale of the products which they manufacture, after deduction of operating costs and other charges.  I understand that, in the light of substantial increases in their operating costs in recent times, they maintain that they cannot afford to pass on to their milk suppliers all or nearly <Col N="254" /> all of the increase in market returns that has now become available to them.</P>
    <P>I have no control over the price payable for creamery milk supplies and I cannot intervene in the matter.  However since most of the manufacturers concerned are controlled by the creamery milk suppliers, it should be possible for them to reach agreement on an equitable sharing of the price increase as between the manufacturers and the milk producers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a fraction only of the increase has reached the farmers?  Is the Minister further aware that what he has just said is not of much satisfaction to farmers who had been expecting a large increase this year?  Is the Minister aware also that they had been informed, through the various farming papers and organisations, that they would be getting 32p and 33p per gallon for their milk delivered to the creameries?  Is the Minister now aware that they will be very lucky if they get 30p per gallon, which is what really matters?  The Minister should have some power to investigate what happens down along the line.  Might I ask the Minister to take that power into his hands and not wash his hands of the matter because the producers are depending on him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fall during the last three months in the level of prices for feed grain imports into the Community, while resulting in import levies, has also resulted in the grant of mitigating accession compensatory amounts in respect of feed grain imported into Ireland and the United Kingdom.  This advantage as compared with the other member states falls to be offset in respect of pigmeat exports by the charging of accession compensatory amounts from the 1st May. However, since the United Kingdom accession compensatory amounts on feed grain are larger than ours, there is a net grant of accession compensatory amounts on imports of Irish pigmeat into the United Kingdom, giving a payment to us of £14.29 per ton in terms of bacon from 1st May as compared with nil at present.  But the full United Kingdom accession compensatory amounts are payable on <Col N="258" /> pigmeat imports from other supplying countries who are not subject to the export charging of accession compensatory amounts that Ireland is, due to our more favourable feed grain imports levy position than the original Community member states.  I have been questioning aspects of the change from 1st May as applying in particular to third countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, in the light of the large number of quality Irish applications to the FEOGA fund, he will secure a much increased national allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have on a number of occasions made representations to the EEC Commission about this country's participation in the FEOGA projects scheme and, in particular, about Ireland's share of the funds available for the provision of grant aid.  Detailed submissions have been presented to the Commission making a case for a higher allocation of funds for Irish projects.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, however, that as the funds available to the Commission for the scheme are limited they are not sufficient to meet the demands of the various member states.  Applications to the Commission are considered on their merits and it a matter solely for them to decide which projects are to be assisted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the reply, all the cases are supposed to be treated on their merits.  That is all I can say at this time, but looking at the allocations it would appear as if there is another element which comes very strongly into it, who pays the bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>For instance, Germany are continually reminding us they are paying 33 per cent of the total cost and they get 23.1 per cent of these grants.  We get 4.1 per cent. These are some indications.  The UK get 11.8 per cent, which looks low for them by comparison even with us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister examined over the past ten years the allocations to member states and does he not realise that the allocations have not varied at all, which would strongly suggest that allocations are strictly on a national quota basis?

Landings for nearly all species of seafish increased in 1974 compared with 1972 but these were more than offset by a fall in herring landings which dropped from nearly 48,000 to 39,000 metric tons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a measure would require legislation.  In May, 1971, an application was made by one county committee of agriculture, which adopted a resolution that in the mari-time counties the committees of agriculture <Col N="270" /> be designated county committees of agriculture and fisheries for the purpose of assuming responsibility for the interests of the fishing industry as well as those of the agricultural industry.  The implementation of that proposal would have required amending legislation.  The Department replied in July, 1971, to the Waterford County Committee of Agriculture to the effect that the Department's Fisheries Division and BIM were charged with the responsibility of taking care of the sea fishing industry and that the designation of county committees of agriculture as suggested was not considered necessary.  No further action has been taken since in relation to this matter.  The Kerry county development scheme set up a body recently to be known as the Kerry County Committee of Fisheries.  Their work could be useful but they would be acting merely in an advisory capacity.</P>

      <P>Since Ireland's accession to the European Economic Community all quantitative restrictions on fish imports have been removed and the only import licences now required, apart from the needs of health control, are for the management of the duty-free and reduced-duty concessions provided under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement for the import annually of 2,000 cwt of fish, 9,000 cwt of fish fingers and of other prepared fish products to a value of £6,000.</P>

That speech and sentiment was probably true for the most part but since then and since the amendments to the agreement we are discussing were initialled in October and November, 1974, there has been a major change in the United States policy in relation to oil and in relation to the sentiments expressed by Dr. Kissinger last November in Chicago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> These are of great significance because the sentiments of the United States at the time of the original signing of the agreement may not have been totally in conflict with our interests and with our sentiments.  It appears that since this agreement was originally signed and its amended form signed on behalf of the Government, the United States has changed the rules and we are now being asked to approve an agreement that is significantly different.  At least the circumstances are so significantly different that its meaning and effect will be different from what was originally intended.</P>
    <P>When dealing with details of the agreement I shall say something about the voting system that is proposed to be established in this authority.  The voting system is such that it is totally weighted in favour of the United States and its interests.  An example of this is that as the agreement stood when it was signed at Brussels on 13th November, 1974, there were what were described as 100 oil-consumption voting weights distributed between the various countries who were then part of the agreement.  The United States has 48&mdash;in other words it has 48 per cent of the muscle straightaway and if anyone else goes with the United States it has almost control.  The extraordinary situation is that Ireland under that heading has no votes at all. The only other country with no votes, because like ourselves it was considered of no significance, was Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>When we see the total dominance of the United States in the context of this agreement we must consider the current United States policy.  They have changed ground since the November, 1974, policy.</P>
    <P>The present proposal of the USA Government is to put a 3 dollar-per-barrel tariff on imported oil from OPEC.  Their second proposal is to remove price ceilings on domestic US oil so that it will climb to the level of imported oil.  Thirdly, they are now endeavouring to negotiate a floor price which is not much below the present level.  Furthermore, they incorporated in that floor price for oil a built-in <Col N="286" /> escalating clause to cover world industrial inflation.</P>
    <P>The current proposals of the US Government in relation to this agency, which is virtually controlled by the US, can be summed up as being proposals which in each instance suited the interests of the multi-national oil companies, and I do not think it is unfair, as has been suggested by Deputy Barrett and others, to say that the interests of the multi-national oil corporations and of the USA and their policy in relation to oil are almost synonomous.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, putting ourselves in a situation that we are going into an authority controlled by America whose policy, in turn, is identical with that of the multi-national oil corporations whose activities we have had so much reason to resent in this country and others in recent years.  It is no wonder that the public are confused. First of all, the US Government said that high prices are intolerable and then a few months later their objective seems to be actually to make them higher in the US and to stop them from falling in Europe.</P>
    <P>The agreement we are now being asked to endorse has been formulated under the influence of the USA whose so-called energy policy is completely muddled with contradictions as between what they are now seeking to achieve and the principles which they propounded through the Secretary of State in Chicago last November.  Participation in the EEC and the OECD should not diminish our traditional aspiration with regard to non-alignment with power blocs.  We now enjoy international acceptability and credibility with regard to neutrality and independence not disimilar to the countries traditionally regarded as bases for international aid, such as Sweden and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>We ask the Government here, before finally committing us to this agreement, to look at the circumstances which would bring the agreement into effect.  The greatest single possibility of its being brought into full effect would be consequent on OPEC retaliation to political provocation <Col N="287" /> initiated in the turbulent mess of Middle East politics, or because OPEC retaliated against an authority such as this which they would rightly feel had been set up as an authority in some way in direct confrontation with OPEC's best interests.</P>
    <P>These are the obvious circumstances in which this agreement would operate and we should clearly recognise that. If we do, we must appreciate that we are being drawn into an area which is fraught with danger.  We will be labelled because of our association with this authority and because of our association with those who dominate and control the authority.  No case has been made from the Government side, as far as we can see, to show why it is essential that we should ratify this agreement and become part of this new proposed energy authority.</P>
    <P>All the evidence in the past 18 months causes us and many other people to have the gravest reservations with regard to any proposals related to oil or energy which emanate from the Government.  I would suggest to the Government that there is a strong case for us now to give serious consideration not to join this proposed authority to which we are provisionally committed but to stay away from it and, as our own resources become developed, to consider joining OPEC.</P>
    <P>We now know we own a substantial gas field.  The indications are that this country now has under its control a certain amount of oil.  We do not know yet whether the amount will be sufficiently large to make it a worthwhile commercial find but the indications are that that may well be so. The fact that we are certain we have a substantial gas find and that it is likely we have a worthwhile oil find is of tremendous benefit to this country.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke on this the other day he saw fit to criticise the arrangements which put us into this situation of having oil and gas fields developed within the jurisdiction of the Government. For many years he and others, by innuendo and otherwise, suggested that while Fianna Fáil were <Col N="288" /> in Government after the last Coalition debacle in the 1950s they made a bad arrangement.  But we are now in the situation that this same agreement which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others criticise actually qualified us for entry into the OPEC group.  It has given us the means, without any cost to this nation, by which we can prove to the world that we have under our jurisdiction an energy source and this has created the widest possible interest among those who have the financial resources and expertise to prove and develop the extent of the oil and gas within our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we should now begin to identify ourselves as a producer nation.  We should now be formulating an intermediate energy policy until we extend our area of known deposits and get them into production.</P>

      <P>The agreement which was made at the end of 1958 and beginning of 1959 with Ambassador Oil was at that time a considerable step into the unknown.  It had then, and it still has, great implications. It would be no harm to remind ourselves of the atmosphere in which that agreement was subsequently ratified by the Oireachtas in the Petroleum Development Bill, 1959, which was passed in the Seanad in early 1960 and became the Petroleum Development Act, 1960.  The agreement had been negotiated by the late Deputy Seán Lemass at the end of 1958 and the beginning of 1959, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He became Taoiseach in June, 1959, and the Bill to ratify the agreement and to establish the various conditions in relation to exploration and mining for oil was introduced in this House by Deputy Jack Lynch, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch said that this agreement had been made, that it had already been laid before the House and that it did not seem to the Government that there was any great <Col N="289" /> likelihood of petrol or oil being found, that they had been so advised but that nonetheless, as this company wanted to explore for it and as they were prepared to pay a large sum of money to do so, $5 million, that the Government could see no objection to allowing them to do so.</P>
    <P>That was the general atmosphere during the debate and it is perhaps brought out best by what the late Deputy William Norton, who was then the Leader of the Labour Party, had to say when he spoke first for the Labour Party on it.  I shall quote the first paragraph of what he had to say from column 825 of Volume 177 of the Official Report.  He said:</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as, I think, will Deputies in all parts of the House, but I think it should be approached in a sober and very reasoned way.  Nobody from a hurried reading of tomorrow morning's papers should get the impression that we will have gushers in stream next month or that the danger is that petrol will be flowing over all the main roads in the country within the next 12 months.  However, if we recognise at the outset that this is really a shot in the dark, that this is a highly speculative project, that it represents an effort to discover oil where our own State geologist says that, in his opinion, there is no oil, then we get a more sober and realistic approach to the possibilities in this respect.</P>
    <P>That is representative of the general approach of the various Deputies who spoke in that debate.  Deputy Norton was preceded by the late General Mulcahy who devoted almost all his speech to a criticism of the provision in the Bill whereby farmers would be compensated by people drilling for oil for damage that would be done to the surface of their lands and to their crops.  If, Sir, you read the Committee Stage debate, which follows in Volume 178 and which took place during the months of November and December, 1959, you find that the great bulk of that debate was confined to the topic to which General Mulcahy kept referring, namely, the question <Col N="290" /> of compensating farmers for damage to their land.  There was practically no discussion whatever of the principle underlying the Bill or of the principle underlying the agreement with Ambassador Oil, which appeared to have been totally accepted by everyone on all sides of the House at that time and recognised for what it was&mdash; an effort, in the words of a subsequent speaker, by an American firm to come in here to find oil when everyone knew perfectly well that there was no oil but since they were going to spend $5 million here we could not but benefit by it but, of course, everyone knew they would get nothing, so if they were so foolish let them on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of this agreement and of the Bill ratifying it and establishing the principles on which oil exploration be carried out was accepted at the time by everybody.</P>
      <P>So far as the late Deputy Seán Lemass is concerned, instead of his now being criticised for having come to that agreement with Ambassador Oil in 1958, it must be regarded almost in the same way as his other great achievements like Shannon Airport and the Shannon industrial zone, as a tremendous achievement for this country because by virtue of that agreement we now know that we have within our jurisdiction oil and gas, certainly gas in commercial quantities and hopefully oil in commercial quantities.  At the latest count some few months ago I understand there were 93 separate companies queued up trying to get from the Minister for Industry and Commerce exclusive exploration licences, 93 companies who want to come in here and arrangements can be made with all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The degree of ignorance in relation to the possibilities of oil and gas at that time is best illustrated when one examines the emphasis in these debates entirely on exploration on land. Off-shore implications were barely referred  <Col N="291" /> to in passing at one passage of the Committee Stage debate.  Subsequently there were protocols which accepted the principle that for minerals and oil the boundaries of the nation extended beyond the traditional landmarks which remained above sea level and right out into the depths of the sea over submerged continental shelves.  This agreement with Ambassador, subsequently taken over by Marathon, having regard to every circumstance, was not then and is certainly not now the give-away that is constantly alleged.</P>

      <P>It will give us, without any risk, a much greater monetary return without any loss of credibility in so far as investor confidence is concerned than all the gimmicky public relations exercises performed by the Government in their negotiations with Tara Mines.  The sums are simple and I will give an example at current day prices of what we stand to gain. We have a right to a production royalty which, if oil were extracted tomorrow&mdash;I am taking the current international price of $14.50 per barrel &mdash;of $1.81 per barrel without risk at royalty rate of 12½ per cent on production values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these matters seem to be entirely overlooked by people.  They seem to think some agreement was made for the magic sum, which is always mentioned, of £500 with Marathon. From my reading of the agreement £500 is on the grant of an exploration licence.  It is more in the nature of stamp duty on a deed than anything else.  The real payments do <Col N="292" /> not arise until such time as mining licences or mining leases for oil are brought into effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Do that.  We are also entitled to 40 per cent of the net profits under this agreement after giving credit for the royalties.  It is an important proviso in the agreement as I understand it&mdash;it is a little difficult at one point to be quite clear on it&mdash;that if the production royalties exceed 40 per cent of the net profit, we are entitled to insist on the payment of the production royalties anyway. It is even stated in the agreement that, if the company are operating at a financial loss, we are still entitled to our royalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the present posted price of crude oil per barrel at $14.50, our royalties at 12½ per cent are $1.81. The realisable price at the moment at the well head for crude oil is $9 a barrel.  The projected average North Sea production cost per barrel of crude oil is $5.  The Arabian cost is a little over 10 cents but that would not be relevant to our conditions which would be closest to the North Sea conditions.  Therefore, the total payment by the company to get a barrel of crude oil out of the sea south of Ireland would be $6.81 assuming current prices held.  They can sell it at $9 which gives them a gross profit before they pay any expenses of $2.19 a barrel of crude oil.  Their expenses are difficult to estimate and it is difficult to arrive at their net profits because they depend on a number of factors of which we have no knowledge yet.  Taking their gross profit at <Col N="293" /> $2.19 and taking the State's share at $1.81, by taking our production royalties, we have an income of about 45 per cent of the total income out of each barrel of crude oil.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to Tara Mines. This party suggested very strongly that, in relation to that mine, or any other mining, or oil producing, or gas producing proposal, that it is very foolish for the Government of a country like this not to insist on a production royalty because, with a production royalty, you get paid for every ton, or barrel, or whatever the quantity might be, of gas or oil or minerals.  Whether the company are operating at a big profit or a big loss, or just ticking over, the State will get the same.  The State is at no risk.  It has no worries.  It simply has to collect the cash.</P>
    <P>That was the arrangement made by the late Deputy Seán Lemass in 1959.  It is a very good one.  It has suited us that prices have risen so much since because our royalties can be correspondingly higher.  The decision which faced the late Deputy Lemass and the Government and the country at the time was that we were told on the highest authority available &mdash;by the State geologists and various other geologists&mdash;that there was no oil in this country.  The company, Ambassador Oil, came from America and said: &ldquo;There is just an off chance that there is oil and we would like to have the chance to search for it. We are prepared to expend $5,000,000 in Ireland.&rdquo;  The Government decided this was a free way of getting the possibilities of Irish oil and gas reserves discovered, that it was a very efficient way of doing it, and that a lot of money would be poured into our economy as a result even if nothing was found.  Of course they realised there would be inestimable benefits to our economy if anything were found.</P>
    <P>Happily the late Deputy Lemass was proved right.  Gas has been found in substantial quantities and oil in promising quantities.  There are 93 companies waiting to move in.  If ever there was justification for the foresight of that man it is to be found <Col N="294" /> in what he did in 1958-59 in this regard.  This suggestion about throwing our resources away and all the rest of it is totally at variance with the facts.  I understand that Deputy Desmond has gone off to read the agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said a moment ago that it was Marathon who had the foresight and that the late Deputy Lemass did not believe there was oil there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Marathon said there was a chance.  Deputy Lemass was advised that there was none, but he let them in and told them they could go ahead.  It would not cost the Irish people anything.  In fact, they got $5,000,000 invested here which would not otherwise have been invested here. We now have all the benefits of having found oil and gas.  How Deputy Lemass or the Government of the day could be criticised for having brought about the situation we are happy to be in today, I do not know. Surely this was the greatest time for them to be found when the price of oil from the Arab countries went up by 300 per cent or more.</P>
      <P>I want to come back now to the agreement and to examine the assumptions arising from the effects of energy conservation and the contradictions which I pointed out in US energy policies which, because of the weight of voting, make US policies synonymous with the energy sharing committee policies.  First, I do not think anybody can quantify precisely what reduction in consumption will occur because of the tariff impositions in the United States, or say that US domestic producers encouraged by higher prices will produce more oil from American sources.  Most experts seem to agree that there is little chance of a significant increase in domestic US production, which has been declining for years. Despite the doubling in the price of US domestic oil, from $5.50 to $11 a barrel for oil from new wells, production fell by 600,000 barrels a day last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, tariffs on OPEC oil will not affect OPEC.  They have a capacity of nearly 40 million barrels a day. They have already reduced production <Col N="295" /> by 25 per cent in order to hold up prices and they seem capable of winning any price battle with the benefits of their financial resources and their limited home demands for oil.  The suggestion that higher prices will reduce demand might well be valid, but it is also ammunition for the OPEC countries who also have access to the statistics which our Minister for Finance said our creditors watched, when he failed to fool us as to the reasons for his infamous 15p rise in the price of petrol in December last.</P>
    <P>The OPEC countries see the resources accruing to consumer treasuries from taxes levied on petroleum products, and OPEC countries are very easily tempted to ask for a price which the product will apparently bear in the way of cost to the consumer.  With petrol at 71p per gallon the great bulk of that 71p is duty accruing to the Exchequer.  With all the criticism of them for raising prices, the Arabs get only a small proportion of that.  About 60 per cent goes to the Exchequer and one-third approximately to everyone else. That, of course, includes the profits of the multi-nationals.  The Arabs have considerably less than one-third.  If the Arabs see this vastly inflated price being paid for oil products, and particularly petrol, in Ireland and in every European country, are they not entitled to say: &ldquo;Why should the Minister for Finance of Ireland, or Britain, or Finance, or anywhere else get four or five times more out of a gallon of petrol than we, the owners and producers, get?&rdquo;  Is there not a great temptation for the Arabs to say: &ldquo;O.K. We will retail petrol at 71p a gallon and let the Minister for Finance battle on as best he can.  They have to have petrol.  If the Minister for Finance is going to tax it to that extent why should we not get some of the benefit? Why should we be confined to perhaps a quarter, or less, of the price the consumer is paying?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We should bear these factors in mind and give up the foolish approach which is part and parcel of this agreement. We would save ourselves a great deal of trouble by doing so and save <Col N="296" /> ourselves also getting into a number of unsavoury associations.  If this country has to get into union with any of these aligned power groups and if we have to talk to someone, I suggest the one to talk to and the one to consider is the OPEC group because it is in that group our future interests as a producing country will lie.  There are several non-Arab countries, as the Minister knows, in OPEC and there is no reason why we, as a country about to go into production, should not think in the same way as Venezuela and Nigeria and a number of others have done.  Unfortunately, I suppose very few of us have read the agreement in its entirely.  I have read three-quarters of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not want to go over the ground Deputy O'Kennedy covered, but I believe he is right.  I read the bits of the agreement to which he specifically referred.  There are substantial provisions here and there which are utterly meaningless or could mean any of three or four things.  This is a solemn, international agreement meant to bind us solemnly, but there is no one here who could say what various aspects of it mean.  My fear is that, because of the way this whole energy authority, or whatever they call themselves, is set up any ambiguity or doubt will be given whatever meaning the United States interests, as I have pointed out, are synonomous with multi-national oil corporation interests.  This is a highly dangerous situation.  We are now going in with these various companies under the umbrella of the United States.  We will be totally subservient.  I do not want to appear critical of the United States; I am very conscious of what they have done over the last 50 years to preserve democracy and freedom.  They have made many sacrifices and been very generous in those sacrifices.</P>

We are being asked here to ratify an agreement which will put a very important aspect of our whole industrial and commercial life, and even our social life, under the thumb of the American Government of the day.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now coming into a situation in which, hopefully, in a couple of years' time we will not be totally dependent on imports of oil and gas, but for some years to come we may go on being dependent to a great extent on imports; indeed, we may never reach a situation in which we are totally self-sufficient. We do not know, but there is hopefully a possibility that we might reach that situation and by going into this arrangement on its present basis we are putting our own stocks at potential risk.  We may have to share these out under circumstances which may well not suit our interests at all.  Has that aspect of the matter been considered by the Government?  Has it been sufficiently considered by this House?  Do we realise that if we ratify this agreement we will be stuck with it?  We will have to give one year's notice to get out of it.  If we go in and later come out after a year's notice we will be in a very awkward position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the multi-nationals and they may take all kinds of retaliatory action against us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time to think about all this is now.  The time to reflect is now.  The time to decide whether the major change in United States policy over the last few months should or should not have a bearing on our ratifying <Col N="298" /> this agreement is now.  I do not think that major change has been sufficiently taken into account.  We have no guarantee that there will not be another major shift in the United States position within the next six or 12 months if that suits their commercial interests which, in the field of oil are often synonymous with the interests of the multi-national oil corporations.</P>
    <P>We could be signing away our right to control our own natural resources if we ratify this agreement.  We should have much more time to think about this.  Deputies on both sides, together with the Minister, should seek to tease out the various parts of the agreement which, to say the least of it, are far from clear.  Deputy O'Kennedy said that if ever there was a document which needed a Committee Stage debate it was this document. One has to make a Second Reading speech on it when we should really be sitting down in Committee going through it line by line with the Minister and satisfying ourselves about the propriety or otherwise of the various provisions.  Deputy O'Kennedy gave numerous examples of the extraordinary ambiguity of much of it.  It refers, for instance, to one or more representatives on the governing body.  What is that supposed to mean?  Does it mean one or does it mean more?  No one knows.  If it is more, how many more?  If the Minister knows, why does he not explain what it means?</P>

      <P>Another aspect&mdash; small but indicative of a great many changes that may well have taken place in relation to this agreement&mdash; is the fact that the Minister announced, for the first time to our knowledge, that Norway was becoming an associate member of this particular authority.  There is no provision we can find in the agreement for associate membership.  How can one become an associate member if there is no way of doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Norway may well be wise to become <Col N="299" /> an associate member because she is in a position not dissimilar to our own.  She is now rapidly developing her own resources and she may well be wise not to tie herself irretrievably to this organisation.  Why can we not do the same?  It is significant that Norway will not go in and it is significant that France, which has always traditionally disliked American dominance, stands aloof.  She will not suffer by doing that.  I believe, potentially, that we can do a great deal of harm to this country by going in.  I understand the Minister spoke for a quarter of an hour the last day.  His speech was a short one in very general terms. No real effort was made to explain the details of this agreement.  One wonders if an effort was made to understand all the implications of it? I do not suggest I understand them but I suggest that this side of the House have the gravest reservations about various aspects of this.</P>
    <P>I want to come back briefly to the American dominance of this organisation. As I mentioned earlier, every country is given three votes described as general voting weights.  After that your votes depend on the amount of oil you consume.  There are 100 extra votes given for oil consumption.  The USA gets 48 of them, Japan gets 15, Germany eight, the UK six and so on down to the smaller countries.  Ireland does not get any and neither does Luxembourg.  Deputy O'Kennedy asked the last day why the Government agreed to this situation.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us but we are left in the same position as the Duchy of Luxembourg, a splendid place.  I have great admiration for a little country like that which has prospered so well but it has only 200,000 people.  It is really, economically, an annexe of Belgium, part of the Belgium monetary system.  It is not a country independent to the degree we are of anyone else.  If you regard Luxembourg as being part of the Benelux economic situation this is the only country that gets no votes at all, as a consumer, apart from our three general votes which each country gets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The copy we were given is entitled &ldquo;Agreement on an International Energy Programme, Brussels, 13th November, 1974&rdquo;. Apparently there is a more up-to-date situation now that two more countries have come in, Norway apparently as an associate member and New Zealand as a full member.  I presume that Norway as an associate member would not be entitled to any votes, even general voting weights, apart from her consumption voting weights. I am sure New Zealand does not consume a great deal of energy.  I am sure it is probably far less than our consumption and she has some resources of her own.</P>
      <P>It is a very serious situation that with the weight of voting that takes place in this organisation, provided the USA gets any two of the larger countries to go in with her she can carry virtually anything. There could be a situation where three countries wanted one thing and perhaps 14 or 15 wanted another but the three countries would prevail.  Is this country wise to get herself involved in that, especially now that almost miraculously we actually have our own gas and oil supplies?  We will have to share them into this pool because there are provisions in this agreement that in an emergency everyone must share.  Would we not be better off to retain control of our own resources as we have under the Ambassador-Marathon agreements because all the offshore oil must be landed under those agreements on our territory?  It is then a matter for the Government as to what is done with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would we not be better off to build another refinery so that we would be in a position to refine 100 per cent of our requirements?  If we were lucky enough we might have our own oil but even if we were not we could, without any by your leave to the multi-nationals, go to one of the OPEC countries and buy on the open market <Col N="301" /> at $9 a barrel and either get it refined in Europe, where there is now surplus capacity, as Deputy Barrett has said on a number of occasions, or get it refined here.  Would we not be much stronger in an emergency situation if we were free to do that?  We are tying ourselves, instead of that, into an organisation in which the totally dominant partner is the USA.  She has shown in the last six months a complete shift of policy in relation to oil because her multi-national corporations who call the tune there decided that would be a good thing.  We have no guarantee that these terms suit us in the context of the changed American policy.  Even if they did we have no guarantee that America would not radically change her policy again in another six or 12 months.  If she does, there is nothing we can do about it. If she changes her policy, the facts are that under this agreement the whole organisation, which we are now going into, changes its policy also, because America is sure to get at least some of the others to agree.  If she gets any two of the bigger countries, they can carry it.</P>
    <P>We should let this agreement be examined more fully in the light of developments since it was originally signed.  There is a provisio whereby the Government under the agreement can apply to the organisation to have the ratification date put back until some time after the 1st May.  This is a very important agreement.  There are many implications in it which I do not think anybody is fully aware of.  The implications are liable to change from day to day and from week to week as the domestic and foreign policy of the USA changes. We will have to reassess the wisdom or otherwise of our going in.  We will have to reassess the effect it will have on our own supplies coming on tap within the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the agreement be put back for three months to enable the necessary examination to be carried out in the light of changed circumstances and changed American policy. I have no doubt that the organisation concerned would agree to a request from the Government because there <Col N="302" /> is an article in it which allows that to be done.  I am sure they will be quite reasonable in that regard.  I ask the Minister to postpone the agreement for a period of three months. If he does not do that, I am afraid this party are seriously worried about the implications of this agreement and in the national interest we, and anybody on the other side who is seriously worried about the implications in the national interest of the agreement, have no option but to vote against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>This agreement proves to me the irrelevancy of this House.  The Minister devoted 15 minutes to informing the House of the agreement and since then we heard the views of three front bench members of my party, Deputies Barrett, O'Kennedy and O'Malley. However, we have not heard the views of any members from the Government side.  Deputy O'Malley has pointed out that this agreement may be detrimental to this country at a future date, particularly if we become an oil-producing nation, and I agree with that view.  The problem about these international agreements and EEC directives is that the Government make no attempt to have them discussed in this House before they are signed.  This agreement is before us merely for sanction but it should have been discussed in the same way we discuss a Bill on Committee Stage. If we did that we could discuss the agreement line by line and then the Minister would be in a better position to assess the benefits we could derive from such agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suspicious of the agreement. The agency mentioned in it will be run by the Americans.  The Americans will have the biggest number of votes but we will not have any vote.  Even though we will not have a vote, we will be obliged to obey all the decisions of that agency.  In my view the agreement will prevent us from having any direct negotiations with the oil-producing countries.  Because of the amount of tax collected on oil no one could blame the oil-producing countries charging more for this product. <Col N="303" /> In a case like this I should like to hear both sides of the argument because I have not had an opportunity of considering the agreement in detail.  I try to assess motions before this House objectively and never with the intention of scoring political points but I have only heard one side of the argument in this case.</P>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion of Deputy O'Malley that we should adjourn further consideration of this motion until we have had an opportunity of discussing the details of the agreement.  I will not vote in favour of the emotion because we have not discussed it in detail.  I am annoyed and worried about the agreement.  I cannot understand why more time is not devoted to consideration of international and EEC agreements.  This House should be given an opportunity of debating them for at least two days.  In this case we are told that the agreement has been signed&mdash;a case of take it or leave it.  The agreement will be sanctioned by this House because the Government have a majority but the Minister has not the views of all Members.  I expected that Deputy Barry Desmond would put forward the Government and Labour Party point of view but he did not offer.</P>
    <P>When the first explorations for oil were carried out nobody, with the exception of the late Seán Lemass, held out any hope of an oil find.  The people who carried out the explorations were laughed at.  I sit in on as many debates as possible for the purpose of being educated and for this reason it was disappointing that the Members on the Government side did not contribute.  I know Deputy Barrett's views.  I know he holds very strong views in regard to the question of more oil refineries here&mdash;buying crude oil for refining here.</P>
    <P>There may be suggestions from that side of the House which would convince me, but such suggestions have not been forthcoming.  It detracts from the prestige of the House that a good case has not been made by the Government side in favour of this agency of which we are now asked to become a member.  I did not intend <Col N="304" /> speaking on this matter at all, but I could not sit here and be told: &ldquo;This is an agency we are joining.  We think it is good for you.  We will tell you a little about it.&rdquo;  I understand the agreement is a long document which would take much time to study.  I could not allow the Minister wind up this debate without giving my views, as an impartial observer, having no axe to grind one way or the other with regard to this agency.  We are endangering this country by not discussing fully here, and objectively, any international agreement, whatever it may be.  The way this measure has been brought before the House, without any explanation from the Government side, is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I listened very attentively to the contribution made by Deputies O'Malley, O'Kennedy and Barrett, all of whom put up a very sound, solid case for reconsideration of the whole question of membership of this agency.  I would make a final appeal to the Minister not to push this through the House, not to vote on it immediately, to study it further and, if necessary, put it to a Committee of the House if he does not want to have an open debate.  I do not like these committees.  I prefer open debate in this House because such debate serves to make any legislation going through, or any agreements made, internationally or otherwise, better.  No matter how good a man is&mdash;and I am not casting any doubts on the competence of the Minister&mdash;he can always learn.  We often heard it said: &ldquo;I never went to a meeting yet from which I did not learn something.&rdquo; If one debates anything in any House, certainly one will learn something.  Let nobody set himself up, no matter who he be, from the Taoiseach down, as somebody who can say: &ldquo;I know all&rdquo;&mdash;that everybody is out of step except our Johnny.  That is something I should not like to see creeping in here.  From the way in which this agency has been presented to this House it appears that we are taken for granted.  I know the Minister had advisers.  However the attitude appears to be:  &ldquo;This is good for you; take it or leave it.&rdquo;  I do not accept that and never will accept it. <Col N="305" /> I am indeed sorry Government speakers did not tell us more about the agreement, which we think endangers the country.  We feel it is a dangerous agreement.  Our policy is to oppose it unless it is left in abeyance pending a full discussion at a later stage, just as one would have on the Committee Stage of a Bill.  Again I would appeal to the Government, when they intend entering into international agreements, at least to think sufficiently of the elected representatives of the people to come in here and say, for example: &ldquo;We are about to enter into an agreement on oil.  This is what the agreement will be like.  We should like the House to discuss it for a day or two.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same applies to the Agenda at EEC level.  It is scandalous the way this House is being treated&mdash;this attitude of presenting us with a measure and of saying: &ldquo;Take it or leave it.&rdquo; It is that to which I strongly object. As long as I remain here, I shall continue to voice that objection.  I stand for democracy and democracy means informing people about what one is doing.  Consultation is consultation with people, and informing them before one reaches agreement.  Certainly coming in here and informing us that an agreement has been arrived at, with an attitude of take it or leave it, does not constitute consultation.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by asking the Minister, as did Deputy O'Malley, to refrain from putting this measure to a vote, study the agreement which, in my view, will have serious implications for the country and one which I do not think should be rushed through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Callanan has said, this is a very important agreement at international level. Surely it merits more discussion in this House than has taken place to date. Admittedly, there is very little in the agreement in so far as practical gains for this country are concerned.  A good deal of it is wishful thinking. For example, we are very unequal partners; we are the little men in the middle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard a good deal about oil when its price increased fourfold.  Every <Col N="306" /> second day of the week we had Government spokesmen speaking in terms of the damage done to the economy by the drastic increase which took place.  We were all prepared, more or less, to accept that sort of statement. But we are not so prepared to accept at face value agreements said to be entered into and which will fall as a burden on the Exchequer later.  We are not disposed to accepting empty statements or pious hopes. It is said sometimes it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive.  But there is no appearance in this agreement of our having arrived at anything beyond a certain set of aims. No doubt the agreement establishes a number of praiseworthy aims.  Perhaps I might quote briefly from the Minister's statement setting out the terms of the agreement:</P>
    <P>The agreement establishes a programme whose main features include co-ordinated efforts to develop an emergency supply reserve, a scheme for restraining energy demands and sharing oil in a supply crisis, arrangement for gathering information on the international oil market, long-term co-operation aimed at conserving energy and developing alternative energy supplies and the promotion of a co-operative dialogue between oil-producing and oil-consuming countries, including those of the developing world.</P>
    <P>To deal with the first point, apart from the widespread mention oil received in all communications following the increase in its price, we have not heard to date too much of the aims set out here.  We heard of them in the international context.  How much are we, as a small economy largely dependent on oil, doing?  How much are we doing, for example, to establish, to develop and to co-ordinate in a general way our fuel resources? We read of developments on the Continent&mdash;for example, of a house which would derive its heating from solar energy.  We heard an announcement some time ago that the ESB were interested in solar energy.  I should like to hear further from An Foras Forbartha and other agencies <Col N="307" /> about how feasible it is to heat a house here, on the Continent or elsewhere, by solar energy.</P>
    <P>Not too long ago I read a short article on the subject.  I was glad to learn that the Germans, who as usual make the running in matters of this kind, have a house on the market designed to absorb solar energy.  I was further edified to read that the roof was made mostly of metal.  The windows seemed to be small but there was one large window under the roof which provided a conductor for the heat to be dispersed throughout the house.</P>
    <P>As a small economy, we find it hard to find the cash necessary to pay for our imports at a normal, rational level.  It will be much more difficult to find the cash to pay for a fourfold increase.  As I said, the Government made much of this early on but did not make enough of the ways and means of generating, conducting and conserving our supplies of energy other than oil.  This does not happen overnight but one will never reach this point unless there are various studies carried out on this subject.</P>
    <P>This is a small country on the rim of Europe, an intensely developing continent.  We went forward as fast as we could to keep up with the modern usage of all types of energy, especially oil.  This led us to be largely reliant on oil for not merely heat but power in general.  Even at this early stage we should be doing more to encourage the ESB to look further into this question of energy from natural water reserves.  We never did enough in this direction.  Admittedly what we did was very costly, but we should have a secondary programme that would shore up and help take the weight off our main generating units.</P>
    <P>When speaking of energy one might ramble too far, especially when one has not had sufficient time to study the matter in detail.  It has been said that sometimes we were too ambitious when we asked the ESB to develop sources of power, the cost sometimes running into many millions of pounds. My main point is that we should have a secondary programme running in <Col N="308" /> the same direction but on a more modest basis of expenditure and in a most modest way.  In this way we could provide an auxiliary to our main generating units.</P>
    <P>We talk about our high rainfall, about our lakes, rivers and mountains. I often wonder if we are making the best use of our natural resources. There are many sources of energy, apart from solar energy.  There are physical sources of energy, such as fossilised fuels and so on.  If we intend reducing our reliance on oil for energy, what auxiliary sources of fuel are there?</P>
    <P>I suppose one need not make too much fuss on this point I am on at the moment.  While we had oil we all relied on it because it was the cheapest source of energy.  No matter what the consumer nations, some of them producers, who signed this agreement say, oil will never be cheap again and the price of oil will depend on the producer countries, and undoubtedly the producer countries will form various cartels in order to keep the price of oil at a level which will pay them well as producers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we would want to be careful in considering international agreements, who we make them with, in whose company they are made and so on.  If one is a producer and at the same time a large consumer, one cannot be entirely on the side of either the producer or the consumer.  Regrettably, being entirely consumer, we would be a small man in company of this kind, and this is the kind of company we are in in these international agreements.</P>
    <P>Leaving other sources of energy aside and dealing with fossilised fuels, what information have we regarding these types of fuel to give us any hope that now or in the near future we would be able to mount a programme to harness them, with the aim of reducing our oil imports?  For a long number of years we have had small power stations, for instance, Mount Allen at Arigna.  We had a long battle to get the ESB to agree that any energy could be generated there, and they were very hesitant on <Col N="309" /> the grounds of cost and so on at the time.</P>
    <P>I am not a miner nor have I any mining experience, but we have a large bed, of what is known as ash coal, the exploring of which would be worth expending a certain amount of money.  If this ash coal was capable of producing the energy we need, then we could examine further the question of extending the generating plant that is there already.</P>
    <P>There are other types of energy under the ground that we know very little about.  We heard nothing about our sources of energy before the oil crisis, but since then we have had a good deal of discussion on this whole matter of alternative sources of energy.  We should have a survey of every field in Ireland to see what energy is under the ground.  We have the geological office, but that is not enough.  Geologists are not miners and would not be experts on oil or gas. There could be pockets of oil or gas located here and there throughout the country and we do not know it.</P>
    <P>Instead of relying too much on international aid and agreements we should be doing a little more at home in order to discover, even in a small way, alternative sources of energy. The terms of this agreement read well and anyone could subscribe to them, but will they be adhered to?  One point that struck me earlier on when this oil crisis arose was that although the EEC was a developing area, a common market area, those making up that area did not stand together on that question.  In a community which is made up of units with common economic and political aims, I question their integrity when they cannot stand together in face of the crisis which the question of oil brought about.</P>
    <P>Small and poor and all as we are, we have certain sources of energy at our disposal for which we should be grateful, and we should investigate further sources of energy in order to know what is available to us.  Not too long ago I was reading various articles on this whole energy question.  From one article one would get the impression that the oil consumers would <Col N="310" /> comprise a large unit and would have some say in the ultimate price of this product.  However, a spokesman for the producers, Sheik Yamani, after listening to some discussions between the consuming companies was asked, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, April 21st, 1975:</P>
    <P>With the collapse of the talks between the oil producers and the oil consumers in Paris, what do you see as happening next?</P>
    <P>and he said:</P>
    <P>First of all, I have to be sure that there is a collapse and that it's not an adjournment.  If it is a collapse, then I think it is a serious matter and the result might lead to confrontation&mdash;which is definitely against the interest of the consumer. But if it's just an adjournment of the meeting, then I hope the talks will resume as soon as possible, and that the full conference will take place and there will be some sort of international co-operation in the way of energy and development.</P>
    <P>He was asked then whether Saudi Arabia would push to try to have the talks resumed if they did collapse.  We know that agreement was not reached after those talks but there is this agreement between consumers and hopes have been expressed of taking certain steps.  However, the expressed intention of the oil producers is that never again will they work to supply the developing countries with a cheap source of energy.  This is not an ephemeral matter but a long term one and we can be assured that never again will there be cheap oil available. In this context one might pose the question as to what is meant by cheap oil.  If a number of the Governments in Europe removed tax from oil the product could be had at a reasonable cost but, regrettably, ways have been found of harnessing energy for taxation purposes. Consumer countries, be they large or small, should impress on their own governments the necessity for releasing a product such as oil from the grasp of taxation.  We see on the one hand the price of oil being increased fourfold in a short time while on the other taxes are levied by <Col N="311" /> various governments on this commodity. In these circumstances we can rightfully and in fairness call for a halt to this method of raising revenue.</P>
    <P>Another matter which must be considered in the context of energy is the question of wastage.  As I said at the outset, the Germans always do something positive about such matters, something that is calculated to move their economies in the right direction. One would hope that other economies would follow suit.  The Germans argue that 60 per cent of the energy of a power station is wasted.  Having regard to the degree of scientific aid we can call on, this is a matter that we should be able to do something about. Admittedly, German power stations are on a much larger scale than ours but our power stations are as vital to our community as are those in Germany to the community in that country.</P>
    <P>It would be time and money well spent to devise ways and means of harnessing this energy which at present is being wasted.  It is a great pity that this waste energy cannot be harnessed especially in built-up areas and that it be piped to where it would be needed for heating purposes. Initially, the expenditure for any such project would be very high and would invite much criticism but the effort would be well worth while in the long term if it resulted in the conservation of what would otherwise be waste energy.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to have the matter of fossilised fuels examined and have a report on it so as to discover how far we can go in extracting heat from those known sources of energy.  If we could accomplish this even at a higher price than we pay for oil it would be money well spent. I should like to be the Minister who could come back and tell the House: &ldquo;We know our sources of fossilised fuel; we know what we have under the ground.  We are beginning to develop it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have not been mentioned here of late but peat should be utilised so as to be a far greater source of energy than it is.  Admittedly, very good progress has been <Col N="312" /> made not only in producing sufficient fuel for some power stations but at the same time producing sufficient sod peat for consumers at large.  Last winter when it was very cold I was commenting on the poor insulation of houses and the degree of heat wasted in every house in the country &mdash;that was only last January or February&mdash;and also on the fact that Bord na Móna many years ago patented a grate for burning turf. One hears nothing about it now.  I have asked for this grate in many hardware shops throughout the country and they have never heard of it.  Matters like this should be highlighted and Bord na Móna should be encouraged to raise the necessary funds this year to begin an all-out programme to provide all the energy they can.  In doing this we would be doing a good day's work for the country in the long run.</P>
    <P>Even last winter we did not have sufficient emphasis on the need to conserve heat and save the energy we have.  I often wonder why Dublin offices are lit up so late at night.  We should have a good programme to conserve heat in the winter months when it is most needed and also a programme for the insulation of houses.  We have had a wonderful housing programme, public and private, but how many builders refer to insulation as an element in the general housing programme?  That question should be asked not only here but outside the House.  We hear very little about those sources of energy because that is what they are.  Where there is wastage we should try to eliminate it and to conserve the energy we have.  If we did this, I believe the Minister could report progress in the long run.  It is the little things in life that matter most.  It is said that the best things in life are free and that is the attraction in this matter.  I do not suggest that energy or anything connected with it is free, but we could make a much better effort to conserve the energy supplies we have, find out more about them and use them more efficiently.  If that were done we could cut down substantially on our oil import bill.  By doing a number of small things all <Col N="313" /> calculated to lead to reduced oil consumption and reducing waste of energy we could, in the course of a year or so, achieve substantial progress.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carter has made an excellent case for the rejection of the suggested agreement on international energy programmes. In his considered, well-documented and ably-delivered contribution he has, point by point, destroyed the arguments put up by the Minister for the agreement.  What the Minister suggests that we as a Parliament should do is sign away our potential energy resources, at a time when they are either obviously available or becoming available, to the large multi-nationals controlled by the governments of the large producers such as the United States&mdash;and not even producers but governments holding shares in the multi-national companies that are developing and using various oil fields not necessarily in their own countries but in other countries.  Directly or indirectly, as a small nation we are handing over our power and our potential to the multi-nationals whether from America, or the Netherlands with the Dutch Shell company, or similar concerns. This is at a time when we should be doing the direct opposite, namely, holding our independence, preparing to go forth into a brave new world with our own energy resources and our own potential as an energy supplier rather than an importer and a user.</P>

Yesterday we heard a lot about guidelines and we are limited to guidelines on this issue now.  We are moving into wider areas that involve the entire health services.  Most of the speakers yesterday should have been more enlightened. The more I think of the motion we are discussing the more baffled I am about what the whole thing means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members whom we might have thought were aware of the present day situation, particularly in such a vital area as health services, showed they were totally uninformed about what was being discussed.  I do not know if this was deliberate ignorance of the situation.  These are the people who are supposed to tell their constituents <Col N="315" /> the situation with regard to medical cards and the health services generally.  The lack of knowledge displayed yesterday by Fine Gael speakers in particular baffled me.  It is a matter for the Minister to bring the issue into the open and to have a full and frank discussion on the health services.  I can easily understand the predicament of ordinary people with regard to the health services when Deputies display such ignorance of these matters.</P>
    <P>I intend to substantiate my statements with regard to Deputy Haughey's motion by proof and figures and, most important, from experience. I wish to be as informative and constructive as I can and I hope those who should know more will take even half a leaf from a book of 25 or 26 years' experience with regard to public health matters.</P>
    <P>I wish to correct some statements by Deputy Moore with regard to hospitalisation and home treatment. There are cases where home treatment should be used&mdash;for example, for geriatrics and for people suffering from mental illnesses.  Home care is an asset that should be used as much as possible but it is not up to any lay person to decide that a patient should not remain in hospital but should be sent home.  The only person entitled to make that decision is the medical person involved.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the statement made by Deputy Moore that we have too many beds.  The position is the reverse.  For the last 20 years in my area we have sought extensions for the regional, voluntary and maternity hospitals.  We have met the present Minister and his predecessors with regard to our request for extensions. If that is the experience of Deputy Moore in Dublin, I wish it applied to the rest of the country also.  We must get our priorities right where the health services are involved. In many of our hospitals&mdash;perhaps not so much in the voluntary as in the regional&mdash;we have to accommodate people in corridors.  The simple reason is we have not got enough accommodation in the public wards, in the semi-private or private wards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> With regard to hospitalisation generally, there should not be worry or distress on any breadwinner or anyone else because he has to be hospitalised.  The financial problems of people occupying public wards are taken over by the health boards.  I am sorry that Deputy Moore harped on the financial problems at home. They are not the fault of the health boards.  They may be due to domestic matters, the weekly income and other things.  They are not due to hospital charges if patients are in public wards which are free for everybody.  However, some people will not go into public wards&mdash;they opt for private and semi-private wards.  Then when the bill is presented to them they come to us and when we make inquiries we discover they opted for semi-private wards.</P>
    <P>With regard to the dental services, numerous statements have been made. Here again we must get our priorities right.  I have never heard of anyone dying from toothache.  I have made suggestions over the years and I do not know whether the Minister will find it possible to implement them.  His predecessors failed to do so.  There are prostheticians, the dental mechanics. In Europe, particularly in Switzerland, they serve an apprenticeship of three years.  They can handle dentures and fittings of all kinds.  Here we do not train them in that way and if we did it would help to solve many problems.</P>
    <P>Deputies Haughey and Moore spoke about a charge of £3 per week.  I checked on this by telephone with my health board in Limerick this morning and the sum is between £3 and £5 a week and if it is anything more than that, half of the figure is returned in full.  Apparently it all depends on the approach of the different CEOs.  We have rectified our problem in Limerick because we insist that members of the staff, particularly the junior members, male and female, attend health board meetings in rota.  In that way they learn of the human aspect of the work of the board and the human problems that have to be dealt with.  Then we have the co-operation of the staff who know from attending our meetings <Col N="317" /> that there is not a straight line down the centre.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have not enough time to go into more detail.  I hope the Minister will take our views into consideration. All of us have been speaking from experience of health service administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is very timely.  My special concern is to get some streamlining of the qualification conditions.  For instance, there is a hardship clause.  Deputy Coughlan spoke about the human element, but superintendent officers and their assistants have to remember that there is an auditor who may come along and ask why they have given medical cards in certain cases and reprimand them. At the moment the qualifying guidelines are very low.  In my area, to qualify for a medical card the income must not exceed £24.50p.  That is very low.  Social welfare payments are allowed to be added.  Ten years ago we had a set qualifying limit but this has gone by the board because of inflation and steeply rising prices.  Even after five months of exhortation it is difficult to get the limit raised.</P>
      <P>I suggest that it has become necessary for the Minister to tie the limit either to the cost of living index or to increases in wages so that the qualifying figure can be raised as the cost of living increases.  We should not have this yo-yo business where a man may get an increase in wages and be deprived of his medical card because of that.  There should be a definite link between the qualifying figure and the cost of living index.  I do not think Deputy Haughey went out of the way when he considered the proper income limits for people to qualify for medical cards.  He advocated that the weekly means of a husband and wife, after deductions for rent, rates, mortgages and expenses of travelling to and from work, should be £40 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Southern Health Board at the moment the allowance in respect of a child of under 16 years is £2.25 per week.  You would pay more for a <Col N="318" /> fair meal in the Oireachtas restaurant. If the child happens to be older than 16 years he or she qualifies for a medical card in his or her own right and the parents would be allowed £3.25 per week.  That is a miserable figure when one considers that the boy or girl has reached manhood or womanhood.  Deputy Haughey has not gone out of the way in recommending that the figure should be £4 per week.  The £40 per week income cannot be regarded as out of the way.</P>
    <P>Apparently one-third of our community are medical card holders and I should like the Minister to tell us what the cost would be if we included another third.  Somebody has said it would not cost more than between £13 million and £16 million a year.</P>
    <P>The improvement suggested in the motion would benefit many people. A medical card holder living in rural Ireland or in a city is entitled to free transport to hospital whether it be by ambulance or by a local hackneyman who has a contract with the health board.  There are many people in my area who cannot qualify for this, people with £28 or £29 a week. They have to hire a car at a cost of £9 or £10 for each journey.</P>
    <P>If they had medical cards they would not have to spend that money. I know people who have had to forego visits to clinics because they could not afford to pay the travelling expenses. The motion recommends that persons over 65 years of age should qualify for medical cards.  I agree with that.  It is a sad day when a retired roadworker, with ten years' service, and his wife do not qualify for medical cards.  Except for a very few, people over 65 should get medical cards.  Indeed it would be as well to include everybody because the few in the upper income group will not avail of them anyway.  A single person or a widow has very little hope of getting a medical card.  That is all wrong.  Such a person may be 68, 70 or 72 years of age, perhaps living alone in a council house.  How many of us in this House think there is something wrong with us and go for a check-up?  Those people dare not think there is something wrong with <Col N="319" /> them because the cost of finding out is too high.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot of talk about the contribution towards the cost of drugs.  The amount is very small.  If a doctor gives a prescription to a man with a family and he goes to the local chemist and gets it processed he is lucky if he does not have to spend £8 or £9 immediately.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy should be whole-heartedly behind this motion.  When we were arguing about raising the income limit for medical cards this year we were told that the health boards did not have enough money to provide hospital treatment for all the categories that would be included. That is sad.  The Department and the Minister have trimmed down the estimates for all the health boards and that is a sad reflection on our community. Each individual should have as many days as are due to him on this earth and he should not be deprived of one of them because of the lack of a proper health service. The idea in Deputy Haughey's mind is that we should base the qualifying limit on the take-home pay of a worker.  This is a good motion and nobody should refuse to support it.</P>
    <P>Let me return to the question of travelling expenses.  If a medical card holder is referred by his doctor to a hospital he can avail of the service provided by the health board.  The local hackney man who has a contract will call for him.  Is the Minister aware that in north Cork alone last year that service cost over £44,000? I regard it as money well spent but that amount of expenditure would not have been incurred if we had some of the services available in the town of Mallow.  This is an old chestnut.  An announcement from the Minister on the question of Mallow Hospital is long overdue.  We are expecting it every day.  It is costing £44,000 to convey the people of that area to Cork city, to Tralee and to Limerick.  It is estimated that it will cost at least £70,000 in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that the present population of the Mallow catchment area qualifies it for a fully-equipped <Col N="320" /> maternity hospital?  That is something on which the Department should make a decision very soon. The Department should announce that they accept this idea in principle and that in due course they will provide the necessary money to build that hospital.</P>
    <P>I must praise the home assistance officers and the superintendent assistance officers for their devotion to duty.  They are excellent men.  they are very humane men.  They act within the guidelines.  Any politician who goes to them with a deserving case is listened to.  I am speaking of my own area.  I am speaking of the men I know.  I want to put on record my appreciation of the way they carry out their duties.  Would the Minister arrange with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that when a home assistance officer has been appointed he is immediately provided with a telephone?  Lives often depend on the way those people carry out their duties and it is ridiculous to put them on a waiting list for telephone service.</P>
    <P>It is very important that dental treatment should be provided free for people.  Dental treatment nowadays is very costly.  Deputy Coughlan said he never heard of anybody dying of a toothache, but there is more to it than that.  If a person has not got a medical card he may be covered by insurance but he will have to pay for dental treatment for his wife and family.</P>
    <P>The Minister should lower the qualifying age for medical cards.  It is now 16 years of age.  Children get the benefit of the medical service when they are in the primary school but, once they leave school, they do not qualify for a medical card until they are 16 years of age.  For about three years they are in a kind of limbo if their parents can afford to provide them with the necessary medical attention.  I suggest that they should be entitled to qualify for medical cards when they leave primary school.  The State has no commitment to those children during the three or four years before they qualify at the age of 16.</P>
    <P>We are all anxious that the allowance for home treatment should be expanded.  We must try to keep our <Col N="321" /> people out of hospitals and institutions. A son or daughter may have to give up a good job to come home and look after the old person.  The allowance in this respect should be increased. If you had to go into hospital for a week or a fortnight, you would feel very sorry for yourself when you got the bill if you were not covered by insurance or a medical card.  Regardless of cost, we should provide for our people in a right and proper manner.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in supporting this motion which also refers to persons suffering from any long-term illness.  In the recent past the Minister has expanded the category of people who qualify under that heading. People who are asthmatic do not qualify.  The scheme should be further extended.  The guidelines set down for the categories who qualify are not very clear.  As a matter of fact, some of them are rather contradictory.  The Department should look again at how the medical officers assess in what way people qualify.  The Minister can get the facts from our advisory committee in Cork.  We went over this in detail. I have great pleasure in supporting this motion.  I hope the House will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate which has been initiated by Deputy Haughey.  It covers one aspect of our health policy.  Of necessity it is a short debate.  We have had varied contributions from some Members of the House who spoke more or less in broad terms rather than in the specific terms of the motion.  I welcome the views of those who have contributed to the debate. There seems to be a little difference of opinion on the matter of medical cards.  Deputy Byrne talked about abuses in the issue and the use of medical cards.  If there are such abuses they should be reported to the medical health board in the area.  As a public representative I do not believe that there are many such abuses. Naturally there will be some abuses in any Government or local authority operated scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give the House some of my views, my ideas and my problems <Col N="322" /> which have to be faced in the matter of social policy.  It is abundantly clear from the motion and from the contribution by the mover of the motion that he wants to move away from means testing for medical cards in respect of certain categories.  That is significant in itself.  The principle of means testing was enshrined in the White Paper of 1966.  That principle was central to the policy of the last three Fianna Fáil Ministers for Health.  It was enshrined in the White Paper published in 1966 and copper-fastened in the Health Act, 1970, both of which state clearly that entitlement is based on ability to pay or means testing.</P>
    <P>In this motion Deputy Haughey seeks to disregard that principle for all widows, for all those over 65 years of age, and for all those suffering from long-term illnesses.  It is easy to find out the number of widows and those over 65 years of age, but there is a difference of opinion as to what should be regarded as a long-term illness which would qualify for benefit. It is suggested that these three groups should get medical cards regardless of their income.  That is an interesting departure because the last three Fianna Fáil Ministers for Health argued&mdash;and I use that word deliberately because these words were included in the White Paper&mdash;that it was unnecessary and undesirable to give medical cards without a rigid means test.</P>
    <P>Section 45 (1) of the 1970 Act which refers to full eligibility is definitive in its phraseology.  It provides that for the purposes of full eligibility only persons who suffer undue hardship will be entitled to qualify.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government at that time, and Deputy Haughey was Minister for Finance, it was envisaged by the Government and the Minister for Health&mdash;I forget who it was&mdash;that only 30 per cent of the population could become eligible for medical cards.  That was a global means test in itself.  This motion is in contrast to that when one has regard to the number of people Deputy Haughey wants to become eligible. This motion would increase the number eligible to from 60 per cent to <Col N="323" /> 65 per cent.  Fianna Fáil thought that was undesirable and unnecessary in 1970.  It appears to me that Deputy Haughey is departing from previous Fianna Fáil policy in that he favours no means test for some groups and he wants to move away from the 30 per cent of the population mentioned by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I welcome the change of heart.  He is entitled to change his policy and this is, I suppose, a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government should not tie themselves unduly to rigid selectivity in health matters.  Reference was made to the hardship clause.  What I describe as guidelines should be guidelines and, if there is hardship, the CEOs should be in a position to remedy the hardship. Where there is a long history of illness or shortage of money to be taken into account the CEOs, through the health board officers and the home assistance officers, should be able to identify those who suffer hardship, even if they do not qualify under the existing guidelines for medical cards.</P>
    <P>The guidelines should be reviewed at intervals.  They should be flexible. They were criticised by those who contributed to this debate.  As far as my term of office is concerned, these guidelines have, with the initiative of the CEOs, been improved to meet the increase in the cost of living. When discussing health&mdash;all health is expenditure&mdash;it is not possible to focus on just one aspect alone.  One must consider it in conjunction with other aspects.  I am concerned with a wide range of services.  The general medical service is one.  I am vitally concerned about that.  I am, however, forced to look at the needs of other services and determine priorities. There is no bottomless purse available in relation to my Department any more than there is a bottomless purse available to other Departments.  I cannot do all I would like to do within a given time.  One can, however, by steady progress and initiative ensure real improvement.</P>
    <P>There is an unceasing demand&mdash;I do not object to it&mdash;in questions addressed <Col N="324" /> to me for more money for this, that and the other, all very desirable; but there are other areas and a number of health services that have been neglected in the past which are badly in need of development.  It will be readily agreed that psychiatric services have been neglected, not perhaps deliberately but they have lagged behind in comparison with other services.  The psychiatric services need to be developed and it is no secret that that development will cost a great deal of money if we are to bring them up to an acceptable level.  It will take money to provide training and employment for the handicapped.  This is an urgent human and social need.  It will take money to implement the various proposals made by the working party on the training and employment of handicapped people.</P>

      <P>I will consider the report.  Reference was made to home help services within the community care programme which is designed to ensure that the poor and the aged will be looked after and, incidentally, kept out of hospital.  Reference was made to a hospital development plan.  That will cost millions.  We did not have a hospital development plan until 1948 and in 1953 it was dropped like a hot potato because of political implications. Probably what I will decide will also have political implications but I am prepared to face that.  The only people who are happy where hospitals are concerned are the people representing Dublin constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was in Opposition I complained about dental services.  The 1970 Act provides for <Col N="325" /> practically everything but unfortunately it does not provide the means.  This is one of the big difficulties.  The Act is a good one but there is no provision for dental services for secondary schoolchildren or vocational education students.  I am trying to recruit dentists to ensure that those entitled to dental treatment in the medical card group and schoolchildren will get it.  It is very difficult to recruit dentists.  We have advertised and discovered we cannot get enough applicants.  There has been an improvement but it is pathetic to meet a holder of a medical card, who in law is entitled to dental services, for whom no dental service is provided.</P>
      <P>All these things are very desirable, but funds are not limitless.  I must allocate the funds available across a broad range of services and decide on a planned rate of development in line with a system of priorities.  The job would be much easier if I could concentrate on one part of the health service.  The Deputy in his motion shows just one area.  I do not take exception to that.  He argued for extending the number of people in the lower income group&mdash;widows, those over 65 and those suffering from long-term illnesses.  He also wants to ease the means test for married couples and single persons under 65. In principle, I agree with him, but principles are not much good when one cannot produce the cash.  That is the reality we have to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Opposition I said I would aim at a comprehensive health service.  I still believe that to be a legitimate aspiration and I am glad to see Deputy Haughey is moving in that direction now.  His proposal to increase elegibility from 35 per cent to 60 per cent or 65 per cent is something he wants to do in one fell swoop.  I have sympathy with the sentiment but there are real and practical difficulties that will not disappear merely because we vote on this motion.  Finance is important. The Deputy said he could not put a cost on his proposals.  I do not blame him for that because he does not have access to the information I have, but he could have got it by way of parliamentary question.  to me, he gave the impression that the <Col N="326" /> cost would be relatively small in relation to the total Health Estimate.  My information&mdash;I believe it to be accurate&mdash;is that the motion would bring into the medical card group 750,000 people which in effect would mean bringing in those who are now in the middle income group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that 750,000 more or altogether?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>750,000 more.  As I say, the Deputy will not have the information I have but the firm information is that in respect of all those people, whether they are sick or not, the cost per year is £19 to £20 per person.  That is a minimum cost of £15 million per annum.  I believe that is a conservative figure because if guidelines were changed&mdash;we know this from the professional organisations&mdash;over a certain percentage there is the possibility they will want to re-negotiate a new contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The total cost this year is only £18 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £21 million.  This £15 million is not available at the present time.  I have no hesitation in saying we are going through a serious economic time and I think the Deputy will recognise this.  This was spelt out by the Government in the White Paper and in the presentation of the budget by the Minister for Finance. This year the primary object is to maintain the standard of living we have in the crisis that is as serious as the one we had in the 1930s.  Any additional expenditure that the Government may allow would not necessarily be given to one Department more than another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot say if the £15 million were available to me for health that I would devote it to those who would qualify for medical cards.  There are other services within the health services now being administered and I do not think I could commend the motion to the House.  First of all, there is a legal difficulty that is insurmountable.  The motion cannot legally be implemented because it does not provide for a means test.  Section 45 (1) provides <Col N="327" /> for a means test and it does not make any difference whether or not you nominate this, that or the other class. My legal advice is that no matter who you nominate to be deemed to be in the full eligibility group there has to be a means test.  I have no reason but to believe that the advice I have been given is absolutely right. Section 45 (1) makes it obligatory to take account of the question of hardship for the purpose of qualification for a medical card.  That means, in effect, that the first three categories which are mentioned in the Deputy's motion would have to undergo a means test and, in present circumstances, in accordance with the guidelines laid down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to check it with his own legal people I do not mind.  A new Health Act would be necessary to implement that part of the motion in respect of certain classes.  It could not be implemented under the 1970 Act.  I cannot support this motion because it must be done, as I said at the beginning, in consultation with the professions concerned.  I do not think a three-hour debate will resolve the question.</P>
      <P>My approach to extending the health services is to proceed by way of extensive consultation and involvement of the interests concerned before I ask the Government to commit themselves to a new policy direction. For example, in reforming the psychiatric services I would certainly discuss any proposed changes with the interested parties.  In the reform of the children's law and child care that process of consultation has already begun.  As the House is aware, a working party has been established, which is meeting very regularly, in order to introduce proper legislation in respect of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise as much as any Deputy the hardship there is in relation to medical expenses.  I know this causes hardship for individuals and families and they are not now covered.  I want <Col N="328" /> to assure the House I will do all in my power to alleviate and eliminate this handicap where it exists.  In this I may say I am at one with Deputy Haughey.  Money is an important factor and I do not think there is any evidence to show that the Government have been niggardly in the allocation of money to the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the general medical services, to which the Deputy referred a few minutes ago, was £12 million in 1972-73.  In 1975 it is £22 million, which is an increase of nearly 100 per cent in respect of expenditure on the GMS.  The number covered in 1972-73 was 860,000, 28 per cent. In 1974 1,100,000 were covered, an increase of 35 per cent.  As far as the guidelines are concerned, they were reviewed upwards, needless to remark, in January last year.  They will again be reviewed during the middle of the year and the increase in allowances will take account of the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I also increased the list of long-term illnesses.  Drugs and appliances are provided free of charge regardless of the needs of those people.  That includes about 5,000 people.  There is also a scheme of assistance for drugs available to all employed people regardless of means.  I will not correct Deputy Coughlan again.  I will talk to him in private because my time is running out.  We have retained the figure of £4 as a maximum amount any eligible family need pay for prescribed medicines in any month.  This was set in April 1972 and should, I suppose, have been raised but we have not done so.</P>
    <P>I do not think I was ungenerous to the unfortunate thalidomide children nor was I ungenerous to those who need constant care.  A constant care allowance of £25 a month was provided. That costs something like £1 million.  I believe these are concrete steps which have been taken in order to alleviate in some way those on whom a big burden falls as far as health costs are concerned.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure for the health services in 1972-73 was £112 million. In 1975 it is £203 million.  I think, <Col N="329" /> having regard to inflation and everything, that is a pretty good performance as far as the allocation of public moneys to the health services is concerned. In respect of the gross national product that devoted to health in 1972-73 was 4.6 per cent, which rose to 5.6 per cent in 1974. I submit that all this is evidence of my concern for the health services and I want to assure the House that that concern will continue.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that there are difficult choices to be made in determining priorities in our health services.  Deputy Haughey put forward one priority and I have listed some of mine.  My job is to make the choice between the desirable options available.  It is perfectly clear that we cannot have everything we need all at once.  The way in which we set about making our choices, how we generate genuine discussion and study of the choices available, and how we make the best use of our available resources is very important.</P>
    <P>I am constantly studying this problem.  This is my job as Minister for Health.  We have also discussed the question a number of times in this House during the last two years, during Estimate debates, Questions, debates on regulations and again today.  I believe the time has come to broaden the debate by extending it to the professions, administrators and members of health boards involved in delivering the services.  The beginning of this process of discussion and consultation outside the House will take place at a seminar on health policy on 15th, 16th and 17th May.  I hope this will be a major event in the development of our health services.  It will provide an opportunity for representatives of the medical and nursing professions, health administrators, representatives of para-medical personnel and the trade unions to come together to out-line their views on the needs of our health services and their future development.</P>
    <P>I have felt for some time that it was desirable to have such a seminar with the professional people concerned to discuss fully and freely the <Col N="330" /> problems we face in developing the health services.  We will all have the opportunity to explain openly our ideas and hopes for the future in this vital area of social security.  I look forward to this seminar.  It will be the first of its kind here and one which I hope will achieve significant results. I was pleased with the response to this announcement and to my invitations. I have no doubt that the discussions will be of great value to Members when we come to debate health policy in the future.  We will continue to make the necessary decisions but we will all benefit from the advice of the professionals involved. This does not indicate that this House will be by-passed.  Having met the different organisations on various occasions and for different reasons I felt it would be a good thing if all the medical organisations joined together in a seminar to discuss health problems generally.  Unfortunately, they do not meet together and I only meet them singly.  In my view this is a good move but it does not mean that this House will be by-passed or that I am going to evade my responsibility as Minister for Health where these services are concerned.</P>

      <P>I support the motion. Those of us with a social conscience recognise the need for the updating of health factors particularly in relation to the weaker sections of the community, those over 65 years of age.  All too soon these people are forgotten. The health factor is an on-going matter and it must be updated accordingly.  It was in order for a rigid means test to be applied to applicants for medical cards when the scheme was introduced because there was a situation of complete stability at that time but at present we are told about the tragedy of people being on the poverty line. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare has informed us that many thousands are on the poverty line.  Some of the people specified in the motion are on the poverty line.</P>
      <P>Efforts must be made to ensure that the Minister and his Department are made aware of the problems we meet daily.  It is not enough for the Minister to indicate that he will oppose this motion.  If he opposes the motion it is an indication that he has little or no interest in the sections of the community referred to.  The motion deals with the weaker sections of the community who need medical attention. In many cases the people over 65 are forgotten and social workers are unable to locate them.  These people have rights and the State should ensure that they get the necessary facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is an effort to prick the social conscience of people in this regard.  In the first year of Government by the National Coalition we heard a lot of talk about free health services.  What free health services mean and what the people understand them to be are two different things. The people should be made aware of the benefits they are entitled to because <Col N="332" /> a large section of the community are unaware of them.  The Minister should not discard this motion simply because it was tabled by Deputy Haughey.  He should give it serious consideration and see if reliefs can be given.  Two Government back-benchers who spoke seemed to be in favour of the motion and this indicates that there is no clear-cut thought in relation to health factors. Some of those contributions were valid and the Minister should give consideration to them.</P>
    <P>No fair-minded Minister could say that people over 65 years of age are not entitled to the necessary medical facilities free.  While there are people over that age who have means there are others who are unwanted and turn up in statistics presented by the Departments of Health and Social Welfare as people on or below the poverty line.  When we were told that 60,000 people were unemployed some time ago we were also informed that 25,000 people were living on or below the poverty line.  Now that we have unemployment running at the rate of 100,000, that figure must have increased drastically.  We must examine the situation in relation to present-day circumstances.  Change in circumstances and in demand at any given time are factors that must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The case of widows must be examined also, as referred to in the second part of Deputy Haughey's motion.  We know that many such people are disowned by their families, are living alone and are in need of treatment.  I met one widow last week who had to pay for her prescriptions. No doubt she got some recompense afterwards.  That woman was suffering from a heart complaint.  Her problem was that, when she received her tablets, she took the prescribed amount the first day&mdash;that being four tablets daily&mdash;and, in order to stretch them out, she took two on the second day, one on the third day and so on until the supply had been exhausted. In that case the prescription and treatment given to that woman were of no value whatsoever because she could not take the tablets in the <Col N="333" /> quantity prescribed.  She did not even have the capacity to pay the amount indicated earlier by the Minister which she could later reclaim.</P>
    <P>These factors must be taken into consideration by the Minister and he should not classify every widow in the same way.  If the Minister said he was prepared to give comprehensive consideration to the various groups, that he would sift out to see if there were deserving elements within those groups, then I would say the Minister was going some way towards meeting their needs and that he had the type of social conscience we are led to believe he possesses.  But there are people within each social group who are in great want and who must be facilitated at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>With regard to long-term illnesses, we have now a new group suffering from one or other type of tropical disease.  I refer to men who have returned after service in Cyprus, the Congo and elsewhere.  I am certain that in ensuing years we will be faced with a new group of diseases requiring long-term comprehensive assistance. In this respect also the Minister must indicate to the House that he is prepared to up-date and meet this general trend.  We will have people with long-term illnesses, new diseases, as is evident now from our people who have returned from service abroad.  Were the Minister to indicate that he would undertake a basic examination of deserving cases, there would be some ray of light for them.</P>
    <P>Quite an amount was said about medical cards and the difficulty experienced in obtaining them, about their withdrawal and the guidelines attached to their issue.  Some of the people indicated in the motion&mdash; people over 65 years of age and widows&mdash;may have had their medical cards withdrawn for no apparent reason.  The Minister is aware, just as is every Member of this House, that the older a person becomes so also the more forgetful he becomes. Such people may not answer letters. Because of literacy problems, some of them may be unable to do so. They may be people who have few <Col N="334" /> friends who could assist them in this matter.  There should be widespread examination of the problems outlined in Deputy Haughey's motion, with some indication from the Minister that he recognises that, somewhere within those groups, there are deserving cases.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy Dr. Gibbons wants to speak on this and that Deputy Haughey will be winding up. This serious situation has built up over a considerable period.  The withdrawal of medical cards alone would necessitate the putting down of a motion such as this, so that the Minister and his Department would take a new look not alone at the guidelines for their issue or withdrawal but at all matters affecting people entitled to them.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have spoken already on the other aspects of the motion before the House.  I would ask the Minister to give us some ray of hope that he will examine in some depth the subject matter of this motion. If he has not sufficient money to alleviate the situation generally, at least he should give an assurance that deserving cases would receive sympathetic consideration at the earliest possible opportunity.  There must be identifiable deserving cases in urgent need of attention and of the medical services to which Deputy Haughey referred.  The motion has been put down in order to bring to the attention of the Minister the desirability and necessity of up-dating these services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few points to make on this motion.  First, as the Minister has said, money is scarce for medicine.  It is natural also that money is scarce for the people who want to avail of it.  Medicine is becoming dearer for this reason.  It must be accepted that medical card entitlement must be extended from one year <Col N="335" /> to another.  I am one of the doctors who worked under the various authorities who carried on the health services for the past 30 years, from the time of the health boards to the county councils and now back to the health boards.  I remember almost 30 years ago, when I sought the appointment I now hold, the then county manager pointed out to me that from the statistics available to him at the time the number of people entitled to free medical services amounted to 15 per cent.  At present at least 55 per cent of the people in my area are medical cardholders.  This is a strange happening at a time when the country is supposed to be becoming more affluent, with money becoming more plentiful and employment more extensive. That conveys to me but one thing&mdash;and it becomes more and more obvious to me within the walls of this House&mdash;that the old standard for deciding entitlement to free medical services, which was the inability of a person to provide for his own medical services, has gone by the board and that all the political parties at present are, for all practical purposes, engaged in a race to extend medical services as part of the extension of the social services, the social system and indeed the social philosophy of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be accepted that, at a time when hospital expenses are free to from 80 per cent to 95 per cent of the people, the number of medical card holders has been increased. When I started in medicine hospital services were free to the very few only and medical cards&mdash;or red tickets as they were then&mdash;were much fewer in number.  I have no doubt whatever, irrespective of what party may be in Government, that if the money was available we would have a completely free medical service here.  I would have no objection to it at present. I would have raised a very big objection to it in the past because under that old system, particularly when the medical card was issued first, I found my private practice being eroded by the extension of the medical card without adequate financial <Col N="336" /> compensation to meet such a contingency.  We got the increases sought from time to time but they were not commensurate.  Fortunately three or four past Ministers and the Department were wise and farsighted enough to see that the fee-for-service system would be acceptable to the doctors.  In this was a built-in compensation for the extra patients on the workload.</P>
    <P>Some months ago a conflict seemed to be developing between the doctors and the Minister but fortunately it was settled.  The doctors appeared more or less satisfied with it.  Much was made of the fact that doctors were earning very big incomes under the fee-for-service system.  I tried to get figures before the House and the public although that was not my main aim.  I wanted to put on record the back-up behind the earning of those figures.  I failed to do that.  I realised that the system of Question Time does not permit this.  Nevertheless in my opinion there was some unfairness to the doctors in the way the questions were answered.</P>
    <P>Last week's <i>Medical Journal</i> published a doctor's income from the medical service over his own name. This is the way the situation should be analysed.  I know from experience that anyone who earns good money under this system works very hard. Because I can come to this House I am probably the wrong person to make this case, but these are the facts.  If a doctor earns a lot of money in general practice at present he is working very hard.  Others are working hard too and are probably not compensated so we cannot make an issue of it.</P>
    <P>If I had money to spend on the medical services at present I would try to provide teeth and spectacles for the people who need them, particularly those in the lower and middle income groups.  I find it heartbreaking to put down a person's name for a clinic knowing in my heart that he will not be called for examination by a specialist for perhaps six to 12 months.  This should be stopped.  If the Minister can stop this but does nothing else for the next 12 months <Col N="337" /> unfortunately he will earn the gratitude of so many people that it will sway a general election against us.</P>
    <P>It is also heartbreaking when a child studying for his intermediate or leaving certificate examination comes to me and complains that he cannot study because he needs glasses.  I put his name down and know that his examination will be over before he is called to see the specialist.  I sincerely ask the Minister to try to break this backlog by using whatever money is available to him.  There may not be specialists available to examine these people&mdash;I am talking about people needing glasses in particular&mdash;but a special case should be made for children so that they can be sent to the specialist to have their eyes examined. It could be arranged that the specialist would be paid a fee and these children would get their glasses through the health board.  I am speaking now of those with medical cards.</P>
    <P>Teeth are another problem.  Dentists tell me that teeth for people over a certain age are a poor investment. I do not want to be jocose about this but one might feel that for nutritional reasons a mincemeat instrument would be more valuable to them than teeth although teeth may be necessary for cosmetic reasons.  There is another group in the middle income group who, through their own resources, cannot provide themselves with teeth.  The Minister should try to provide teeth for them by subsidising them to a certain extent, perhaps 50 per cent, and they will provide the rest themselves.  If the Minister did those two things he would be helping more people than he would believe.</P>
    <P>There are other points I could make but Deputy Haughey wants to speak. Finally, again I appeal to the Minister if possible to provide the money to break this backlog of people waiting for glasses.  If he does that he will be doing a good job for medicine.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to express my appreciation of the manner in which this motion has been dealt with by the House and the attitude in which it has been discussed.  I want to make a few very brief comments <Col N="338" /> on what the Minister had to say.  We all admit that his announcement about the health seminar was a very good parliamentary tactic to divert attention from the fact that he is forced to reject this motion.  It is quite clearly a motion which should appeal to him in every way and of which, he admits in principle he is all in favour.  I do not want to make any point about the health seminar, but I would have thought that as a matter of courtesy we, on the Opposition benches, would have been invited to participate.  I am certain that is an oversight on the Minister's part because one thing that can be said about the Minister is that he is a courteous gentleman at all times.  We will be able to benefit from anything said at that seminar because I presume the results will be published.</P>
      <P>I was a little surprised at the Minister's statement that he wishes to proceed in all health matters on the basis of the widest possible consultation with all the professional bodies concerned. I understand that one of the severe criticisms made of him in this regard is that there was no consultation when he extended the hospital service.  He made a flat-footed statement to the effect that the extension was to take place without any prior consultation with the professional bodies and organisations concerned.</P>
      <P>There is not a great deal more to be said about this motion at this stage. The point made by the Minister about legal difficulties is again a debating tactic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read this section very carefully and it seems to be as clear-cut, definite and precise as any legislation I have ever come across.  If there is some doubt in the Minister's advisers' minds about the legality of what I propose, that could be simply cleared up.  However, I would have no hesitation whatsoever in stating that if the Minister wishes to make this order, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, as the motion asks, I do not think there would be any difficulty arising from any direction.  It is quite clear why the Minister was <Col N="339" /> forced into the humiliating position of rejecting this motion.  He had, in so many words, to admit to this House that there is not one penny available to him from the Exchequer at this time to give effect to anything which is so clearly desirable and acceptable as the extensions proposed in this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very interested in the Minister's estimate of a cost of £15 million for what I proposed, and that it would bring the number of those eligible up from 35 per cent of the population to somewhere between 60 and 65 per cent.  My estimate on both these counts was less.  I had calculated that the cost would be in the region of £8 to £10 million and that it would have brought the number of those eligible up to between 50 and 55 per cent of the population.  Are the Minister's calculations accurate?  Is he taking into account the effect of recent pay increases, particularly the pay increases envisaged under the new national pay agreement?  Even if the <Col N="340" /> Minister said to the House: &ldquo;This motion involves me in an expenditure of £15 million which I cannot afford&rdquo;, I would have thought he would have suggested some amendment to the terms of my motion.  In fact, when I was introducing the motion I indicated that some such amendments would be quite acceptable to me.  If £40 was too high I would have thought the Minister would have suggested £38; if 65 years of age was too low, he could have suggested amending the motion to 68 or 70 years of age. The simple fact is that here we have a Labour Minister for Health forced by the mismanagement of the country's finances to reject this very commendable improvement in the health services.  It proves conclusively and clearly that the finances of the country have been grossly mismanaged by this Government to the extent that a Labour Minister for Health cannot budge one inch on a motion which he admits is entirely acceptable to him in principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to Private Members' Business I was making some points about the proposal before the House for agreement on the international energy programme.  The basic assumption behind any legislation or agreement laid before this House is that the problem concerned has been examined by the Government and that being so, that they prepare and introduce either a Bill for the consideration of the Oireachtas or, as in this case, an international agreement.</P>
      <P>It is assumed, too, that the Bill or the agreement introduced is, in the opinion of the Government of the day, a solution to the problem that presents itself.  The problem in question here is that of sources of energy and the way in which the various energy supplies are shared and used.</P>
      <P>From our experience during the past number of years we have had the problem of control by multi-national oil companies of the energy needs of this country.  When the Minister is recommending this agreement to the House I shall assume it to be his considered opinion that the agreement we would enter into, that is, assuming the House so agrees, would be the solution to the control of our energy sources by the multi-nationals and would solve the problem.  On page 1 of the agreement before us we read that the Government of the Republic of Austria and various other countries, including our own, desire to promote secure oil supplies on reasonable and equitable terms.  If we turn, then, to page 79 of the agreement we note what is meant in the agreement by the words &ldquo;equitable terms&rdquo;.  This phrase brings us back to the whole question of the problem of the control by multi-nationals. There are set out various systems of voting in the event of a decision having to be made within the terms of this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of voting seems reasonable and fair but when one considers the implication in that suggested system, one is confronted with this whole problem of control by multi-national companies because the system <Col N="343" /> of voting is weighted very heavily against smaller countries such as ours. I would recommend, for example, that the percentage of oil imported into any country is the system that should be used rather than the system of oil consumed.  The present system is weighted completely in favour of America, Canada and the Netherlands. Together, those three countries can control any vote or decision under this agreement.</P>

      <P>On a point of order&mdash; could we have a quorum because there are seven people from the Opposition side present and the Minister has no back-up at all?  Obviously, the Government do not seem to be a bit interested in this extremely important agreement which they have signed blindfolded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that in the introduction of any agreement or Bill the basic assumption is that the Bill or agreement will solve a particular problem.  The particular problem now is the control of our energy resources from outside this State lying in the hands of the multi-national organisations.  The proposal the Minister has before him, instead of removing this control, merely compounds the difficulty.  I suggest that the Minister should bring back this agreement and do as the French Government have very wisely done, excuse ourselves from participating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowhere is this control by the multi-nationals more obvious than when it comes to voting rights.  There, the multi-nationals have complete control through their Governments. The Dutch, the Americans and the Canadians through their block voting can control any decision under this agreement for the benefit of their multi-national oil companies.  We know the problems these oil companies can create and have created.  We do not have to go outside this city to see these problems.  This has been brought home to us for some days past when we have a clamp-down on <Col N="344" /> industry because of the decisions of oil companies and workers particularly dealing with oil companies.</P>
    <P>If we had a nationally-owned oil company, as in most other countries in Europe and in the world, we would have some control over the importation and distribution of natural resources&mdash;oil and others.  It seems obvious that we have such resources on our shores.  This control should be in the hands of the Oireachtas and the people.  The Minister is suggesting that we hand over further control to the multi-nationals instead of reducing their powers and our reliance upon the structure operating at present.  That structure is such that you have multi-national companies trading under various names basically owned by the countries in which their main offices exist, the American, Canadian and Dutch organisations.</P>
    <P>I would have assumed that the Minister, having recognised this problem after the October war with all the difficulties we experienced with supplies and the distressing queues outside petrol stations, the shortages experienced and the effect on industry, and recognising the problems that have arisen again in the past few days when we are again facing oil and petrol shortages at a time when we have over 103,000 unemployed and a situation arising because of control by multi-nationals in which more people are to be thrown out of employment, would not seriously consider pushing this agreement through the House.  One would imagine that having heard the arguments made by various spokesmen on the Opposition side, the Minister would see the wisdom of the case made and accept that it is wrong at this time to hand further control to the oil companies through their national Governments.  Instead, we should be setting up our own organisation to explore and exploit our energy resources and distribute the imports that it is necessary to import through a national company rather than through the present multi-national system which has fallen down and proved to be a complete disaster.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph of the agreements states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" />
      <i>Determined</i> to take common effective measures to meet oil supply emergencies by developing an emergency self-sufficiency in oil supplies, restraining demand and allocating available oil among their countries on an equitable basis, </P>
    <P>Is the Minister seriously suggesting that by signing an international agreement it will be honoured in the event of an oil crisis similar to that experienced in 1973?  I would remind the Minister of the problems of some of our EEC partners when they were boycotted by the Arab exporters after the October War.  Is he seriously suggesting that we should hand over our natural resources to outside control to be shared if an emergency faces those countries and then find that we are not able to enjoy reciprocal arrangements if the problem hits us?</P>
    <P>In the last few weeks on the international level many verbal and written agreements have been dishonoured. Agreements were solemnly signed in Paris not long ago but now countries have been overrun despite the agreements.  I do not want to use the word &ldquo;dishonour&rdquo;&mdash;it is a bit strong&mdash;but these are the same countries who have found themselves unable to fulfil solemn promises given because of domestic political pressure.  Does the Minister not think if the same situation arose with regard to an oil shortage that these same governments would not make similar decisions?  I do not think he is seriously suggesting that we have a greater hold over these governments than had nations in which they had invested billions of dollars.  I am convinced that if there was pressure on the domestic scene in their own countries the governments concerned would drop this agreement like a hot potato if it did not suit them.</P>
    <P>Why is this agreement being proposed in the first place?  The Minister is merely going along with something that has come from Big Brother.  The reason for the agreement and for the fact that Ireland has been named is because we are a potential source of energy, now recognised on an international <Col N="346" /> level, to be explored and exploited. However, now is not the time to hand over our potential resources to the multi-nationals, as is suggested in the Minister's proposal.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 of the agreement reads:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Desiring</i> to promote co-operative relations with oil producing countries and with other oil consuming countries, including those of the developing world, through a purposeful dialogue, as well as through other forms of co-operation, to further the opportunities for a better understanding between consumer and producer countries.</P>
    <P>That reads well but we need go back no longer than one week to the recent attempt to hold a conference in Paris between the exporting and importing countries.  Where was international agreement and mutual understanding then?  It was not even possible for both sides to agree on an agenda for debate.  It is fine to talk about promoting co-operative relations with oil-producing countries and other oil consuming countries but it does not work out in practice and only a week ago this was proved.  The producers and the consumers&mdash;mainly the EEC countries and the United States&mdash;came together in Paris to attempt to work out what is included in the paragraph of the agreement but they could not even agree on a basic agenda.  Members of the Oireachtas who may be involved in outside organisations know that even though there may be disagreements at least it is possible to work out an agenda.  Unfortunately this was not what happened in Paris.</P>
    <P>In the teeth of all that happened in the last few weeks, the Minister is pushing for acceptance by the House of the agreement.  Instead of helping the Minister is exacerbating the situation and I hope he will have the wisdom to withdraw this agreement.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 of the agreement reads:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Desiring</i> to play a more active role in relation to the oil industry by establishing a comprehensive international information system and a permanent framework for consultation with oil companies.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quoting from paragraph five on page one of the proposed agreement:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Mindful</i> of the interests of other oil consuming countries, including those of the developing world.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Desiring</i> to play a more active role in relation to the oil industry by establishing a comprehensive international information system and a permanent framework for consultation with oil companies.</P>
      <P>If ever there was a paragraph designed at the behest of the multi-national oil companies this must be a classical example.  If any sovereign government were to take the initiative and establish their own oil company for exploration and exploitation and if that company were to be successful, in case these multi-national companies missed out on securing this information, we have here at the suggestion of the Minister for Transport and Power a motion to accept an agreement to hand over information to these multi-national bodies so that they could have a cut of the action.  I suggest that whichever portion of this agreement should be excluded this paragraph is one because by it we would be forced within three months to hand over knowledge acquired by us in difficult and trying circumstances at the request of any other country.</P>
      <P>We know that three countries control 90 per cent of the multi-national organisations and in case any countries have the gall to break away from the multi-nationals, the Minister is suggesting that we should hand over any information we may acquire to the multi-nationals, and no country could break away from the iron grip of the multi-nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know what the Labour Party think about this section of the proposed agreement.  We hear a lot of talk from the various spokesmen of the Labour Party, of the various wings of that party, of the various wings within wings of the Labour Party, against multi-national <Col N="348" /> control.  I assume that if the Minister proceeds with this motion and if there is a vote on it, the Labour Deputies will follow him into the lobby because I do not believe they would bring down the Government on this issue.  They will be in absolute contradiction of everything they preach about multi-national control because by this paragraph of this agreement we are to hand over to the multi-nationals any hard-won knowledge we may gain of resources around our shores or under our soil, and we must hand this over within three months.  Even if we have only a whisper of the likelihood of an oil find, according to this agreement we must within a very limited time hand over the full details to the US or any other country that controls the multi-nationals.</P>
    <P>May we assume that the Labour Party will follow the very wise lead given by Fianna Fáil on this agreement, that it be rejected, as the French Government did, having looked at it?  We come on to page two of the proposed agreement:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Determined</i> to reduce their dependence on imported oil by undertaking long term co-operative efforts on conservation of energy, on accelerated development of alternative sources of energy, on research and development in the energy field and on uranium enrichment,</P>
    <P>The clause states:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Considering</i> the special responsibility of governments for energy supply.</P>
    <P>These two sentences are linked. If one takes the last one, the special responsibility of Governments for energy supply, the record of this Government is without doubt the most appalling in the history of the State.  They have a special responsibility to find energy supplies but what have we had?  We have had the Minister for Industry and Commerce, a Labour Minister, coming before the House and promising that he would make a decision on oil, oil companies and so on, sometime before Christmas but, as the newspapers said, he did not say which Christmas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> This happened at a time when the Minister for Transport and Power was asking us in this House to ratify an agreement committing us to find alternative energy supplies.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce by taking a simple decision could have got things moving.  We are all aware that from geological tests that have been made there are indications that if the Minister would make the necessary decisions we could improve our chances of finding alternative energy sources.  One Minister is asking us to ratify an agreement saying we have a responsibility to find energy sources and another Minister is sitting on the matter and refusing to make any decision.</P>
    <P>The present costs of petrol and oil are exorbitant.  Part of the costs, of course, is outside the control of the Government, but much of it is within the control of the Government.  I would remind the House of the scene here just before Christmas when the Minister for Finance brought before us a measure which slapped on nearly £30 million of taxation in one night without even the courtesy of a vote.  Because of the increase in the cost of oil many of the other forms of power which up to now appeared to be too expensive should be examined. The Minister should reject this agreement and set up our own energy board to examine some of the proposals which should have been examined before now.  The Minister, having been in power for two years when this problem arose, should have been in the lead so far as finding alternative energy sources was concerned. We have had promises and talk from the Minister but very little action.  Our national fuel bill is increasing at a massive rate.</P>
    <P>What action has the Minister taken in the sphere of atomic energy?  Does he think that because we have used oil and petrol up to now we cannot use anything else, or does he find himself in the situation in which the Minister for Health was this evening of thinking that an idea is a good one but having to vote against it because the money is not available, but of <Col N="350" /> course not admitting that the money is not available?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to proceed rapidly with the examination of alternative sources of energy such as atomic energy, solar energy&mdash; although we have very little of that in this country&mdash;and energy provided by wind.  I am not suggesting this on a national basis but surely there are villages and towns that could, with modern techniques, be harnessing the wind or solar power for conversion into energy.  As an island nation there is also the possibility for us of tidal power.  I am not saying this would be the overall solution but it is something that could be examined. As far as I know, no such examinations are taking place.</P>
    <P>Surely in the light of the price increases that have taken place in the case of oil, both at international and domestic level, the Minister for Transport and Power has a responsibility to examine all alternative sources of supply.  Surely they could go some way towards solving the problem on a local basis, and every little helps.  There is also the question of conservation of energy which would include the proper insulation of houses, the proper use of the energy that is being expended. Some of the alternative sources may seem revolutionary but it is always wise to examine all the possibilities.</P>
    <P>We have one alternative source of energy, turf, which has been used by Bord na Móna to generate electricity. They have reached their borrowing limit.  The Minister promised to introduce a Bill to extend the borrowing power of Bord na Móna.  We have heard the promise but we have not seen the Bill.  All the development under the control of Bord na Móna which would be of benefit to the country is at a standstill while we await the introduction of a Bill by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It deals with the responsibility of Governments for energy supply.  Our Government's responsibility for energy supply has been partially met in the past by the activities and operations of Bord na Móna.  Through their inactivity the Government are allowing Bord na Móna to run down and they are not meeting their responsibilities.  The Minister is trying to impose this agreement on us and we are rejecting it.  I would ask him to meet his commitment and to improve the position of Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>This agreement is weighted in favour of the multi-national oil companies.  It was designed by their Governments and most of them are Government controlled.  Seeing their existing control of the international scene declining this is a last ditch attempt to shore up the position of the multi-national oil companies at the expense of independent nations such as Ireland.  Since this motion was introduced in October or November, we have seen the respect some of those Governments have for international commitments when they are under domestic pressure.  I hope the Minister will agree to withdraw this proposed agreement which would involve us with countries which have shown such total disregard for international agreements when it suited them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the agreement is totally contrary to the expressed views of one of the partners in the National Coalition, the Labour Party, who bleat about controls by multi-national companies.  This compounds the felony.  It offers control to the multi-nationals at the expense of our own country which is now recognised as having a potential so far as oil and other forms of energy are concerned.  If ever there was a wrong time to enter into an agreement, if ever there was a wrong agreement to enter into, this is it.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw this document and introduce legislation&mdash;which I <Col N="352" /> am sure will have the backing of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;to control our resources for the benefit of the people of Ireland and not of the multi-nationals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this motion. As reported in Volume 279, column 1927 of the Official Report of 17th April, 1975, Deputy Barrett said:</P>
      <P>Since the oil crisis in October, 1973, it was only right that every effort should have been made at national and international level to solve this problem so vital to the economic life of oil-importing countries.  We have had a number of debates on this problem in an effort to find some solution.  The first step to deal with this on-going crisis should be taken at home...</P>
      <P>It is farcical to ask us to accept this motion in view of the fact that the Government have no energy policy. The Government should present an energy policy to the House.  We should know the exact resources which are available.  Over the past number of years there have been a number of debates on the problem of oil finds and the problem of oil scarcity.  Deputy Barrett also said:</P>
      <P>At the time of the crisis it was admitted by the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that we were completely in the hands of the multi-national oil companies.</P>
      <P>Without an energy policy and without knowing the facts in relation to the resources available here, we are asked to put it on the line with these countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the UK and the USA.  We can see at a glance that in France, one of our partners in the EEC, where they have made a proper and comprehensive study of the fuel situation and their own fuel prospects they have decided to opt out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should like to know what the position is in relation to Norway.  It was specifically mentioned by the <Col N="353" /> Minister.  Speaking about the energy crisis at column 1920 of Volume 279 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It was in this context that the Washington Energy Conference took place in February, 1974.  This conference, which was convened by the United States and attended by nine member states of the EEC, Canada, Japan and Norway...</P>
    <P>Apparently Norway has some strange attachment to this particular grouping to which the Minister wants us to align ourselves.  How are we to indicate the resources available here when we do not know what they are? What will we barter?  Do we propose to align ourselves with the groups the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Industry and Commerce said we are in the hands of, the multi-national companies?</P>
    <P>Taking just three of the countries, the United States has a voting rate of 51, the Netherlands has a voting rate of five and Canada has a voting rate of eight.  These three can outvote all the others.  The Minister wants to force us into a situation of which he disapproved in a previous debate &mdash;it was undesirable to be in the hands of multi-national companies. As a result of this agreement we will be in a position in which three multi-nationals can dictate the terms.  This is an undesirable situation.  It cannot be tolerated.  We cannot tolerate selling out to the multi-nationals.</P>
    <P>We must know what we have to offer.  Neither the Minister nor the Government know what we have.  It has become apparent that we have resources and efforts are being made to find new sources of supply around our coast and throughout the country, with some success, but we have not got the whole picture.  Until such time as we have the whole picture we cannot decide on an energy policy of our own.  We must know what our needs are, what requirements we have, our production capacity and the availability of supply.  It is farcical to have the Minister tell us we will align ourselves with these great nations, three of <Col N="354" /> which can dictate the terms, when we do not know exactly what we have to offer.  It may well be desirable for one reason or another to have some alignment in relation to an international energy policy, but there are certain questions which must be asked.</P>
    <P>Japan's combined voting rate is 18 as against our rate of three.  What has Japan to offer us?  What contribution would Japan make to solving our problem?  Japan is far removed from Europe.  We may have more resources available than the Japanese have.  How concerned, I wonder, are the Japanese about our problem? How concerned are the multi-nationals in the US about our problems, except to extract the last dollar from us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke and others referred to the Dutch and the Canadians.  We do not want another sell out.  This is not a secret agreement but we had agreements in the past which were a sell out.  We must examine this in great depth.  In relation to the oil consuming voting rates, we have no voting rate and neither has Luxembourg. All the others have.  We will be a little pebble in a big pool, dictated to by the multi-nationals.  In the past these were regarded as highly undesirable people with whom to be associated by both the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Speaking at column 1927 of Volume 279 of the Official Report, Deputy Barrett said:</P>
    <P>This is the situation in which we still find ourselves, and it is not a very pleasant one.  Our economy is virtually controlled by these multi-nationals who are pretty ruthless. We should take steps to get out from under the umbrella of these multi-national concerns.  There is no evidence of effective action being taken in this regard and we are as subject to the whims of the boards of these companies as we were in October, 1973... I cannot see anything in this agreement which will release us from this control by these oil companies.  We <Col N="355" /> should recognise that oil supplies are not scarce; what affects us is the control of the supplies and their cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett dealt in great depth with costs and supplies.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be serious about every single page of this 108-page agreement, but we must extract additional information now from the Minister.  For instance, what will be the relationship of Norway to the group?  The French have not aligned themselves.  Why?  We must know the answers if we are to assess the situation factually and effectively.  Where Norway is concerned, is there a loose arrangement, a definite arrangement, or no arrangement at all?  Is it a tight arrangement?  The House demands the answers to these questions. We can assess the situation in relation to the US, the UK, Turkey, Sweden, Switzerland, Holland, Italy, Germany, Canada, Belgium and Austria.  What is the arrangement where Norway is concerned?  The Minister should be able to give us that information.  If the Minister is withholding information that is a very serious matter.  The conference was convened by the US and attended by the nine member states of the EEC, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>The representative from Ireland must be aware of the Norwegian situation and the point of view put forward by that country.  Could we have that so that we can assess it fully?  I can understand the situation if the Minister says he has not the information available.  I assume he has it but does not want to convey to the House the full facts in relation to the conference held in February, 1974.  I suppose there is no way of extracting information from the Minister now if he does not want us to have it.  We have no information other than that contained in this document.</P>
    <P>We could deal with this document in relation to the sections which affect us most or we could deal with it page by page.  I do not mind what way we deal with it.  We can deal with it page by page and ask the Minister to reply to the various questions we raise.  It <Col N="356" /> will be much better if the Minister disposes of the questions as we go along.  The Minister did not tell us about Norway.  Perhaps he was not at the conference at all or he was not fully briefed.  If he was there he must have reported back.</P>

We must make up our minds, first of all, if we are to be little fish in the big pond or if there will be outside influences, such as the Norwegians.  Can the Minister tell us what the point of view of the French is, because it is not in the document we received?  We are just told that France will not participate.  We want to know why France is not aligned with this group?</P>
      <P>We have an alignment with France in the EEC.  I assume, as Deputy Barrett stated, that France made a comprehensive study of the energy situation in relation to her own country and the availability of resources, old and new.  I am sure France considered the situation in the widest possible way and as a result has opted out.  Is that the factual situation?  The person who attended the conference in Washington must have brought back that information and it would be of great help to us in the further consideration that will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to know exactly why one of our partners in the EEC opted out of this agreement.  This may become a compelling factor in deciding if we should opt out.  All <Col N="357" /> available information should be presented to the House in a matter such as this.  During the course of the discussion Deputies should be fed with the information they require.  It could happen that many of the other countries, Denmark, Belgium or Austria, might have the same problem we have.  They may be discussing it in their parliaments at the moment.  If that is the case I am sure they are asking the same questions.  The Minister assumes all those countries will sign.  The Japanese will tell the Italians, the Italians will tell the Germans, the Germans will tell the Swedes to watch Ireland.  What has Japan to offer us?</P>

The Minister's brief should have been comprehensive and given us a clear and concise view of what happened at the all-important conference. I think it was the Minister for Foreign Affairs who attended that conference.  Perhaps the Government are in the same position as the Opposition Deputies, that they do not know what it is all about or cannot assess it fully.  In relation to <Col N="358" /> the non-availability of information about France and Norway the Minister has said he will tell us at the end of the debate, but that is not much help to people who want to make contributions.  We will certainly not sell out to the multi-nationals.  It has been pointed out that three of this group can decide by their votes what decision will be taken.</P>

      <P>I have given the Deputy a lot of latitude but he is repeating himself persistently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not dealt with the general voting weights.  I spoke about the combined voting weights.  On the general voting weights we have three votes but when it comes to the combined voting weights we still have only three while the US, who have only three in the general voting weights, have 51 in the combined voting rates.  The Netherlands have five as against three and Canada have eight as against three. We are on a par with Luxembourg, a country with a population of 200,000 compared with our population of 3,500,000.  There is something wrong there.  It is obvious that someone was mitching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how one can sensibly deal with this because we do not know how the other countries will assist or what their requirements will be.  We have no energy policy of our own but we are trying to solve the energy problems of the world, a most amazing situation.  One of our Ministers went to Washington and discussed in detail the energy problems of almost the entire globe in spite of the fact that we have no energy policy.  Without an energy policy of our own, it is difficult for us to help in dealing with the problems of the world.  Apparently our Government work in reverse.  They deal with the big problem first on the basis that the <Col N="359" /> big fellows will solve our problem. The country was sold out on a previous occasion and we cannot allow it to be sold out on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Article 25 of the agreement states:</P>
    <P>The system shall be operated on a permanent basis, both under normal conditions and during emergencies, and in a manner which ensures the confidentiality of the information made available.</P>
    <P>To whom will this information be made available?  The information would not be very confidential if it was made available to all these countries.  This is another joke.  Now we have the situation that the Minister does not know, and his colleague, on his return from Washington, did not tell him.  I sympathise with the Minister on being sent into this House to pilot this motion through without being briefed by the Minister who went to Washington.  It is unfair to expect this Minister to do that.  The Minister who went to Washington should be present to answer the questions in relation to the agreement.  If this is an open Government with collective responsibility, surely one Minister has nothing to hide from another.  It is pathetic that this Minister was not supplied with any information by his colleague who attended the conference in Washington.  On the basis that the Minister was not advised and that he is doing his best under difficult circumstances I will be lenient with him.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy Barrett pointed out that the US imports 20 per cent of its oil needs and produces 80 per cent.  He pointed out that in an emergency the US could produce 100 per cent of its requirements.  The Americans are aware of the amount of oil in the ground in their country. In my view the Americans will purchase oil from outside until those resources dry up and then they will have their own resources for many years to come.  We have not been told what the other countries involved in this agreement have to offer us.  The information will be confidential and <Col N="360" /> we do not know whether Norway will be in or out.  We do not know what assistance we will get from the Japanese.  The Minister who went to Washington did not bring back any information; the Minister for Transport and Power is unable to give us information and the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that we are in the hands of multi-nationals.  We are being asked to vote ourselves fully into the hands of multi-nationals now and give our confidential information to every Tom, Dick and Harry across the globe.</P>
    <P>Article 33 of the agreement states:</P>
    <P>Under the special section, the participating countries shall, on a regular basis, make available to the secretariat information on the precise data identified in accordance with Article 34 on the following subjects:</P>
    <P> (a)  oil consumption and supply;</P>
    <P>(b)  demand restraint measures;</P>
    <P>(c)  levels of emergency supplies;</P>
    <P>(d)  availability and utilisation of transportation facilities; </P>
    <P>The restraint measures and conservation programme have been in operation here for some time.  We had an adjustment of the speed limits from 60 mph to 50 mph and back up to 60 mph again.  That was to be our great effort to conserve energy.  We also had the fellow on television burning the £1 note.  We will be laughed out of this group if we participate.  Nobody should attempt to join this group unless they have done their homework, something we have not done.</P>
    <P>On emergency reserves the agreement states:</P>
    <P>Total oil stocks are measured according to the OECD and EEC definitions, revised as follows:</P>
    <P>A. Stocks included:</P>
    <P>&mdash;in refinery tanks</P>
    <P>&mdash;in pipeline tankage</P>
    <P>&mdash;  in bulk terminals. </P>
    <P>Stocks excluded are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;in pipelines</P>
    <P>&mdash;in rail tank cars</P>
    <P>&mdash;in truck tank cars</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" />&mdash;in seagoing ships' bunkers</P>
    <P>&mdash;in service stations and retail stores</P>
    <P>&mdash;  in tankers at sea. </P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand that article.  &ldquo;Emergency reserves&rdquo; are mentioned also.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us how one can define what constitutes stocks.  If it is in pipeline tankage, that constitutes stocks of oil; if it is in the pipeline, it does not.  If it is in rail tank cars, that does not constitute a stock of oil.  If it is in barges, it does constitute a stock of oil.  If it is in inter-coaster tankers it does constitute a stock of oil.  If it is in tankers at sea, that does not constitute a stock of oil; if it is in storage tank bottoms it does constitute a stock of oil.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain those definitions to us so that we would have a better understanding of what is and is not stock in relation to this agreement, because it is important to know exactly what we are speaking about.  To my mind stocks would be those held in rail tank cars, or in truck tank cars, seagoing ships, service stations and retail stores but those are excluded.  I think Deputy Barrett dealt with that problem on many occasions.  On the many occasions on which he spoke in this House he dealt with the problem of the price increases and the amount of money the Government allowed the oil companies to accumulate.  Perhaps I might be allowed quote from his speech in this House on Thursday, 17th April, 1975, at column 1931 as follows:</P>
    <P>Multi-nationals go on publishing and bragging about their huge profits.  One company brags about 175 million stock profits in the past year.  We form part of these stock profits and we permit that to happen.  Attaching ourselves to the outer UK zone has been a disaster since December, 1973, and it seems as if it will continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that an oil company need give only seven days' notice and then can increase the price of petrol.  There is not the same type <Col N="362" /> of restriction applicable to an increase in the price of fuel as to the price of other commodities.  These multi-nationals can do what they like. So long as they give the Minister seven days' notice they can shove up the digits on the petrol pumps.  This is an unsatisfactory situation and one with which Deputy Barrett dealt in depth.</P>
    <P>I shall not prolong discussion on that aspect&mdash;where tanks or bunkers were full; where, in some cases filling stations were full; where oil terminals had plenty of fuel and prices were increased with a colossal return of revenue to the oil companies, those multi-nationals spoken about in such harsh terms by many Government Ministers in the not too distant past.  They must have had a good time with them in Washington on that occasion because they seem now to be completely taken over by them and persuaded that it is their best interests to be associated with the multi-nationals who will soak and fleece them, and this nation, as far as they can.  We feel that is an undesirable situation which should not be allowed develop.</P>
    <P>Of course there are sources of energy other than crude oil or petrol. Indeed, if we consider the natural gas finds off Kinsale it is estimated that that particular find will give a 30 year supply to the mainland, anyway somewhere in that region.  If I am incorrect the Minister can correct me on that score.  I would hope we would not have to share that find with the Japanese.  I would hope that the citizens of this city and the Dublin Gas Company&mdash;the largest gas consumers in the country&mdash;would have available to them the natural gas found in the Kinsale strike and that we would not have to share our valuable assets with the Japanese, the Turks, or others.  I hope we will have a 30 year period of constant supply for the housewives of this country who are prepared to use natural gas. At least we have gone some of the way.  We know now we have some natural gas available, probably some petroleum available, and that we have other sources of energy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> The question of solid fuel was mentioned by Deputy R. P. Burke and indeed by others in the course of the debate.  We have the availability of our own resources at all times to the ESB and Bord na Móna.  Deputy R. P. Burke dealt with Bord na Móna in some depth, and indeed the gas company is also involved here.  We can observe the development of energy and power throughout the country.  Those of us who went to Turlough Hill to see the great engineering feat there, the additional sources of energy pumped into the system, designed and developed by Irish engineers and workmen, will be very aware of such progress.  Such progress must be continued, ensuring that we can meet our domestic needs. As is known now, there are sources beneath the earth.  There arises also the question of the production of peat by Bord na Móna, who have done a wonderful job.</P>
    <P>Are we to share such resources with the Japanese?  Will they be taking the briquettes out of our fires next?  Are we to share such with the Turks?  How are we to divide them up?  The Minister has not given us any indication how the divisions will be effected.  What will be the position of each of those countries, other than what is contained in this huge document of 108 pages and the Minister's brief of eight-and-a-half pages, which gives us no information whatever.</P>
    <P>We cannot leave ourselves vulnerable to outside sources, supplying them with information in respect of our affairs.  Tomorrow or the day after such people may be participating in one conflict or another and be fully conversant, on a confidential basis, with the location of our oil wells, or the supplies we may have of natural gas or oil.  In a situation like that how long would such supplies last? We must not sell out our resources on this occasion.  We must adopt a positive policy in relation to energy and fuel.  We must know exactly what are our resources, where we are going and what we will do.  Only after such assessment can we decide on an alignment. <Col N="364" /> When we have all the facts accumulated we can ascertain whether or not we have resources we want to share or do not want to share.  It is unfortunate that such information is not available to us at present.  The Minister is aware also that the necessary exploratory work has not been done in order to ascertain the resources available on the Continental Shelf or, indeed, on the mainland.  We know of some.  Therefore, we have quite an amount of homework to do before entering into the international field and selling out all our information to foreign powers.</P>
    <P>Conservation of energy is very important as was mentioned in Article 42 of the energy document. As I pointed out, our contribution has been the alteration of the speed limit and the burning of the £.  As the Minister mentioned, the television programme was very impressive.  I wonder what would other countries think of that as a conservation programme and that is the only positive step this Government have taken. They have now changed their minds. The Minister for Local Government changed his mind with the alteration of the clock&mdash;the clockwork Minister. He changed the speed limit with the hour.  On one occasion he told us this was to conserve fuel and energy.  If we cannot show a positive policy for conserving energy the people with whom we are going to align ourselves will be disappointed or misled by the man who went to Washington.</P>
    <P>An alternative source of energy is coal.  We have coalfields here.  A re-examination of this situation should take place in the light of prevailing circumstances, such as high fuel costs. This document stresses fuel and crude oil as sources of energy but we should have an examination made of alternative sources.  We should have a positive energy policy towards the development of our coalfields, be they big or small.  We will need whatever sources of energy are in the ground. Until such time as this assessment is carried out, there is no point in aligning ourselves with people who have done their homework, such as the Canadians, the Germans and the <Col N="365" /> Italians.  They are further advanced than we are.  They do not burn pound notes.  They do not change their speed limits.  They have positive policies. They are in this for what they can get, not for what they can give.</P>
    <P>Nuclear energy and hydro-electric power were mentioned.  Have we done enough or can we do more to stimulate these sources of energy?  I am sure we can.  Turlough Hill has been acknowledged as a masterpiece of Irish workers and technicians by people from all over the world.  It is continuously inspected by people from other countries who are amazed.  We can have further developments of this type with the natural resource available&mdash;water, and we have plenty of that.</P>
    <P>The exchange of technical information has been and should be free-flowing. Apparently we are as up to date as other countries in that sphere.  There is a continual updating of on-going programmes to keep abreast with other countries.  We can do this without tying ourselves to the vast number of countries mentioned on page 79, Article 62, of the Energy Programme.</P>
    <P>Energy research and development must be an on-going subject and the Government should be participating in energy research so that we can formulate an energy policy.  When the Government have an energy policy, they should come back and tell us that they are aware of the resources available, know our projected needs and wants over the next 25 years and know what they can give and gain from entering into this situation.  If that research is not done, the Minister is going into this situation blindfolded. Will the Government then bulldoze their way through the Division Lobbies or will there be some kind of sanity in relation to the sell-out to the multi-nationals?</P>
    <P>I hope solar energy will be examined and developed here.  It was perfected in other countries.  Some years ago we visited housing estates in Jerusalem and saw this system effectively applied.  We were told that the amount of sun required is not very great and we would have a source of energy here which at present is untapped.</P>
    <P>Have we examined nuclear power <Col N="366" /> in depth or was there just a haphazard development with information supplied by the multi-nationals or outside sources?  That information I am sure will not be made available to us but will be retained by outsiders because while the project will be here, it will be serviced and maintained to the financial advantage of the people who gave us the ideas.</P>
    <P>Have we a policy dealing with waste heat?  Have we a policy dealing with the housing programme?  Have we issued any instructions about the heating and insulation of homes?  All this is part of an energy programme which must and should be presented to this House.  Have we examined municipal and industrial waste utilisation for energy conservation?  Can we examine some of the problems outlined in this document against our own situation and say that we are very far behind? Can we say that we got inspiration from this document?  Can we avail of the information contained in the document to draw up a positive energy programme?</P>
    <P>The overall energy system must be analysed, whether it is heat, wastage, conservation or whatever the Minister might like to call it.  When we have a positive policy, when the Government indicate that they have a comprehensive policy covering all aspects, when we know all our needs and the availability of produce here, then at the stage let them tell us what they are putting on the line.</P>
    <P>At the moment there are only vague references to the availability of gas at Kinsale.  It is believed there will be a 30-year supply there.  There may be more finds in the future.  Is our energy to be sapped away by other countries who leave their own resources in the ground until such time as ours are exhausted?  Is that why they want confidential information?  I am quite confident they will not fully expose their position as we are exposing ours day by day in relation to available resources.  I am rather sad that the Minister has not been able to give us information on the matters on which we pressed him but, again, it is probably not his fault.</P>
    <P>The cost factor enters into this <Col N="367" /> motion.  What will be the cost of our participation, the cost of buildings for the 90 days' supply?  I hope the Minister will be able to enlighten us in some way because the information conveyed in the 8-page documentation that is already there is very scant.  I hope the Minister will also be able to enlighten us about the sell-out to the multi-nationals; that he will be able to tell us why France is not participating; that he will be able to tell us what the Norwegian situation is, whether they have a loose arrangement; that he will be able to tell us what Japan has to offer and what we have to offer Japan.  Again, I am sorry the Minister has not presented the necessary information and that his colleague who went to Washington did not bring back a full and factual brief so that the Members of this House could be informed in the course of the discussion on this very important matter.</P>
    <P>I hope this motion will not be carried, that we will not sign away our rights, that we will not sell ourselves out to the multi-nationals.  I hope we shall have an assessment of our own resources, and after we have calculated our own needs and the availability of fuel of one type or another and the volume in which it is available, that we shall then be able to make up our minds as to the advantage or disadvantage of aligning ourselves with any group of this magnitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason I have chosen to intervene in this debate is an unsigned article in last week's <i>Sunday Independent,</i> and I shall come back to that in a short while.</P>
      <P>Having read the Minister's brief a couple of times, I have come to the conclusion that the Minister is like a mythical cattle thief called Cacus who used to drag cattle into his caravan by their tails so that he could not be detected.  Indeed, the Minister, in his motion before us, and the Government as a whole, have successfully turned wine into water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it must be accepted that the international agencies are dominated by the United States of America and this, as Deputy Dowling and Deputy <Col N="368" /> Barrett said, should give us very serious cause for concern.  It is now absolutely clear that the multi-nationals are dominating the Legislature of the USA.  It was a depressing thing to listen to the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the last Labour Conference saying there was nothing he could do about it, when we all know this to be untrue.  If the ESB could make private arrangements with the Russians without having to concern themselves with the multi-nationals, the Government of this sovereign State could make whatever arrangements suit them and suit our people without having to knuckle under to any group of business organisations.</P>
    <P>I should like to go back a little to indicate how we attracted people to explore for such things as oil and gas off our coasts.  It was my father who was Minister for Industry and Commerce when the arrangements were made with Ambassador Oil.  He was told at school and by other prominent persons that there was no oil, gas or minerals around our island.  With this traditional record of lack of natural resources, I think it was a correct decision to encourage somebody to invest vast sums of money to find out whether there was oil where everybody said there was no oil, to make it as attractive as possible for them to do this work which the State could not afford to do, had not got the technological ability to do, and which Irish industry was not prepared to take up.</P>
    <P>It will also be remembered the difficulty there was in having an oil refinery established here.  The one refinery we have, which can produce up to 50 per cent of our capacity, was opened by the late William Norton when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is regrettable to see the capacity of that oil refinery being run down when it should be obvious to everybody, especially since the oil crisis arose in 1973, that what we need now is not running down our existing refining capacity but the creation of new oil refinery capacity.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a fourfold increase in the price of crude oil, but in relation to aviation spirit, motor car petrol or other by-products the cost of the crude oil is the very <Col N="369" /> smallest part of the total cost of producing these commodities.  I am aware, from personal contacts, that many of the oil-producing countries &mdash;perhaps I should describe them as previous colonial countries&mdash;knowing our history, have a great deal of goodwill towards this country and that if they have English pounds to spend, they would prefer to spend them here rather than in the UK or in France. Therefore, we are in a situation where oil companies have been discouraged from setting up refineries here.  I know of one company who intended building a refinery on the Shannon estuary to refine oil for home and English consumption.  These people, because of our deep water situation, were very interested in setting up refining plants and also downstream petrochemical plants.  I understand there is plenty of money in refining so far as the promoter is concerned but that downstream industry is the most valuable to a country because of the employment it provides.  These refineries were proposed for the south west, the north west and for Dublin Bay.  In one case the company had arranged international finance and had begun taking options on land for the erection of a complex based on a refinery.  However, the Government by changing their minds on the tax concession legislation which would have made such projects viable, caused this money to be shifted to Canada where the company concerned are in the process of building a refinery.</P>
    <P>We find that Canada and the US are parties to this international energy programme.  In this regard I would liken them to the ITGWU and the WUI here, two unions that operate together in a particular way and the decisions of which are unlikely to be reversed by many other but smaller unions throughout the country.  We are now giving away control of our natural resources and in the process are paying £7,000 in order to do so.</P>
    <P>Another very serious matter in this situation is that OPEC are not very friendly with the US but because the US are the major participants in this <Col N="370" /> agreement we may find that every signatory to the agreement will be cut off should the Americans annoy the oil-producing countries.  It appears that either this possibility has not occurred to the Government or that the motion is before the House now in preparation for the Minister for Finance's journey to Washington to try to raise some money.  If this is a measure to help out at a time of a shortage of finance, that is, to give away longterm prospects such as we have off our coasts and under the ground, it is very shortsighted, one-day only politics.  The water may be turned to wine now but the wine will be well and truly sour as a result of the acceptance of a motion of this kind.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is relevant to the question of energy is a decision taken by the ESB to create nuclear energy in order to conserve our oil supplies but the Minister decided that he would not trust the ESB to do this and he set up a committee to look into the matter.  During the term of office of the previous Government there were times when I was pressing to have some action taken in some area only to be told that a committee was being set up and would report.  I took such information as meaning that the Government of the day had decided to do nothing for the time being.  In the context of what we are talking about here, the Government are putting back this source of nuclear energy indefinitely. There is no shortage of oil but that is not to say that the Minister should not expedite the development of a nuclear energy plant.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider carefully the question as to why France has not signed this agreement.  The reason for this would seem to be that France has available crude oil and has a refining capacity.  On a previous occasion I heard Deputy Barrett suggest that even if we have not a refinery now, that if we must wait three years to have one constructed, that would be assuming the project would be started immediately, it would be possible to negotiate supplies of crude oil and to have them refined in France, that in this way very large <Col N="371" /> savings would result to our balance of payments situation and cheaper petrol would be available to our people.</P>
    <P>I do not know how any Minister of this small country could agree to a majority decision situation such as is provided for here.  I know there is provision for our opting out should we so wish but we should not have gone in in the beginning.  The Minister wishes to have this motion through the House by the 1st May but I expect that if he has not got it by then we will be faced with the usual closure motion and the jackboot tactics to which we have become accustomed from this Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the scheme he had for restraining energy demands. Is he aware that when the people co-operated to reduce the demand, the Minister for Industry and Commerce received a demand for increased prices because the growth rate projected by the companies involved was not adequate?  My electricity bill, for example, which amounted to about £25 every two months amounts now to £40 per month although no more electricity is being consumed in the house than was the case previously.  Therefore, the position is that if we conserve energy we find that because the expansion rate of the people involved in the business does not grow to the extent the management would wish, the prices are increased.  There is not much sense in a policy of that kind.  The profits made by the multi-nationals and which I have described already as an international scandal have soared beyond imagination.  I suggest that he should forget about this and go France's way and then have a word with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and get him to make up his mind as to how we will start exploration and development on our own oil resources. It seems crazy to sign an agreement like this when we may soon be an oil-exporting nation&mdash;certainly an oil-producing one and I am sure we can produce more than we need for the home market.  I do not know if it is the Minister for Transport and Power who is preventing the Minister for Industry and Commerce from making <Col N="372" /> up his mind or whether the Minister is incapable of making up his mind but there is certainly something wrong and it is time that the Government sorted it out.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it was planned to establish a common minimum price level below which they would not allow imported oil to be sold within their economy.  Now we are back to this seven days' notice again.  It seems to me that the multi-nationals will just say to their companies: &ldquo;We have them all sewn up.  We have the majority vote under the energy agreement.  We will tell them to put up their petrol or oil 10p or 20p.&rdquo; There is nothing we can do about it as it now stands.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House but I should like to have it clearly on record that if anyone examines the situation at the time they will find that the invitation to the Ambassador Oil Company to come to this country was a very good move and will be a very profitable decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic and something of a sick joke that tonight we should be discussing this proposed agreement on energy and power when the country is almost immobilised for lack of petrol supplies.  While it may not be relevant, I think it should go forth from this House that we make a plea to both sides in this dispute to come together and end it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has this agreement been examined to see if it is a good agreement?  Is it in our interests that we should sign it?  Are the Government, by their policy, keeping to the terms of the agreement?  I believe I can say truthfully that the Government are breaking this agreement before it is signed and I charge the Government with having no energy policy.  If you take the Government decision on the distribution of natural gas, whether off Kinsale or elsewhere, if the Government had been serious they would have examined how that gas could be converted into power.  Any policy that results in a 60 per cent loss on conversion of every gallon is not a good policy and you are not conserving energy.  Our EEC partners will have much to say when they come to <Col N="373" /> examine the puerile attempt we have made at a policy on natural resources. The Government have not given sufficient thought to the use of our existing resources.  Their only way of trying to cut down on wages is to increase the price of the commodity to the user.  The Minister for Finance on two occasions has used the weapon of higher prices rather than try to work out some intelligent plan to reduce waste and conserve supplies.</P>
    <P>It may be very good fiscal policy for the Minister to slap on any tax he likes on petrol or crude oil and when we cannot buy it he will say that he has cut down on our usage of oil.  Even if we reduce on the amount we had been using the Minister will still do well with taxation.  That is not good planning.  One must despair of Government thinking nowadays.  They should be developing our natural resources.  If the ESB had been given sufficient money and the go-ahead to generate sufficient electricity so that we could have electric trains or trams as we had in this city and as they have in other cities, the situation could have been better.  People will say that the ESB use oil to generate electricity but they also use turf and coal.  Have we fully exhausted the possibilities of hydro-schemes? Have the ESB tackled the possibility of harnessing tidal power as other countries have done?  Have we sufficiently used our coalmines which now lie derelict and from which hundreds of workers have been sacked?  In the last oil crisis, when the producer countries stepped up the price, we fell over ourselves to meet their increases but yet we allowed coalmines to close because we said it was uneconomic to operate them.  We allowed men to become unemployed but if we had spent a fraction of the money spent on importing oil we could have mined coal and kept miners in gainful employment in their own areas.</P>
    <P>This agreement says that it shall be the duty of each country to try to conserve supplies.  I am not speaking yet of the possibility of exploiting whatever resources we find in our seas or underground.  Perhaps our educational <Col N="374" /> system is at fault because when I was much younger we were always told that we had no resources, that it was not worth trying to find anything because this had already been done and there was no mineral such as zinc and certainly no oil and the coal was not suitable for burning in Irish grates.  If it has taken the oil crisis to bring us to our senses, perhaps we have gained something from it.  Because an oil company has told us that we have natural gas or oil off our southern coast we are quite satisfied with this and happy that the supply is coming.  I do not think any of that natural gas will be used outside the Cork area.  I appreciate there are grave technical difficulties, that once an undersea well is tapped it is necessary to draw off the gas in a regular pattern.  It cannot be turned on one day and turned off the next day.  I accept that the Government will have the problem of ensuring that there is a market for the gas and that it is controlled so that the ESB and NET will have a regular supply.</P>
    <P>What is wrong is that the Government have not used any imagination. If they did things properly they could open up a new area in the development of our resources.  They are too timid, they have sat back and depended on outside advice.  I admit that outsiders such as the United States and Britain have more expertise available to them than we have but, even allowing for that, the Government should come forward with a policy for the full development of all our resources.</P>
    <P>With regard to the conservation of resources, as Deputy Dowling pointed out, the Government did three things, they reduced the speed limit on the roads; they carried out a publicity drive on television and in the papers asking people to conserve supplies and the Minister for Finance had the trump card, he put a heavy duty on petrol.  I will not shed any tears over the fact that people who use their cars for leisure purposes have to pay extra for petrol, but the Minister did not consider what would be the result of his policy on employment.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that every tax imposed by a government means <Col N="375" /> an increase in the distribution cost of commodities but in an age when we should be trying to reduce inflation to manageable proportions the Government, in their periodic budgets, are increasing the price of oil and petrol. They have told us the increases were not imposed to raise further taxation but because the EEC countries complained we were not doing sufficient to conserve our supplies and they pointed out we had the cheapest petrol in Europe.  I do not know if that is true but the Government seized on this excuse without comparing our conditions with those obtaining in The Netherlands, Denmark and other member states of the EEC.  We may have had fairly cheap petrol but these countries did not have our high rate of unemployment.  Even today when the economy of the United Kingdom is tottering on the brink of disaster they will still have a much lower rate of unemployment than this country. In spite of this we are doing nothing to create more jobs.  We are neglectful and prodigal with our resources and the number of unemployed increases daily.  This week in my area two long-established Dublin firms will dismiss approximately 300 workers.  One of the firms is engaged in the production of fuel.</P>
    <P>All these matters have a bearing on the agreement we are discussing.  It was drawn up by a number of countries, some in Europe and some outside.  No doubt each country has its own difficulties but none is in such a bad position as Ireland.  None has been so wasteful with regard to its resources.  That is the fault of the Government. They have not shown enough energy or imagination to produce a policy that would use turf and coal. They have not considered how we might use our rivers, the tidal waters or even solar energy.  They have not explored the possibility of using wind power on the west coast.  In this connection I should like to commend the engineering school of UCG who are experimenting with controlled wind power.  This is only a tiny effort by a far-seeing staff in UCG but no lead is coming from the Government.</P>

      <P>We need intelligent policies on conservation and development of our resources.  Goodness knows, our Ministers attend enough conferences in different parts of the world to learn something.  They must have seen the dedication with which other peoples apply themselves to their problems.  They should have brought to this House some serious policy on energy.  Within a few days we will have the Estimate for Transport and Power and let us hope that it will contain something on the lines of an energy policy.  I am not satisfied the Government have examined this proposed agreement sufficiently well to benefit us.  We should not be satisfied with always being the sick man of Europe but the Government's attitude so far could well stamp us indelibly with that label in regard to an energy policy.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been in that office for two years.  I appreciate that in that time he has had to face some crucial problems but I am afraid that the restraining dead hand of the Cabinet has deterred his natural enthusiasm to do something.  The Government have done practically nothing towards the preparation of a real energy policy. Last week the Minister announced the formation of a new fuel board purely as an interim measure.  &ldquo;Interim&rdquo; is a nice name for a stop-gap policy.  If the Government do not get down to examine our sources of oil and gas and turf and coal we will not solve any of our problems.  We will have to put up with a rate of employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can foresee the Minister for Finance copying his British counterpart by coming in here with a policy of deflation.  Or perhaps it is that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has copied our methods. One would expect that a Government elected by the people would be prepared <Col N="378" /> to explore every possible avenue so that our people could have employment, so that we could develop our resources and develop a proper society. They show a defeatist attitude in practically every sphere of endeavour but nowhere more so than in the field of energy.  If the price of oil is increased again tomorrow, and it may well be because we have no control over the price of oil, what will we have done about finding a substitute for oil?  Should we waste imported oil on purposes which could be served by the use of native fuel?  Newspaper or television advertising could be used to educate people in the use of different fuels.  If the Government do not do something in this regard one cannot blame the newspapers or television for not putting the matter across to the people.  I do not think there has been much thinking done by the Government about the proper use of energy and the control, so far as is possible, of the price of oil.  The use of oil can be cut down by ensuring that our natural resources are used to the limit. There are countries in Europe with less natural resources than we have but they have used them much more fully. The Government should send the Minister to those countries so that he can see what they have done in the field of generating power from natural resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the next ten years or so I do not think we can be prodigal in the use of oil.  We may have a surplus of oil if oil is discovered in the Celtic Sea and off our own east coast but until then oil will be a costly commodity. It has been made more costly by the Minister for Finance in his frantic search for revenue.  It is like taxing the air we breathe when the Minister for Finance puts petrol and oil beyond the reach of most people. That is not a policy, it is an act of despair and an act of a lazy Government who will not take the trouble to learn from outside and even from our own history that we must use every sod of turf and ton of coal we have.  In our universities there are engineers who could examine the possibility of the use of our rivers for the generation of electricity.  Several <Col N="379" /> times I have tabled questions about whether the ESB have examined the possibility of using tidal waters to generate electricity.  Each time I have been told that nobody else has done it.  This is not quite true.  At least one country has.</P>
    <P>Do we think that our coalmines must lie derelict because it is uneconomic to use them?  Two years ago people would have said it was uneconomic to buy oil at present prices but we had to pay them.  If our miners had demanded the price for their labour that the oil producing countries demanded we would not have given it but, in order to pay for oil, we had to borrow money and get it anywhere we could.  Perhaps the Government have been stunned by this happening and that is why they have not enabled the Minister for Transport and Power to gather around him a technical staff to examine all alternative energy sources so as to make us as independent as possible.  If the Polish people and the American people can mine their coal and send it here we should be able to develop our mines.  Developments in the last two years have made it imperative to examine the possibility of using our mines.  If the coal is unsuitable for the existing apparatus let us change the apparatus.  Let us use the native talent of our engineers to produce a different type of boiler which will take this coal.  I do not admit that our coal is unsuitable but, if people insist that it is, we cannot change our coal but we can change the apparatus in which to burn it. There are many families in this city who have been driven to desperation by the price of fuel and who would be glad to use Irish coal, turf or logs from our forests.  I am sure the older people, if they were asked about this agreement, would say with derision: &ldquo;Give us enough turf or coal to fill our grates.&rdquo;  Those old people despair of ever again having proper fires.  All this must be placed at the door of the Government.  They have not worked out any policy to ensure a full utilisation of our resources.  Nor have they spelled out clearly what our <Col N="380" /> prospects are with regard to oil and natural gas.  I know some agreements have been made.  I hope that when we are discussing the Minister's Estimate we will go into this matter more fully.</P>
    <P>People are losing hope every day that the Government will do something. If the Government even read this document and decide to avail of whatever knowledge is in it in the preparation of a policy, if they told the people: &ldquo;We have produced this policy: it calls for courage on your part: if it is fully adopted it will make us as self-sufficient as possible&rdquo;&mdash;the people would understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>In putting down this question I was motivated by a very deep suspicion that the Government would be tempted to use Ireland's allocation from the EEC Regional Fund as a subsidy to the Exchequer by activating the partial repayment clause of article 4 of the Council directive.  This clause, coupled with the fact that all Ireland would qualify for regional aid, and that a big percentage of the capital budget, especially that portion dealing with infrastructure, would be deemed to be approved expenditure under the fund criteria, would make it comparatively easy for the Minister for Finance by an administrative sleight of hand to subsume our fund allocation and still remain within the requirements of the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Parliament in document PE 40-041, debated in plenary on 13th March, 1973 condemned this Council regulation with special reference to the partial repayment clause. The debate was carried into the national scene by an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 14th of this month, which carried a report on the expression of grave dismay, anxiety and concern on the part of senior officials at the recent Commission in Brussels at the Government's intention to use the partial repayment clause of article 4.  The debate has now grown <Col N="381" /> into a national debate and there is universal condemnation of the Government's intention.  The debate is joined by students, members of local authorities, industrialists, members of chambers of commerce, regional development organisations, all very responsible bodies.  They have all joined in the universal condemnation of the Government's intention <i>vis-à-vis</i> the regional fund.  What have we heard from the Government through their financially embarrassed Minister for Finance? Nothing except a long stream of civil service jargon couched in ambiguity and reeking of dishonesty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;punctuated by the Minister's own peculiar brand of venom directed at Members on this side of the House, directed at people like myself, harmless back-benchers who are merely attempting to honour a solemn commitment entered into two years ago to the people in the under-privileged regions, the people of Deputy McDonald's area, the mid-lands, and all the western regions.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that during the debate on the EEC three years ago, during the referendum campaign, regional policy played a central role. At that time as the Government, we were committed to the realisation of the evolution of a genuine regional policy, one which would correct not merely national imbalances but also community imbalances.  We further promised and pledged the people of the under-privileged regions that when the fund would be established they, and they only, would be the sole beneficiaries. The Fine Gael Party were co-guarantors to the people of the under-privileged regions, but now it appears that they are reneging on this very solemn pledge, promise, commitment, call it what you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Thursday the Minister lectured us on regional policy.  He repeated that line over the weekend.  He told various national bodies such as students, chambers of commerce, local authorities, regional development organisations and industrialists that they did not understand the basics of a regional policy, that they did not know exactly <Col N="382" /> what they were talking about.  Amongst other things he said, as reported in some of the daily papers last Monday, that our allocation was a flea bite.  For that he cannot blame Fianna Fáil.  We rejected as unacceptable the size of our allocation and we have rightly indicted the Government for their failure in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>Small though the allocation may be, if properly applied it could generate a sizeable investment and positive development across a very broad front.  If the supplemental clause of article 4 were activated a percentage of the aid could give a valuable supplemental grant to the £10 million given to the IDA this year to modernise existing Irish industry, thereby ensuring competitiveness and consequent expansion.  A percentage of the aid could be used to pay interest rebates on new loans from the EIB by activating clause 2 (d) of article 4 for infrastructural purposes.  There will be a £4 million loan this year and £1½ million of this aid, if used for this purpose, would generate an EIB loan of £50 million at 7½ per cent and that, with £75 million from our own resources, would make £125 million available for investment in the infrastructure.  We should be able to afford this kind of money.  It might seem big money&mdash; £125 million, £50 million at 7½ per cent &mdash;but this is the type of investment we must have if we are to correct existing imbalances.</P>
      <P>This type of finance, if placed at the disposal of local authorities for infrastructure development directly related to industrial activity, will make it possible for local authorities to embark on this type of vital activity which is, at the moment, far beyond our capacity.  Repayment of loans to the Local Loans Fund is, as the Minister knows, far beyond our capacity at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another percentage of this infrastructural money generated through the EIB loans, supplemented by our own resources, could be used to provide infrastructure for the disadvantaged areas.  The provision of roads, electricity, domestic water, <Col N="383" /> plus encouragement of the tourist potential are just a few examples of what could be done if this aid were properly used.</P>
    <P>The use of the repayment clause denotes to me a lack of basic philosophy so far as our Community involvement is concerned.  It would project us as a nation of mendicants, pocketing the loot, instead of having a dignified and aggressive policy of using Community aid to supplement national aid generated from our own resources.  With such an outlook I am convinced that in a few short years we will be co-equals with our Community colleagues in every respect.</P>
    <P>I want to hear from the Minister tonight a clear statement, devoid of ambiguity, of the intention of the Government in relation to aid from the regional fund.  If he states the aid will be used to stimulate new infrastructural development, I would ask him to indicate the nature of this development and tell us where it will occur.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask once again will there be investment under article 3, paragraph 21 of the Council directive on hill and mountain farming and in certain other less favoured areas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Herbert, in his very careful and reasonable presentation of his case for the application of the regional fund.  I would refer the Minister in particular to the undertakings given up and down the length and breadth of the country, not only by the Government at the time, the Fianna Fáil Party, but also by, very notably, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dr. FitzGerald. I do not think even the Minister for Finance, rash as he may be, would have the temerity to get up here and say there was any ambiguity about the promises made.  When we speak of regional development everybody has a pretty good idea of the area about which we are talking.  The Government in the recent past&mdash;and it was the Government despite what the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries said here today in answer <Col N="384" /> to questions&mdash;presented a map of the disadvantaged areas.  Surely the areas represented by the Irish Government to the EEC authorities on that disadvantaged areas map would be very, very similar indeed in both extent and area to the area we wish to have thought of as the area that should benefit, and solely benefit, from the application of the regional fund.</P>
      <P>To our horror and dismay, we discover, in spite of the frantic efforts made by the Government to conceal the fact, that the pathetic sum of £4 million for expenditure this year from the regional fund is being snaffled by the Minister for Finance because the Government are in simply hopeless financial trouble.  One has only to look at the antics of the Minister for Education when confronted by the managers of the secondary schools all over the country who tell us, public representatives, that they will be unable to continue unless they get more money from the Department of Education.  The Minister for Education has no hesitation in telling the House and the country that he realises this is the case but he cannot get the Minister for Finance to cough up the necessary funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turn to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and we are told that the drastic cutting down of areas in which the disadvantaged areas scheme will operate is due to the fact that the Minister has £6 million, and only £6 million, to devote as the Irish contribution to that scheme.  In the case of the farm modernisation scheme and the implementation of Directive 159, in answer to a question yesterday, the Minister told us that at the end of January last, after Directive 159 had been in operation here for almost 12 months, only 18 farms in the whole State had drawn grants under the directive.  The reason again is simply because the Government are so hopelessly financially embarrassed that they are reaching for any source and one of the first and easiest is the regional fund and the Minister for Finance grabs this from those who live in the most deprived part of the country.  There is no blinking that fact and there is no use in the Minister for <Col N="385" /> Finance getting up here and saying it will be used in the development of infrastructure in the regions.  There has, of course, always been some infrastructure development in these and other regions.  Even that is running down because the infallible indicator shows the drop in employment in the building industry, the massive drop in industrial employment and the rapid approach of economic and financial chaos in this country.  The Minister can no longer conceal it.  He should take his courage in his hands and come clean to the House and to the country.  The worst blow of all was to hit the people who are least able to defend themselves, those in the deprived areas of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The counties which will mainly benefit from the regional fund are counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Longford, Cavan, Monaghan, Galway, Mayo, Clare, Kerry, parts of Limerick and parts of Cork.  There are a number of misconceptions circulating as to the nature and scope of the regional fund.  They would be laughable if they were not so misleading.  While certainly some of them arose originally through a misunderstanding we cannot now ignore the damage that is mischievously spread for base, partisan motives at home and also done with the malicious intent of doing harm to Ireland's position in Brussels.</P>
      <P>The facts of the situation are that Ireland's share of the regional fund for the three-year period 1975-77 will be only £35 million.  That is a greater share of the regional fund than, according to the criteria of the fund, Ireland was entitled to.</P>
      <P>Actual receipts in 1975 will be only £4 million which is far less than 10 per cent of what the State will be paying by way of aid for development in those depressed areas to which I have referred but the fund will enable more projects to be tackled than would otherwise be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the regional fund is theoretically in existence it is not yet in a position to pay out any money to <Col N="386" /> member States.  The reason is that as no money has been paid into the fund no money can be paid out.  The Community supplementary budget has yet to be passed.  It is at present, as Deputy Herbert acknowledged, the subject of dispute between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  The draft supplementary budget would enable the fund to approve this year only the commitment of £8 million Community support to projects sponsored by the Irish Government but actual payments from the fund to Ireland this year will not exceed £4 million.</P>
    <P>The implication of this is that in 1975 assistance actually to be received from the regional fund will amount to less than 1 per cent of the 1975 public capital programme of £460 million.  That is less than 5 per cent of the regional fund type projects already in hands in the areas to which I have referred.  This, I think, puts the regional fund in its proper perspective. The public capital programme is the instrument through which the Government's investment strategy for promoting balanced growth, on a nation-wide basis, in employment and output is implemented.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the availability of regional fund assistance it must be appreciated, on the basis of its present financing, that it will make little more than a minimal contribution to economic and regional development in this country.  It will contribute far less to national investment this year than, for example, loans which we are obtaining from the European Investment Bank.  We all hope that in time the regional fund will develop as the means by which significant capital flows will be channelled to this country in order to affect in a fundamental way the pattern of our development and to bring our living standards up to average European levels at least.  The fund, however, as it is at present constituted, falls far short of what is ideal or far short of what is even practical help towards significantly lifting Irish living standards to European standards.</P>
    <P>Fund assistance may be given, and <Col N="387" /> may only be given, for investments costing more than £20,833 and which are of the following types:</P>
    <P> (1) Industrial, handicraft or service activities which create ten new jobs at least or maintain existing employment.</P>
    <P>(2)  Expenditure of not less than £20,833 on infrastructure, which is either directly related to these activities or an essential pre-condition for them.</P>
    <P>(3) Investment in infrastructure on mountain and hill farming and farming in less favoured regions, for instance, access roads to farms, electricity and drinking water and disposal of sewage. </P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Herbert I want to say most definitely that it is the Government's intention to expend portion of the regional fund on infrastructure and mountain and hill farming.</P>

He knows well it cannot be spread across every project in this country.  He also knows well it does not even scrape the amount of regional development that is required.  It is high time people topped carrying on this campaign which is deliberately intended to <Col N="388" /> damage the Irish image in Brussels. For every £ this country receives from Brussels it will have to prove that it has already spent at least another £ for investment in industry and it will have to show before it gets the money that it has spent at least £2.33 for every £ it gets for infrastructure development.  That is the proof that instead of the fund coming to the aid of the Exchequer the Exchequer has to prove that it has spent the money before any assistance whatsoever has come because that is in the small print that Deputy Herbert has tried to conceal.</P>

      <P>I would like now to deal with criticism that the regional fund assistance is somehow or other not being channelled to the west.  This criticism is demonstrably false, maliciously mischievous or just plain ignorance.  It is not so much that the critics do not understand but that they know so much about so many things that, as the Americans say, &ldquo;it just ain't so&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The money will be spent in a manner which will ensure that the resources of this country are supplemented to give the necessary <Col N="389" /> development in the areas of greatest need.  The quickest way of providing finance for any project is for it to be financed by the Irish Government.  It must be financed by the Irish Government before any money comes from Brussels.</P>
      <P>Our percentage share of the fund's resources for the years 1975, 1976 and 1977 is based on the premise that the whole of the State is a less developed region of the Community and that the population and needs of the whole State should be taken into the reckoning in determining our share.  While the sum allocated is small in relation to our needs it is relatively high compared with that of other member States but we will have to include projects from all over the country in our request for assistance if we are to maintain our percentage share of the fund when the conditions governing grant of assistance after 1977 are being decided.  If we do not do this it means that after 1977 Ireland would get less money and the less developed regions would get no more than the proportion they are getting at present. These are harsh realities and it is time people stopped playing cheap, miserable, parish pump politics on that issue here.</P>

      <P>The amount of fund assistance is small in relation to our total development needs and it would not be possible to use this assistance to top up State aid granted to more than a minority of projects.  If the supplement method was adopted, the Government and Brussels would be obliged to select certain projects for assistance while excluding all others, including most of the projects in the less developed regions.</P>

      <P>State aid is pitched <Col N="390" /> at a level sufficient to attract and promote the investment in question.  It would not make sense to channel additional funds to aids which have already proved to be sufficient.

      <P>The benefits of the regional fund assistance will be spread as equitably and as widely as possible. County Cavan will get its share, notwithstanding Deputy Wilson's efforts to prevent it.  The preamble to the fund lays down the obligation that the fund assistance should not lead to member states reducing their own development efforts but should complement them.  Under the National Coalition Government we have already given far more development aid than has ever been given in the history of the State.  There will be no reduction in the development aid, in the regional development of this country.  Rather, will we increase the aid given by the Government.  We are glad to have it complemented by the regional fund, small and all as this is.</P>
      <P>The receipt of moneys from the fund will help to increase the overall volume of projects so that Ireland will be able to promote more projects with the fund than we could have done if it was not received.  That is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Anything else to the contrary, it seems to me, is coming only from a strange combination of the extreme right and the extreme left wing of the European Parliament, the mischief-makers of Europe who would like to discredit everything that an Irish Government would do in the name of the Irish people.  We will do it notwithstanding their best efforts to discredit us.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24th April, 1975.</P>

The applicant furnished evidence of unemployment up to 11th February, 1975 only and following the appeals officer's decision arrangements are being made to pay arrears of assistance due from 29th January to 11th February as soon as possible.

These lands are at present the subject of negotiations, not yet completed, with a view to acquisition by the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department.  The negotiations conducted to date indicate that the right-holders will require to retain the greater portion of the best quality lands.  If and when acquisition is effected it is the intention of the service to plant that portion of the lands which becomes available to them.</P>
