      <Col N="7" /> Five schemes have been completed: The Murrough, Wicklow; Front Strand, Youghal, County Cork; Moville, County Donegal; Strandhill, County Sligo; and Rossnowlagh, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>The State expenditure incurred under the Act is approximately £356,000, including local authority contributions towards the cost of the works amounting to £98,000 and £91,000 spent on maintenance of completed works including maintenance of works at Rosslare Strand carried out prior to the Act.  Maintenance expenditure is recoverable from the local authorities concerned.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that in counties like Wexford, which is my constituency, with very long vulnerable coastlines, there are very serious coast erosion problems and would he not also agree that we are only tinkering with the problem in general at the moment?  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that an expenditure of something like £360,000 in three years is nothing like commensurate with the expenditure required to solve the problem of coast erosion.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will also agree that in one part of Wexford the coast has disappeared to the extent of one mile in depth in my lifetime.</P>

Within these designated areas we are required by the directive to vary the level of aids according to the degree of handicap.  Accordingly, the livestock headage payments will be concentrated in those areas which are <Col N="12" /> most severely disadvantaged.

      <P>The EEC Directive on disadvantaged areas requires member countries to vary the level of aids according to the degree of handicap.  The areas in which the special livestock payments will apply comprise over two-thirds of the total designated area and are the most severely handicapped by reference to the criteria specified in the directive.  Outside of these areas the natural conditions for agricultural production are significantly better. Accordingly, whilst I will keep all aspects of the directive under review, I do not envisage any early changes in the arrangements outlined in the recent press statement.</P>

The Minister is aware that theoretically we are in but practically, except for the designated areas, we are out.  If you are not development farmers you do not get the headage payments.  Only 3 per cent of the farmers in my county will get this. Surely the Minister could not reckon that as an advantaged area?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will (a) indicate the amount of the Exchequer contribution being made to the disadvantaged areas scheme, (b) increase the grant for fixed assets from 30 per cent to 40 per cent, (c) remove immediately the ceiling for maximum compensation per livestock unit, (d) make one livestock unit equal to five sheep instead of the six proposed and (e) reduce the £2,100 provision.</P>

      <P>On the basis of present decisions of the EEC Council the Irish Exchequer will be required to bear 75 per cent of the cost of livestock headage payments and at least 75 per cent of the cost of all other aids to be provided under the EEC directive on disadvantaged areas.  As regards the level of aids to be provided I am not yet in a position to announce details but hope to do so at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Monetary compensatory amounts on exports of beef to non-UK destinations were substantially reduced last October and again last month.  There is a net monetary amount payable on our beef exports to Britain.  Last month also the accession compensatory charges and custom duties on our beef exports to the Continent were reduced.  Over recent weeks commercial beef markets in Britain and on the Continent moved strongly upwards.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I do not think there is any reason why those beef export factories who are still putting the bulk of their cattle slaughterings into intervention should not, as a number of other factories have already been doing, exploit the commercial opportunities to the maximum, especially at this stage of the season.  This is also very much in the long-term interest of the factories themselves and in the national interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if his attention has been drawn to the statement by the fresh meat exporters that a reduction in sales to intervention by Irish meat plants will result in a loss of jobs and lower prices to producers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statement referred to.  I do not accept that a moderation in intervention intake should cause a reduction in either producers prices for cattle or the level of employment at beef export factories if the factories make sufficent use of commercial outlets, and having regard to the factories trading position particularly since last autumn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <P>The amount paid for intervention beef purchases in 1974 was £69.76 million.  My Department have no particulars of the amounts paid by processors for their trade purchases of cattle from which the beef was derived but I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report a table showing (1) the average market prices for the four intervention categories of cattle for each week in 1974 and (2) the official intervention carcase prices for each of the four categories during the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 to 40, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year ended 31st January, 1975, grant payments to farmers arose almost entirely under the former farm buildings, water supplies and <Col N="31" /> land project schemes.  These payments amounted to £7.25 million for the whole country and £282,000 in County Limerick.</P>
    <P>In the calendar year 1974 grants totalling £257 were paid to five farmers under the farm modernisation scheme.  Grants amounting to £1,477 were paid to nine farmers under the farm modernisation scheme during the year to 31st January, 1975, of which £550 was paid to seven farmers in County Limerick.  All claims being processed for payment in my Department at that date have since been paid.</P>
    <P>All expenditure during the year in question was borne by the National Exchequer.  Recoupment from the EAGGF which applies only to grants to development farmers will arise in 1976 in respect of expenditure during the present year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister why it is that, although the farm modernisation scheme began to operate in February of last year, by the end of that year, three farmers only in the whole of the country got grants totalling a couple of hundred pounds?  What has gone wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy knows the answer to that&mdash;that for quite some time there was a dispute in the advisory services which held back the operation of that scheme. Work has to be completed before there is any question of payment of grants thereafter.  But the level of overall payments for improvements was quite high during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not trying to defend the current situation where, more than 14 months after the initiation of the scheme, a handful of farmers only, approximately 18, in the whole country have been paid farm modernisation scheme grants?  The Minister must know that the farm modernisation scheme has not got off the ground as his figures show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that work is not completed in a few <Col N="32" /> weeks; it takes a very long time.  The EEC contribution comes yearly and we are paid for EEC work a year late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a delay in the payment of grants under the scheme prior to the farm modernisation scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not so aware.  If the Deputy knows of any cases which need to be paid, he might let me know.</P>

The corresponding figures for County Limerick are 540 and 550 and for County Cork 534 and 3,144.

The same weekly support rate is paid here on exports of Irish carcase mutton and lamb to Britain as is paid under the UK fatstock guarantee scheme for UK home-bred sheep and lambs.  The UK bears the cost of this support on our exports up to 5,500 tons per annum, which is more than the quantity we exported to the UK in each of the last three years.  Also Irish store sheep and lambs fattened in the UK for at least two months are eligible for the same support payments as UK home-bred sheep and lambs.  The UK support payments are based on a guaranteed annual average price of 35.5p per lb for 1975-76, the actual weekly guaranfeed price varying seasonably from 34.2p per lb in the autumn to 38.8p in the spring.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the amendment which seeks to have the interest rate of no more than 1 per cent on underpaid tax and tax which is in arrear.  I have already given a number of reasons why it is <Col N="42" /> desirable to have a higher rate than 1 per cent.  The principal reason is that if the interest charged on tax arrears is not higher than the going bank rate, then people will withhold tax as a source of borrowed moneys.  The Exchequer has no obligation to be a moneylender and the Minister for Finance has a duty to ensure that the system does not work in such a way as to permit people to borrow from the Exchequer at the expense of other taxpayers, because that is what happens when people borrow from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The current overdraft rate from 8th April is 13½ per cent, but the current rate of interest charged on tax arrears works out at only 12 per cent.  Therefore while a person in certain circumstances may charge interest on an overdraft against tax liability, the rate of interest charged on tax arrears is reasonably attractive, particularly to people who for one reason or another are unable to borrow elsewhere, because, for instance, the bank manager is not disposed to give them the money. However, when you take term loans, you find the rate of interest is even higher than the 13½ per cent.  It can go to 14¼ for a loan for one to three years, to 15 for three to five years, and to 15½ per cent for five to seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> When the 1 per cent charge was introduced in 1960 the bank rate then was 5.75 per cent, so that there was then, if you like, a penalty of 6.25 against a person who was in arrear with his tax payments.  Even though the figure of 1½ per cent per month works out at 18 per cent, the difference between that and the current overdraft rate is, in fact, less than the difference between the interest charged on tax arrears in 1960 and the then bank rate.  It is necessary to maintain this margin as between the interest charged on tax and the interest which people will have to pay on borrowing.</P>
    <P>The existing rate is not adequate to secure prompt payment of tax and, as a result, the amount of tax arrears has been increasing substantially for a number of years past.  If it were only substantial in this year, no doubt it would be claimed it was attributable to the current economic climate, but that is not the situation.  This growth in tax arrears can be directly related to the increase in the bank interest charges and to the failure to adapt the tax interest charges to the bank interest rate.  If a margin had always been maintained, then I believe we would not have these substantial tax arrears which we now have.</P>
    <P>The amount of income tax outstanding in 1974 and due for collection was almost 30 times what it was in 1964 when the interest rate was 1 per cent for PAYE.  For comparison purposes I would point out that the amount of tax receipts for 1973-74 was only five times greater than that for 1963-64.  Therefore the total amount of tax receipts has increased by only five times but the amount of tax arrears is six times greater than is warranted by the increased amount of tax collected, which is a clear indication that the existing interest charged is not sufficient to encourage people to pay tax promptly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and corporation profits tax, but not VAT.  If the interest rate on tax underpaid were to be at the going rate, this would make the Revenue Commissioners a lending agency, as I said earlier.  That is not their function in law.  Their duty in law is to collect tax as and when it is due and then pay the tax so collected to the Exchequer.  If taxpayers wish to borrow money for personal or business reasons, they should seek their accommodation elsewhere, and not take it at the expense of the State's institutions which means ultimately at the expense of other taxpayers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley has suggested that there are ways of collecting outstanding tax other than by charging interest. There are a number of ways of enforcing payment, including the institution of legal proceedings and the employing of the sheriff.  But enforcement of collection through the agencies of sheriffs, court registrars and court proceedings is a relatively slow process, as the Deputy knows well.  Such procedures are resorted to by the Revenue Commissioners only in exceptional cases. It is inappropriate that they should be considered as part of the ordinary administrative process to be applied in the generality of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On average, tax collected through enforcement procedures is obtained about nine months after the date due. There is no legitimate reason for allowing people such a long period for the payment of tax that is due.  Therefore it is necessary to have a not inconsiderable interest charge on outstanding tax.  This reduces the number of cases which are forced to the stage of legal proceedings.  I should not like to think that the whole process of tax collection would be so delayed and become so cumbersome as to require enforcement and court proceedings in the generality of cases.  If we did not ensure prompt payment of tax the whole system would break down because of the volume of work which would be imposed on the Revenue Commissioners as well as on the collection <Col N="45" /> agencies that would have to be employed.</P>
    <P>We had a number of speeches from the Opposition and, in particular, from Deputy de Valera, emphasising the need for simplifying tax procedures so as to lighten the burden of work on the administration.  This is necessary in the interest of equity.  It is necessary also to ensure that the number of people employed in the public sector on tax collection duties is no more than necessary.  The longer tax remains outstanding, the more work must be done&mdash;the more often a file must be resorted to, the more letters must be written and the more agencies must be engaged to effect the collection.</P>
    <P>Even if enforcement agencies are resorted to, it is very seldom that the cost of employing those agencies goes any worth-while way towards meeting the total cost involved.  Costs awarded in court form only a very small part of the total cost of collection.  Like anybody else who would sue for the recovery of a debt, the Revenue Commissioners would have to pay their own administrative cost of collecting the money.</P>
    <P>Therefore this method of collection is one to be avoided.  If we can avoid it by having this interest charge, so much the better.  There is no desire on my part or on the part of the Revenue Commissioners to collect interest for the mere sake of collecting it or to impose a penalty merely for the sake of taking that action but we see the prudence of providing an incentive to people to pay promptly.  Prompt payment of tax will avoid any interest charge so there cannot be any question of unnecessary hardship.</P>
    <P>I was interested to note that in his budget statement last week the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain was forced by recent experience in that country to take steps to ensure prompt payment of tax.  We have a number of measures operating here of which there are no equivalents across the water; but it is proposed now to bring such steps into operation there, and no doubt the rates will be such as will ensure that people will pay tax rather than borrow from the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> While, understandably, Deputy Colley from the Opposition benches would endeavour to be &ldquo;Mr. Popular&rdquo; by proposing an amendment such as that before us, I am sure that, as a former Minister for Finance, he will acknowledge the serious obligations on the Minister for Finance to ensure prompt payment of tax.  He will acknowledge also the need for the Revenue Commissioners to ensure prompt payment.  In the circumstances of today's money market when interest rates are so high there is a necessity, in equity, for the measure of charging interest to taxpayers who withhold tax.</P>
    <P>In a large portion of these cases the tax payable does not belong to the taxpayer because in many cases it would have been deducted by employers from the pay packets of employees so that the employer has no right to withhold it for any period of time.  Failure to pay over the money is a form of embezzlement.  Likewise, the trader who charges VAT is collecting a tax that is due to the Exchequer, but to withhold that money would be a form of embezzlement.  The temptation to do so may be great.  A person may wish to use the money to pay outstanding bills or to ease cash flow, but that is not the purpose of these taxes. To allow a scheme to operate whereby people could continue to withhold tax would be to impair seriously the system of collecting taxes and would force the Exchequer to borrow against future tax payments, none of which can in equity be warranted.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated earlier that the growth in arrears of tax was of the order of 30 times the increase in ten years while the growth in tax revenue for the same period was of the order of five times the increase.  In response to a question from me he indicated that the figure to which he was referring in regard to revenue was related to income tax and corporation profits tax but not to other tax, VAT in particular.  Can he say whether the 30 times increase in arrears was related only to income and corporation profits taxes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will understand the purpose of my question&mdash;to ascertain whether the growth in arrears is proportionate to the growth in revenue.  If it is, the argument he has been putting forward does not apply.  The position appears to be that we do not have that information. It may be that the suggestion the Minister is making is correct but we do not know because the section we are dealing with and to which this amendment relates defines specifically the taxes involved in subsection (3), which refers to the tax as meaning income tax, surtax, corporation profits tax or value-added tax.</P>
      <P>It also seems to me that the logic of most of what the Minister said is that you could justify an interest charge of 100 per cent, as against the 18 per cent which the Minister is attempting to justify, in regard to most of what he said.  He made certain arguments to which this would not apply but the bulk of what he said would seem to justify a rate of 100 per cent or any percentage you care to think of.  Taking the case to extremes, as that is doing, illustrates the fact that the argument which the Minister put forward to which this can be applied is not really valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we should be trying to achieve is a rate of interest which will act as a sufficient incentive to the taxpayer who is in arrear, to pay his tax and as a sufficient deterrent to the taxpayer not to be in arrear with <Col N="48" /> his tax&mdash;sufficient to do that but not to operate as a penal, exorbitant and usurious rate of interest.  Almost by the week, and certainly by the month, the extent to which the Minister's proposed rate of tax of 18 per cent per annum is becoming extortionate and exorbitant is increasing because interest rates are, and have been over the past 12 months, decreasing. If this section is enacted without this amendment, it will be built into legislation and it will be extremely difficult if not impossible to reduce it in the future and we shall end up with 18 per cent in the legislation while the current and going rate of interest is reducing&mdash; hopefully&mdash;over the next few years so that the discrepancy arising will be very substantial.  I say that no matter what Government is in power because I know how difficult it is to make that kind of adjustment once it is built into the legislation.  Therefore, there is all the more reason why we should look at the provision more closely now.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated on the last occasion that there were cases known of taxpayers who deliberately withheld their tax and invested the money in order to get a high rate of interest and that they were able to make a profit on this while still paying interest to the Revenue Commissioners. Would it be possible for the Minister to indicate whether such cases were private individuals or people in business or who had businesses and were doing this as part of their business?  I suspect the latter is the case.  The position now is that in the case of a private individual there is a limit to the amount of interest on which he can claim any relief but he cannot claim relief on £1 interest he owes the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;there is no relief for him there.  Businesses can claim relief but not in the case of interest owed to the Revenue Commissioners so that the actual rate of interest being charged, as compared with the rate at which one can borrow&mdash;which was the rate to which the Minister referred&mdash;is quite different from what it appears to be on its face.  The existing rate of 12 <Col N="49" /> per cent is much higher if one allows for the fact that there is no deduction allowed in respect of income tax liability in regard to this interest and the rate of 18 per cent proposed in similar circumstances is&mdash;I have not done the sum&mdash;somewhere probably in the region of 23 per cent or 24 per cent.  That is the real rate of interest that is proposed to be charged.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can justify such a rate of interest which is exorbitant and is not justified by the needs of the Exchequer because if one accepts that argument about the needs of the Exchequer being paramount one might as well say it should be 100 per cent and that people should pay their tax promptly or take the consequences.  This is to be applied in the generality of cases, as the Minister indicated, and should, therefore, be fixed at a rate which is an inducement to a taxpayer to pay his tax on time but not so as to be an exorbitant penalty.  If one wants to apply that approach in particular cases where it is justified the Revenue Commissioners have other remedies. Some of these may take time&mdash;they do not all take a great deal of time&mdash; and even if they do, the Revenue Commissioners are earning interest in the meantime.  The Minister has indicated&mdash;correctly, I believe&mdash;that it would not be proposed to apply these remedies in all cases of arrears of tax but, putting it very roughly, only bad cases so that what we are talking about in regard to the rate of interest here is what I might call the ordinary case of arrears of tax, either income tax, surtax, corporation profits tax or value-added tax.</P>
    <P>On the previous occasion I adverted to the fact&mdash;this is something of which I am aware and I am sure the Minister also is aware because I think he has received representations on it&mdash;that today, because of the economic climate, some people, particularly wholesalers, are in the position that they have been forced to extend their normal credit substantially and are paying considerably more for stocks and paying interest on the money to their banks and they have to pay value-added tax to the <Col N="50" /> Revenue Commissioners long before they receive that tax themselves.  For the Minister to say that in all cases of arrears of VAT people are virtually embezzling the money because they are holding other people's money is not correct in cases of that kind: it is the taxpayers' own money that is being paid over and he has to wait a considerable time to receive VAT from his customers.  We know there is quite a number of such cases and I am sure the Minister knows it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider those cases.  Is it just to apply a rate of interest to arrears in such cases which effectively works out at considerably more than 20 per cent per annum?  Is it necessary?  I do not believe it is.  Where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that it is a bad case, not just a normal case of being slow in paying tax, they can go after the taxpayer concerned but we are talking about the normal case and it is not necessary to apply such a rate of interest.  It is not just and I doubt if it will be very effective especially in the present economic climate.  If you make it very expensive for a taxpayer, you can go so far that he might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb and not pay at all.  If it happens to be a limited liability company, if the amount due is too great and if the interest is too great, they may go into liquidation.  They may leave the Revenue Commissioners with their priority, which they have on a liquidation, trying to recover.  I doubt if there is any great advantage to the Revenue Commissioners in that procedure.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge the Minister to look at this matter again.  Whatever justification there might be for an 18 per cent rate of interest per annum&mdash; I think there is very little&mdash;that justification is disappearing rapidly.  By this time next year I hope the justification will be even less, on the grounds that the going rate of interest will have decreased considerably.  The Minister should consider the situation where such a figure is built into the legislation and he should recognise the practical difficulties, as distinct from the theoretical position, of amending this provision. <Col N="51" /> I know that theoretically there is no problem in amending the provision but the Minister must know that in practice there are great difficulties in effecting this kind of amendment.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter.  It is not likely to help the Exchequer and the Minister must see that it will impose not just hardship but injustice in some cases with regard to arrears of tax, where people are paying their own money in advance of collecting the tax they must pay the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Yes.  I suppose this is an indication of the times.  Anyone who is running a business today appreciates the delicate balance required to keep it going.  In difficult times like this there is bound to be an increase in arrears of income tax but I doubt if the Minister's proposals will solve the present problem.  The majority of retail outlets are balancing their payments in that they pay one wholesaler one week, another firm the following week and then they pay the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons for the present situation is the system introduced by the banks in the last two or three years, known as the term loan.  The majority of business people are placed on term loans and payments must be made every month or every three months.  This kind of situation did not arise three or four years ago.  Today the banks automatically deduct their term loans from current accounts and these payments must be met.  For the majority of business people their overheads are increasing but the profits are getting tighter and, consequently, they are barely able to keep going.  Smaller profits combined with the term loans, have contributed to the present situation <Col N="52" /> with regard to payment of income tax and surtax.  If the Revenue Commissioners check their books they will see that many people are in this situation now, people who formerly would never have considered withholding income tax payments.</P>
    <P>Of course there are other taxpayers who will deliberately withhold tax. Perhaps some of these people have re-invested their money and made profits. I would have no hesitation in using the full force of the law to collect those arrears but I am sure that in the course of the next year or so there will be many people who will genuinely be unable to meet their income tax payments due to circumstances outside their control.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley has mentioned the case of the wholesalers.  Many of them have been put in this situation today because of the high bank rate the distributive trade are paying on over-drafts. Naturally they are delaying payments to the wholesalers for as long as they can.  The two months allowed to the wholesalers at the moment is not long enough because they have a dreadful problem trying to collect debts from the distributive trade.  Nobody likes to lose business in these difficult times.  Many wholesalers do not like to force customers too much to pay their bills, they try to use gentle persuasion, but very often they may have to wait for three or four months.  A rather different situation obtains with regard to big monopoly firms; some of these firms can afford to demand their cash in 28 or 30 days but other smaller firms are not in that situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the position of wholesalers who have to wait for their money for long periods when the question of the interest rate arises.  I realise that PAYE should be submitted to the Revenue Commissioners within a given time because generally it is in the hands of the employers but it is more difficult for people to pay the other taxes.  Once we establish a figure of 18 per cent with regard to income tax, that will be carried forward into the other capital taxation measures going through the House.  In this connection I am referring to the legislation dealing with <Col N="53" /> capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and wealth tax.  I can visualise the problems that will arise with regard to the wealth tax if the 18 per cent is carried forward over the next 12 months or two years.  I can see it being applied to 95 per cent of the people who will be subject to wealth tax. They have no hope of getting their accounts through or assessing exactly what they are worth.  It would be senseless to apply that rate.  Whatever justification there may be in charging a high rate for PAYE, it is a different proposition to charge that tax for the capital acquisition or the wealth tax. It would impose a very serious burden on people and a sliding scale should be operated in this area.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that next October many people will be subject to wealth tax and if this is carried forward in the same way as PAYE and VAT, I doubt if many will be in a position to pay. Deputy Colley has outlined our opposition to this.  I doubt if it will help the Exchequer to any great extent.  I should like to see an encouragement clause, to start at a lower rate, say 12 per cent, and have two rates, the higher to apply if the tax has not been paid within three months after the final date.  Let us have the other rate at 14 per cent or 15 per cent, but coming in with the 18 per cent after a given time is too harsh.</P>
    <P>Wholesalers have a scheme through which they get their revenue in very effectively by a sliding scale of bonuses for prompt payments.  If we could introduce some such sliding scale, we would get our revenue more quickly. Honest tax payers never withheld tax but this harsh system proposed by the Minister is too penal and unfair.  The Revenue Commissioners could give a reasonable time during this period of economic difficulty.  A certain element of sympathy is needed here.  Business people will always try to stay in business for as long as they possibly can but I am afraid of the effects of this new penal system.  There are many concerns at the moment desperately trying to stay in business and for that reason alone I urge the Minister to be more sympathetic in the administration of this provision, of this extortionate <Col N="54" /> rate to be charged immediately after the final notice.  As I said earlier, it should be scaled if payment is made within two or three months.  We should try gentle persuasion rather than this punitive system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to inquire from the Minister whether the 30 times in ten years relates to the volume or to the number of cases.  It seems to me that it is not so much the rate of interest as the difficult circumstances which business has been facing in the last 12 to 15 months that could have caused an increase of that kind. I do not think the Minister, on behalf of the State, is setting a good example in increasing the rates of interest on taxes payable by 50 per cent.  In reality, it is far more than an 80 per cent increase because it is on a monthly basis and there is a computation upwards if payment is delayed.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Colley said, it would not vary in a year by 18 per cent but by a much greater percentage.  Our economy depends to a considerable extent on the prospects of a reduction in bank rates to stimulate business, and for the State to increase interest rates is going in the very reverse direction.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has a point when he refers to a possible increasing rate at a later stage.  As we know, the State has a tremendous advantage over all business enterprises. Most accounts for purchase of goods by business firms are payable on a monthly basis subject to some form of discount.  Probably many wholesale and manufacturing firms would hardly be able to survive if purchasers did not have the encouragement of a reduction of the total amounts by percentaages of 2½, or 3¼ in some cases, for early payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Business in general, barring the fortunate few multi-concerns, is suffering very seriously due to inflated increased costs of goods, and as Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, this is not a good time to introduce a provision of this kind.  If the Revenue Commissioners have found, and it seems from what Deputy Colley has said that they have, some cases where the device of not paying tax <Col N="55" /> has been used to make other moneys, I find it difficult to believe this could be widespread.  Possibly it would apply to some selected groups who pay considerable amounts of tax of one kind or another and find they can make some quick money, but it is not very widespread.  Therefore, I do not think this type of penalty should be imposed on the generality of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister should find some other way to deal with such cases if many of them exist.  He seems to have adopted the same attitude as he did to the Opposition's proposal on the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  We put forward the proposition that easy money, speculation money made quickly in a year or two, should be subject to a higher rate of tax, a proposition which the Minister was not prepared to accept, I think wrongly, because if you deter enterprise you slow down the economy. The principle of taxing the easy money speculator is one this side of the House is prepared to support, but the increase in interest charged by the Revenue Commissioners here, bringing it to double the bank rate in a full year, is a device I would use only on the sort of element the Minister has referred to who are trying to make money out of the money due to the Revenue Commissioners. I do not think this is a time to discourage business enterprise.  The Minister must know enough about the problems related to redundancy and unemployment to at least agree with that approach.  The Minister should consider some amendment to this increase of 50 per cent in the rate of interest chargeable on tax due, before we pass from this section.</P>

      <P>We are not concerned with charging interest.  What we are concerned with is making it unattractive to withhold tax.  The vast majority of taxpayers have no option at all.  It is taken under the PAYE system out of their pay packets.  I am sure there are plenty of workers who would find very good use for their gross pay if they could <Col N="57" /> get it but the Legislature many years ago decided, in its wisdom or otherwise, to collect tax under the system of PAYE.  Under that the vast majority have no opportunity to elect between paying tax and withholding it.  In equity we must provide that people who are paying tax in arrears should be discouraged from withholding tax.  The kind of people we are dealing with here in the main are people who are withholding the employees' tax or VAT or they are the self-employed who are paying tax in arrears.  Their 1975 tax liability is based upon their earnings for 1973-74 and with inflation running at a rate of 20 per cent that is a whale of a bonanza.</P>

      <P>Yes.  One could see, in theory anyway, that there were grounds for their case but they lost it because the law cannot allow a penalty to be set off against a tax liability. Similarly, if interest is paid here on outstanding tax it would be inappropriate to allow that to be set off against tax liability.  The State is not interested in collecting this interest. The State is interested in collecting the tax and in removing any incentive which the present system gives to withhold tax.  That is the only way in which we can approach this section.</P>
      <P>Most countries that I know of have a charge of interest nowadays in respect of overdue tax and these rates of interest have tended to increase because of the high cost of money.  It could be argued that there should be a relationship between the interest charged and the going bank rate at any given time.  There is an annual Finance Bill and it can be adjusted. This is preferable to operating a system which would require the rate of interest to be calculated for broken periods which would complicate the system.  I hope this 1½ per cent will not be a permanent rate.  It will only be a permanent rate if money remains as costly in the future as it is today.  If the cost of money goes down, I would consider it appropriate to have an adjustment made of this.</P>

      <P>I am referring to existing taxes only, taxes for which the legislation authorising same has already been enacted.  As the Minister is aware, I had an amendment down to this section, an amendment the Ceann Comhairle was obliged to rule out of order on the ground that it could involve a charge on the Exchequer, and I want to put to the Minister now the principle involved in that amendment.  The principle is that, in any case in which interest is payable on tax in arrear, similar interest should be payable at precisely the same rate by the Revenue Commissioners on tax which is overpaid.  The case for this is self-evident.  I do not propose to argue it unless I have to and I sincerely hope I shall not have to.  Does the Minister accept the principle?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that where taxation is under appeal there is provision under which the State is liable to pay interest on tax which is overpaid.  That provision is not in any way affected by this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice, the principle is recognised and the Revenue Commissioners pay interest where tax is overpaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite the position.  I must confess I thought it was the position in regard to value-added tax.  I thought I had introduced such a provision but, as it has worked out under the legislation, it does not apply in that way.  It is quite clear that if we are to accept the argument which the Minister has been making for some time&mdash;that the taxpayer should be obliged to pay interest at what is admitted to be a penal rate on tax which is overdue&mdash; equity demands that the Revenue Commissioners should pay tax at the same rate on any tax which is overpaid. Whether or not there is an <Col N="63" /> appeal, once it is determined&mdash;it may well be determined in various circumstances that there is an overpayment of tax without an appeal&mdash;the tax should be refunded.  Frequently there are complaints about the delay which takes place in refunding overpaid tax. I am not dealing with that point at the moment.</P>
      <P>I am dealing with the principle that interest should be payable on that money at the same rate as is charged on overdue tax.  I want to be quite clear about this.  I do not want any misunderstanding about this or about the Minister's position.  I should like to know precisely what is the Minister's position on this.  Does he accept that in all cases in which there is an overpayment of tax interest should be paid by the Revenue Commissioners on that overpaid tax from the date of its overpayment to the date of its refund to the taxpayer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as VAT is concerned, if there is an overpayment the Revenue Commissioners invariably make some adjustment of the tax. As the Deputy knows, VAT is invariably an ongoing account.  Where somebody is in business or in trade the tax is paid at regular intervals.  It is not uncommon if a person has made an overpayment in one tax period that he withholds tax in the following period of an amount equivalent to what has been overpaid. In actual practice the Revenue Commissioners usually do not press for payment of interest in respect of the tax withheld in such situations.  As the law stands at the moment it operates in such a way as to give to the taxpayer who is in genuine dispute about tax and who has made a payment on account interest on such excess if excess is found after the tax has been properly assessed.  This is the system which was in operation when Deputy Colley was Minister.  I think he found in practice this worked out satisfactorily and that is why he did not make any amendment in the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  I confess I was under the impression that I had <Col N="64" /> made the amendment in the law which I am now seeking.  I was somewhat disturbed to find I had not, that it had not worked out as I thought it would. I have no doubt now, and I had no doubt when I was Minister for Finance, of the equity of the principle involved.  If the taxpayer pays interest on unpaid tax the Revenue Commissioners should pay tax on overpaid tax.  It is a simple, fair proposition and in practice the cost to the Revenue Commissioners is minimal, as the Minister should well know.  In comparison with the amount of tax in arrears the amount of tax which is overpaid is quite small.  There is no substantial amount involved for the Revenue Commissioners in accepting this principle but there is a good deal to be gained by demonstrating an even-handed approach.</P>
      <P>There may be some practical difficulties, particularly in regard to VAT, and the Minister has adverted obliquely to some of them.  It is true that the period of payment of VAT is at two-monthly intervals.  Therefore the fact that somebody has overpaid VAT for a period of two months, which he can adjust after two months, means that in practice this is not too bad a position, although strictly speaking he ought to be paid interest for that period that he has overpaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt if the Minister would accept the argument he was making for the Revenue Commissioners if a private taxpayer were involved.  If, for instance, an income taxpayer were to say: &ldquo;Of course, I have a running account with the Revenue Commissioners because I am liable for tax every year.  I am underpaid here so I will adjust next year.&rdquo;  The Minister does not accept that.  He says: &ldquo;No, you will pay 18 per cent interest on it.&rdquo;  It seems to me that, subject to the practical difficulties which may arise, particularly in regard to VAT&mdash;and human ingenuity is not such that it will not find a solution to it&mdash;the principle involved should be accepted. I am trying to establish clearly whether or not the Minister accepts it.  If he does I call on him to amend this section accordingly.  If he does not accept it we would like to know that <Col N="65" /> precisely and why he does not accept it.</P>

      <P>I cannot see how this could be fair.  If the Minister overpays me for something and I have money belonging to him for a certain length of time I give him no interest but he charges me interest if I do not pay him enough.  Surely what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander?  Several people have told me there is overpayment of tax.  This should operate fairly both ways.  I do not think it is fair that a man should have to wait for an appeal before he gets his money.  The principle should be accepted that where there is an overpayment you should not have to appeal to get interest.  In my view this is a very valid and common-sense point.  It will raise the prestige of the Revenue Commissioners in rural areas and they need that badly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I can see the sense in the Revenue Commissioners, if they are satisfied on appeal, making a refund <Col N="67" /> with interest.  I can see complications arising in connection with VAT and I am not sure if the same principles should be applied.  If one voluntarily submits VAT and overpays, there is no provision to readjust that the following month.  My recollection is that the refund is paid by cheque.  If there is a mistake in the calculation and the figures that may not be noticeable to the Revenue Commissioners, I do not think the businessman is permitted to carry that forward to the following two months.  Where an overpayment is made by mistake to the Revenue Commissioners, I would not expect the Commissioners to pay interest on that, especially at 18 per cent.  This overpayment could be made in a deliberate way also.  The case for VAT is exempted from this suggestion.  In the case of VAT the demand is not made by the Revenue Commissioners.  We should establish that where demand is made for payment of an amount in excess of the amount due, interest should be paid on the overpayment.  If that is established we will be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in regard to the practice.  In the case I illustrated earlier which can occasionally happen the refund is not made.  The very fair rule of thumb applies in such cases that interest is not charged on a payment which is theoretically due if, at the time it is due, there is a refund due to the VAT payer.  The bulk of VAT claims are disposed of within three weeks of receipt.  It is cause for some satisfaction that the Revenue Commissioners have speeded up the processing of the VAT claims.  It is very rare that any case goes beyond that time.  If there is a claim outstanding for a longer period, it is oftentimes not attributable to causes entirely within the Revenue Commissioners' control.  The most important thing is to speed up the process of refund and if this can be got to work efficiently&mdash;it works much more efficiently now than it used to and the refund section is much better staffed and works more speedily than it used&mdash;we would be <Col N="68" /> doing the best service to the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I adverted to some difficulties that would arise in regard to VAT and I accept the idea that separate arrangements would need to be made in regard to that tax because of the intervals at which it is paid.  If we leave VAT out of the reckoning, why can the Minister not accept the principle we have put forward, that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but those are the two conditions that have to apply before any interest is paid by the Revenue Commissioners as things stand.  Does the Minister not recognise that a number of other cases in which there is an overpayment can arise?  In such cases the overpayment could be discovered, without an appeal, and agreed.  Such cases occur but why should not the taxpayer in such circumstances get interest on the money he overpaid?</P>

      <P>I suggest that one reason the Minister might not be happy about this is that he has raised the rate of interest to such a high level that he might find people investing in the Revenue Commissioners for the yield they will get. They will find it hard to get that kind of yield anywhere else.  That is one of the Minister's problems.</P>

      <P>The Minister is painting an extraordinary picture by endeavouring <Col N="69" /> to convey the impression that where there are overpayments to the Revenue Commissioners the pattern and format is that overpayments are cleared and repaid within a month. This certainly arises in relation to the subsection of this section which involves the deduction of payments to subcontractors.  In my constituency contractors who are carrying out repairs to local authority houses and are erecting isolated cottages cannot procure subcontractors' certificates.  In such cases they are paid only 65p in the £ for the work done.  If such contractors are cleared by the clerk of works for doing £1,000 worth of work the local authority, on the instruction of the Revenue Commissioners and under the law, gives that contractor a cheque for £650.  The contractor then has the problem of trying to establish to the Revenue Commissioners that he is entitled to an amount or all of the balance.  This regular feature is holding us up in so far as cottage repairs and buildings are concerned.</P>
      <P>For the Minister to suggest that the overpayments, or over-stoppages as I would prefer to call them, by the Revenue Commissioners, should not be paid back within a month is wrong. Earlier, when replying to Deputy Colley who asked the Minister to name other countries where the interest on overdue amounts of income tax was as high as that imposed under this section, the Minister blandly stated that our people, speaking on behalf of Irish people, are probably the worst payers in the world.</P>

      <P>In this context I would nearly go so far as to say&mdash;maybe it is not as politically unwise, because one is having a go at the Revenue Commissioners, as what the Minister says; I could say just as vaguely as did the Minister a few moments ago&mdash;that the Revenue Commissioners are twice as slow as any other Revenue Commissioners to pay back what is due to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>But there is a principle involved here.  It is the old one I remember hearing first when I was four years of age, that is, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  In this instance that principle must be accepted.  The only objection the Minister can possibly have is the one Deputy Colley put a few moments ago.  If the Revenue Commissioners are not guilty, as I am charging at present, there should be no problem about the Minister conceding this.  If the Minister makes the point that if there is overpayment to the Revenue Commissioners and that 99 per cent of those overpayments are returned within a month, there is no possible basic objection he can have to including a provision in this section making sauce for the gander the same as sauce for the goose and agreeing to pay the 1½ per cent on money overheld by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice, the Revenue Commissioners make the refund within a month.  There are cases where they are unable to do so. Most of such cases arise where the documentation is not furnished by the person making the claim.  When I was in Opposition, and indeed as a practitioner, I had occasion to complain from time to time about delays on the part of the Revenue Commissioners, no doubt, in some cases, warranted.  Even there, in many a case in which I made representation, I discovered the blame was not on the commissioners' side alone.  In fact, in many cases it was not.  Even now &mdash;and I am sure Deputy Colley would confirm this too&mdash;I find that quite often, when complaints are made against the Revenue Commissioners, the commissioners are <Col N="71" /> awaiting some documentation from the person making the complaint. Until the information required, by law, in order to make an assessment is furnished, obviously the Revenue Commissioners are not in a position to dispose of the claim.</P>
      <P>The important thing is to speed up the process of repayment.  If Deputies are aware of any cases where they believe there is undue delay on the part of the Revenue Commissioners, I would be very glad to know of it.  Indeed the Revenue Commissioners would be glad to know of it because their anxiety is not less than the taxpayers to ensure a system of taxation which is fair and is seen to operate fairly and efficiently.  The Revenue Commissioners realise that, unless goodwill exists, their task is all the more difficult.  They are quite anxious to make repayments but there has to be a readiness on the part of the taxpayer to furnish information necessary for the purpose of making a proper assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not see that a very potent way of making the taxation system not only fair but seen to be fair and of building up some goodwill in favour of the Revenue Commissioners would be to accept the proposition we put forward? It does not really matter, for the purpose of this discussion, whether delays which occur are the fault of the Revenue Commissioners, the taxpayer or both.  That is relevant perhaps to discussion of the efficiency of the system.  The fact is that what we are talking about is a situation in which, not the Revenue Commissioners, but the Minister for Finance has the use of taxpayers' money to which he is not entitled. Therefore, should he not, when repaying it, pay the going rate which he has prescribed, and voted for a short time ago, of 18 per cent per annum, which he is applying to overdue tax? To me that is self-evident.  As far as I am aware, the Minister has not given us any reason why he should not accept this principle, except perhaps in relation to value-added tax, <Col N="72" /> where there may be some practicable problems.  But, in relation to the other taxes specified in this section, why should the Minister not accept this proposition?  Has the Minister any reason?</P>

It is only when he is dissatisfied and when on appeal it is found that the tax is less than the Revenue Commissioners were seeking that the question of a refund arises.

If they assess somebody for tax and he pays and then he discovers that the assessment was wrong and he should not have paid as much as he did, the Revenue Commissioners do not always insist on his going through the whole appeal procedure.  If they can see straightaway that he is right in that they will accept that situation and refund the money to him.  In such circumstances why should interest not be paid on it at the rate now prescribed in this section?</P>

      <P>Certainly it helps to speed up the processing of all cases of this kind if a person cannot anticipate a handsome payment of interest on money which has already been overpaid.

      <P>I am afraid the Minister is disclosing that he is more and more mentally orientated towards the collection of revenues than giving justice to the taxpayer.  Surely, in the kind of case I have described, justice requires that the taxpayer be paid interest on the money he has overpaid on foot of a wrong assessment without necessarily having to go through the whole procedure of appeal? Would the Minister give us one good reason why a person should not be paid interest on his overpayment in such a case?</P>

      <P>I have fairly dealt with the matter already.  I have said that the law, in practice, deals with the normal situations of overpayment which arise.

      <P>Despite the Minister's earlier disclaimer it is now plain that he does not accept the principle that a taxpayer who overpays is entitled to interest on his overpayment in the same way as the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to interest on a withholding of tax.  Under the existing provisions for repayment of tax, has the adjustment in the rate of tax from 12 per cent per annum to 18 per cent per annum been incorporated in this section?</P>

      <P>I am both surprised and disappointed at the Minister's failure to accept the principle we put forward.  Despite his disclaimers, where he said earlier that he was accepting it, it is now quite clear that he is not accepting it.  He may have good reasons for that but if he has, he has not given them to the House. The principle, in my view, is so self-evident, right and just that to indicate our disapproval and dismay at his refusal to accept it, we must oppose the section.</P>

If what emerged from the parliamentary draftsman was not what I said I wanted, that is no reason why the Minister should resist the principle.  To my credit I tried to do it.  All the Minister is trying to do is mulct the taxpayer.  He does not give a damn about the taxpayer who overpays.  He has made that position quite clear.</P>

However, we will have the opportunity to put this right in a reasonably short time.</P>
      <P>At the moment it is important that we should record our disapproval of the attitude of the Minister for Finance in being one-sided in favour of the Revenue Commissioners.  He wants to charge the taxpayer 18 per cent per interest annum on tax paid late and refuses to do anything about giving interest to a taxpayer who overpays, except on foot of previous legislation. He is not prepared to accept our proposition in general&mdash;that an overpayment of tax should carry a similar rate of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put a hypothetical case to the Minister.  I overpay £1,000 tax to the Revenue Commissioners for the year 1973-74.  I am fighting the Revenue Commissioners for the repayment of that money.  During the next financial year I allowed £2,000 to accrue in arrears, but after two years the situation is resolved because the Revenue Commissioners accept that I am entitled to the return of my £1,000 for 1973-74. They also determine that I am liable for the £2,000 payable the next year.  I reckon that I could settle with the Revenue Commissioners by the payment of £1,000 plus interest.  I am assuming that under this section the interest on £2,000 over a two-year period would amount to £360.  Subtracted from that would be the credit of £1,000, but no interest.  This means that I am paying 36 per cent interest on the £1,000 owed.  The Minister should be able to devise a formula to repay the overpaid tax plus interest.  He says that if the Revenue Commissioners have all the data and the taxpayer fills in his form properly there is no doubt the commissioners will have refunded the extra tax within the month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding of this section is <Col N="76" /> that the rate of 1½ per cent is chargeable each month or part of a month. In other words, if a month and a day are involved the Revenue Commissioners are empowered to charge 1.5 per cent for two months.  As Deputy Colley said, all the legislation is geared to mulct the taxpayers.  There is no provision for being generous.  Deputy O'Malley laughed at me the other day when I thought the Minister was bringing in a section to protect the taxpayer from the Revenue Commissioners.  The Deputy was entitled to smile at my naivete.</P>
    <P>While the Minister says he would like to be able to do something to help, he has stiffened his back by way of opposition to anything of that nature.  We have looked at this in every way and asked him to give some indication of his willingness to amend the section in order to provide for the unlikely event of the Revenue Commissioners holding over money for a month in order that the taxpayer would get the same rate of interest he would be charged if he owed money.  We do not seem to be getting anywhere with the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann request the Minister for Health to make a regulation under subsection (3) of section 45 of the Health Act, 1970 specifying that the following classes of persons shall be deemed to be within the categories mentioned in subsection (1) of section 45 of that Act:</P>
      <P> (1)  Persons over 65 years of age</P>
      <P>(2) Widows</P>
      <P>(3) Persons suffering from any long term illness</P>
      <P>(4) Families where the weekly income of husband and wife after deducting rent, rates, ground rent, mortgage repayments and expenses necessarily incurred in travelling to and from work and an amount of £4.00 per week in respect of each child with no income under 18 years of age, does not exceed £40.00 per week</P>
      <P>(5)  Single persons, living with relatives, whose income does not exceed £20.00 per week and</P>
      <P>(6)  Single persons living alone whose income after deducting rent, rates, ground rent, mortgage repayments and expenses necessarily incurred in travelling to and from work does not exceed £20 per week; </P>
      <P>and request the Minister for Finance to assent to the making of such a regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is to expand to a much greater number of people than at present the benefits of the general medical service by making them automatically entitled to entry in the general medical services <Col N="78" /> register and to receive a medical card.  Fianna Fáil are putting forward this motion because we believe that one specific way in which the welfare of ordinary men and women can be positively improved is by making better health services more widely available.</P>
    <P>Illness, by itself, brings suffering and distress to the individual and into the home, but when there is added to that natural and inevitable suffering the additional misery of worry about the cost and expense, the strain becomes intolerable.  We cannot abolish illness from human life, but it should be our resolve to move steadily towards a position where nobody in our community will be deprived of any medical attention he needs because of his financial circumstances, so that that fear one so often hears expressed of not being able to afford to be ill will be removed from our midst.</P>
    <P>The general medical service is the cornerstone of our health services.  It is through its expansion and improvement that the most positive and widespread progress can be made.  Health services here, as in most other countries, are absorbing community resources at an increasingly alarming rate, and it is doubtful if even the richest nations can provide adequate resources for all the things they would wish to do in regard to health.  The control of the development of our health services in a modern community is, therefore, something that calls for great wisdom, judgment and balance.  There must be constant forward movement, but great care must be taken to ensure that in that process of forward movement the resources and capacities are not overstretched to the detriment of the services provided.</P>
    <P>It is these considerations that have led us in Fianna Fáil inevitably to decide that an extension of the general medical service to a wider section of the community is the major improvement that should be undertaken at this time in our health services.  This is something we see as urgent and inescapable in our circumstances today. There is no other single improvement <Col N="79" /> in our community services which is so clearly called for for a widening section of our community. The mounting pressure of the general cost of living and the alarming rise in the cost of medicine are making it impossible for them any longer to provide for their medical needs out of their own resources.</P>
    <P>This proposal to extend the general medical service to embrace a wider section of the population is a basic component of our general health policy.  That policy is based on the principle of advancing steadily on a broad front.  It will seek to achieve a tolerable balance between overall requirements, on the one hand, and the availability of resources, on the other, to improve services comprehensively without diluting the quality of those services.  It is part of that policy to afford priority to improving existing facilities, and that is precisely what we are seeking to do in this motion, by extending the general medical service while, at the same time, as resources permit, improving and adding to the general level of that service.</P>
    <P>Our policy is to push forward within the existing framework, the progress rate to be determined by community needs, scientific advances, social and economic factors, and not by any doctrinaire considerations.  We believe that in this way it will be possible to evolve a comprehensive health service in an orderly manner, services being augmented steadily and not reduced in quality from time to time by ill-considered, unprepared decisions.</P>
    <P>That strategy of advancing on a broad front will, nevertheless, mean that there will have to be preferential direction of resources to certain problem areas.  That guiding principle acknowledges the fact that certain groups will always require special attention and protection, and we are making a start with some such groups in this motion.  The family doctor is, of course, the key to the general medical service and, indeed, to the health services in general.  Our policy for health involves a greater emphasis on increased recruitment into the general <Col N="80" /> medical service with&mdash;and we must admit this&mdash;a corresponding curtailment of recruitment for hospital medical staff.  Accordingly, conditions of service in the general medical service will have to be made more attractive to secure this change of emphasis.  If doctors are to be attracted into this service, there is undoubtedly a need for a contract to be negotiated on a new, far-reaching basis with the profession.</P>
    <P>We believe also that the local health centre, as the focal point of the general medical service, is the key to the most efficient use of our limited resources. The development and improvement of the services provided in these health centres will reduce greatly the necessity for hospital admissions and will facilitate something which we aim at also&mdash;the ultimate integration of our medical services with our social and community services.</P>
    <P>This motion seeks to increase in two ways the number of people eligible for medical cards.  First, it seeks a general increase in the number of people eligible for medical cards by raising fairly substantially, but not irresponsibly, the upper income limits for eligibility in the case of families and individuals. Secondly, it seeks to make obligatory the issue of medical cards to specific categories of persons.  Those categories to which we seek to have the issue of medical cards automatic and obligatory are, first, persons over 65 years of age, secondly, widows and, thirdly, any person suffering from a long-term illness.  It is our view that the general circumstances of these people and their status in the community are such that there should be no question as to their eligibility for medical cards and that the common-sense approach to this is to make automatic the issue of a card to anyone in any of the three categories.</P>
    <P>The case for doing this in respect of a person over 65 years is self-evident and is entirely in keeping with modern thinking in this area.  There may be people in this category who, because of their private circumstances, would not be regarded as being badly in need of eligibility for free general medical services but I submit that such persons <Col N="81" /> are few in number and that, consequently, we need not concern ourselves unduly with them.  They would not be likely to avail of the service in any event.  It is entirely in keeping with the whole trend in community thinking that senior citizens should have automatic entitlement to free general medical services.</P>
    <P>The case in respect of widows is equally self-evident.  Widows are in a very special category.  They are a section of our community who require and deserve special consideration and concern.  Any reasonable approach to the question of an extension of eligibility for the general medical services would include widows automatically.</P>
    <P>The case for including persons suffering from long-term illnesses is unanswerable. There are special provisions in existence for such persons in so far as a limited number of illnesses are concerned and I know that recently the Minister extended the list of diseases but, again, the simple straightforward way of dealing with the matter is to make automatic and obligatory the issuing of medical cards to all persons suffering from any long-term illnesses. Regardless of how the Minister may extend the categories there will always be the case which, if excluded, will result in hardship.  It must be pointed out, too, that in respect of the diseases listed by the Minister, the sufferers are entitled only to special financial assistance relating to certain costs and expenses.  I am proposing that they be entitled to the full services which a medical card would make available to them.</P>
    <P>When we specified these various categories we should not be regarded as excluding any other either now or in the future.  No doubt most Deputies, from their own experience in their constituencies, will see a need to add to the list of three which I have included in the motion.  Indeed, no sooner had I drafted the motion and tabled it than I realised there was one important category which I should have included and which I would include if I were to amend the motion. I refer to unmarried mothers.  The issue of medical cards to persons in this category should be automatic also.  I trust that if the Minister is <Col N="82" /> adopting our proposal he will include them.  I should hope also that the categories I am enumerating would be regarded as a tentative beginning and that the list would be added to periodically as the need arises and as resources become available.</P>
    <P>In addition to the desirability of improving generally our health services by making the general medical service available to a wider section of the community, there exists an immediate, urgent need to revise the present income limits upwards so as to cope with the effects of inflation.  The existing guidelines are being rendered irrelevant by these inflationary pressures. Income increases which have been granted, either to people in employment or to those in receipt of social welfare were granted to compensate for increases in the cost of living.  However, these increases are resulting in medical cards being withdrawn unjustifiably from people to whom they had been issued already and are operating in a way that prevents the issue of new cards in cases where the necessity for them is clear. This is because these necessary increases are resulting in persons earning more than is the guideline in the limits for eligibility.</P>
    <P>I went through my constituency correspondence and at random&mdash;I am sure most Deputies could do the same&mdash;I was able to extract seven cases where medical cards are denied to individuals and families where any of us would agree that, if at all possible, the card should have been issued.</P>
    <P>I shall take the case of Mrs. D who lives in Artane.  She applied for a medical card in 1973 in respect of her baby daughter who was a rubella baby and was also born deaf.  With the complaint this child has, she is open to colds and infection and needs permanent heating in her bedroom. The family installed central heating which they could barely afford.  The child requires regular attention and they are finding it very difficult to meet the bill.  The husband is not covered by any insurance scheme and any visits to specialists or anything of that nature has to be paid for out of <Col N="83" /> their own resources and they are not able to afford the cost involved.</P>
    <P>When I got in touch with the Eastern Health Board I was told that because of the family income they would not be eligible for a card but my attention was directed to a scheme where the cost of medicines in excess of £4 in a calendar month can be refunded to them.  That is a help but it is not sufficient.  They still have to pay £4 a month for drugs.  That scheme is not very efficiently administered.  In addition there are countless other medical expenses which they have to meet out of their own meagre resources.  That is a typical case extracted at random.</P>
    <P>There is another case, that of Mrs. C of Santry, who has a three-year-old boy who suffers from hypogammaglobulinemia. It is a long-term illness which requires very special treatment.  She also applied for and was refused a medical card.  I appealed to the Minister for Health in that case and I had a very courteous and helpful letter from the Minister but the gist of it is that in the circumstances and within the context of the guidelines laid down for the Eastern Health Board, a medical card cannot be issued.  He directed my attention to the scheme for refunding the cost of drugs and medicines in excess of £4 a month.  That is of very little help to this woman who is a widow.</P>
    <P>Another widow, Mrs. C of Coolock, has a full contributory widow's pension which comes to £18.95 per week. She works part-time in a local factory. She has three children and after all the calculations are made and all allowances granted to her within the guidelines, she is about £4 over the limit and is denied a medical card. Again, this is a particular case in which I think in the circumstances of today a medical card should be issued.</P>
    <P>I have put down in the motion particular figures because I thought it advisable and desirable that I should put some positive proposals to the Minister.  As regards (4), I set out that medical cards should be issued in the case of families where the weekly income of the husband and wife after deducting rent, rates, ground rent, mortgage repayments <Col N="84" /> and expenses necessarily incurred in travelling to and from work and an amount of £4 per week in respect of each child with no income under 18 years of age, does not exceed £40 per week.  There is nothing sacrosanct about the £40 per week or the £4 per child and if the Minister were to accept lesser figures I do not think anybody would quarrel with him.  I do not want to suggest that my figures are figures over which we would challenge a division.  They are just a kind of starting point and I put them into the motion for the sake of having some positive figures to work on.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should explain why we have adopted the particular method set out in the motion to achieve the extension of the general medical service which we believe to be necessary at this time.  We have done so because it seems to be the only means by which such an extension could be immediately and uniformly accomplished throughout the whole country. In 1970, the Minister for Health asked the CEOs of the eight health boards to accept responsibility for deciding who is, or is not entitled to a medical card and he urged that uniform standards be adopted in all areas.  That was agreed to and the present position is that medical cards are issued throughout the country on the basis of guidelines laid down by the eight CEOs of the health boards in pursuance of that agreement. To bring about the substantial change we regard as vitally necessary would, I assume, involve getting those eight regional health boards through their CEOs to adopt new criteria and guidelines.  That would seem to involve long and tedious negotiations and the process might well turn out to be fruitless at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The procedure we are proposing in the motion is that the Minister make an order with the consent of the Minister for Finance which would enable this proposal, if the House deems it to be worthy and worth while, to be brought into operation immediately throughout all regions on a uniform basis.  We do not regard it as appropriate for us, as a responsible and constructive Opposition, <Col N="85" /> simply to demand the provision of services without any regard to their cost or the budgetary implications involved.  We, also, must establish our priorities and we must relate any proposal we put forward to the overall financial situation.  Fully conscious of that responsibility we have however, no hesitation in putting forward this proposal and pressing its adoption on the Government and the Minister.  I think the House will appreciate that on these Opposition benches we have found great difficulty in endeavouring to calculate the exact cost of this proposal but we are satisfied on the best evidence available to us that cost need not be prohibitive. In the context of an Estimate of £177 million for the Department of Health this year, the cost of our proposal would be of an order that could legitimately be dealt with within the normal processes of dealing with excess expenditure of a Vote of the size of the Department of Health.  Certainly there is no other proposal over the entire spectrum of the health services that would bring such widespread and universal relief throughout the economy for such a relatively modest cost.</P>
    <P>This is a serious considered proposal. I hope it will be considered by the House on its merits and that it will receive mature examination.  I am quite certain that Deputies, with their experience of the administration of health services, will be able to point perhaps to flaws in this proposal, to suggest improvements and, if necessary, limitations on what we propose. I hope it will be dealt with by the House in that attitude and that we will not have, as unfortunately we sometimes have from the Government back benches, a certain standardised, sterile type of comment.  This extension in eligibility for medical cards is urgently needed to alleviate widespread worry and hardship among a large section of the community.  I strongly commend this proposal to the House and to the Minister.  While having regard to limitations that may exist, I hope it will receive favourable and sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>I have considerable sympathy for the suggestions set out in Deputy Haughey's motion but its complexity has been glossed over by the proposer.  Acceptance of this motion would mean that we would reach a point where almost 90 per cent of the population would be covered by the GMS.  A national health service has its supporters and its critics. There are sections in the motion that should be given serious consideration and, if the finance is available, they should be implemented immediately.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) of the motion refers to persons suffering from any long-term illness.  They should be given the optimum benefit of the health services. In this category we should include people suffering from chronic bronchitis, regardless of the cause; chornic arthritis, regardless of origin or definition; chronic heart disease and acute heart disease; and asthma, regardless of the type.  We should also include people suffering from anaemia and chronic leukaemia as well as people suffering from a group of minor ailments.  We have the highest percentage rate in Europe for some of those illnesses.  I realise this would be a major financial undertaking but it would bring great relief to the sufferers.</P>
      <P>It is important to quote the section of the Health Act, 1970, to which Deputy Haughey referred.  Section 45 (1) states:</P>
      <P>A person in either of the following categories shall have full eligibility for the services under this Part&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  Adult persons unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants,</P>
      <P>(b)  dependants of the persons referred to in paragraph (a). </P>
      <P>Section 46 (8) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person who is not in any of <Col N="87" /> the categories specified in subsection (1) or in regulations under subsection (3) but who, in relation to a particular service which is available to persons with limited eligibility, is considered by the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board to be unable, without undue hardship, to provide that service for himself or his dependants shall, in relation to that service, be deemed to be a person with limited eligibility.</P>
    <P>These conditions are well defined in a very bureaucratic Health Act, an Act that is not fully understood by the people.  The Health Act, 1970, was one of the most complicated pieces of legislation brought before this House in relation to the health services.  I know that the wish of the Minister is to have health services that the people can understand and use.  At the moment people are entitled to a refund of expenditure in excess of £4 per calendar month but many people do not understand this or know how to go about claiming the refund.  It is not the fault of the Department. The facility exists but people are slow to claim it.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Haughey is referring to really is 15p per day in the cost of medicines.  This is the maximum for a person suffering from a long-term illness or for a person who has an illness in the family.  The sum involved is 15p per day over 28 days.  Perhaps a survey might be taken of the number of people who applied, correlate that with the number of people using the medical services outside the GMS, take account of the number of prescriptions issued per month by chemists on a private basis and thus see the percentage availing of the service. In this way it might be possible to get a more accurate figure regarding costs.</P>
    <P>A problem arises in that the Medical Union contend that in the initial agreement made with regard to the GMS the percentage of the population covered should not exceed 33 per cent.  It is around that figure now.  If Deputy Haughey's motion were accepted there would be a difficulty in <Col N="88" /> that matter.  There would also be a problem with the chemists.  That question was satisfactorily resolved by the Minister recently and he must be congratulated for his efforts.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed about one aspect. There is a stigma attached to the medical card and we want to eliminate that.  We want all patients to be equal. There are too many medical cards. There is the British Army Services card, the CIE medical card, the Garda medical card, the Dublin Port and Docks card.  There are far too many different coloured medical cards and not all of them entitle one to as much as the GMS card.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the card system go altogether.  I should like to see everybody equal and that they would themselves feel equal.  In the country they will not use the medical card on many occasions because of the stigma attached to it.  As far as the motion is concerned, there is validity for persons over 65 to be covered. The age should be practical, though persons over 65 years could do with the GMS card.  Widows in so far as they do not include wealthy widows should be covered.  Their dependants should be included.  There are deserted wives and unmarried mothers.  It is not unusual nowadays for many members of the clerical institutions to have the GMS card.  It applies to university students, and every child up to the age of 16 and attending school has the medical card.  This would have to be altered or amended in a way that would give children up to the age of 18 and attending school the use of the card.  The figure in the motion of £40 per week for a married man and £20 for a single man seems to me to be quite a high figure for qualification but it could be altered a little.</P>
    <P>One thing I should love to see, and I should like to have heard Deputy Haughey refer to and I hope the Minister will refer to it, is that 33 per cent of the population are covered by the medical card.  How often do those patients visit with the medical card and what is the cost to the State? I hope the Minister refers to this in his reply because it is causing a lot of consternation at the present time. <Col N="89" /> A doctor will have a person with a medical card coming in to see him 50 times a year but as soon as he loses the card he does not get sick until, perhaps, in three or four years' time when he is out of work and he gets the card back.  There is widespread abuse of the medical card in certain areas to the extent that it could be termed criminal.  People come in to health centres around the city and in other urban areas looking for Dettol, hair shampoos, creams, baby lotions, tonics, soap, and they are entitled to them under the Health Service Regulations of 1972.  A doctor under the GMS can be brought before a committee for not prescribing these things under subsection (5).</P>
    <P>I think the State at the moment could afford what Deputy Haughey has suggested in his motion.  There are areas in respect of which it could be afforded with no extra expense if far greater control were kept on the abuse of the medical card.  I have seen people who needed medical treatment not being able to get it.  I have seen people hesitate to look for medical treatment, but I have also seen widespread abuse.  It is in that grey area of the 1 or 2 per cent who abuse the medical card that discipline should be brought in by the health boards.  There are eight CEOs in the country and this load should be taken off the backs of GPs&mdash;the swapping of cards, the bringing in of neighbours' children to a locum.  This is widespread&mdash;I am not exaggerating. Because of that the people who are paying rates, mortgages, ground rents and so on should be entitled to a little more.  I am fully in support of the ideals in this motion in which I would include dependants of Army personnel because I find they are a deprived section.</P>
    <P>The £177 million for health services this year is an increase of 340 per cent during the last five years.  Some tremendously good things have been done.  There were the recent additions in the 1975 regulations of Parkinson's disease, acute leukaemia, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and, in 1973, the thalidomide sufferers.  I know these will be extended and that <Col N="90" /> as much relief as possible will be given in so far as the Exchequer can bear it.</P>
    <P>There is no Minister more concerned than the Minister for Health about providing help in that grey area Deputy Haughey referred to.  We have the men: we have more doctors per head of the population than any other country in Europe and in Dublin we have more than in any other city in Europe bar Geneva; we have more nurses per head of the population than any other country; we have more hospital beds per head of the population. What we are lacking is in the small percentage of money being spent to expand the services the other little bit that is needed&mdash;to the widows, the over 65s and so forth.  They cannot be looked after to the extent that we would wish.</P>
    <P>If this could be done, we would have the back of the problem broken forever.  The GMS would require only small additions.  This is the final rock that has to be moved, the final pill for the services.  I know the Minister wants this done as soon as possible. I sincerely hope that those who speak after me will not attempt to debase the good intentions behind the motion.</P>
    <P>The 33 per cent of the population covered in the agreement with the Medical Union and the IMA, the contract entered into with the chemists, the increased administrative costs, the increase in the cost of distributing these drugs through the chemists, are a measure of our concern.</P>
    <P>One thing I should like the Minister to refer to in his reply is the dental service.  I know the people concerned in this motion want that.  We want the dental service improved.  It is one of the priorities of the health services. There are illnesses resulting from dental disease and I appeal to the Minister in his reply to give that some mention.  I had a case of a person recently who was quoted a bill of £600 for dental treatment to hold on to a few teeth.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that there are provisions in the Health Act which mean that people need not necessarily suffer because of the cost of either hospitalisation or medicines but there is a very real subjective suffering and <Col N="91" /> a feeling of being a burden on the health services.  The services may suffer from financial anaemia and that is the responsibility of the Exchequer. What is in this motion is part of the Fine Gael policy document &ldquo;Towards a Just Society&rdquo;.  The figures have been changed a little.  It is also part of the National Coalition policy.  I do not think there would be any great objection to it provided the money was there.</P>

      <P>I rise to support Deputy Haughey's motion.  It focuses attention on something we have neglected to emphasise up to now.  I am not criticising the health services which I believe are generally quite good.  It is our duty to keep people out of hospital.  Deputy Haughey mentioned the stress and strain on a patient who is worried about how he is to pay for his treatment in hospital. This is not conducive to a speedy recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne said we have got more hospital beds, doctors and nurses than any country in Europe.  To say we have more hospital beds may be a doubtful compliment.  It may be that we are not taking sufficient steps to provide people with proper treatment at home.  St. Vincent's Hospital was only completed in the last few years and already it is too small and some of its patients have to be accommodated in a nearby hospital.  With the best intentions we are trying to provide more hospital beds but with the cost nowadays of keeping a person in hospital anybody who can be treated at home should be treated there.  This would not just save money.  There are also sociological factors involved.  It is much easier today to treat people at home than it was 20 years ago. Our housing standards have risen greatly.  In urban areas at any rate most houses have a supply of hot and cold water.  Certain medical and surgical treatment could be provided at <Col N="92" /> home.  The local health centre should be the focal point of this.  I would urge the Minister to consider the idea of having mobile teams at each health centre who could treat people in their own homes.  In this way a colossal amount of money could be saved.  It would also mean that a mother, say, with a slight illness could stay at home with her children.  This is not new thinking.  The maternity hospitals have been doing this kind of thing for years.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask who will foot the bill if he accepts Deputy Haughey's motion.  I suggest that if he concentrated more on home treatment the money saved would enable him to accept the motion.  The concern is not just to save money but to make people better.  I say the emphasis should be on the prevention of illness by providing the best services possible and by removing the fear that people will not be treated because they cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>When I was a young man I worked with a man who had TB.  I am convinced that he died because he went on working to the very end.  In the late 1940s the late Dr. Ryan brought in a Bill which removed the means test in the case of TB.  This was a great step forward.  It meant that people could go for treatment and not worry about where the money came from.  The emphasis should be on preventive rather than remedial measures. Deputy Haughey's motion is a step in that direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned the abuse of the medical card.  He has more experience than I have and I do not disbelieve him.  However, the abuse of any art or science is not a condemnation of it.  Human nature will tend to abuse but even if there is abuse and even if home treatment costs money it will not cost as much as hospitalisation.  At present the Eastern Health Board pay about £20 a week towards the cost of keeping a person in an institution.  When one adds on what is paid by people themselves it shows the cost of keeping a person in hospital for even one week. Even the most modern hospital has a a huge staff.  Apart from the medical <Col N="93" /> staff there are clerical and manual workers.  I serve on the board of a federated hospital in this city.  It is an old building.  The Government grants keep it going but in order to make it better some of the most eminent medical and business people in the city try to raise funds for the hospital.  We are quite successful.  The money raised is small when compared with the cost of keeping a person there but that does not cause us to lose heart.  In fact, it spurs us on.</P>
    <P>The time has come for us to look at the whole matter of the ever-rising costs of staffs, general upkeep of the hospitals, drugs and medicines, and to find out where there is the greatest loss of money. I suggest the greatest cost arises because so many people are hospitalised.  There are times when people must be sent to hospital.  I am sure Deputy Byrne, Deputy Coughlan and Deputy Haughey will agree that very often you cannot get a person into hospital because the hospital are full all the time.  This is no reflection on our medical services.  It shows that we need, to use a modern cliché, an in-depth examination of the whole structure of the hospital services particularly in the larger cities.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the projected size of St. James' Hospital, and what it will be like when it is finished and has absorbed most of the federated hospitals. Medical men tell you today that larger hospitals are better for training personnel and better for patients, and that doctors gain more experience by having a varied list of cases in a hospital.  The Minister might ask the new health committee to examine very closely how much it costs to run the hospitals.  If we examined the cost of maintaining one patient in a modern hospital for a month we would find that the figure was staggering.  If that person had the benefit of an early diagnosis and if he could have availed of the medical card, he might not have had to be hospitalised.  A person with a medical card has no fear of having to meet hospital bills.  Many of us know from personal experience what a worry it <Col N="94" /> is to receive a colossal bill from a hospital and then to be told that we also have to pay the physician or the surgeon.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Byrne that very often the health services are not explained to people.  People come to us with their problems and we explain how they can benefit under the health services.  That relieves their mind of some worry.  Of course, in some cases we have to say: &ldquo;I am sorry.  You do not qualify.&rdquo;  They say : &ldquo;I have a young family and I cannot afford to go into hospital.&rdquo;  They go on working until they cannot work any longer. They then have to think of the day when they will have to settle their bills.  This does not help them to recover. It retards their recovery.</P>
    <P>We should emphasise to the medical men that they should try to treat people at home instead of removing them from their families and sending them into hospital.  The health services must pay the colossal cost when they are hospitalised.  Deputy Byrne mentioned the abuse of the medical cards.  It is better that they should be abused than that one genuine case should suffer.  I know a man who is an alcoholic.  He will not admit it. He is still working.  His wife has no medical card.  He cannot afford to give her much money because he drinks most of his wages.  This whole family are suffering because they have no medical card.  The returns from his employer say he is earning £x per week which puts him beyond the limit for a medical card.  His wife has got to try to keep the family going in clothing and in food on the pittance he gives her each week.  In that case, even though there might be an abuse of the medical card, I would give it to them.  I do not see why his wife and children should suffer because the man needs treatment and will not take it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to examine an allegation which is often made, with some truth I think, that in the Dublin area it is harder to get a medical card than it is in other parts of the country.  I do not know what the criteria for medical cards are. The Minister might see whether we <Col N="95" /> could lower the qualifying requirements so that we will be able to ensure that a person who deserves a card, not because of his income but because of his medical needs, will get it.  It is foolish to think that by refusing a card to a person we will save money. I suppose in a few cases we would save money but, in many cases, the fact that a person did not get a card eventually adds very much to the cost of the care of that person when he has to go into hospital for treatment.</P>
    <P>In my experience, the treatment in our hospitals is of a very high standard. Whether or not you have a medical card, while you are in hospital you are given the very best treatment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey's motion proposes that persons over 65 years of age should be given medical cards.  We could do this.  People will be living longer because of the excellence of our health services.  There is also the fact that the expectation of life is getting much longer.  Therefore, we will have a problem on our hands with regard to homes for our old people.  As we become more materialistic, the modern tendency is to put old people into homes.  I know that in many cases this cannot be avoided. The person's family may have all died or he may have some chronic illness and must go into a home.  I would appeal to the Minister to try to provide homes for old people near the health centres in the urban areas.  I often thought how wonderful it would be if we could have local homes for old people so that they would not have to leave their neighbourhood and could look out the windows at familiar scenes.  This would be good for them.  With Dublin becoming so big, people have to go a journey of several miles to the geriatric homes. They are taken out of their old habitats and put into new surroundings. Every time one visits them they ask to be taken home again or to be brought back at least into the city.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the abuse of medical cards.  Education in the proper use of medical cards would be valuable.  It should be clearly shown <Col N="96" /> to those who abuse these cards that they are being unfair to others who have to pay heavily in taxation so that they can abuse these cards while those who pay the bill are deprived of medical cards.  That should be clearly spelled out.  Entitlements should be clearly defined.  That would be a valuable exercise in economics though we do not run our health services on the basis of economics.</P>
    <P>One glaring omission arises under dental services.  A man's wife does not qualify for dental treatment. Dental treatment can be a major factor in good health or bad health, as major as other organic disabilities. This discrimination against women should be ended.  Women should be treated on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey's motion is a good one.  It will not cost a great deal of money.  It has been shown that its implementation would actually save money.  The cost of hospitalisation is truly frightening and we may well reach the stage at which we will not be able to put people into hospital because of the cost.  Health boards are having a tough time meeting their commitments.  I work for a charitable organisation and I have found the health boards most helpful.  The people involved are dedicated and they give all the assistance possible.  At the moment it is not so easy to get money from the health boards.  I appreciate that a great part of the problem is the ever-rising cost of hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>We have here a new approach, an approach which will help to prevent people getting ill.  This motion, if accepted, will reassure those who fear they cannot afford to be ill.  One sympathises with the Minister in the task of finding the money to finance all these services.  I believe preventive medicine is the answer.  It would effect a great saving on hospitalisation and that would enable other services to be expanded in the way suggested in the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on this motion as a member of a health authority for well over 25 years. Initially, we were just an ordinary board dealing with mental illness.  As <Col N="97" /> time went on we developed into a health authority with responsibility for the city and county of Limerick, governing all the hospitals, with the exception of the voluntary hospitals which were privately run.  Later on, we were formed into a health board with responsibility for the city and county of Limerick, all Clare and North Tipperary.  Having listened to the previous speakers, I am amazed at the fact that they know so little about this whole subject.  I cannot understand the statements made with regard to the general medical services operated by the board of which I am a member. I also happen to be a member of the board of both the voluntary hospitals in Limerick, St. John's Hospital and Barrington's Hospital.  I think I know a little about what it takes to run health services, to run them as efficiently and as economically as possible. We have our problems.  Who has not?  But, if we have our problems, we face up to them within the limits of our resources.  On our health board all the professions are represented.  We have the GPs, the specialists, the dentists, the nurses and the public representatives.  I could not imagine a more representative group setting out to solve, rectify and improve the health services of our region.</P>
      <P>The people who spoke here this evening are obviously looking at the problem through long distance binoculars. They should take a close-up view of the immediate problem and see the reality of the situation.  We would all like to give and go on giving.  We would all like to have our patients in private rooms.  So far nobody has really dealt with the question of cost.  Deputy Moore said he had some experience of an organisation here in Dublin&mdash;he did not name it&mdash;but anyone who is attached to the health services knows what it costs to run these institutions and provide the services.  We have been operating these services over a long number of years.  Here, I must say that the late Minister for Health did an excellent job within his resources.  He recognised reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without being in any way complimentary to the present Minister, I must say he has excelled in overcoming certain <Col N="98" /> difficulties with which he was faced.  God knows they were tremendous at times during the discussions when strikes were threatened by all sections of the medical profession&mdash;the general practitioners one day, the consultants another day and the nurses another day.  We did not have anything like this in the past.  I am surprised at a professional man like Deputy Byrne telling us we can give this and it will cost nothing.  I expected a lot more from him.  I am only an ordinary man who is acquainted with the people who live on the side of the street.  I do not look at them through my binoculars.</P>
    <P>We should consider all those things when we seek the sanction of the House for a particular project.  I have 25 years' experience in public life and I do not think I am an amadán.  I am afraid, judging from some of the things I have heard, that there are some among us.  We have to have a certain degree of discipline and investigation in the administration of the health services. Those are not civil service regulations or regulations laid down by people who say that this is it and beyond that we cannot go.  We have our own guidelines.  The health boards consist of people who have come together in various areas.  They are men from rich land and poor land who deal with all sections of the community. They have agreed on certain lines of operation, but these are not strictly adhered to.  There is no hard and fast rule in my health board area and I am sure the members of the other seven health boards are as humane and conscious of the problems that exist as we are.  We have full co-operation from all the people represented on that board&mdash;the general practitioners, consultants, nurses, dentists and public representatives. We also have people who are interested in social work generally. Those people are nominated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>My health board are anxious to help not alone the people who are ill but their dependants.  Following their establishment all the health boards agreed that certain objectives should be set, and within that context we should look at every case presented to us, irrespective of the income going into the <Col N="99" /> particular house.  That is the way medical cards are issued and not as set out in the portion of the Health Act read by Deputy Byrne.  Deputy Haughey mentioned three or four cases.  If those were in our area they would get immediate attention.  I am surprised such things are happening in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey and Deputy Byrne said that the monthly refund was £4. This is £3 in my area.  If receipts are presented for anything between £3 and £5 spent in a month, half that sum is refunded; and if over £5 is spent, all the money is refunded.</P>

The Deputies would need to get some specialist to try and diagnose whatever grey matter lies in their heads.  Nobody has told me what this proposal will cost but in my area we costed most of the items referred to.  At present in the region of 3,000 people are employed <Col N="100" /> and we are giving a service to 100,000 people by way of medical cards.  However, it does not stop at that.  The fact that a person holds a medical card does not limit him to the benefits of the Health Act.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1975: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed : &ldquo;That section 28 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned I am more than anxious to ensure the equity of the tax system.  I would be willing to ensure that there is equality of treatment on either side. However, we must take account of the fact that the purpose of charging interest on overdue tax is to provide a disincentive to withholding tax. No case can be made for paying the same rate of interest to people who overpay tax as is charged against people who withhold tax.  In one case it is a penalty for withholding tax, it is a disincentive against withholding tax and the other case, while the Exchequer may have the use of moneys advanced by a taxpayer, arises where the taxpayer failed to furnish the information necessary to make a correct assessment.  In my view no legitimate case can be made for giving total compensation to some person who has failed to comply with his legal obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the desirability of ensuring that where there is a genuine mistake or where hardship is identified some arrangement should be made which will enable some interest to be paid in respect of the Exchequer's use of the money which the Exchequer received.  The law enables interest to be paid where an excess payment is made by the taxpayer pending appeal.  If it were possible to work out a system of payment at an appropriate rate of interest rather than a penal rate of interest on overpayments of taxes in other circumstances I would be disposed to consider it.  It is not something that can <Col N="101" /> be treated simply because on many occasions on notional tax payments the Exchequer does not receive the money for a long time afterwards. This happens in the case of deductions of tax from dividends.  In such cases the Exchequer may not receive the tax in question from the company concerned until a long time after the taxpayer has suffered a notional deduction of tax.  Situations can arise where tax deductible from dividends is repayable because the taxpayer in question is not liable for the payment of the tax.  These are extremely difficult and complex situations, even though they are frequent, and it is difficult to devise some appropriate form of interest payment to deal with situations of that kind.  It certainly could not be dealt with in the way suggested in the amendment.</P>
    <P>Of course, as the Chair pointed out, we are not discussing the amendment which has been ruled out of order; we are discussing the section which seeks only to deal with cases in which people are withholding tax from the Exchequer and not cases where the Exchequer has received an overpayment.  I have been asked whether I accept the principle that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  I accept that principle but how one pours the sauce, or what the ingredients of the sauce should be in any given circumstance, is something over which experts will always be in disagreement.  However, I would be disposed to look at this but it would not be possible to deal with the problem in the way suggested by the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that what the Minister has said is an advance on his earlier statement.  The Minister is now saying that he would be prepared to consider arrangements whereby interest would be paid on overpayments of tax but at a lower rate than the 18 per cent imposed in this section on overdue payments of tax.  While it is an advance I have an unworthy suspicion. I understand the Minister to say that this section has the effect of providing that the Revenue Commissions will pay interest at 18 per cent <Col N="102" /> on repayments of tax found to have been overpaid as a result of an appeal where 80 per cent of the due tax was paid before the appeal.  For the Minister to say there is no case for applying the same rate of interest to overpaid tax as to overdue tax seems that he is saying that the section is doing something he does not approve of.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about making arrangements whereby in certain circumstances interest would be paid but at a lower rate, but does he intend to reverse the effect of this section in doing that?  The section provides for payment of interest at 18 per cent in limited cases by the Revenue Commissioners but would the arrangements the Minister has in mind reduce that 18 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would want to look at the whole package and not deal with anything in isolation.  Where there is a difference of opinion between a taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners if the Revenue Commissioners are unsuccessful in their assessment of the situation then one could consider that there has been some &ldquo;blame attaching to them&rdquo; by their incorrect assessment.  Therefore it could be argued in such a situation that it might be appropriate for them to pay at the higher rate.  But I would not even regard that as being necessarily true in all cases.  However, if a person overpays tax and there is some fault on the part of that person&mdash;because, say, he has not furnished the correct information&mdash;that situation cannot be treated as being on all fours with the kind of situation which arises from an overpayment as a result of an appeal: in one case the fault lies with the taxpayer in not furnishing the correct particulars and in the other the claim to refund arises because the Revenue Commissioners, as it were, exceeded their authority or made an assessment in excess of their powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider he is getting into very difficult country once he starts trying to apportion blame to the Revenue Commissioners or to the taxpayer?  Is the real question not that of having the <Col N="103" /> use of another person's money, whether it is the Exchequer having the use of the taxpayer's money or the taxpayer having the use of the Exchequer's money?  On that basis should not it be measured on the basis of how much interest should be payable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are getting into an argument, which I know I introduced, as to whether the appropriate rate is the going price or what we are doing in this section, that is, providing at the going price plus a penalty in respect of non-payment. The two are separate issues and must be looked at separately.  The section deals only with the case of imposition of a penalty, which is the going price plus penalty.  Perhaps we could argue on another occasion, if there is an amendment of the law in relation to refund of tax, what should be the appropriate rate of interest on a refund, given that the circumstances which occasioned the refund may be attributable to a variety of causes, some of which would very properly apportion blame to the taxpayer and others would be due to a &ldquo;misjudgment&rdquo; on the part of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister correct in what he says, in so far as he says that this section deals only with the question of payment of interest on money withheld by a taxpayer which, in his view, should contain not only the element of interest proportionate to the use of the money but also a form of penalty?  In fact the section, according to the Minister, covers also the repayment of tax to a taxpayer who has appealed, has been found to be correct in his appeal and provides for repayment, plus interest, at 18 per cent.  Therefore I do not think the Minister is correct in saying that the section deals only with a withholding of tax; it covers also a repayment of tax at 18 per cent.  I wonder are the Minister's words before we adjourned coming home to roost?  By any chance does the section contain something he did not intend; When he referred to what occurred when I was Minister for Finance and said that to say that <Col N="104" /> the parliamentary draftsmen did not quite carry out the intention of the Minister was a very lame excuse.  I wonder is that happening to the Minister on this section?  Did he intend to apply a rate of 18 per cent interest to a refund of tax to the taxpayer, because it does not seem to square with what he has just been telling us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 31 of the Finance Act, 1964, provides that, where an amount of corporation profits tax is paid on account in a case under appeal and where as a result of the appeal an amount of the tax falls to be repaid, or to be paid where there is an underpayment of tax, the tax overpaid is to be repaid, with interest, at the rate specified in section 14 of the Finance Act, 1962, that is in paragraph 28 (1) (a).  Of course tax underpaid carries a similar rate of interest.  As the rate of interest so specified is being raised to 1.5 per cent, this rate will apply as from 6th April, 1975, in respect of any tax overpaid or underpaid.  Section 419 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, contains, in relation to income tax provisions corresponding to those I have mentioned already, and of course the rate of 1.5 per cent will apply in the same way to any balances of income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has not quite dealt with the point I raised.  However, I will not pursue that; it might be a little awkward for him.  Could the Minister tell us, when he says he would be prepared to consider arrangements whereby interest would be paid on overpayments of tax in particular circumstances, other than on appeal, does he have in mind amendment of this Bill while it is going through the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to give that assurance because it is a very complex area.  I have merely mentioned a few of them.  Deputy Colley acknowledged that it was not done in his day as Minister for Finance, neither was it done in the days when any of his colleagues on that side of the House was Minister.  I am not going to accuse him of any want of desire or of any incompetence.  I am <Col N="105" /> saying it is an extremely difficult area with which to deal.  One would need to look very carefully at the several situations which can arise to ensure that one did not create in the tax legislation a facility intended originally as a disincentive to the withholding of tax which would enable some people to use the system to make a profit for themselves by making overpayments in certain situations, then claiming interest on those overpayments which may be attributable to their own failure to furnish proper accounts in the first instance.  It is not a simple field.  I wish it was.  If it was one could quickly bring in a suitable amendment of the law.  But it is a very complex field and we have to guard against any erosion of the money due properly to the Exchequer while, at the same time, I would recognise, observe the obligation to be fair to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that it would have been a much simpler operation had the Minister accepted our amendment to make the interest rate 12 per cent per annum instead of 18 per cent, because he would not then have had the fear that people might start deliberately overpaying tax in order to get a rate of interest they could not get anywhere else.  In that connection, could I ask whether, under the existing provisions for repayment of tax with interest, after an appeal, that interest is regarded as income subject to income tax or whether it is free of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is tax free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore in circumstances where somebody is going to get a refund, under the existing law he is going to get 18 per cent tax free on his overpayment.  That is a return he will find very difficult to get anywhere else.  I think the Minister will agree with that.  Surely it highlights what is the real problem here?  I think the Minister has hinted at the extent of the problem if he were to apply the principle we have been trying to enunciate, that is, there would be no better investment for anybody than to overpay tax and get interest at 18 <Col N="106" /> per cent tax free from the Revenue Commissioners?  The Minister would of course, wipe out all the financial institutions in the country were he to do this and would gather all investment money available into the Revenue Commissioners in the form of overpayment of tax.  Clearly this is impractical; it cannot be done.  But the real problem is that the rate of interest is too high.  We tried to tell the Minister that before and he would not listen to us.</P>
      <P>However, as I understand it, we now have a situation where this section provides that in circumstances where the taxpayer has appealed and, before the appeal, has paid a sum which turns out to be at least 80 per cent of what he is found to owe in tax, as the Minister pointed out earlier, in order to get a refund at 18 per cent per annum, he has to pay more than 100 per cent. That is the position under this Bill, as I understand it.  That seems to be a peculiar situation to say the least, but the peculiarity arises because the Minister has imposed such a high rate of interest in this section&mdash;a rate of interest which we have good reason to suspect is higher than in any other country of which he is aware in such circumstances.  I suggest that when the Minister is reconsidering this matter&mdash; and I understand from what he said that he is undertaking to give further consideration to this whole problem&mdash;he also reconsider the rate of interest being charged in this section which is leading to such ridiculous results.</P>

      <P>In the light of what the Minister has said and if my understanding is correct, that he is prepared to look at this section again, we will not oppose it.  I would ask him if possible to look at it between now and dealing with the Bill in the other House.  I realise that it may not be possible to do this because of difficulties but it would be worth trying.  I also appreciate that it may be even more difficult to do it in this House.  I take it that the Minister intends actively <Col N="107" /> to pursue this and will not wait until it is again raised here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it does. What has emerged is that existing legislation, limited as it is, makes an effort to be fair to the taxpayer.  The Minister has refused point blank to be fair to the taxpayer in all the discussion on this section until, during the adjournment he apparently thought about it, came back and said what he did, which was an advance.  If we are going to talk about the attitudes of the Minister and of his various predecessors let us put it in perspective.  He has refused point blank to do anything to help the taxpayer who has overpaid, whereas he has increased by 50 per cent, to an exorbitant rate, the interest being charged by the Revenue Commissioners. That is the situation in its true perspective.</P>

      <P>This debate has gone on because I said it would not take me 16 years to consider the matter. The only change in the law which we are now making is providing for a level of interest which will act as a disincentive to people withholding money from the Exchequer.  The facts are there to prove that the existing level of interest is inadequate to act as a disincentive to people to withhold tax from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I pointed out hours ago that the amount of arrears are now 30 times greater than they were ten years ago although the tax income is only five times greater.  Profit can now be made by people who withhold tax and use this money for their benefit.  The majority of people have no option in this matter because tax is deducted from their wages.

I am prepared to accept that in the light of experience they see they were in error to have had such an arrangement.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, in effect, amends the provisions of section 39 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, and reproduces the amended provision in the income tax part of the Finance Bill, since those provisions relate to the adjustment of capital allowances for income tax and corporation profits tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> The purpose of section 39 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, as it stands, is to secure that when the cost of any machinery and plant or any other capital expenditure is being taken into account for the purposes of the allowances in respect of capital expenditure available under the Income Tax, 1967, or the Finance Act, 1971, the amount of that expenditure to be taken into account is to be reduced by VAT deductions or repayments claimable under section 12 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, in respect of that expenditure.  This treatment is being extended to the new capital allowances provided under the Finance (Taxation of Profits of Certain Mines) Act, 1974, and to the allowance in respect of farm buildings and other works introduced by section 22 of the Finance Act, 1974.</P>
    <P>Account will also be taken of VAT repayments which can be claimed under orders made by the Minister under section 20 (3) of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972.  Any such repayment will be deducted in arriving at the amount of allowable expenditure.</P>

      <P>What I am saying may appear to be out of order, but this is a bit difficult.  You will recall that section 3 of the Bill was deleted by reason of an amendment by the Minister, and a new section 33 is proposed to be inserted under amendment No. 16.  I do not want to stray too far from this section but there is a very close relationship.  In that proposed new section &ldquo;capital allowance&rdquo; is to define, amongst other things, as an <Col N="111" /> allowance other than an allowance or deduction to be made in computing profits or gains.  May we take it that all of the allowances referred to in section 29 are allowances other than allowances or deductions to be made in computing profits or gains?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not clear on the face of the section.  Could the Minister elaborate a little further?  The section does not appear to be confined to capital allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is not quite right, because some of the matters referred to, for instance, in the Income Tax Act of 1967, are not just capital allowances.  Some of them are non-capital allowances.  This is why I raise the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they refer also to such things as allowances in respect of scientific research, some of which would be capital and some of which would be non-capital.  It is reasonably clear in the new section 33 which the Minister proposes to introduce, though we shall have some questions to ask on that; in that case it refers to capital allowances and defines them, but this section does not refer to capital allowances or define them.  Therefore, if it refers to allowances under Parts XIII to XVIII of the Income Tax Act, 1967, it must include both capital and non-capital allowances, because both are dealt with in that Act.</P>

      <P>Yes.  These are minor drafting amendments.  A transferee company referred to in paragraph 3 of the Third Schedule cannot be carrying on a trade as defined if it is to qualify for relief pursuant to that paragraph.  It would, however, have to be regarded as carrying on such a trade if the words in the definition of &ldquo;company&rdquo; mentioned in the first amendment were retained.  The purpose of the first amendment is to delete the words in question so as to preserve the transferee company's entitlement to relief by virtue of paragraph 3.  The restriction of stock relief to companies carrying on a trade, as defined, in the State will be maintained <Col N="114" /> by the insertion in the definition of &ldquo;trade&rdquo; of words to the same effect as the words being deleted from the definition of &ldquo;company&rdquo;.  This insertion is achieved by means of the second amendment.</P>
      <P>The third amendment removes unnecessary words in subsection (4) (a) which refer to the computation of a deduction under section 31 on the basis of reducing a company's closing stock value.</P>

      <P>The fourth amendment makes a change in the proviso to subsection (4) (a), consequential on the third amendment, by substituting for the existing subparagraph (ii) of the proviso a new subparagraph which has the effect of deleting references to closing stock value and a reduction in closing stock value.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section and the Third Schedule is to grant the tax deferment in respect of increases in the value of trading stock and work in progress announced in this year's budget statement.  In general, the deferment will be in respect of corporation profits tax on profits of accounting periods ending in the tax years 1973-74 and 1974-75 and in respect of income tax for the years of assessment 1974-75 and 1975-76, which would be based normally on the profits of the accounting periods mentioned. Broadly speaking, the relief will take the form of a deduction calculated on the amount of the increase in the value of trading stock, including work in progress, in an accounting period, less 20 per cent of trading profits for the period before deduction of capital allowances or losses.  The relief will apply to Irish resident companies engaged wholly or mainly in manufacturing, <Col N="116" /> construction or farming or in the sale of machinery and plant, excluding passenger vehicles or goods to persons, companies or individuals, for use by those persons for the purposes of trading activities falling wholly or mainly within these sectors.</P>

Can the Minister indicate where in the section there is provision for deferment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not provided for explicitly nor is it necessary to so provide.  Our intention is to have a look at the situation next year in order to see what might be the appropriate tax charged but as of now it provides simply that the tax payable in this year will be calculated subject to these deductions being made from what would otherwise be the liability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are providing this relief because of the possibility that a number of firms are experiencing this difficulty now but a firm would not have to prove their being in that difficult situation in order to be entitled to this relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In many businesses during the past 18 months there has been an inflation in the value of stocks.  That situation would affect profit and would attract tax.  I give the Minister full credit for the proposal here being a measure to give relief in such a situation but I am concerned with the word &ldquo;deferment&rdquo;. I take it that this deferment applies in the current year without strings and without reasons being given?</P>

      <P>Therefore, am I being over-suspicious when I express concern that the Minister's continual use of the word &ldquo;deferment&rdquo; in this connection may mean simply that not only may the situation be brought back, say, next year or the year after, to what it was before this Bill but that the Minister may seek to recover at that time what he is foregoing at present on the grounds that he has given sufficient relief already.

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No, a large number of businesses.  I do not want to take away from what the Minister is doing. He is trying to help and I do not want to belittle that.  Under this Bill these companies will automatically get this substantial relief.  I have no quarrel with the Minister.  But there could be a new Bill this year altering things forwards or backwards.  If the Minister or his successor decided that stability had been attained regarding stock values and that a return to the earlier situation, where you had a simple valuation of stock coming into the element of profit, is desirable, all the Minister would have to do is repeal these provisions. That could be fair and equitable in a situation of stability. Saving the points Deputy Colley wishes to make&mdash;I am trying to make the argument simple&mdash;so far so good.  I think the Minister would find people reasonable in that view but I am <Col N="118" /> worried that this continued use of &ldquo;deferment&rdquo; implies a firm intention by the Minister to recoup the relief granted in what appears to be a simple provision.</P>
      <P>If that is the Minister's intention, I want to have it absolutely clear.  Is the Minister giving a relief in the present year and for such time as those conditions hold and is that relief absolute? Or, is the Minister only deferring collecting the money we are foregoing for an unspecified period and is it on the cards that even next year the Minister may say: &ldquo;We let you off that tax for a year.  We will not ask you to pay 18 per cent on it; we will take it as it is.&rdquo;  I do not know if it is one or two years&mdash;I think it is two years.  It can be an indefinite period in another sense. At the end of the two years does the Minister intend to collect that money? If he does, would it not be desirable to say so explicitly in the Bill because under our law what the Minister says carries no commitment and is not part of the law?  That leaves business with some uncertainty.  I am referring solely to the Minister's use of the word &ldquo;deferment&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>The Deputy asks me whether I think it is on the cards that any Minister for Finance would seek in some future year to collect two years' tax deferred in addition to the then current taxation.  I will answer in a straightforward way: I do not think it is on the cards.  Unless there is some extraordinary boom in the economy and some fantastic profits being made I could not visualise circumstances in which one could impose that burden.

      <P>I think it is unlikely. We are operating in a very indefinite field, indefinite not merely in regard <Col N="119" /> to what may happen in connection with profitability in a couple of years' time but also we are dealing with a situation in which the accountancy profession themselves have not made up their minds about the proper way of treating stock, particularly in an inflationary situation.  One hopes and one must do one's best to ensure that in the next few years the rate of inflation falls.  It is falling elsewhere and it will fall here too, please God, and there will be a totally different approach on the part of many people who this year sought this particular concession.  They might want the whole arrangement to be treated in a different way within a year or two.  I would not attach too much importance to the use of the word &ldquo;defer&rdquo;. I use that word simply because I want to make it clear that we want to take another look at this situation in the light of experience as to how this works and see the ability of business to pay a fair share of tax in a couple of years' time.  But I cannot see it being on the cards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still a little concerned about this.  The explanatory memorandum issued with the Bill contains the word &ldquo;deferment&rdquo;.  It says:</P>
      <P>Section 31 provides for deferment of the payment of income tax and corporation profits tax....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> On the second stage I referred to deferment and said I could not find anything in the section which indicated deferment.  Yet the Minister, speaking on the section tonight again used the word &ldquo;deferment&rdquo;.  I am concerned about this for two reasons. First, as indicated by Deputy de Valera&mdash;quite rightly, I believe&mdash;it is important that there should be a degree of certainty about what is being done.  It is one thing to say that it may be necessary in due course to take other steps because of the effect of inflation on accounting, but at least in relation to what is being done in this section and the effect of it there should be a degree of certainty.  The Minister has indicated&mdash;correctly, I believe&mdash;that in practical terms for the Revenue Commissioners to take back this money after two years is not really on.  Still, I think it should be made quite clear that there is no intention of doing that particularly as it does not seem to be possible. From the point of view of certainty for the businesses that will benefit under this section I think the word &ldquo;deferment&rdquo; should not be used.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why I am concerned with it.  The Minister will note that the section refers to deductions under this section which may be made.  The Minister knows the income tax Acts are full of sections referring to deductions being made in certain circumstances.  If it is the view of the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners that where a section provides for a deduction it is possible to interpret that as meaning a deferment&mdash; where it can be interpreted as meaning it can be deducted this year or next year but where we are entitled on that construction to say it was only temporary&mdash;that kind of interpretation of the word &ldquo;deduction&rdquo; would be totally foreign to its meaning in the context of the income tax Acts.  It would introduce a totally new concept that would be undesirable and would lead to great uncertainty not alone in relation to this section but to the whole income tax code.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am somewhat mystified as to why the explanatory memorandum and the Minister have used the <Col N="121" /> word &ldquo;deferment&rdquo;.  It does not seem appropriate either to the wording of the section or the Minister's intention as indicated here.  Will the Minister tell us now that the word &ldquo;deferment&rdquo; in the context of this section is a misnomer, that deferment does not arise in relation to this section, that deductions are provided for two years and that that is the end of the matter?  Will the Minister tell us that is the position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. The word &ldquo;deferment&rdquo; will not be quotable in a court of law.  The reason I have put it in is that there is such argument going on in the business world, and in the accountancy profession in particular, as to the proper way to approach the question of valuing stock and at this stage it would be wrong to prejudice whatever thinking there might be.  It is better to have a full assessment of the best way to assess what are real profits rather than for us to write in something into a Bill that would colour people's thinking on the matter.  The Deputy is right in what he has said.  There is a deduction for two years and it would be a brave man who would seek to have it recovered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>What the Minister is saying is a matter of considerable interest to business people.  The Minister has said this is for two years and that is the end of it, that the word &ldquo;deferment&rdquo; does not imply that the relief given will be taken back after two years.  That is the net point of the Minister's reply.  This matter is of particular interest to business people and to companies who are affected by this provision and it is important that they have the assurance.  It is important that they realise there is no ulterior intention as the Minister has pointed out and, of course, we accept that.</P>

      <P>There are many concerns engaged in the wholesale and retail trade who are not seriously affected.  It depends on the kind of goods they are selling.  If a person has a rapid turnover and can get total compensation for a price increase in a short period, it is difficult to make a case for giving him this concession.  In relation to the specific question put by the Deputy, I cannot recall any particular case being brought to my notice.  However, if any specific case is brought to my notice, where a special problem arises because of the nature of the business and because of current difficulties, I will be prepared to look at it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It will serve little purpose if the concession is given at the manufacturing end and not at the distributive end.  I can see the point raised by Deputy Brugha.  There are cases where it could apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Brugha and Deputy Fitzpatrick is the major one arising on this section. The relief proposed to be given is valuable in that it goes a step along the road in meeting the very acute problems of many businesses at the moment.  In fact, the problems are so acute that many companies are very close to being forced to close down and, consequently, any relief in such cases is welcome.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that on an earlier amendment we tabled we sought the waiver of corporation profits tax and he relied rather heavily on this section to resist our amendment. We pointed out at that time that there are many businesses, particularly on the wholesale level, who will not get relief under this section and who are in an acute situation because of liquidity problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister received representations in regard to this matter from the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies in Ireland.  They consist of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the Association of Certified Accountants and the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants.  I have a copy of the representations made to the Minister and, with the permission of the Chair, I should like to quote from that communication. It makes a great deal of sense and it is from people who are more familiar with the business situation in Ireland than anybody else, probably including the Revenue Commissioners. With regard to this section, they state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The liquidity problems caused by inflation are as great in the case of many companies carrying on trades outside the scope of section 31 of the Bill as they are for companies for whom relief is proposed. The liquidity problems at the wholesale and retail levels are reflected in sluggish demand for manufactured goods.  In order to maintain the full flow from the manufacturing stage to the consumption stage, it is essential that wholesalers and retailers should have sufficient financial resources to maintain an adequate supply of stock.  The <Col N="124" /> committee is aware that many wholesaling and retailing costings are reducing the physical quantities of stocks held because of liquidity considerations.  This places increasing burdens on the manufacturing sector&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is the point that was being made earlier: if you affect one sector in the chain you will affect all of them. To some extent the section recognises that&mdash;that you cannot just assist manufacturers and leave it at that: even though you assist them they may suffer if the rest of the chain is suffering.  The representations then went on:</P>
    <P>The committee submits that there are very strong grounds for extending the relief to all companies with the object of maintaining stimulated demand on the manufacturing section.  The committee considers that the relief should be extended on the lines suggested above on the grounds of the equity of the tax system, apart from the demand situation.  Profits calculated for tax purposes on the basis of historical costs tend to be substantially over-stated in times of rapidly rising prices.  If stock relief on the lines proposed in the Bill were extended to all trades it would in many cases only go part of the way towards releasing taxable profits to a realistic level.  In present circumstances to select certain types of trading organisations for the relief and exclude them does not in the committee's view reflect differences in the effects of inflation on the calculation of taxes. </P>
    <P>I suggest there is a great deal of sense in what is stated there.  From the demand point of view it is demonstrable that a number of firms are just as much in need of this relief as those who will get it.  I do not think the Minister will quarrel with that statement; I will be surprised if he does.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of equity as represented in these representations, there is a case for saying that the problems arising from inflation in regard to the production of unreal and artificial levels of profits apply across the <Col N="125" /> board and if one is trying to deal with that one should apply the relief across the board.  That is a logical case which I would urge on the Minister, the case for stimulating the economy and the maintenance of employment.  With unemployment as it is, what is needed is to give what stimulation we can and not to leave any stone unturned in that direction.  We are leaving many stones unturned if we accept this section as drafted.  As I have said, it is quite clearly demonstrable that there are firms who would not come within the terms of this section who, (a), need the relief as much as those who will get it; and (b), if the relief is of any use at all and they get it, it will have an effect on employment and the stimulation of the economy.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can contest either of these basic propositions, and if that is so he should consider very seriously the representations made to him and the arguments we are making from this side.  The Minister may say with some justice that there are certain businesses who will not suffer from this problem or if there are they are in such a comfortable position that they do not need assistance.  I would say two things in regard to that.  The first is that he could try to devise a method of giving the relief which would exclude such companies.  But if he finds it totally impossible to do that, then I would say to him that the cost of giving relief to people who do not need it would be far outweighed by the benefits in terms of employment and of general stimulation of the economy by giving it across the board if that is the only way open to him, which I do not accept.  If it is, I believe the cost of doing it&mdash;by &ldquo;cost&rdquo; I do not mean merely in terms of money to the Exchequer but the general cost involved of giving relief that is not required&mdash;is justified.  The problem is too acute.  It is not one that we can pass over by saying: &ldquo;We cannot allow any of this relief because so-and-so who does not need the relief will get it.&rdquo;  The problem is much bigger than that.  It goes to the root of our whole economic situation today. Even if this relief is given right across the board it will not solve our economic problems but it is a step on the road <Col N="126" /> to keeping a number of businesses alive, to survive hopefully until things improve.  It is a step towards maintaining some of the employment that still exists.  We cannot entirely ignore the representations involved in that and if we are to ignore these representations this section must be widened in its scope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I reinforce everything Deputy Colley has said and the principles on which he has enunciated them.  I shall put three different points to the Minister as a particular support. When we are dealing with the first element, I want to clear the ground as to what the relief is.  The first consideration is the ground on which you can discriminate here.  If you are to give this relief to some companies and not to others which have heretofore been all treated under the one heading, some justification is required for that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley mentioned elements of fairness.  I want to invert that and to draw attention to the danger of discrimination. If the ground for leaving out some companies is that they do not need this relief we are going down a road already travelled much too far with the Prices Commission through which the State is intervening to decide who will be the beneficiary in business from the State and who will not.  It is a very short road from deciding who is to be the beneficiary to deciding who is to be treated as &ldquo;the rest&rdquo; and who is to be penalised.  It is a slippery slope that is already there in the Prices Commission's reports.  The tendency to slip in a direction like that is only too clear.</P>
      <P>On a matter of principle, I have not the slightest doubt that the Revenue Commissioners or any other Department dealing with it would act absolutely conscientiously in these matters, but a principle we have always sought to maintain in our law is that the opportunities for discrimination will not be there.  It is one of the glories of our public service that it is absolutely free of any taints, that it has the reputation, deservedly, of integrity. We should not move in a direction in legislation that, so to speak, would give an incline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making this point purely as a <Col N="127" /> point of principle to reinforce Deputy Colley.  As a legislator, I consider that selectivity is dangerous because it can mean either preference or discrimination. I am making no imputations.  This is the danger.  If that element is taken into account, is it not desirable that we do not bring in any fragmentation of the group to which the present provisions apply?  To get down to specifics would cloud the principle I am trying to adumbrate.</P>
    <P>There is another factor which I would like the Minister to take into account.  There is a chain from the primary source to the consumer.  At various points of that chain there will have been an accumulation of stocks at a customary level.  For the purpose of our argument we will assume that that chain is contained within the State.  A state of equilibrium has been attained where the primary manufacturer is turning out his product at a certain rate.  That is taken by the secondary manufacturer at a certain rate.  It is taken by the wholesaler at a certain rate.  It is finally sold by the retailer at a certain rate. In a stable situation that flow will be fairly uniform, giving stability right along the line.  If that is perturbed at the wholesaler's or retailer's level by eating into stocks, the effect will be that the flow from the manufacturing end is retarded. For instance, a retailer or wholesaler carrying large stocks and selling off at a certain rate may suddenly decide, because of a liquidity problem, to liquidate his stocks to keep his bank balance right.  He calls on his reserves like the camel on his hump and he buys nothing for the bank to replace his stocks during that period.  The result is that the secondary manufacturer first and the primary manufacturers behind him will experience a slowing in delivery.  It decreases business at the manufacturing end and this puts jobs in jeopardy because most jobs are normally in the manufacturing area.  Let us take a hypothetical case.  Suppose there is a retail shop carrying clothing.  It will be backed up by wholesalers who are carrying stocks at a certain level.  The consumer demand may remain exactly <Col N="128" /> the same but if the retailer starts calling on his stocks to supply the consumer the manufacturer for the garments, and behind him the manufacturers of the materials that go into the garments, will find that they are not selling and then the people who are making those things will be in danger of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, I am not clear as to who is getting relief here.  My reading of the section and the definition of &ldquo;trade&rdquo; in section 31 does not convey enough certainty to me to say exactly what it covers so what I have said is to be taken as an example.  I would ask the Minister to consider those two points as emphasising two aspects of what Deputy Colley has said.  Would it not be simpler in the long run, administratively and every other way, to do the straightforward thing and apply it if there are exceptions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing would be simpler and nothing would make a Finance Minister more popular than the abolition of taxes but we have at all times to strike a balance between resources, the demands which are made upon resources, and particular difficulties which some sections of the community may have in meeting their existing tax liability.  We made that assessment this year and we considered that the areas which seemed to be most affected were manufacturing industry, the construction industry and certain sectors of agriculture.  We could, of course, do as the Opposition suggest and give general company tax relief but there would then be a situation in which financial institutions, banking institutions, hire purchase companies and the lot would qualify for tax relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now Deputy de Valera says we should confine it to stock reliefs only but that is a limitation in itself.  Is a company with stock any more deserving of assistance than, say, some service activity which might be in difficulties?  We must draw the line somewhere.  I think we were right in identifying the sectors of manufacturing <Col N="129" /> industry, the construction industry and agriculture as deserving of special relief.  We have given that relief.  It is quite significant when you consider that the total corporation profits tax is £28 million a year and £12 million relief per annum has been given for the next two years in this business sector.  That shows that there is a fair measure of relief for the people who are most affected.</P>
      <P>In case anybody feels I was misleading the House I should like to say that, when I was asked by Deputy Brugha if I had received any repretations in relation to the wholesale companies, I thought he was wondering whether I had received any specific complaints about any particular sector of the wholesale industry.  I have not.  I have certainly received the representations to which Deputy Colley referred.  There is one thing to be said in favour of the accountancy profession, that is, that they are very skilled indeed in making a case.  A Minister for Finance must not look merely at the general theoretical case which any professional group can be past masters at presenting.  The Minister for Finance oftentimes is not in possession of specific information because profitability, income, tax liability of individuals and companies are confidential and known only to the Revenue Commissioners.  There are cases where people can identify their pains and their aches to the Minister for Finance and then he may look at them.  Looking at the whole economy and those areas which seem to me to be most in need of help, we have given them that help.  The help we have given can only be given in the way in which we have given it. We have given it to the manufacturing industry, to agriculture and to the construction industry, or to suppliers to those industries.</P>

      <P>Suppliers to them but not the other companies.  I accept that there is considerable merit in what has been argued about other companies.  We are not saying that we have excluded all areas of difficulty. We are sure we have not, but we have given a very wide measure of relief.  I do not think we would be justified in extending it more liberally because to do so would, quite frankly, reduce the resources which the Exchequer would then have.  In reality, what some firms need this year is not a tax relief, because they may not have made profits either last year or the year before.  If you have not got a tax liaibility, tax relief is of no use to you.  A cash injection from the State or from some other source is what is needed specifically</P>

It is known that inflation is affecting the public sector most seriously and that revenue buoyancy no longer exists.  In that situation we have to be very careful, indeed, as we go about giving tax reliefs.  We must relate them to areas of greatest <Col N="131" /> need and not run the risk of giving tax concessions in areas where they may be unnecessary.  I understand Deputy Colley's argument.  He says we should not be looking for perfection and, if a few people get away with a bonanza, so what?</P>

      <P>Yes, if you get the economy moving again.  The sad reality for us in Ireland is that we have a very vulnerable economy affected by the performance of the world economy more than any other individual country in Europe.  We are a small island. We are exposed to all the winds and all the currents which move around us. Even if we were to provide all the benefits and concessions which the Opposition suggest we should, we would not necessarily generate a better market for our goods.  It is the market that matters, the market demands.  The market has shrunk and, therefore, the possibility of sales has shrunk.  We cannot get away from these unpleasant forces.  We may endeavour to persuade others who are more powerful than we are to reflate.  Something of that kind is already occurring.  The precise timing and extent of the beneficial consequences are very difficult to determine. In the meantime, we are providing quite significant reliefs for the sectors most affected by this slump, which, I think, is now at the bottom of the trough.  Anything and everything which we in Government can do by way of tax reliefs, or indeed by way of financial assistance, to help companies to overcome this temporary difficulty we will do, but we will have to trim any aids we give according to needs.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he hoped we were at the bottom of the trough.  Is that not the very time when it would be better to keep the flow from the factories going and not encourage retailers and wholesalers to liquidate stocks and slow down the flow?  I take it the Minister will accept the argument that, if the same incentive is not given to the retailers and <Col N="132" /> the wholesalers to maintain their stocks, these stocks will be eaten into. I do not know how important that factor is, but it seems to be a factor to be taken into account.  Surely by taking that attitude the Minister is defeating his own purpose to some extent.</P>

      <P>Nothing will generate more activity in the distributive trade better than demand.  If demand improves you may be certain that retailers and wholesalers will very rapidly build up their stocks again. At the moment, because of a drop in consumer demand, they tend to be well stocked and if demand improves this situation will change rapidly.  In the distributive trade there is a very rapid response to trends.  I do not think that by some sophisticated tax relief we could generate as much activity as any improvement in demand would generate.  Once there is an improvement in demand we can be quite certain that the stocks will be rolling again.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the areas to which this is being restricted but, if the commissioners find what would describe as hard cases, where employment is likely to be affected the application of this section might possibly be considered.  As the Minister rightly says, there is no point in talking about companies which are not making a profit because they could not benefit under this anyway.  A rapid increase in the cost of stocks to whole salers and retailers may be affecting some categories which may be worth preserving if only for the sake of the continuity of employment rather than that those employees should be drawing pay-related benefit or unemployment relief.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Inflation is influencing the situation and, as we all know, inflation is running at a very high level. In many companies profits are derived from inflation.  These are what I would describe as false profits and to meet this situation some more sophisticated type of accountancy will have to be adopted.  Whether that will be acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners I do not know.  By and large, this is not really a trading at all.  However, this will be another day's work.</P>
      <P>The Minister should seriously consider applying this to wholesalers.  I would not go along with the suggestion that it should be applied right across the board to all manufacturers and wholesalers.  The section is designed to meet a certain type of situation and look after a certain section of industry which is struggling to keep going.  We must, of course, come to the help of those caught up in such a situation.  The concession should not, however, be given to companies that are making a profit, have a good cash flow and no problems with regard to the sale of their products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are wholesalers who carry astronomical stocks in which there is no quick turnover.  They carry a considerable variety and there may be a turnover only once in 12 months. That is the type of wholesaler I have in mind.  If he is not helped, he will reduce his variety and that may not be to the benefit of the trade.  I know <Col N="134" /> what the Minister is trying to avoid but I fear the section will not have the effect he seeks unless he gives the benefit at the wholesale level.  If it were possible that the manufacturing sector would pass on some of the benefit from the point of view of credit to the wholesale sector, that would be all right but I do not believe manufacturers will extend their credit to any great extent and the only option open to the wholesaler then will be to reduce his stocks.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that aspect.  This provision will serve no useful purpose unless it also covers the wholesaler.</P>

      <P>This needs to be pursued a little further.  The Minister spoke earlier about our general economic situation.  I would not quarrel with a good deal of what he said but I suggest this section is largely irrelevant because, although it recognises there is a problem and attempts to do something about it, the real question is will the section give some relief to those sectors of the economy which need it.  The Minister has made the point that blanket relief would give relief to those who do not need it. That is a valid point but is that not precisely what he is doing in a small sector of the economy?  On the definition of trade, for instance, we find it will apply to the manufacturer of goods.  There is no restriction.  The manufacturer of goods will get this relief.  There may not be many manufacturers of goods who do not need relief, but there are some.  Then there is the carrying out of construction operations within the meaning of section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970; one can assume that the great majority here need assistance, but there may be some who do not need it Whether they need it or not they will get it under this section.  Again, in regard to farming, the great majority need assistance, but there may be some who do not; they will all get it under this section.  The Minister has <Col N="135" /> actually been forced into the situation he was decrying in relation to what we put forward.  The Minister has been forced to adopt a relatively blunt instrument.  I do not fault him for that because I can see the difficulties with which he is faced but, since he himself was forced into that position, the validity of the criticism he made of this side of the House that relief may be given to those who do not need it is considerably reduced.</P>
      <P>I mentioned earlier that there were sectors of the economy in as great need of relief as those being relieved by this section, sectors which are not covered in the section, and I suggested the Minister would not controvert that statement.  He did not controvert it because he knows just as well as I do that there are sectors that could come into this category.  One is the wholesale sector referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Some in that sector will be covered but some will not.  A great many of them will not.  A great many wholesaling firms are in the gravest difficulty because of shortage of cash, shortage of cash contributed to by a number of factors&mdash;in particular, by the rapid increase in the price of the goods they stock, by the necessity in some cases, because of prospective shortages, of carrying much larger stocks than usual, by the falling demand for their stocks which means that the holding of larger stocks is aggravated still further by the fall in demand, and the very high price of money which they needed to finance these stocks, plus the fact that they are obliged to pay value-added tax every two months while they have to extend credit to their customers for three, four and more months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of these and other factors are combining to leave a number of wholesalers in a most precarious position with the consequent danger to their employees and the consequent reduction in their demands from manufacturers.  All manufacturers are being given relief under this section. We tried to make the point earlier that there is not much value in giving relief to one link in the chain <Col N="136" /> if by reason of failing to give it to another link the link not getting the relief collapses, and the link which you are purporting to give relief to, if it does not collapse, will get no benefit from the relief.  That should be self-evident and is a very strong argument for urging the Minister to extend the scope of this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, for instance in response to what Deputy Fitzpatrick said, that a sharp eye will be kept on the situation.  I want to put two points to him in regard to that.  First, as I see it, the section does not give any power to extend the categories who would benefit from it by order.  Therefore, if he decided, having kept a sharp eye on the situation, that there were other categories which should get relief it would be necessary to introduce legislation to give that benefit. That does not inspire too much confidence in the keeping of a sharp eye on the situation and moving quickly to give relief where it seems to be needed.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of this is that, having presumably looked at the situation with a sharp eye, the Minister has come up with this section.  However, it is clear to anybody who looks at the situation, even without a very sharp eye, that there are sectors, which are not included in this relief.  For those reasons I believe it is necessary to go a little further and for the Minister to show a more genuine readiness to extend the scope of the relief, where it can be clearly demonstrated that the need is at least as great as it is in the case where relief is being given.  I do not think the Minister is giving himself power under this section to do that where it is demonstrated.  He ought to consider very seriously taking that power under this section.</P>
    <P>I believe it may well be that by limiting the scope of the relief under this section, in the way it is being limited, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, the benefit expected to accrue, not just the individual firms concerned but our whole economy, may be either lost or substantially lost because the line is not extended along the chain <Col N="137" /> in order to be really effective.  Here we are talking about, to a great extent, the maintenance of employment and keeping in being firms which might otherwise go out of business.  If the Minister is correct in his assessment that we are at the bottom of a trough, then as Deputy de Valera said, it is true that this is the time to give the relief if only to keep those firms in being until the situation improves.</P>
    <P>Very often, if such firms go out of business, not alone do you have the consequent unemployment but they are not replaced that easily and a good deal of expertise and knowledge goes out of circulation altogether.  If we are to benefit, if there is an up-swing in the economy in the future, we cannot afford to allow such firms to go out of business because we are prepared to give relief to one sector and not to another.  I believe if it can be demonstrated that the need in some sector of the economy is the same as it is in those sectors covered by this section then the relief should be given and the Minister should have power to give it.  I believe the case for different sectors can be made and vincingly.  They are not covered by this section and they should be covered by it if we are really serious in what we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>I very strongly urge the Minister to reconsider this situation.  If he cannot extend the scope of this section on its face&mdash;I can see some difficulties in definition and so on&mdash;he should at least take power to apply this relief to other sectors where the kind of criteria that he applies in arriving at those sectors mentioned in the section apply.  There is no case, either in economics or in equity for refusing to extend that relief to sectors which need it as much as those which are getting it under the section but are not included.  I strongly urge the Minister, if he cannot extend the scope of the section, at least to amend it by taking that necessary power to give the relief where it is needed and where it is demonstrated it is needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be appropriate at all to give a <Col N="138" /> Minister for Finance permissive power to absolve people from tax liability. If the case can arise where a tax concession is warranted then I believe that should be specifically identified in legislation and put beyond the whim of a Minister.  Tax, I suppose, is one of the most serious things which Parliament is called on to deal with and I believe the responsibility should lie with Parliament and not with anybody else.  We have identified, and I think the House recognises this, the most sensitive areas deserving relief. I have said if any other particular sector appears to merit the same attention, that I would be disposed to consider giving that relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I believe that is the correct way to do it so that the House might have an opportunity of saying whether or not they considered this absolution from tax liability was merited.  It is just as involved to give the Minister power to impose tax as it is to give him power to waive it.  The Revenue Commissioners are the people who have the obligation, under the law, of collecting tax.  They are given that power and they are an independent body because of the desirability of keeping the working of the tax machine away from the discretion of a Minister.</P>
      <P>This is an area in which I think discretion should not operate.  Something would want to be justified and I think at the present time, having regard to the constraints which I mentioned earlier, I would not be warranted in seeking any further extension of this particular relief, which is very generous and has been acknowledged by the business community, by and large, as being generous and helpful in the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with the general proposition put forward by the Minister and he will not I expressed a preference for expressing on the face of the section the sectors of the economy to benefit and if that could not be done that the next best course was to take the power to extend <Col N="139" /> it.  That power, as far as I am concerned, can be vested in the Revenue Commissioners.  Ideally, the criteria involved should be laid down.</P>
      <P>While it is impressive to hear the Minister put forward the argument he did, the fact is in another Bill, which he has before the House, there is written into it the power for the Revenue Commissioners to waive all of the tax arising under that Bill in particular circumstances without any criteria being laid down.  Therefore, there is a certain lack of consistency in the Minister's approach.  We are really concerned with finding a way to give this relief to sectors which need it, and some sectors need it at present, and to ensure that the jobs involved are saved.</P>
      <P>It is not beyond the wit of the Minister and his advisers to find a way to do this.  This section does not do it for all the sectors which need it.  There are a few ways of doing this but to pass this section as it stands in practice means that no other sector of the economy no matter what its need will get this benefit.  The Minister knows that to go through with such legislation in practical terms means we are writing off their chances of getting any such relief unless it is provided for in this section.  That may not be the theoretical position but it is the practical position. I urge the Minister&mdash;I am not asking him to do it now&mdash;to give serious consideration to my argument.  I ask him to consider in the passage of this Bill between here and the Seanad making some amendment in this section to meet my argument.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to subsection (4) (a) (i) of the proviso which states:</P>
      <P>In no case shall the amount of the deduction as so computed exceed the amount of the company's trading profits for that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to the fact that this relief was of no use to companies which were not making a profit.  This proviso states that if a company is making an extremely small profit the relief they will get will be limited to the amount of that profit. <Col N="140" /> I question the principle involved in this. I put it to the Minister that if a company is in need of this relief and would get it but for the fact that it has a minimal profit for that company to be able to say they know they will get this relief and can see their way ahead for the next two years whereby they can build up their profit enough to make the proposition viable should be sufficient.  If that company could say they could carry forward the reliefs, it could make all the difference between making a profit in two years time worth their while to continuing as against the decision to close down now.  I suggest to the Minister that to be able to carry forward the relief could be of considerable help to companies to whom he is trying to extend some relief under this section.  In some circumstances it could make all the difference between the decision to continue in business or to close down.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that in two years time hopefully the economic climate would be such that this relief would not be necessary but we should not forget that companies have to make decisions now in relation to what will happen in two or three years' time.  If companies knew this could be carried forward the decisions they will make now in relation to the future could be vitally important.  To say the companies cannot get the benefit unless they are making adequate profits at present may be the wrong approach to the question of giving relief to companies in difficulty.  It seems to be contradictory to say they will be given that relief now provided the profits are big enough to benefit from it.</P>

We are not proposing at this stage to deal with the situation when, if all the forecasts are right, a significant growth of the world economy and our economy will take place in two years' time.  If at that stage special consideration is required, I am sure the Government will give that special consideration to the problem.  We are now dealing with the current situation and providing relief for present problems and not for what may happen in two years' time.  I would not consider that many businessmen today would be making a decision as to whether they would continue in business on the basis of a tax arrangement which might operate to their benefit in two years' time.  It will only operate to their benefit in two years' time if they were making profit.  If they were not making profit by then the carry forward of this unused concession would be of no value to them. If they were to be making profit in two years' time, and very few will not be doing it, then the concession suggested by the Deputy would not be justified.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to insert the following section before section 33 :</P>
      <P>&ldquo;33.&mdash;(1) In the Income Tax Acts, save where the context otherwise requires, `capital allowance' means any allowance (other than an allowance or deduction to be made in computing profits or gains) under&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  Parts XIII to XVIII of the Income Tax Act, 1967,</P>
      <P>(b)  section 22 of the Finance Act, 1971,</P>
      <P>(c)  the Finance (Taxation of Profits of Certain Mines) Act, 1974, or</P>
      <P>(d)  section 22 of the Finance Act, 1974,</P>
      <P>and `capital allowances' shall be construed accordingly. </P>
      <P>(2)  Part II of the First Schedule shall have effect for the purpose of supplementing this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment, to which Financial Resolution No. 7 relates, is to substitute a new section in place of section 33 of the Bill.  Sections 3 and 33 of the Bill are concerned with bringing up to date the definitions of capital allowances in various places in the Income Tax <Col N="144" /> Acts, by including in the definitions references to the new capital allowances introduced in recent years.</P>
    <P>The new section to be inserted by the amendment will provide a single, updated definition of capital allowance which will then apply throughout the Income Tax Acts.  The existing definitions in different parts of the Acts will be deleted by the new Part II to be inserted in the First Schedule by a later amendment.  In most cases the extension of the list of capital allowances gives relief, but in two instances the extension could result in the cutting down of relief. For this reason a Financial Resolution is necessary.  The two instances where the extension of the list might result in the cutting down of relief are as follows: section 236 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, where capital allowances are to be deducted in computing nett relevant earnings for purposes of determining the maximum allowable premium in the case of premiums paid by self-employed persons under contracts to secure retirement annuities in old age; section 218 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That section is in Part XI of the 1967 Act which deals with the taxation of co-operative societies and provides for the apportionment of capital allowances in such cases by reference to chargeable and exempted profits. Only the amount apportioned to the chargeable profits may be set against those profits.  Extension of the list of capital allowances is contained in section 218 so as to include the new capital allowances and involves apportionment of these allowances.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that what he has just told us is somewhat complex.  I think we had better take it bit by bit.  First of all, I might take the first item he mentioned as being a reduction of relief.  He referred to a change in regard to the assessment of allowances for the purpose of qualifying insurance premiums.  There are two questions I want to ask the Minister with regard to that.  First, could he explain precisely what change is proposed. Secondly&mdash;this is the question I raised in regard to the amendment to delete section 3 and I asked why certain existing reliefs in regard to qualifying insurance premiums were being taken away&mdash;I understood the Minister, at that time, to say they were not being taken away.  But he is now telling us that they are, which is what I thought at the time.  I should like to know precisely what is the change involved in relation to qualifying insurance premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 236 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, relates to the relief which is given in respect of premiums paid by self-employed persons under contracts to secure retirement annuities in old age.  The amount of premium qualifying for relief is limited to 15 per cent of the taxpayer's net relevant earnings after the capital allowances listed in section 236, subsection (3), have been deducted. The allowances are those in respect of capital expenditure on plant and machinery, industrial buildings, scientific research, mining development allowances and so on.  Does that help the Deputy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we may be at cross purposes at present.  Section 236 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, specifies the nature and amount of relief for qualifying premiums.  I understood the Minister to say that one of the effects of amendment No. 16 is to reduce the reliefs provided under section 236 of the 1967 Act.  I am not clear what way the relief is reduced and why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are adding the following allowances : the 20 per cent investment allowance for plant and machinery provided for use in the designated areas, section 22 of the Finance Act, 1971, the capital allowance provided for persons mining scheduled minerals, the Finance (Taxation of Profits of Certain Mines) Act, 1974 and allowance in respect of farm buildings and other works, section 22 of the Finance Act, 1974.  It is most unlikely that any person would be affected by the Finance (Taxation of Profits of Certain Mines) Act, but if the capital allowances are put into one comprehensive section, we must include all capital allowances, including those that might not be used because the terms of the new provision affect only individuals.  The people involved tend to be self-employed and would be unlikely to be affected by capital expenditure on mining minerals.  Prior to 1974-75 the limit on qualifying premiums was only 10 per cent of net relevant earnings or £750, whichever was the lesser.  Since last year's Finance Act the limit is 15 per cent or £1,500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Previously the law provided for the deduction of capital allowances before arriving at the net relevant earnings.  We are now adding the number of deductions which may be made before the calculation of the net relevant earnings.  Accordingly, the net figure may be altered if the deductions arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the impact of the capital allowances under the Finance (Taxation of Profits of Certain Mines) Act, 1974, is not likely to be great.  For example, if we take section 22 of the Finance Act, 1974, which deals with capital allowances in the case of farmers liable to income tax, could not the effect of including that in the capital allowances general definition, and thereby reducing the net relevant earnings for the purpose of calculating qualifying premiums, be of some considerable significance in certain cases?  If so, why should this position arise?  Why should such a person's position be disimproved, a person who, almost by definition, is self-employed and trying to make provision for his retirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not making any change in principle here.  Various capital allowances were always deductible. <Col N="148" /> There are additional capital allowances now.  Obviously, the logical thing to do is to make the additional capital allowances also deductible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the logic of that.  The Minister said he was restricting the position relating to co-operative societies.  Could he indicate the nature of the change being made and the reasons for that change?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing law provides for the apportionment of capital allowances in such cases by reference to chargeable profits and exempt profits.  Once again the capital allowances come into play in making these calculations.  If we change the list of capital allowances, obviously the net sums change also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it then that the reason why this new section refers to the Income Tax Acts in general is that it is desired to give a completely new definition to the term &ldquo;capital allowances&rdquo; which will be applied right across the board in all Income Tax Acts?</P>

      <P>Paragraph (a) refers to Parts XIII to XVIII of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  In section 236 (3) of the 1967 Act which deals with the qualifying insurance premiums, there is reference to various Parts but the latest one is Part XVI.  Why are Parts XVII and XVIII of the Income Tax Act, 1967, being brought in now when they were not brought in in the reference in section 236 of the 1967 Act?</P>

      <P>The new list of capital allowances will include those in Parts XVII and XVIII&mdash;relief for expenditure and training of local staff before commencement of training and special allowances for buildings, plant and machinery used in the production of certain commodities not produced commercially in the State.  I am <Col N="149" /> advised that while they are probably not applicable, it was deemed advisable to have a comprehensive list and not to exclude any allowance&mdash;and as we are adding on the allowances that were introduced in 1971 and in 1974, it is deemed appropriate to include these as well.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate why the 1971 and 1974 allowances have to be added in, but it is not so clear to me why the allowances which were not brought in in the 1967 Act, which, as the Minister knows, is the whole basic law in income tax, are included. In that Act the tax allowances in Parts XVII and XVIII were not brought in, and apparently it was not thought necessary.  I have wondered why it is necessary to bring them in now and whether any consequence could flow from this that might be undesirable, if in fact the only reason for bringing them in is to make it look tidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are purporting to deal comprehensively with allowances&mdash;and that is our intention&mdash;we consider that any capital allowances which exist should be included in this Act.  It would seem odd to leave some of them out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is reasonable to assume that there was some reason for leaving them out in the 1967 Act which was the basic, Principal Act, and still is, on income tax.  However, they were left out of the assessment under section 236.  The Minister is now proposing to put them in, and I would suggest that is not the purpose of the section at all; it is an incidental effect of the section.  What is worrying me is that this and other incidental effects have not been adverted to and that we may be doing something here without realising the consequences.  Can the Minister assure me that all of these possibilities, like what is happening under section 236, were considered and it was decided that the consequences were either acceptable or desirable?  I doubt if the Minister can give me that assurance.</P>

      <P>I can give the Deputy some further information, that is, that such defects or lack of comprehensiveness as exists in the 1967 Act finds its origin in the 1958 Act, which is the Act that section 236 is codifying.  Unless a very good reason can be produced for excluding a particular capital allowance, I think all capital allowances should be brought into a section which is declared to be a comprehensive one; otherwise we are not producing a comprehensive statement of the capital allowances.</P>

      <P>Doing it hopefully without being absolutely certain of the consequences of what he is doing, I would suggest.  I would ask a further question of the Minister.  In subsection (1) for the proposed new section there is a reference to an allowance or adjustment to be made in computing the profits or gains.  In that context is &ldquo;computing&rdquo; the equivalent of &ldquo;charging&rdquo;, that is, could it equally be: &ldquo;other than an allowance or deduction to be made in charging profits or gains.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too clear what is worrying the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I would refer the Minister to the Income Tax Act of 1967.  Section 244 (3) deals with capital expenditure on scientific research and goes on to provide:</P>
      <P>...subject to the provisions of this section, there shall be allowed as a deduction in charging the profits or gains of the trade for the year of assessment...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's amendment a capital allowance means any allowance <Col N="152" /> other than an allowance or deduction to be made in computing profits or gains.  If that is the equivalent of &ldquo;in charging profits or gains&rdquo; it would seem to exclude that allowance referred to in subsection (3) of section 244 of the 1967 Act.  What I am trying to find out is whether that kind of allowance&mdash;there are others but take that one as an example&mdash;that is dealt with in subsection (3) of section 244, the scientific research allowance&mdash;is to be deemed to be a capital allowance or is it to be deemed to be excluded by reason of the phrase &ldquo;other than an allowance or a reduction to be made in computing profits or gains&rdquo;?  Does the Minister follow my point?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so, and if not I am sure the Deputy will tell me.  If you take an allowance or a deduction into account in computing profits or gains, you take that allowance or deduction into account before measuring profits or gains.  If, on the other hand, you have arrived at your profits or gains and then allow it in making a charge against the profits or gains, that is after the event.  In one case you are computing, as it were, before you calculate the profits, in the other case, you charge it against the profits which have already been calculated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to insert a new section before section 34 as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;34&mdash;Section 59 (1) of the Finance Act, 1974 is hereby amended by the substitution of <Col N="154" /> `reasonably require' for `think necessary'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the Finance Act, 1974 and it proposes that in subsection (1) of section 59 of that Act the words &ldquo;reasonably require&rdquo; be substituted for the words &ldquo;think necessary&rdquo;.  Subsection (1) to which this relates is short and perhaps I may read it:</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners or such officer as the Revenue Commissioners may appoint may by notice in writing require any person to furnish them within such time as they may direct (not being less than twenty-eight days) with such particulars as they think necessary for the purposes of sections 57, 58 and 60.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes to enable the Revenue Commissioners to serve a notice in writing requiring any person to furnish them within such time as they direct, not being less than 28 days, with such particulars as they reasonably require for the purposes of sections 57, 58 and 60.  The practical effect for many people of the acceptance of this amendment might be nil or almost nil but for other people it could be of extreme importance because the section as drafted enables the Revenue Commissioners or any officer they may appoint to seek such information as they think, or as he thinks, necessary for the purposes of the section I have referred to.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, that would appear to apply no limitation on the particulars which may be sought other than some connection which, in some cases might be very tenuous, with the matters dealt with in sections 57, 58 and 60.  On the other hand, acceptance of the amendment would not inhibit the Revenue Commissioners from obtaining any information that would be required for the purpose of carrying out their work.  There is a significance in the phrase &ldquo;reasonably require&rdquo; as against &ldquo;think necessary&rdquo;: because the information and the particulars sought by the Revenue Commissioners must be such as they reasonably require for the purposes of these other sections there is <Col N="155" /> built in some criteria whereas the section as drafted has no such criteria. This means that in a very unreasonable case where the Revenue Commissioners or an officer appointed by them acted very unreasonably, it would be possible for an aggrieved taxpayer to have a remedy by applying to the court and establishing that the information sought was not reasonably required.  If it were reasonably required the taxpayer, by definition, would be bound to furnish it but unless this amendment was accepted there would appear to be virtually no limitation on the information which may be sought.  That is wrong in principle as well as in practice.  Therefore, the Minister should not have any difficulty in accepting the amendment, an amendment to the same effect as one tabled to the Bill that was before the House last year but which was not reached because of the manner in which portion of the Committee and subsequent Stages of that Bill were dealt with.  The acceptance of this amendment would not inhibit the Revenue Commissioners in any way but would establish some form of protection for a taxpayer against unreasonable demands for taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed at some length in the other House.  I pointed out there that the Revenue Commissioners, like any other arm of the State, must act reasonably at all times and that if they fail to act reasonably they are amenable to the courts.  The mere fact that they can be challenged in the courts is ample protection for the citizen.  In this connection I might refer to a case in England where a person was aggrieved by receiving a notice from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue.  This notice would be similar to one served here under the 1974 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be worthwhile to put on the record of the House what the British court said.  Incidentally, as I pointed out in the Seanad also, I should observe that the legislation in Britain which deals with requiring certain people to make disclosures about the transfer of moneys abroad for tax <Col N="156" /> avoidance purposes was introduced in 1936.  Somebody said that what we were proposing was a fascist move and I pointed out in the Seanad that the persons who introduced this provision in English law had declared war against nazism and fascism and was unlikely to bring in something which was fascist in nature.  It is not fascist; it is simply providing an absolutely necessary weapon to counter tax avoidance by the transfer of assets abroad.  Those who endeavour to avoid tax by transferring assets abroad are not simple people; they will go to any lengths to conceal their activities from the Revenue Commissioners and if they succeed it is not merely the Revenue Commissioners or the Exchequer that is the victim but the general body of taxpayers who because of the avoidance action of the well-to-do are left carrying a larger burden themselves. The State has a clear obligation to counter tax avoidance activities.</P>
    <P>However, the English case is pertinent and I mention the name of the case so that anybody who wishes to pursue the matter further may do so. It is the case of Clinch v. the Inland Revenue Commissioners, 1973, All England Reports, Page 977.  The plaintiff asked the court to rule that a notice served on him was invalid and one of the questions addressed to itself by the court was: Has the plaintiff established that the commissioners have exercised their discretion unreasonably? The Inland Revenue contended that the notice could only be attacked for unreasonableness if the degree of unreasonableness was such that no reasonable person could consider the notice necessary for the purposes of the Act.  The plaintiff contended that the court was entitled to interfere if it could be shown that, viewed objectively, the authority were acting unreasonably, albeit that they were acting within the four corners of the authority conferred on them. In the course of the judgement, the judge said: &ldquo;The particulars are sought of the intermediary&rdquo;&mdash;who was the plaintiff in the case in question&mdash;&ldquo;in order that he may be used as a stepping stone towards obtaining <Col N="157" /> the more detailed information required by the Commissioners to enable them to decide whether or not, in their opinion, tax has been unlawfully evaded.  The information which they require is such as to give them a shrewd idea of the relationship between a taxpayer and a foreign company, partnership, trust or settlement. Accordingly, if the particulars sought went substantially beyond that which was required for this purpose so that they could be properly described as unduly oppressive or burdensome, I have no doubt that a court would be entitled to intervene and declare the notice invalid.  One of the vital functions of the courts is to protect the individual from any abuse of power by the executive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the event, the judge held in favour of the Inland Revenue.  He accepted in principle that a notice could well be inordinately burdensome or oppressive and therefore invalid but that was not the case in the instance involved in that case which would be similar to the kind of instance that could arise if the Revenue Commissioners used the powers given to them under the 1974 Act.  Those powers may only be reasonably used and if a taxpayer, or a person to whom the notice is addressed, is of opinion that they are being unreasonably used, then a right exists to take the matter before the courts to see if the courts would have a different view.  It is, therefore, clear that the Revenue Commissioners in acting under this section and in looking for the information will do so when they think it necessary and if they consider that it is proper that they should investigate a case they may serve the required notice.  I have no reason to anticipate that the Revenue Commissioners will act unreasonably. In fact, the law assumes that the State and its agents will act in a reasonable way in using any powers given to them.  As Deputy Colley knows, it is open to anybody who feels that the bounds of reason have been exceeded to challenge any act which appears to be unreasonable. One does not need to use the words that Deputy Colley suggests in his <Col N="158" /> amendment in order to ensure that reasonableness will at all times prevail so far as the conduct of this State is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Mini-in regard to the case he quoted whether the relevant portion of the English Act was similar to this?  Does it contain the phrase : &ldquo;such particulars as they think necessary&rdquo;? That was the phrase in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I venture to suggest that what the Minister has said in regard to a requirement that the Revenue Commissioners would not act unreasonably in general, is true and the case that he quotes is true of the general position but, with all due respect, that, I think, is not really the point of this amendment which is that if you have the phrase: &ldquo;such particulars as they think necessary&rdquo; and the court is asked to interpret whether the commissioners acted reasonably or not, the court will establish a certain level of responsibility which I suggest would be different from what would be established if the section were to read &ldquo;such particulars as they reasonably require&rdquo;.  There is a slight difference in the meaning and I think there would be a difference in the interpretation by the courts arising out of these words.  I suggest that the Minister does not want, or should not want to have the Revenue Commissioners acting unreasonably, or unreasonably to require certain particulars; that he wants them to act reasonably.  Therefore, he should not have any difficulty in agreeing that the phrase &ldquo;they reasonably require&rdquo; be inserted.  If I understood him correctly earlier he was saying in effect that it does not make any difference whether you put in &ldquo;reasonably require&rdquo; or &ldquo;they think necessary&rdquo;, that you get the same standards applied by the courts.  I am not sure that is so; indeed, I have grave doubts that it is so and I would hope that the Minister would not want any interpretation other than that which would be taken from the insertion of the phrase &ldquo;reasonably required&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> That does not inhibit the Revenue Commissioners in any way in carrying out their duties under this part of the Act.  It should meet the requirements of anybody in the House that the courts would not interpret it in a way that would hinder the Revenue Commissioners but it does establish some criterion, some level on which an aggrieved taxpayer can stand and can apply to the court and get a greater degree of protection than is implied in relying on the general obligation of the Revenue Commissioners to act reasonably and within reason.  But interpreted in the light of the Oireachtas having enacted a phrase &ldquo;such information as they require&rdquo; or &ldquo;as an officer requires&rdquo;, I suggest there is a difference.  I hope the Minister will be able to agree that the acceptance of my amendment would provide a slight degree of protection without inhibiting the Revenue Commissioners.  On the other hand, if his argument is that it makes no difference, I suggest he might accept it anyway because he is not losing anything.  Even if it is unnecessary I am sure some people would be reassured if that amendment were made.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cunningham gave notice of his intention to raise a matter on the Adjournment, namely, the decisions or conclusions reached by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of large imports of shirts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time today I asked the Taoiseach to indicate the quantity of shirts imported (a) from Korea and (b) from other third countries in the first quarter of 1975.  Incidentally, when I tabled the question it was directed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce but, as it was a statistical matter, it was put in the Taoiseach's group of questions.  The reply I got with regard to imports from Korea for the first three months of this year was 67,000 shirts.  There was no indication <Col N="160" /> whether this referred to dozens of shirts or to 67,000 shirts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>It referred to shirts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I was told the number imported from other third countries was 110,000.  In a supplementary question I asked what action was being taken to curb what is generally regarded as the dumping of textiles, especially shirts, and I was told that was a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary who was replying on behalf of the Taoiseach if he would get this information but, as I was dissatisfied with the replies to my supplementary questions, I decided to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  I understand the subject matter of the Adjournment now becomes &ldquo;the decisions or conclusions reached by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of large imports of shirts&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This matter was brought before the House on many occasions during 1974 when the problem developed into one of some magnitude.  These imports affected the constituency I represent where there are a dozen or more shirt manufacturing concerns whose products in the main are exported but who sell a fraction on the home market.  During 1974 there were redundancies, short-time working and closures in the industry due principally to these visible, direct imports of shirts.</P>
      <P>The figures I was given today do not represent indirect imports from third countries because imports from third countries are taking place in Britain and they are exported to this country. I do not know the actual figures but it is not uncommon to find on shirts imported from Britain a small label stating they were made in Hong Kong.  The same situation applies to other areas also.  Therefore, the figures I was given do not represent the full quota of shirts imported from outside the EEC.  The situation is an alarming one for my constituency and for the shirt manufacturing industry generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> As a result of questions and motions during the year we elicited from the Minister that he had taken up the matter with the EEC Commission and that representatives of the EEC visited this country with regard to shirt and footwear imports.  However, we were not given a final statement regarding decisions arrived at, actions taken or the result of such actions or decisions. The situation as I see it is that two out of every three shirts worn in this country are imported from Korea and other third countries.  This situation is causing problems for our manufacturers and workers.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister if the provisions regarding dumping legislation are being invoked or if duties are being imposed.  Is it the intention of the Minister to impose such duties?  We see countries in the EEC putting up protective barriers in respect of certain commodities, notwithstanding the fact that there are provisions with regard to free trade.  Our country is weak economically and we should be able at least to erect some barriers, whether by way of duty or by the invocation of the provisions of the dumping legislation.</P>
    <P>I asked for this adjournment debate because I mentioned this subject during two discussions about a month ago when I indicated to the Minister that at Alexandra Quay in Dublin container loads of Korean shirts and others were being unloaded this year despite all the negotiations the EEC had.  The main problem is that the Minister is not doing anything about this.  My information is that these Korean shirts are being landed at Alexandra Quay at 25p each and are being sold by retailers at £1.50 each and in some cases £2.  It would be interesting to find how much the Minister for Finance is getting by way of VAT from these container loads of shirts landed at 25p each and retailed at £1.50 to £2.</P>
    <P>The Minister must explain this to shirt factory workers, to the producers of shirts who have been doing a good job of work during the years catering for the home market and for a fairly large export market.  This is a duty not <Col N="162" /> only of the Minister but of the entire Government.  What is the score as of today?  What will happen in the future?  I appeal to the Minister to take definite action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want briefly to support the case made by Deputy Cunningham.  I assume the Minister will tell us about some form of voluntary agreement he got recently with the South Korean Government in relation to the export by them to this country of cheap textiles.  Apparently the agreement was arrived at some months ago but we never have been very clear on the details.  The Minister referred more than once to it. It appears to have been of little or no use during the quarter ended 31st March, in which 67,000 cheap shirts were imported from South Korea alone, not taking into account imports of 110,000 cheap shirts from other third countries.  There were also indirect imports through Britain and elsewhere of similar garments from third countries.</P>
      <P>We are rapidly approaching a situation in which each adult male in the community purchases one of these shirts per annum.  In these circumstances it is understandable that all shirt factories in the country are in difficulties, not just those in Donegal mentioned by Deputy Cunningham, but those in Dublin and elsewhere.  The unanimous views of the workers in those factories is that they are up against unfair competition.  The shirts can be made in Korea and other such countries at a tiny fraction of the cost it takes to make them here.  Even though it is within the power of the Minister to limit or possibly to prohibit altogether in one way or another these imports, he has refused to do so.</P>

      <P>I would have thought that, with our balance of payments very much on the wrong side of £300 million per annum, our situation in that regard is very little short of a crisis condition, and with unemployment running at its present rate the whole position of our general economy is little short of that situation.  There is provision in the Treaty of Rome for meeting a situation in which an industry or industries run into serious difficulties, as this particular industry has run into as a result of these imports. The EEC have made it perfectly clear that it is not up to them in the first instance to take the necessary measures to put a stop to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have seen national governments in the past year or so taking steps to protect their industries and their workers and we are asking that the workers who are affected in this and many other industries should be assured that steps will be taken.  The making of voluntary agreements with Korea has proved to be of no value whatever.  The efforts by the EEC Commission as a whole to make agreements with those countries are of little value to us, to the smaller and weaker states in the Community, whose problems are generally much greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a bit much to expect the EEC Commission representing the whole Community to try to make agreements with third countries if only one or two countries are affected as regards particular industries.  We have no indication that similar industries in some of the EEC countries are affected by the level of employment and redundancies that have applied here in the past 12 months in shirt <Col N="164" /> factories and other industries throughout the country.  With the figures we got today in relation to imports, I am afraid it is clear that the situation is likely to continue without hope for a change unless the Minister takes some steps to cut down on the huge figure of imports which we had for the quarter up to the end of March.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have time to make a point which I made to the Minister already.  Under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement there is specific provision that in a case where imports are seriously affecting a home industry we can apply to take protective measures.  Why this has not been imposed when there were ample time and grounds to do so I cannot understand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to hurry because I have a lot to say.  Deputy Cunningham made a serious and reasonable speech but I thought Deputy O'Malley was a perfect example of the sort of half-baked inadequate Opposition we are seeing so much of.  I will give a couple of examples&mdash;I do not propose to waste a lot of time on what Deputy O'Malley said because the half-baked attitude of my opposite number for Industry and Commerce does not merit it.</P>
      <P>First, he said, and I quote, &ldquo;We were never very clear on the details of the Korean agreement&rdquo;.  I do not know what one has to do but perhaps it would be too much to expect the Opposition spokesman for Industry and Commerce to read the newspapers for 1st March.  He went on to reveal his knowledge of the workings of the Community when he said it was a bit much to expect the Commission to make arrangements with third countries.  The Commission is the legally empowered organ to make trading arrangements with third countries and it defends that right against nation states with very great vigour. If the Deputy had the faintest knowledge or would bother to acquaint himself even a little&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was Deputy O'Malley who, after a reasonable speech from Deputy Cunningham, introduced this foolishness and sneering into the debate.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about the issues in question.  First, I will talk about South Korea.  Under the multi-fibre agreement of the GATT negotiations were continuing through 1974 to make arrangements between the whole Community and South Korea.  It was obvious to us, as the autumn of 1974 wore on, that the target dateline of 1st January, 1975, would not be met. We, therefore, invoked the emergency procedures of the multi-fibre agreement of the GATT in November, 1974.  We were the first country so to do.  As a result of that intervention we obtained the agreement with South Korea which was set out in the notice of 1st March which Deputy O'Malley did not see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a limited amount of time.  I refer the Deputy to that agreement because, if he will pay the country, the Parliament and myself the compliment of reading it, he will find the dates to which it refers.  That is the result of the intervention in regard to Korea.  We were the first country so to invoke it and we got a result.  The general multi-fibre agreement of the GATT between the whole Community and Korea will come in at a later date, but because of the slowness of negotiations it did not come in in time to <Col N="166" /> help us and we got an emergency arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>When will it come in and what will be the effect of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is aimed at the second half of 1975 now.  It was aimed at January 1st, 1975.  The effect will be to limit Korean imports in regard to guidelines which were related to the imports in 1974.  Again I would beg Deputies to familiarise themselves with the history of the GATT negotiations and with the history of efforts to liberalise trade in the world because, as a trading nation with 30 per cent of our GNP and more being exported and many more shirts being exported than imported, we must not lightheratedly interfere with free trading arrangements from which we benefit more than we lose. There is a serious kernel in this.  I would beg people to study the history of the GATT and understand it a little.  We have benefited from this development of free trade in general.</P>
      <P>In regard to dumping, the mechanism with An Coimisiún Dumpála is that they can initiate investigations or they can be requested by the Minister to initiate investigations.  On 10th January of this year at my instigation they initiated a dumping investigation. Deputies again would be aware, if they would familiarise themselves with the international rules on this, that if you initiate an investigation and then find that your own dumping commission, having to operate internationally agreed rules, cannot demonstrate dumping, then your last position is certainly no better than your first and may be worse.  That investigation is proceeding at my instigation.  We started on January 10th.  The Deputies never make reference to it, perhaps because they do not know about it but let me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Patronising is too good for the Deputy opposite.  It is a waste of time even doing that with him.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the low-cost quotas which apply to 16 countries.  This is a catch-all mechanism which did not catch Korea because at the time that those low-cost quotas were initially introduced Korea was not a significant exporter.  It came on the scene later. The 16 countries are Japan, Czechoslovakia, Roumania, India, Malaysia, Macao, People's Republic of China, Hungary, Hong Kong, Taiwan (Formosa), Bulgaria, Poland, East Germany, Pakistan, Yugoslavia, USSR. The point here is that the catch-all quota for all of those countries, except Korea, is the value of £100,000 and that low-cost quota system, effectively excludes, except for evasions which I will talk about in a moment, all of the products from those countries.  The £100,000 is a nominal amount for that number of countries.  That system exists, is operated and will continue to the end of 1977.  That relates to countries other than the Community where we have free trade and other than Korea which was not a significant exporter when that system was introduced.  That is an effective system which is working very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is known that there is evasion of this to some extent and about that we have done two things.  In November, again at my instigation&mdash;the Revenue Commissioners carry on a normal amount of investigation of all the import documentation&mdash;we urged them to intensify that control, the scrutiny of documents, to see that there was no cheating, no putting things in from other sources.  I am happy to say, and to place my thanks on record, that there was a very substantially increased vigilance by the Revenue Commissioners to see that products of places like Hong Kong and the other countries I named were not coming in in irregular ways.  There <Col N="168" /> is also, of course, a provision in the agreement with South Korea, the details of which were published in the newspapers on 1st March, which sets out the mechanism for dealing with the passage of things from South Korea into the Community and then into Ireland, a mechanism directly between the Koreans and ourselves, that will minimise those illegalities.</P>
    <P>I am also in a position to say, and this is new information, that a formal surveillance scheme, in addition to the increased surveillance of the Revenue Commissioners, requiring a licence will be in operation in the very near future.  I have obtained the necessary mechanism to do that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the AIFTA agreement which Deputy Brennan mentioned, we have approached the British.  I spoke to Peter Shore informally in January. We had a formal meeting on 21st February.  We pushed our side of it as hard as we possibly could.  Deputy Brennan suggested that that mechanism could be invoked easily.  We tried to invoke it to the limit and in regard to the UK we got nowhere.  That mechanism was an illusory one when we tried to use it.  We did try to use it informally in January and formally in February.</P>
    <P>I have recorded decisions about Korea, decisions about the other 16 countries and the low-cost quotas, decisions about tightening the Revenue Commissioners' surveillance, decisions about a licensing system which will give us a very up-to-date control, decisions about reference to An Coimisiún Dumpála.  All of these are specific actions to the very limit of what is permitted under our Accession Treaty which was so injudiciously and lightheartedly recommended by Deputies across the House, without any consideration for the potential damages of which we are now suffering one, because we are functioning to the limit of the possible.  Again they have been making allegations about what other countries have done.  I would beg them to go to some neutral source like <i>Keesing's Contemporary Archives</i> and find out what actually happened under what Articles of the Treaty and see if <Col N="169" /> they are really urging us to do the same thing and if they think it is to our advantage to do the same thing.</P>
    <P>I have enumerated the decisions.  I have heard no suggestions except vague ones which evaporate when analysed.  I have been asked for conclusions and I will offer some.  When I look at the figures, both for volume and value, I find that we export and are continuing to export much more than we import in shirts.  Deputy Cunningham referred to his constituency where I know there is a concentration of shirt industries, but he said himself that they export most of their production to England.  Does he want to invoke, for the people he is concerned about, retaliation from Britain, because that is a real danger?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would do his homework a little he might <Col N="170" /> find a legal mechanism under the Accession Treaty that would work but until he has done that homework &mdash;and he has demonstrated that he has not started to do it yet&mdash;I do not think he has the right to make those sorts of suggestions.  That is too light-hearted and facile to be serious. There are desperate dangers to provoking a trade war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should do his homework and try to understand the legal mechanisms.  There is potentially much greater damage to us by tipping off a trade war with countries to which we export.  We are functioning under the legal mechanisms of the Treaty.  We are functioning in areas of decision in the five ways I have indicated, most of which Deputies on the other side seem to be unaware of.  I will certainly entertain serious suggestions of practical legal alternatives or things that we are not doing but I have not heard them.  I heard a serious speech from Deputy Cunningham and I share his concern.  I undertake to investigate and to act on practical suggestions but I cannot and do not take seriously the wide-swinging, unanalysed, sweeping suggestions for instant solutions which are simply illegal under mechanisms negotiated by the Opposition.</P>
