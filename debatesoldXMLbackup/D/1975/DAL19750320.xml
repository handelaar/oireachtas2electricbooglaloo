    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that the House is being given an opportunity of discussing the EEC, its implications and ramifications.  Those who opposed entry into the EEC have often described the Community as a rich man's club.  While I do not subscribe to that view one can say that the manner in which it has operated as far as the west is concerned can very well <Col N="870" /> be described as redolent of what one might expect from such a club.  Beginning with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries one finds that many of the benefits in relation to agriculture from the EEC have not reached the west.  Small cattle producers, whose primary function is the production and rearing of cattle, which are eventually sold at a year-and-a-half or two years, have been very badly let down in the past two years because of the way in which agriculture in general has been handled.  This is not the picture where the larger farmers are concerned; they have been possibly much better off than ever before.  They have been able to avail of intervention.  They have been able to restock at a much lower price which means that their profit margin overall has been pretty high. On the other hand, the small producer has got no protection at all from the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various schemes were introduced, such as the small farms scheme, which encouraged small farmers to improve their land and increase their stock.  That scheme was taken up in my county in a rather big way.  We had to employ a number of extra agricultural instructors to advise the farmers and help them in the operation of this scheme.  The result was that stocks increased considerably and ultimately small farmers were overstocked and they found themselves in the impossible position of not being able to sell their cattle at any stage.  Lowlands and fodder crops were limited and this aggravated the position.  Even though there is an improvement now in the situation we have not yet got back to the position that had been reached in 1972 when small farmers, for the first time since the foundation of the State, began to have confidence in themselves and in their ability to work their land and make a livelihood at home.  The marketing position which had improved recently&mdash;that improvement generated a certain amount of confidence&mdash;is again threatened with a recession because of the huge mountain of beef.  Only this morning the newspaper report on the position; it <Col N="871" /> is causing some concern to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. This pinpoints a rather serious situation, a situation about which some positive steps must be taken.</P>
    <P>I believe the sale of beef in the EEC by third countries has brought about this situation.  Sterner action should be taken by our representatives in the EEC to ensure agriculture, which is our main industry, has full protection.  When agriculture goes well our whole economy booms and when we have a drop in the income from agriculture we can expect a disimprovement in our economy.</P>
    <P>There is disappointment about the delay in having the regional fund made available.  I know our Minister has been doing his utmost to ensure that the scheme is brought forward and that we have an adequate share. However, there is still delay.  The west of Ireland are disappointed that the whole country is to be taken as a region.  This means our share will be far less than would have been the case if a different method were used for the distribution of this fund.</P>
    <P>We are also disappointed that the disadvantaged areas scheme for farmers is not reaching finality.  This is causing a great deal of concern in the west because many of the grants which were available to small farmers are being dispensed with.  No grants have been introduced to replace the small grants which were available for practically anything, such as improving land, drainage, fencing, improving buildings, making paths around buildings and making roads to houses.  Those grants were of great benefit to small farmers to help them make their land more productive.</P>
    <P>Now we have the farm modernisation scheme.  Since that scheme was accepted the small grants have been dispensed with.  The Department of the Gaeltacht in Gaeltacht areas made a contribution towards the smaller grants.  They do not make that contribution now because the small grants are not available.  I believe it is necessary to have the disadvantaged areas scheme introduced as quickly as possible <Col N="872" /> to fill this gap.  There is a good deal of uncertainty about many of these schemes and it is a disappointment that we have to wait so long to have them implemented.</P>
    <P>People engaged in agriculture felt that sheep farmers would receive some benefit.  An Foras Talúntais, in setting up a scientific institution such as the institution at Creagh, did a wonderful job in preparation for Europe and in trying to help our farmers to produce a breed of sheep and cattle that would be acceptable to Europeans.  There seems to be no definite policy in relation to sheep.  At least one of the EEC countries, France, seems to be digging in her heels very much in relation to the marketing of mutton in France. This is discouraging because it appears that some EEC countries, although they are bound in a common interest, dig in their heels when it suits them and when it is to their own advantage. Some of these schemes are working to our disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Fishing is another area where we do not seem to have geared ourselves to gain the best advantage from the EEC, especially in relation to withdrawal prices and the setting up of producer groups.  We have been very lax in preparing a comprehensive plan for the fishing industry so that we can avail of EEC grants.  I should like to make a parallel with something which happened recently in relation to FEOGA grants.  I read in a statement that five fishermen received grants for new boats, County Down received 16 and the whole United Kingdom received 37.  This shows that we do not seem to have our programme prepared in order to get the best advantage available to us.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have an all-out drive in order to increase our fishing capacity, to get larger boats and to prepare for the future in this vital industry.  It is necessary to do this because our in-shore fleet at the moment has reached a point where we can hardly afford to have boats of 70 feet and 80 feet scratching our shores.  It is necessary to try mid-water fishing.</P>
    <P>We talk a good deal about our mineral wealth being stolen by foreigners but we should look at what <Col N="873" /> has happened in relation to fishing. The wealth of fish which has been taken three and four miles off our coastline over the years is far greater than any mineral wealth we have lost to date.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why it is important that something should be done about this.  It is the fact that when the Treaty of Accession is being reviewed in 1982, if we are not able to make a case with regard to the fishing of our own waters we will be in an impossible position and our negotiators will be faced with the problem involved in having to admit that that is the case.  Urgent action is necessary to extend our fishing fleet and to get bigger boats.  The fact that EEC grants are available to us should help in this respect.</P>
    <P>This also takes in the other aspect of fishing, the provision of suitable piers, the building of cold storage facilities, the education of young fishermen, training of personnel in processing.  A great deal more should be done in this field.  I would urge that all the funds available to us from the EEC be used to the full for this vital industry.</P>
    <P>We can hardly be happy with the present situation in industry.  One wonders if we have been taking the necessary action to protect our home industries.  The footwear and textile industries are particularly vulnerable. We have not been firm enough in protecting our interests here.  It is a well-known fact that there is wholesale dumping on our home market. As a small country in the EEC, just beginning to build up industry, we should seek the necessary protection to maintain employment in industry and to protect industrial workers.</P>
    <P>One problem arises in connection with EEC grants, that is, as to who has the right to apply for the grants and where does one look for grants. There would seem to be no directive. County councils and county managers, for instance, are not clear as to the position.  I am a member of the Western Regional Tourist Board. There is some doubt there as to the position of the board.  Are they <Col N="874" /> entitled to look for grants from the EEC or is it Bord Fáilte that looks for them?</P>
    <P>At present there is major development taking place in the northern part of County Mayo where we have been fortunate in getting one or two large industries.  As a result it is necessary to provide the infrastructure which does not at present exist for industries. The provision of water schemes, sewerage, improved roads and so on is a matter of urgency.  The cost would be prohibitive, particularly in a county like Mayo where the rate is the highest in the country&mdash;£9.80.  Again, we are not sure of our position.  Can the county council apply for grants?  What grants are available?  The existing structure must be examined.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that a special division or department should be set up for Europe from which clear directives would be forthcoming to groups and individuals so that they would know the exact requirements in the matter of getting grants.  I mentioned the provision of piers.  In the building of a pier you may have the Department of Finance, the Office of Public Works, the county council, the Department of the Gaeltacht, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and on occasions the Department of Transport and Power involved.  This means that the operation can be slowed down considerably. There is also the consideration that even with the limited funds available to us up to now there have been occasions when unexpended money had to be returned because of the fact that certain agencies, possibly the Office of Public Works in many instances, were not geared to spending the money.  This highlights the situation we are likely to find in relation to the spending of further grants.  If we are to take full advantage of grants that may be available the existing structures will have to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous advantages to be derived from our entry into the EEC.  When we are sufficiently geared to take advantage of the various schemes and grants available, the economy as a whole will benefit.  We are still groping in the dark in many <Col N="875" /> respects and there is a great need for the restructuring of existing services in order to gain the greatest advantage from the funds available.</P>
    <P>I just want to comment on the position in which some civil servants find themselves.  They are trying to carry on a job in the Department to which they are assigned.  They find themselves in Brussels one day and back in Dublin the next day.  They cannot be expected to do their job efficiently under the present structures. It is essential that we have clear directives from the top to indicate the benefits available and to assist individuals, county councils, regional boards and industrialists so that they may gain the best possible advantage from the grants that are available.</P>
    <P>With regard to the social fund, it is not good enough that Deputies get at second hand all the information with regard to this matter.  It is in the newspapers that we get information about the various grants and schemes being paid but we should have the privilege of getting this information directly rather than having to depend on the newspapers.  This morning I read there was little hope of the west benefiting to any great extent.  It appears AnCO are getting a large slice of the social fund.  I am not objecting to this because I consider money spent on their training services is worthwhile but while it helps the major centres of development the backward areas stand to benefit very little.  It is well known that people doing the AnCO training courses must be sponsored.  In western areas there is not much industry and it is next to impossible for a young boy leaving a vocational or secondary school to get sponsorship to avail of the training courses.</P>
    <P>Very little progress appears to be made in the provision of industry for off-farm employment.  Small farmers will have a tough fight to maintain their standard of living and to stay on the land but to date there has been little done to provide the off-farm employment necessary for small farmers and their families.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> I have been fairly critical of the operation of the EEC but most of the criticism has been justified.  My remarks are not by way of personal criticism of the Minister or of any of our people in the EEC but were made in an effort to pinpoint deficiencies in the operation of EEC schemes.  I hope we will be able to do something to improve the present position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been members of the EEC for two years and overall we have benefited to a large extent.  I should like to congratulate all who were connected with the organisation of the recent summit in Dublin and I include in this tribute those responsible for security.  The fact that there was no adverse comment from the Press or elsewhere is an indication of the efficiency of the civil servants and those engaged in the organisation of the meeting.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has not been idle since he took up office. Much of the success and harmony in the EEC is due to his influence and personality and I should like to express our gratitude to him.</P>
      <P>We were not very pleased with the allocation we received from the regional fund.  In the next three years we will receive £35 million and, although we had anticipated a larger allocation, we must accept this as a beginning.  The allocation of the money in the country will engage the attention of the Government but I hope the disadvantaged areas in the west which need the money most will get full consideration.  I am glad to see that the 12 western counties will qualify for the disadvantaged areas support.  This is only right when we consider the massive depopulation that has occurred in the west and the fact that the area did not enjoy the benefit of industries in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries succeeded in getting the green £ and also in raising agricultural prices and those achievements were a boost to the agricultural economy.  However, we must consider now how the common agricultural policy has worked and whether, in the light of our experience in the last two <Col N="877" /> years, that policy should change.  We should consider whether the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Agriculture and Fisheries should consult together to see if we can correct the trends that are responsible to some extent for the drastic drop in the price of young and small cattle.  I refer particularly to the areas of the west, primary producers of young stock, which have because of incentives introduced over the years in some cases doubled their stocks.  About a year-and-a-half ago they found there was a sudden glut and while intervention and slaughter payments were guaranteed to owners of stock over a certain weight, owners of young stock were left without any such guarantee.  Then there was experienced the drastic results of that overstocking without an adequate market which is a lesson from which we can all learn and with regard to which corrective measures should be undertaken immediately. We cannot afford to allow the very foundations from which our beef trade sprang meet a recession of the type we have had to overcome.  I say quite emphatically to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that immediate steps must be taken.  I am glad to note that the Taoiseach has promised that a survey will be made of the payment of funds to ensure their proper use.  I hope that review body will issue a report as soon as possible because we must protect those who work hardest in the particular sciences which are least fertile.  I would consider that to be a most urgent matter.</P>
    <P>We have benefited in many ways because of our membership of the EEC.  From time to time we hear criticism from people who are ill-informed, who may not be aware of the guaranteed prices to all our milk producers, the guarantees now also to producers of beet and on many of the agricultural commodities we sell.  It is useless for such people to attempt to decry the advantages of our membership of the EEC and people will not be influenced by such stupid statements made from time to time.  One can appreciate that the first months, or perhaps year, of EEC membership <Col N="878" /> necessarily entailed a certain amount of delay in the working through of economic and foreign policies to the different member States.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, his officials and all of the civil service here seemed to work in those policies rather rapidly through our political system.</P>
    <P>I hope that the channelling of the funds available will be done equitably. And they are available from many sources.  We now have headage payments for farmers of different categories rearing different types of livestock under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  These are vital if we are to restore confidence and confidence is necessary for people subject to the uncertainties of an Irish climate.  They experienced too often in the past the uncertainties of a fluctuating market which could not be relied on from year to year.  I hope that uncertainty will have been abolished and that in the future we can progress with greater confidence and reliance on our membership with full confidence in the Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his officials to administer the different programmes initiated through our membership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking back over the EEC in the last two years, certainly there are some areas in which we have been disappointed.  I should like to say a few words on regional policy and especially the development of border areas we had expected and hoped.</P>
      <P>In the European Parliament, on the 13th November, 1974, a number of statements were made which were found to be of particular concern to people living in border areas, amongst which were statements by the Commissioner for Regional Development, Mr. Thomson.  Let me quote from his reply to a question raised by Deputy Michael Herbert when he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission is making a general study of the problems of frontier areas in the Community. Following visits I have made this year to several frontier areas inside the Community&mdash;and I can tell Mr. Herbert that this includes both <Col N="879" /> sides of the frontier in Ireland&mdash;I have asked my staff to prepare as a matter of urgency a comprehensive study on the Community's frontier regions and the measures being taken by Member States' Governments to ease the problems for those who live there which result from the Community's borders. This study will deal in the first instance with the Community's internal frontiers rather than with the frontiers with non-Member States.</P>
    <P>When we read that statement in November, certainly we were expecting that, when the regional fund was set up, it would be very favourably disposed towards those border regions. One could not but be disappointed last week when it was stated here, in reply to questions, that no schemes had been submitted by member States in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the Commission's proposal for a regulation on the Regional Development Fund, Commissioner Thomson said:</P>
    <P>... the Commission proposes that special consideration should be given to projects of a trans-border nature, as the President-in-Office of the Council has just said.  Indeed, I can assure Mr. Herbert that I attach great priority to this proposition. It seems to me this is a distinctive means by which to ensure necessary regional development through the Community in a way that is certainly very difficult to do at the national level.  Once the fund is set up, therefore&mdash;and I emphasise &ldquo;once it is set up&rdquo;&mdash;we shall accordingly be ready to examine any well-founded projects for the United Kingdom-Irish border area. Of course, such projects will depend in Ireland as in other parts of the Community, on a joint approach being made to the Commission by the Governments of the Member States concerned.</P>
    <P>Those words of Commissioner Thomson were reassuring to people on both sides of the Border.  The Commissioner's visit, coupled with the efforts of most of our representatives <Col N="880" /> there, was reassuring.  I said &ldquo;most of our representatives there&rdquo; because, on that occasion, 13th November, 1974, Deputy Dr. Thornley in his contribution, when commenting on the possibility of cross-Border co-operation, perhaps did a disservice to that area when speaking in the European Parliament on that day, and from which I quote as follows:</P>
    <P>I hope it will not seem impertinent if I say I am trying to introduce a note of realism into this debate.  I wish first to thank my group for appointing me as its spokesman on this subject since I am only one of two Irish Members of the second largest group in Parliament.  I represent the country with the lowest gross national product in Parliament.  I wish also to thank Parliament for its interest in Ireland, this tiny, rather poor country.  I thank Mr. Hill for literally taking his life in his hands by going to Ireland and visiting both north and south.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>I think that to discuss this subject without being aware that a ring of steel, in effect, separates the North from the South is unrealistic.  It is completely unrealistic to ignore the fact that there have been between 150 and 200 exchanges of fire between the security forces of the North and South of Ireland.  It is unrealistic not to take into account the fact that the nearest town to the South in the North, Newry, is virtually rendered a desert by bomb explosions.</P>
    <P>I contest this point most strongly and I wonder if that had an effect on the submission of schemes for regional development?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my view that it had the effect of our European colleagues having a more sympathetic view of the whole matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope initially that those schemes would be submitted to have a chance in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot compare this House with the European Parliament, because they are not alike.  It is unfair to quote one of our colleagues out of context.  I am sorry, I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cross-Border projects, for instance, a drainage projects, which would have been ideal for submission for the fund.  If we are ever to achieve cross-Border co-operation, instead of Deputy Thornley throwing cold water on our efforts he should have welcomed such attempts at co-operation as I and thousands of others along that Border welcome them.  We in that area have positive proof that there would have been co-operation.  The border between Monaghan, Cavan and Fermanagh cuts across many rivers large and small.  It is the main drainage channel for that border area out to Lough Erne.  There are many small and large farmers whose lands are suffering greatly from lack of drainage.  With the slow progress of arterial drainage we believed that the only possible hope was the regional development fund, and we had looked to our representatives in the European Parliament to press the case for this. Adequate drainage for that region can only be achieved on a cross-Border basis.  Some time ago we, on a non-political and non-sectarian basis, made efforts to organise in preparation for this hoped-for fund.  There was a tremendous response to that effort and it blasted Deputy Thornley's view that this was not possible.  We were hoping this fund would be in operation there this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil are fully behind the farm modernisation scheme and fully behind farmers working to a plan and a forward projection, but we see great dangers in this scheme as it is at present.  It must be amended and amended quickly.  We believe, from the income point of view, that the £1,800 per labour unit will have to be reduced.  Another serious aspect of <Col N="882" /> the farm modernisation scheme is the way they view the farmyard enterprises, both the pig and poultry industries. They seem to treat them as sensitive areas.  In my county of small farms, farmyard enterprises are not only desirable but essential if farmers are to make a decent livelihood from the land by supplementing their income from small acreages.  Directive No. 159 on farm modernisation says that in relation to pig enterprises we would want to have £4,200 of an investment to qualify for aids or grants.  That is a fairly sizeable investment for a farmer, and it is only one of the sidelines.  On the other side of the coin, the farmer must also produce 35 per cent of his feed requirements for the pig enterprise if he is to qualify for the grant.  This is not feasible in a hilly area that does not concentrate on grain growing because the land is not suitable for the large combines and other machines which are necessary.  That is another matter that would want to be amended in the farm modernisation scheme.  The case must not have been properly put in this connection.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the drainage of those hilly regions, land which, if it was developed, would be suitable for grazing sheep and which the normal schemes would not cover at present.  The same can be said, from a regional point of view, about afforestation.  Where there are a large number of forests it may be possible to have an industry based on timber set up, say, in Fermanagh, Tyrone, Monaghan and Cavan where there is a fair amount of afforestation and where there are forests coming to maturity.</P>
    <P>We also hoped that the regional development fund would have catered for the extension and development of arterial roads, because in County Monaghan we were very well served some years ago by the Great Northern Railway; there were two main lines going through the county.  With the closure of the GNR the roads were not developed and were not adequate for road transport.  It is disappointing, therefore, that the fund does not cover such a scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> Mention was also made of milk by previous speakers.  Certainly the milk producer is coming well out of the present situation due to the increase in milk prices.  However, we must think of the great danger that may have been done to milk production over the past 12 months and especially at the end of last year when so many cattle which would have been suitable for milk stock were slaughtered in our factories at four, five and six cwt.  In years to come it may be difficult for those in milk production to get replacement stock due to the depression in the cattle trade which, looked at in retrospect, should not have happened.  We must lay blame on the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for not taking remedial action in the fall of last year because it has turned out that we had not all the surplus cattle which it was believed at the time we had.  We hope that breeding stock, especially for milk production, was not damaged.  I should like the Minister to keep those items in mind, especially the cross-Border development.</P>

      <P>Then I shall deal briefly with the Fourth Report which gives us an opportunity of putting on record here some facts in relation to the European Community that may not be fully appreciated.  Most people here look on our membership of EEC as a means of getting something for nothing or for very little.  I suppose I have an opportunity of looking at the Community from a vantage point and nobody in Europe is in any doubt about our contribution to the Community which, in our presidential year when our Foreign Minister is President of the Council and when other Ministers are Presidents of various <Col N="884" /> other councils, has been significant. Judging by the popular Press in Europe our European colleagues are quick to recognise that although we are small in population and perhaps poor in resources we have given a fair share from an economic point of view and in terms of ability, philosophy and manpower, our leadership has been significant and we have achieved more in the first few months of this year under President FitzGerald's leadership than was achieved in the past 18 months or two years.  It is due largely to the dynamic work and efficiency of our Foreign Minister that we have got the Community moving again and that progress has been made.</P>
      <P>I was quite proud to stand in the European Parliament last week with my Irish colleagues and hear the President of the Commission, M. Ortoli, pay a very sincere tribute to our country, our Government and our civil service on the organisation and success of the summit conference in Dublin.  Europeans do not lightly throw bouquets.  This showed we were not just passengers, in the Community for what we hoped to get out of it. The dedication of all those who were engaged here on the summit and their work proved that we have something to offer and that we were able to provide superbly the means to enable the institutions to work and in many ways we have set a headline.  We can take our place and speak with confidence on the progress of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like briefly to remind our people that it is necessary that we should contribute and play our full part.  When one sees adverse comment, for instance on the new disadvantaged areas scheme, it should be realised that straightforward criticism is not good enough.  We are a very small fraction of the Community with a population of 3.9 million out of 254 million.  Our contribution to the Community funds this year is about £7 million out of a total budget of about £2,800 million.  Our Ministers and officials work hard to ensure that as far as possible every scheme and directive&mdash;and in Parliament every opinion and report&mdash;will be bent or <Col N="885" /> tailored so as to give the maximum advantage to our people here in all walks of life.  In a large Community, which this is, it takes time to effect change but I am confident that when we see the disadvantaged areas scheme in operation it will be possible to modify it in some way to ensure that we get the best possible results from it.</P>
    <P>In drawing up maps of areas that will benefit we must remember that very definite criteria are laid down.  It would certainly give the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries no pleasure to exclude any parish or townland from the scheme if it were possible to include it.  A parish or an area can only be included at present if it conforms to the three main criteria proposed by the Commission and laid down by the Council of Ministers.  This has been the practice and while the scheme is not yet fully in force I am confident that it will continue and that as time goes on we shall be able to get more momentum into it.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly now with the regional policy.  I compliment the Minister on the work he and his colleagues have put into bringing a regional policy into being and having this new regional development fund funded as it was last week.  It is through the regional policy that the philosophy of the founding fathers&mdash;Schuman and Adenauer&mdash;about spreading the wealth of the Community right across the peripheral poorer areas will be fulfilled. I look forward in the immediate future to working as President of the Parliamentary Committee for Regional Policy in close harmony and co-operation not only with my colleagues but with the Commissioner, Mr. Thomson, and his staff to ensure that we get the fullest momentum possible and that, when we come to the end of this financial year, every penny of the £150 million allocated will be spent.  It might be beneficial if we were actually able to over-spend.  For me, this is an exciting task and I am confident that within a year or 18 months we will have progressed so far our budget will be the second largest in the Community, second only to FEOGA which at present <Col N="886" /> accounts for almost 80 per cent of the total budget of the Community.</P>
    <P>That brings me now to the common agricultural policy.  I hear people constantly criticising the operation of the common agricultural policy and equating CAP with what is so obvious in the United Kingdom; there they choose not to regard the common agricultural policy very highly because their community has only about 3 per cent who are farming.  We should bear in mind the fact that we are gaining a tremendous benefit and a large amount of hard cash from the common agricultural policy.  Since we stand to gain so much from this policy surely we cannot afford, no matter how tempting it might appear to be, to transgress in the smallest way the rules and criteria laid down.  I believe they suit us very well.  It is not possible to have every directive tailormade to fit our own narrow situation.  We must, however, bear in mind that CAP is the one policy that has actually got 80 per cent of the Community's budget.  Industrial areas in the Community are constantly endeavouring to change that situation and cut down the amount of funds channelled into CAP.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of woolly thinking.  People pose questions as to how we, for instance, can increase the price of butter by 5 pence a lb. when across the Border it costs much less. I would remind the farmers who talk like this that in the last two years the price of their milk has been more than doubled and one cannot have increases like that without the end product being also affected.  Surely no one would want our Government to act in the same irresponsible way as the United Kingdom Government have acted over the last two years <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Community, one day they were in and the next day they were talking about going out the following morning. Everybody now welcomes the fact that they have at last decided to recommend staying in the Community. We all hope we can now sit down to a period of real progress and stability.  In the world of today it is very important that there should be a very definite policy because in no other way can we have progress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> With regard to regional policy, I believe our activities in this respect should be under the jurisdiction of one Minister.  All the country is a designated area for the purposes of this policy and so the funds should be spread right across the country. There has been some suggestion that the funds should be localised.  That would be counter-productive because the Council of Ministers put up quite a fight to ensure that every part of the country would qualify for aid and grants under the scheme.  As I say, overall administration of this fund should be vested in one Minister.</P>
    <P>Some may argue that the amount of money we can expect in this financial year is quite small expressed as a percentage of our capital budget. This is a fund that will, more than any other fund, help the realisation of the aspirations of the founding fathers.  I had the pleasure of having a meal recently with M. Jean Rey, a man who has served the Community very well indeed.  He also expressed the opinion very forcibly that this fund will grow and grow dramatically. We should look on its starting small as a plus factor.  We will be able to organise it much better and lay firm foundations which will ensure that, once the fund gets off the ground, we will be able to add to it each year and ensure that the best possible advantage is taken of it.  We will be able to lay infrastructures which will directly help the development and expansion of industry in growth centres.  Responsibility for all this should be laid firmly on the shoulders of one Minister so that one person will be answerable for the progress of the fund.</P>
    <P>At the moment practically every regulation comes within the ambit of different Ministers here.  Responsibility for some aspects of transport policy fall within the ambit of the Minister for Transport and Power while other aspects fall within the ambit of the Minister for Local Government.  Perhaps we should reorganise ourselves in line with European practices.  It is difficult for those of us who are working on these documents <Col N="888" /> to have to deal with a large number of civil servants working for two different Ministers.  If there is to be a major reorganisation of public servants it might be a good idea to look at it from the European point of view and see how we can organise our Departments to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard spoke very briefly about cross-Border co-operation in relation to the regional policy.  Cross-Border co-operation did not depend on the formation of a regional policy. The Government on many occasions repeated the demand that there should be a joint approach with the United Kingdom Government making an application to the Commission to set up a cross-Border study.  A similar study has been undertaken elsewhere in the Community.  It is important to recognise that the United Kingdom Government up to now have not co-operated in making that approach for their own reasons. Therefore, it is not right for Deputies to blame lack of initiative on the part of the Government in relation to cross-Border co-operation.  This is one of the points the Taoiseach discussed with Mr. Heath when they had their historic meeting at Baldonnel about 18 months ago.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer very briefly to the social policy and to place on record the tremendous contribution being made in Europe by Dr. Hillery. This is the case of an Irishman who has made the grade in Europe and has brought honour to the country. He has done his share to ensure that our flag flies high throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>This has been a good year in Europe for this country.  We should remember that when we criticise the many problems the ordinary people in the country have.  I should like to take this opportunity of complimenting the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Commission for the success of the policy that has been implemented on the difficult question of beef over the last year.  There were too many prophets of gloom in the early part of the year who prompted farmers to dispose of their small store cattle at very uneconomic prices.  The blame <Col N="889" /> for losses to the small farmers who are least able to bear them must rest on the shoulders of those prophets of gloom.  The Commission have spent about £75 million in ensuring that the least possible financial and economic damage is done to our country.  This is an indication of the great benefit we have received from joining the Community.  They come to our aid when we are going through a difficult period.  We have had two such periods. It takes a while for the remedial measures to bear fruit.  We saw it took up to nine months to clear the problem of the butter mountain.  It is the same in relation to beef.  It is important to realise, through the ups and downs of our economy, that we have an organisation to ensure that minimum guaranteed prices will be paid to the primary producers.  We should take a more positive view of all our dealings with the European Community.</P>
    <P>The eighth report of the European Community published some time ago is a document I recommend to all my colleagues in the House.  It sets out very concisely the progress of the Community over the last year and the headings under which the main items of expenditure occurred.  It also gives an indication of the type of activities that are supported by Community funds.  It would be to the advantage of everybody if more of our people sought out information rather than accept what they are told by the prophets of gloom.  They would know all the different projects which can be supported if they are prepared to work.  It is not enough to expect that a Government official should go around asking people if they want grants under several hundred headings. If people have something important in mind, they should write to the particular department or to the Commission to find out if grants are available.</P>
    <P>A lot has been written on the new ACP negotiations.  I should like to place on record the role the Government played in the final negotiations on the new ACP agreement, which is a convention signed at Lome whereby the nine member states of the Community <Col N="890" /> and 46 countries from Africa, the Pacific and the Caribbean signed a trade agreement.  This agreement involves one-sixth of the world's population and puts all our producers of quality products into a privileged position. We have a very large market open to us.  Any industrialist in the country who produces quality products and who is able to present and package them attractively to meet the market and the requirements of a wide variety of countries right across the world has something to look forward to.  There must be tremendous opportunity there to secure the maximum development for this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy FitzGerald, on his success, on the fact that he was able to bring the 55 different points of view of the participating countries to agreement and to get 53 of them to sign on the one day.  It was a tremendous task and his success has not gone unnoticed.  I want to congratulate him warmly on his tremendous work and on the wonderful way in which he spoke to the people of the associated States at the conference in Abijan, which won tremendous respect not only for himself but for the country.  Each time the Minister speaks in Europe, his Irish colleagues who are in the vicinity get caught up in the wake of the congratulations and very good wishes that accrue.  I wish the Minister every success in the second half of his term as President of the Council. I am confident he will be equally successful in that half as he was in the first half of his term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">

      <P>I, also, would like to commend the Minister on the extraordinary energy and drive he is putting into his work as a member of the Council of Ministers and as President during this year.  I would also like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary who sat in the House last week for the Minister, on his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary and to wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussions that we are having from time to time on the European Community are most useful.  It is important <Col N="891" /> to keep in mind the original idea that the members of the Community working together can contribute not alone to one another but to the world community in a far better way by standing together and by strengthening the Community and making it successful.  It is important to Ireland&mdash;one might say to both parts of Ireland&mdash;that the Community should thrive.  This is important not alone for the benefits that we may derive from membership and not alone from the marketing improvements by way of exports that we may get, vital as both of these are to us, but it also helps us as a community to become more mature and to be better able to make our own contribution.</P>
    <P>A comparison may be drawn between the value to all members of greater co-operation between the members and the benefit to the people of Ireland as a whole of areas of co-operation between north and south in the interest of those in this country whose livelihood depends on the success of life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The attitude of many of us here towards the Community may be somewhat different from the attitude that prevails in Britain.  They give the impression that their interest is how much can they benefit.  There is a tendency in Britain&mdash;it is not as noticeable here&mdash;to associate current economic difficulties with membership of the European Community.  For example, the recent summit meeting was fully taken up with satisfying a British political need to justify continuing in membership.  There must be many areas of potential constructive development towards which the heads of government could have directed their attention in the recent summit if they had not had to give their full time to dealing with Britain.</P>
    <P>The upshot of the Dublin summit is a rather strange state of affairs, that this small country may now have to contribute something between £1 million and £2 million towards the objective of trying to ensure that Britain remains a member.  It certainly might be described as one for the books that Britain, which is having to <Col N="892" /> support Northern Ireland at such a high level, is now having to get some support from our Republic.  This is a pointer to the changing circumstances of history.  I am quite sure that very few here or in the North would have thought six years ago that a development of this kind would take place. One would hope that the northern community, especially Unionists and Loyalists there, will appreciate that we all have to respond to change.  The facts of life are facts wherever you may have to live.  It may also be worth saying that a British withdrawal certainly would cause great difficulty in the northern community.</P>
    <P>However, the summit itself in Dublin did highlight the great significance and importance of our membership of that Community.  It is no harm to say that the progress towards achieving the aims of the Community is somewhat slow but it is interesting to note that in November, 1974, the Political Affairs Committee agreed that the first direct election be organised at the same time in each member State and at the latest on the first Sunday in May, 1980.  It is important that we should begin to think about this ourselves and how we may approach that problem.</P>
    <P>One item to which I should like to refer is that relating to the effect of the dumping of low-priced goods from outside the Community on our own economy.  This matter was discussed in the House towards the end of last year. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us where we stand in connection with the dumping of low-priced Korean goods imported into Britain and which are then exported here.  This is one of the causes of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 7.2 of the Fourth Report of &ldquo;Developments in the European Communities&rdquo; states:</P>
    <P>A new representative rate for the Irish pound for the purposes of the Common Agricultural Policy was also fixed ... which had the effect of increasing farm support prices in Ireland by approximately 11 per cent in addition to the 5 per cent general increase.</P>
    <P>This was an important development for our farmers but we are entitled to <Col N="893" /> criticise the delay of the Government in this area.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 8.5 of the Fourth Report refers to public supply contracts and it states:</P>
    <P>A report from the working group of the Council which has been examining the draft directive concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public supply contracts has been submitted....</P>
    <P>I know of some efforts to communicate with Irish contractors but I should like to hear from the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary of the efforts made to keep Irish developers and contractors informed of the opportunities to quote for public works in any part of the Community.  This is important for Irish industrial life and Irish employment.</P>
    <P>Environmental policy is also discussed in the Fourth Report.  I should like the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to state what practical steps have been taken by us on this matter.  The report also has an important reference to the disposal of waste oils under the heading &ldquo;Energy and the Environment&rdquo;.  Paragraph 12.12 states:</P>
    <P>The Council approved a Directive on the disposal of waste oils.  The Directive requires member States to encourage the recycling of waste oils and to control the disposal of waste oils in order to prevent water pollution and minimise air and soil pollution.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what practical steps have been taken by us in this area.  I am informed the value of a gallon of waste oil is about 22p.  Apart from the disposal of such waste materials without damage to underground waters or coastal waters, I should like to hear what practical steps are being taken by business interests or any interests the Government may be able to encourage to engage in this kind of work.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 14.10 of the Fourth Report states:</P>
    <P>.... The Report recommends that the aim of Irish economic policy should be to ease the strong inflationary pressures in the economy <Col N="894" /> without however aggrevating the already difficult employment problem. It envisages that an active incomes policy will have a major role to play in this respect.  The Report recommends that the aim of budgetary policy should be the limitation of the rate of growth of expenditure and the maintenance of the net borrowing requirement at a level only slightly higher than that for the current financial year on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Here I must refer to the serious high level increases in prices and to the responsibility of the Government so far as it relates to internal inflation, which has been referred to by the Community.</P>
    <P>With regard to regional policy, it is interesting to study the percentages agreed to be distributed among members.  The decision to arrive at a regional policy is a welcome one although it did not live up to the policy decision made at the 1972 summit.  It seems to me from studying the percentages agreed that some of the members are living up to the spirit of the 1972 summit.  One can make a comparison between Belgium at 1.5 per cent, Denmark 1.3 per cent and the Federal Republic of Germany at 6.4 per cent.  These figures are relatively low compared with the figure of 28 per cent for the United Kingdom.  It is better that there should be some beginning made on regional policy and I am not complaining so much about Ireland's share but I am referring to the basic approach to regional policy.  In effect, as a result of the summit the United Kingdom rate will be somewhat higher than 28 per cent.</P>
    <P>Apart from any benefits we may obtain, it is important that we continue to make as great a contribution as we can to the idea of a European Community and European integration. I think it is the one significant way in which we, as a small nation, can contribute to a better world through Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain I am not concluding or answering.  I am <Col N="895" /> intervening in the debate.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, this debate was opened by the Parliamentary Secretary who had the advantage of being here for the opening speeches.  I think it preferable that he should reply, having heard the opening speeches.  I should simply like to intervene in the debate, of course, to reply to some of the points made, in passing, and to make my own contribution to the debate and continue thereafter.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy, in speaking, expressed some concern that I was not present at that stage and did not open the debate.  The position is that, at this time&mdash;when Ireland has the Presidency of the Community&mdash;the burden of work involved is very considerable. During the weeks since the year began I have been out of the country literally more than half the time.  During the working week, and on the days on which the Dáil meets, those are precisely the days on which meetings occur which I have to attend.  But the portion of my time absent is much greater than that.  It did not prove possible to arrange this debate to start on a day when I would be present in the House.  While Deputy O'Kennedy suggested there was no urgency about the debate, I must say I have not got the feeling that that was the Opposition's view because, in fact, we are debating the third and fourth reports, one of which is very overdue for debate.  The fact that we have to combine them shows the problem we have had in finding time to have a debate of this kind.  I was reluctant to seek to have the debate postponed until it could be taken on a day on which I could be sure of being present.  In fact, even today it is a matter of pure chance I am here because there was to be a council meeting of Development Ministers in Brussels today, cancelled only a few days ago, and I was not aware that I could be here today until a couple of days ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I apologise for the fact that I was not here for the opening of the debate.  But this is in the nature of a situation when a country, especially a small one which does not <Col N="896" /> have a number of Ministers, holds the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. However, I am glad it has been possible for me to intervene in the debate, to deal with some of the points that have been raised and speak more generally about some aspects of development of the Community.</P>
    <P>Taking a few points that have come up in discussion, Deputy Gallagher, speaking earlier on regional policy, said he was disappointed that the whole country was treated as a region. He seemed to feel that, because of that, in some way the west of Ireland would get less.  Of course, the contrary is true.  The method by which, very arbitrarily and, as we thought, not very rationally, the amount of the regional fund allocated to different countries was determined was fundamentally based on the population of the regions which were thought to justify assistance.  This was adjusted in our case, not once but twice, as a result of the efforts we made to get it increased to a higher proportion.  But the basis of the calculation on which the whole thing started was population. If, in fact, we had not insisted that the whole country be treated as a region, we would have lost out doubly. First of all, the population base would have been very much smaller and the basic share from which we started would have been smaller.  Secondly, the argument we were able to use, and use with effect, in getting our original allocation topped up twice&mdash; that is, the argument that there was no part of this country well enough off to be able adequately to subsidise development in the less well-off areas &mdash;could not have been used but for the fact that, uniquely amongst Community countries, the whole of this country was correctly designated as a region for those purposes.  I think it fair to say that the amount we would have got from the fund would have been, probably, no more than about a third of what we have now got had we not successfully pressed the case that the whole country be treated as a region.  When one takes into account both the effect on the population basis and the fact that our argument for topping that up was so heavily based, <Col N="897" /> necessarily, on the fact that there was no part of the country that could afford adequately to subsidise other parts of the country, taking the two together, we probably got about three times as much by adopting that approach than had we adopted the narrower one.</P>
    <P>Of course, that having been done, the question of where this money is allocated is one for the Government and for the Dáil.  Of course, given the nature of the development problems within this country, there will be inevitably, and properly, a bias in the allocations in favour of the west, just as there is in our existing development policy, regional policy and our system of industrial grants and in any aspect of policy which involves transfer of resources within the country at present.  The way in which that would be done and the extent to which it would be done are a matter for the Government to determine and for the Dáil to debate in due course.  The inclusion of Dublin for the purpose of the regional policy is a means of getting a larger allocation but does not permit the Government to use it in the Dublin region.  Just as the proportion of other funds which comes to Dublin for development purposes, our domestic funds, is low in relation to the population and income of the region, so, in the case of the regional fund, the distribution will, of course, be biased in favour of the parts of the country that most need assistance.</P>
    <P>I hope I have explained that adequately because it is important that there be no misunderstanding about the distinction between the whole country being a region for the purpose of getting the money and what we do with the money when we get it, or to be more precise, the selection of schemes which we submit for assistance from the fund which will necessarily, naturally and properly be biased in favour of less developed regions and particularly, of course, of the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy, in speaking, alleged that from time to time&mdash;in the previous debate last December in particular or at other times&mdash;I had given the impression that everything was going swimmingly, that the Community <Col N="898" /> is an enormous success and that there are no problems.  I hope I have given that impression.  One has to make a clear distinction here between the fact that the Community from our point of view is enormously beneficial and is making a great difference to the development of our country, that our participation in it has changed the whole nature, character and value of our involvement in affairs outside this country and the fact that the Community itself is a very imperfect entity in this stage of its development.  There are many features of it we wish to see improved and shall work to improve.  There are other aspects of it which, of course, are disappointing from time to time by comparison with our expectations from it.  One always has the problem in commenting on anything in life, in drawing distinctions between the comment one makes by reference to absolute standards and relative standards. I can remember when I was a member of the staff of a State enterprise for many years by absolute standards of efficiency all of us in it were conscious of the fact that we fell short of those standards and were seriously self-critical of the way the concern was run.  But when it came to an objective evaluation of how that particular concern stood in efficiency, in comparison with similar organisations in other countries, we were not at all surprised to find that the Irish firm was, in fact, the most efficient by objective standards of comparison.  Relatively speaking we were the most efficient. But, in absolute standards, everything falls short of expectations.  The same is true of the Community.  It has many defects, some of which will persist for a long time to come, some of which may be difficult ever completely to overcome.  At the same time, it represents an enormous step forward politically and economically, and one which from our point of view is enormously beneficial.</P>
    <P>Depending upon the particular occasion on which one speaks and in the particular context one may tend to emphasise either the defects which are so glaringly evident or the advantages which should also be evident.  It is <Col N="899" /> always possible to take a phrase out of context and to suggest that on one particular occasion a comment one makes is unduly pessimistic or optimistic in its orientation.  This is inevitable when one is dealing with something which, while being greatly to our advantage has, of course, serious defects.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy was also critical of what he alleged to be a tendency on my part to relate our position to that of France, Germany or Britain and apparently attempting to ape those countries, or to match them.  I did not, he said, sufficiently relate our position to that taken up on certain problems by, say, the Benelux countries.  I am not conscious of this and Deputy O'Kennedy was not specific in his criticism. But there may be a point here that on many issues the Benelux countries adopt a progressive and forward-looking attitude, do not create difficulties, do not put obstacles in the way of developments beneficial from our point of view or that of the Community, whereas the larger countries &mdash;who have, of course, more vested interests to protect and which, on the whole, have been somewhat less enthusiastic about the development of the Community into a supernational organism&mdash;are inclined on particular issues to create problems.  Therefore, when one is reporting on progress, one tends to have to report not that at last one has persuaded the Benelux countries to agree that there should be a regional fund, which they always supported&mdash;in fact they were always willing to support any form of regional fund that would secure agreement&mdash; but that the obstacles or difficulties raised by, Britain, France or Germany, from their different viewpoints were or were not being maintained or were or were not being removed.  Therefore, from time to time in reporting progress on particular issues one must, perhaps, realistically pay more attention to the attitude of the larger countries because they are the ones that hold up developments.</P>
    <P>In regard to the regional fund&mdash; and it may well be to that that Deputy O'Kennedy was referring&mdash;there were <Col N="900" /> no difficulties with the Benelux countries, as I have said, but France, Germany and Britain, each from their different viewpoints, were pressing particular interests which, taken together, formed a triangle of conflicting interests which had proved extremely difficult to resolve into a more forward-looking geometrical shape.</P>
    <P>We, of course, are conscious of the fact that there is no way in which we can be compared in the importance of our role to these larger countries. We are the second smallest country after Luxembourg and our interests in the Community must always be in that sense relatively small.  However, because of the way the Community is structured, because each country can press its own interests when they are of importance, and because no country is ever forced to adopt a course of action which it perceives to be against its vital interests, our role from our point of view is important and is sufficiently important and powerful to enable us to protect our interests.  Of course, it does not stand comparison with the scale of the influence that can be exercised by one of the larger countries, and I hope nothing I said has ever suggested the contrary.</P>
    <P>It is fair to comment, in the context of the presidency, that because smaller countries do not have so many vital interests to protect in so many different areas and, perhaps, also because their Ministers are less distracted by post-imperial involvements in various parts of the world, it is possible for a smaller country to play a relatively more active and more useful role in the presidency than for larger countries.  This is not inevitably true, but it is well-established as the norm in the Community that a small country's presidency tends to be more productive and more harmonious than those of larger countries. This applies to us as to others, because like the other smaller countries we have not got a large number of vital interests to protect.  We have some that are of crucial importance, especially those relating to agriculture and to questions of regional policy, but when these and a small number <Col N="901" /> of other matters are not at stake we can take a more detached view.  When it comes to the negotiation, for example, that between the Community and the African, Caribbean, Indian Ocean and Pacific States, to which Deputy McDonald made reference, there were very few significant Irish interests involved, whereas each of the larger countries felt they had major interests to protect.</P>
    <P>As a result, the fact that this negotiation came up for conclusion during the Irish presidency proved, I think, speaking quite objectively, to be fruitful and beneficial, because, first of all, the Irish President, myself in this instance, did not have to be looking over his shoulder all the time on each issue to consider whether there was some vital national interest to protect. On most aspects of it I was able to look at the matter objectively.  The other countries were conscious of the fact that we were not seeking to protect some vital national interest and were, therefore, more relaxed and more willing to allow the presidency to play its role of conciliation and give a lead in seeking solutions to problems.  The role of a small country can be, in matters of that kind, I will not say more important but more useful and more valid than that of a larger country.</P>
    <P>As I am on that subject, perhaps it is worth continuing with some remarks on the question of the presidency in a more general vein.  We inherited the presidency of the Community at a time when there had been two years in which progress had been relatively slow for a variety of reasons, partly, but only to a small degree, because of the British so-called renegotiation but also because of other internal difficulties in the economic community and the economic crisis, and certain political tensions between Member countries.</P>
    <P>These difficulties were greatly alleviated, although not completely resolved, by the time of the Paris Summit meeting in December of last year.  Consequently, we had the good fortune to inherit the presidency at a moment when some of the road blocks in the way of progress had <Col N="902" /> been, a few weeks before, swept aside. Therefore, the clearance of these road blocks occurring just before we took over the presidency and our own position, as I have outlined it, as a country which has not too many vital interests to protect, combined to enable us in the first 11 weeks or so to make quite unusual progress on a number of different policy issues where progress had hitherto been slow.</P>
    <P>Naturally, we have tried to make the fullest use of these opportunities and to give the Community a new impetus by putting our backs into the job and tackling the work resolutely, thoroughly and with energy.  It is only fair to say that we might have done all that and more besides and in less favourable circumstances and very little might have come out at the other end.  There are other countries that did their best in the presidency at different periods and ended up with very little to show for it because they were unlucky in the time they inherited this office.</P>
    <P>In the ten or 11 weeks of our presidency we have managed to get off the ground a number of important matters.  We have mentioned the negotiation between the Community and the African, Caribbean, Indian Ocean and Pacific countries, which is of enormous importance to Europe because it gives a new type of link, of a very satisfactory kind from the point of view of both sides, between the Community and the 46 countries in these parts of the world.  It links together something like 40 per cent of the member countries of the United Nations although in population the two sides represent 500,000,000 or 600,000,000, a rather smaller proportion of the world population.</P>
    <P>The linkage will be of great importance to both sides, from the point of view of the developing countries with whom this link has now been established, a much wider group than those previously associated, because they include a number of countries that have been independent for many years past as well as a number of former members of the British Commonwealth or former British colonies.  This much <Col N="903" /> wider group has the advantage now of this involvement in a stabilisation fund for certain primary materials, which will be directly beneficial to them, which will provide a very interesting and, I hope, valuable model of the kind of stabilisation fund that could be established on a more global basis and for a wider range of commodities. The group might help to provide a solution to the dangers of instability in commodity prices which has so often threatened the welfare and even the ability to survive of some of these developing countries, and which has also, in recent years particularly, threatened the economic stability of the industrialised countries which have found great difficulty in facing up to the problems posed by enormous price fluctuation of primary materials.</P>
    <P>This negotiation was also productive in creating new industrial co-operation arrangements between the Nine and the 46.  It also involves a very substantial fund running to 3,390 million units of account which is about £1,700 million over a five-year period and it involves trade arrangements beneficial to both sides.  The fact that it has been possible to negotiate in the first month of our presidency this difficult agreement is certainly beneficial to us because our ability to make a contribution to this Community must obviously be of this kind rather than in the form of a financial contribution where we are net beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>In addition to concluding these negotiations we also succeeded in getting the mandate for the Community for the GATT negotiations, the next round of worldwide tariff reductions. We had to get that agreed in time for the discussion in the GATT in mid-February. We succeeded in getting regional policy regulations agreed much more rapidly than anybody foresaw. Early on, I was told there was a chance that the obstacles might be cleared at the March meeting but in fact we cleared all but one of them at the February meeting.  The doubts then expressed as to whether it would be possible even by March to have these regulations cleared proved quite unfounded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> There is at present in progress a process of conciliation between Parliament and the Council of Ministers which holds up the formal implementation of the regulations.  It is part of the process by which Parliament asserts its growing authority in matters of this kind although because of the way in which heads of Governments determine the size of the fund, Parliament is not in practice in a position to make any variation in it.  When this process has concluded the regulations can immediately be brought formally into effect but the problem of reconciling divergent national interests in this matter was settled under our presidency much more rapidly than had been foreseen.</P>
    <P>We are also making good progress in the negotiations with certain Mediterranean countries and hope to be in a position, certainly within two months, to sign agreements with the MAGDA countries and with Israel. This is an aspect of the Community's activities which for a long time past has been dragging its feet.  Also, at a meeting of the Council of Ministers attended by the Tánaiste we succeeded in making the breakthrough of getting adopted the regulation of the free movement of doctors and of pharmaceutical products, which had been awaiting decision and action for years past.  Since the mid-1960s I have been following the work of the Community in seeking to achieve free movement of the professions and on each occasion when I visited Brussels over the years 1964 and 1965 onwards, I always made contact with the relevant director general to discuss progress&mdash; or lack of it&mdash;in these areas.  Now, ten years afterwards we have the first regulation for a liberal profession adopted and hopefully, that fact will not be only important in itself but will provide a lead for other liberal professions where perhaps the backlog of activity over the past ten years will begin to show results.</P>
    <P>In our case the regulation for doctors is of great importance because we export doctors.  The number of medical graduates here has always far exceeded our needs and our capacity to absorb them and availability of <Col N="905" /> access to the profession in other countries is immensely important to our graduates.  Hitherto, so far as European countries are concerned, this availability depended on <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements with these countries, most notably the United Kingdom.  In effect, the decision as to our qualifications was in the hands of the United Kingdom body and not solely under our own control.  To have this matter resolved by the Community in a way that relieves us of this excessively direct relationship with the United Kingdom in this matter is very satisfactory from our point of view.  It means that our doctors now have the right to free movement as of right, without being dependent on the regulations of the United Kingdom body. Getting this through, contrary to many gloomy prognostications, is another important development in the first few weeks of our presidency.</P>
    <P>All the work in this area involved considerable strain on all the staff concerned. In a sense it may be easier for a small country at ministerial level to undertake the presidency because the Foreign Minister of a small country may have less post-imperial preoccupations elsewhere in the world. On the other hand, the staff are much less numerous in a small country and the strain of undertaking the presidency is enormously greater.  It is already evident that the country, less than half-way through our period of presidency, owes an enormous debt of gratitude to the public servants in so many Departments, my own in particular, but in many others also who have been willing to work so extraordinarily hard and with such dedication in this period to make a success of the Irish presidency.</P>
    <P>That is true in particular of the arrangements made for the meetings held in Dublin recently at Foreign Ministers level and at heads of Government level.  These arrangements proved notably successful and received great praise from all concerned. Privately and publicly the comments by other Ministers and by the President of the European Commission on our work in making these arrangements have been extraordinarily <Col N="906" /> laudatory and obviously were genuinely felt.  Objectively speaking, our arrangements did enable the heads of Governments meeting to run more smoothly than has been the case at some other heads of Government meetings in the past.  People have certainly shown their gratitude for the work we did and this redounds to the credit of the country.  It is not merely a question of arranging rather spectacular meetings successfully; the work of presidency involves much more humdrum work at official level which has to be carried out with very few people under very considerable pressure. At this near half-way point I can report that all concerned stood up to the strain remarkably well and that there has been nothing but praise for the work achieved so far.  We have not faced any problem where anything has broken down or where there has been any failure on our part that would be a source of complaint to any of our partners.  I hope that will remain true during the remainder of the period.</P>
    <P>Before discussing somewhat further the heads of Governments meeting, the summit in Paris and the results flowing from them, I should like to deal with some points raised by Deputy O'Kennedy in his opening statement, points which affected me particularly or in which I have a particular interest.  He referred to Press reports that there had been disagreement between ourselves and France about the arrangements for the heads of Government meeting and suggested that I had in some way dismissed this and said it had not happened. I did not say that.  When the question was raised as a result of Press reports which were not accurate and were pretty wide of the mark in some respects I said that there had been a problem which had been resolved in the course or a meeting of less than two hours in the Council of Ministers several weeks earlier.  This is the case.</P>
    <P>Most of the arrangements we pro posed for this meeting arising from the directives and headlines and indications given at the Paris summit were accepted by our partners without difficulty but one point did arise where <Col N="907" /> there was a sort of philosophical&mdash; one might almost say theological&mdash;difference of view.  It had been our impression that the approach that other countries would wish and the one that would seem to be the simplest to the arrangements for the heads of Government meeting was that matters coming within the framework of the Community and which are matters for the Council of Ministers and for the heads of Government meeting as a Council of Ministers should be treated separately and consecutively with political co-operation matters which are not under Community auspices.</P>
    <P>The French had a divergent view and felt the meeting of heads of Governments should submit to being constituted physically in both these forms simultaneously throughout its entire length rather than be divided into consecutive segments.  There is a consecutive segment, I think, and the net difference is nearer at the end because, in fact, the decisions taken have to be classified and dealt with according to whether they are, in fact, decisions of the heads of Governments meeting as the Council of Communities or heads of Government meeting to discuss particular population matters. The point was, therefore, a metaphysical one which was resolved in discussion at this meeting and the Press publicity attaching to it was certainly disproportionate to the divergences on this metaphysical point, which was resolved very rapidly without difficulty. As Deputy O'Kennedy raised the point, I merely wanted to clarify what the issue was.</P>
    <P>On development aid, Deputy O'Kennedy asked were we the ninth State who, at a meeting of the Development Council last year, had been unable to commit itself to work towards the target of 7 per cent.  My recollection of that is that we were not the ninth State but, of course, we indicated that our position, which we had inherited, was one where the share of GNP devoted to development aid was only a tiny fraction, one-twentieth, indeed, of the target and it would take as quite a while to catch up from the <Col N="908" /> position where we started from two years ago, which resulted from the fact that the importance attached to development aid in Ireland was not very great and did not have a very high priority.  We made it clear at this meeting that we would not be able from the position where two years ago, the share of GNP devoted to development aid was .035 per cent to one where it would be .7 per cent, or twenty times as much, within four or five years at that rate but that we would aim towards the .7 per cent and we would set ourselves the target of each year, taking one year with another, increasing the share of GNP devoted to this purpose.</P>
    <P>We would increase it each year, taking one year with another, to an amount equivalent to .05 per cent of GNP per annum which would bring us over a measurable period of time up to the target and would involve very substantial increases in development aid over the period.  This commitment on our part to the target set was taken as quite adequate.  It was not Ireland which was the country that had difficulties with that commitment at that time because our Government was willing to commit itself in this way.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also suggested at columns 1971 and 1972 of the Official Report that we cut back in the current year&mdash;that is, 1975&mdash;the percentage of GNP for this purpose. That is not the case.  We calculated most carefully and to the best of our ability what, in fact, based on the projections of GNP in 1975 was, the sum of money necessary in order to maintain the percentage of GNP that had been allocated for this purpose in 1974 and, having arrived at that figure, by admittedly in this very difficult year a small amount, so that far from any question of a percentage cutback in development aid the planned amount for the current year is fractionally higher as a percentage of this year's GNP than last year's development aid provision was of last year's GNP.  If, in fact, the money is spent&mdash;because of difficulties with international commitments which sometimes do not materialise it is sometimes <Col N="909" /> difficult&mdash;it will, in fact, be a significantly higher proportion than that actually spent last year.  In each of the two years we have been in Government we have found that some of the international arrangements through which we contribute to development aid falls through the course of the year or do not materialise and we are then left in the position that we have provided money for purposes and the money is not called up and on several occasions we have had to look around for other things to do with the money, which is a curious position to be in but, seeking to maintain our commitment, we have done this.  It has not always been possible at the last moment so the actual amount spent sometimes turns out to be less than the amount originally committed.  The amount committed for this year is, as I say, a higher percentage of the estimated 1975 GNP than the amount committed for last year was of the 1974 GNP.  It is likely to turn out in practice a significantly higher share than the amount spent in 1974 was, in fact, of the 1974 GNP.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's assumption here was quite incorrect.  In fairness, it should be said the figures are complex and the form in which they are published does not lend itself to easy analysis.  This is a matter I am looking at.  Deputy O'Kennedy is not to be blamed for being uncertain as to what the position was though he should not, perhaps, have made such a definite assertion about something he had not checked more carefully.  I know it is not easy for the Opposition to get the exact facts except by submitting a certain amount of questions and I am not happy about this.</P>
    <P>I should like the presentation of the figures to be clearer but one of the difficulties is that development aid is channelled through a number of Departments, principally Foreign Affairs, Finance, Agriculture and Fisheries and certain others.  There is a tidying up operation to be undertaken here before we get a clear and simple pattern.  We are engaged on this and I would hope the Parliamentary Secretary would have special responsibility for this side of the work of the <Col N="910" /> Department and that he will be able to produce a clear picture as part of his general work on the expansion of development aid and of the arrangements that exist for the organisation of development aid.</P>
    <P>Those are, I think, the main points raised by Deputy O'Kennedy with which I wish to deal.  I should like now to turn to certain more general matters.  First of all, I should like to tell the House that the reports they have before them and which they are considering in this debate are, in my view, whatever criticisms there may be of them, and nothing is perfect, very valuable documents and are regarded as such internationally.  Our system of having a twice yearly report on the EEC is an unusual one and, although there is certainly something similar in Britain, the scale of the report is so minimal compared with ours as to be of relatively small value. As a result our reports are looked on as extremely useful reference documents. They are in demand by other Administrations as check lists on the actual work of the Community.  The fact that Parliament here sought reports of this kind and has been exigent in its requirements as to what the reports should contain and how they should be presented has helped to keep us up to the mark and has helped us to produce reports which have certainly proved useful not only at home but also abroad.  I thought it worthwhile mentioning that at this point.</P>
    <P>On the question generally of Community membership and its benefits to Ireland, this is something about which there is some confusion and about which I ought to say something briefly.  We had a referendum here and out of that referendum came a very clear-cut decision.  That decision was clear cut for several reasons.  I would hazard a guess that there were two very strong reasons.  The first was a clear perception by the voters that membership would be beneficial to our agricultural sector, which is very important because the increased income derived from agriculture percolating through the Community helps to generate employment and incomes. <Col N="911" /> That argument was a strong one and one which was understood by our people.</P>
    <P>It was notable that in the urban areas where there was, of course, the certainty that there would be some increase in prices brought about by membership, and the fact had to be faced in the referendum, these urban areas voted in favour of membership. The fact that our people grasped very readily the concept of the multiplier effect of farm spending and the fact that a more prosperous agriculture would benefit the whole community was clearly understood.  They were not taken in by the attractive idea, a natural way of thinking, that what is good for the farmer is bad for the townsman.  This is a very natural mode of thought because until recently there was not much economic growth anywhere and out of a static cake, such as existed in the past, if one got more someone else got less.  But the people in the urban areas grasped the particular point and I think that the benefits to come to and through agriculture were perceived as being important and that played an important part in the decision of our people.  The other thing which was important was probably the recognition, perhaps subconsciously, that membership would, in fact, change our relationship with the United Kingdom which has always been such an unduly close and polarised one and place us in a broader and more satisfactory context.  This, too, has, at an almost subconscious level, affected people's attitude to membership.</P>
    <P>Let me come back to the agricultural policy because here we face the fact, in the second year of membership, that Irish farmers suffered very severely in relation to the question of beef and cattle.  One should try to disentangle the role of the Community and its policies in this matter.  Generally speaking, the background to this problem was a shift in the supply demand relationship for beef and for meat generally an a worldwide basis. This is not something for which the Community was responsible.  The fact <Col N="912" /> that the expansion of beef production was faster than expected and the demand did not develop as rapidly and also the high prices over the period when we joined the Community put people off eating beef and reduced consumption.  This is not particularly a matter involving the Community because it is a world-wide problem.</P>
    <P>One has to say about the Community that the policy it had for beef, which was never tested in a situation of surplus, proved inadequate to meet the strains placed on it.  The beef policy of the Community and the intervention mechanism which it devised was parallel and similar to the mechanism employed for other products. It was not sufficiently appreciated that, first of all, there could be a surplus of beef.  There was a very deep-rooted belief that beef would be in deficit almost indefinitely.  Secondly, if there was a surplus of beef it is not a product which can be easily stored, like grain.  It requires special arrangements for storage and refrigeration. Therefore, even a small surplus of beef could over-strain the whole intervention mechanism.</P>
    <P>The Community can be faulted for having too simply and easily accepted that the arrangements which worked to cope with surpluses of other products, including butter, would work for beef.  They worked imperfectly but well in the case of butter and worked perfectly in the case of grain. It did not work satisfactorily in the case of beef.  Secondly, I think it is fair to say that the Community institutions and the Commission were insufficiently perceptive about the way in which the market was going and were inclined to encourage farmers to hold on to stocks at a time when it was much better for them to sell them.  The attempts which this Government made here to counteract that by trying to persuade our farmers to sell when prices were high did not prove effective because farmers tended to believe, I am afraid&mdash;in this case they turned out to be wrong&mdash;that the European Commission was a better guide than the Irish Government in relation to their policy in this respect. As the problem was a world problem <Col N="913" /> I can understand people thinking that the Community Commission, with all its expertise, was better equipped than the national Government to advise in this matter.  They were wrong and it was unfortunate that the advice the Government gave at that critical period, contrary to the advice given by the European Commission, was not taken more widely.</P>
    <P>These are the two criticisms we can make.  The beef policy of the Community was inadequate to stand the strains placed on it.  It was not envisaged with sufficient imagination when it was constructed.  Secondly, the actual forecasting mechanism of the Commission proved inadequate when it was put to the test.  However, the fact remains that were we not in the Community our position would have been utterly disastrous.  What the Community did, partly because of our pressure in the matter, although it would have happened in any event, was impose a ban on imports from outside the Community.  If Britain had joined and we had not joined our position would, of course, have been absolutely impossible at that time.</P>
    <P>One has to distinguish between the defects of the policy and the administration of it on the one hand and the fact that with all its defects nonetheless inside the Community, although our farmers had a very tough time last year, their position was many times better than it would have been if we were outside at that time.  If you take agriculture as a whole over those two years, and leave aside the special problem of beef, the benefits to the country from membership have been very great.  They have been evident in the way it has been possible to increase the price of milk over this period at a rate that has rendered it very remunerative for farmers.  The rate at which it has been possible to do this in this period, without undue strain to the Irish Exchequer, because of the extent to which the Community takes up the burden, is very important to realise.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of the financial effects of membership. When we joined the general expectation was that we would in our first year of membership secure something <Col N="914" /> like £30 million of benefits from membership.  This figure was mentioned in relation to the question of our ability to improve social welfare benefits in the discussion on that subject and, indeed, in the election campaign at the beginning of 1973.  The actual figures in this connection are of interest.  In 1973 we received not £30 million but £44.1 million in grants in outright payments from the Community, plus £11.3 million in loans, that is £55.4 million altogether.  Our payment to the Community in that year was £6.1 million so the net benefit was £49.3 million in sums approved for payment to us in that year.</P>
    <P>In 1974 the figures rose very sharply.  Grants received rose to £72.8 million, loans to £24.8 million, increasing by 65 per cent and 120 per cent respectively.  When you deduct the £7.5 million for the contribution we paid for membership the net benefit in 1974 in sums allocated to us in that year was £90.1 million.  That is incomplete because there are still £70.4 million of claims outstanding in the guidance section of FEOGA, quite a large proportion of which we will get in due course.  The actual gross amount we will eventually receive in 1974 will exceed £100 million.  The net amount will approach that figure.</P>
    <P>The actual payments lag a little. Instead of receiving £49.3 million in 1973 we received £39 million but that lag of £10 million was made up in 1974 when of the £90.1 million so far approved we received £99.5 million, in other words, almost £10 million extra postponed from the previous year.  The approved figures are a more accurate measurement of the trend and volume of aid than the actual cash payments which fluctuate a bit because of a lag in payment.  The fact is that in 1974 the net receipts from the Community will have lain between £90 million and £100 million.  I think the House will readily realise how difficult our position would have been last year if this money was not available, how many of the services we have been able to provide would have been cut or what enormous further increase in taxation would have been necessary to see us through.  From the <Col N="915" /> purely financial point of view Community membership has been of very great value.</P>
    <P>It is also highly significant that the ratio between what we contribute and what we get is great.  Paying £7.5 million last year we will have received the best part of £100 million, probably a little more when the accounts are finally closed.  This disproportion between what we pay and what we receive is of very clear benefit to us. We have to recognise the fact that all this has to come from the Exchequers of other people.  We are, from the point of view of other members, an expensive member to have.  The fact that our partners are having to pay out about £100 million of their taxpayers money to our benefit, which they would not have to pay if we were not a member, is something we should not forget.  We can take too easily for granted the fact that these benefits flow to our Exchequer and that the consumers of food, in Britain for example, have to pay much more for their food, because we are in the Community, than would otherwise be the case.</P>

      <P>The loans are £24.8 million, the grants £72.8 million, plus some proportion of the £7.4 million which is still outstanding and has not been settled.  Probably we will get something between £75 and £80 million in grants and £25 million in loans.  The taxpayers will have to fork out the £75 million to £80 million plus remunerations at home.  These are very substantial sums.  They impose on us a recognition of our obligations to the Community.  It is in matters of this kind that the contribution we can make to carrying out our duties of presidency effectively are important. <Col N="916" /> We can never be in the foreseeable future net contributors financially to the Community.  In the nature of things, in the nature of our level of GNP per head, our stage of economic development and geographical location, the transfers within the Community will tend to have to be always in our favour and as the years go by, with the introduction of regional policy&mdash; because all these figures are before regional policy came into existence&mdash; the transfers towards us will tend to rise rather than to fall.</P>
      <P>If we are going to ensure that this is done willingly and that there is not any local resentment against the fact that they have to contribute financially to our assistance on this scale, it is important that we, in the policies we adopt, should be constructive and positive and be seen to be helping the evolution of the Community.  I cannot emphasise this too much.</P>
      <P>We must not take these benefits for granted because certainly if we wish them not only to continue but to expand, if we expect and desire that in the next three-year period the regional policy will be on a larger scale and better orientated towards the real regional needs of the existing regional policy, then we must ensure that when we come to argue that case we will be arguing it not simply on the basis of a sore thumb or begging bowl but as a country which will be seen to have made as big a contribution as it could in terms of what it can offer to the Community in that period so that people will feel, well, maybe it does cost a bit to have Ireland in but it is worthwhile because Ireland is adding something to the Community; the policies adopted by the Irish Government are constructive and forward looking and when Ireland has a chance to do something, for example, the Presidency, it does its job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual effect eventually to us, in terms of tens of millions of pounds received, of our policy orientation and the way we actually handle ourselves in the Community, will be very great indeed and even if one has no sense of actual duty but thinks purely in material terms&mdash;and that we do not <Col N="917" /> and should not&mdash;it is materially in our interest in order to ensure a positive orientation to our future financial needs that we should play as constructive a part as possible in the Community. This has been uppermost in our minds during the past few years and certainly I have been conscious at every meeting I attend of the importance of this element.</P>
    <P>This means at times that it may be better for us not to press unduly a small not very important vital interest which might unduly irritate other people who might feel, well, the Irish are getting £100 million already and here they are now looking for the last £100,000 at our expense in a matter where they really do not need it that much.  One has to bear this in mind, that we have a strategy in our approach and that we must concentrate on the essential elements, the things that are of great importance and must try to avoid pressing our luck too far in matters. That has been our policy and it has notably paid off over this period. It has paid off materially and paid off in terms of the esteem in which this country is now held.</P>
    <P>One has to bear in mind in all this that these two years of membership have been years in which the headlines of Europe when they have mentioned Ireland have mentioned it usually in much less fortunate and indeed usually a tragic context.  The fact that we have been able to build up so much goodwill and to become accepted as a worthwhile and useful member at a time when most of what the newspaper readers of Europe see about Ireland is certainly damaging to our interests and to our image is something of an achievement.  There could not have been a worse time at which to have established Ireland's name in the councils of the nations of Europe and to make it stand high. There could not have been a more difficult time to attempt that task than this period and we have, by and large, accomplished it.</P>
    <P>This, of course, also has its possible relevance in the future to the question of Northern Ireland itself and the fact that we have won goodwill in the Community in other matters may stand to us in the future if at any <Col N="918" /> stage the problem of Northern Ireland becomes one that can no longer be fully coped with within these islands.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the summit in Paris and to the heads of Governments meeting in Dublin and to deal with some of the issues raised there and to bring the House up to date with developments.</P>
    <P>The summit in Paris, of course, settled regional policy.  I do not need to go over that old ground again.  We did succeed in getting a further tapping-up of our share at that meeting, in what were necessarily difficult conditions.  We did not hide our disappointment at the size of the fund which was notably smaller than it should have been.  What we could say, and say with some pride, was that we did succeed by our efforts in increasing the Irish share by two-thirds.  So, the drastic reduction in the size of the fund had no adverse financial effect for us in this period.  I would much prefer to have got two-thirds more out of the full regional fund rather than the reduced fund but the fact that we were able to increase our share in this way proved of great importance to us in maintaining the amount.  Whereas all other countries had their absolute amounts reduced by between 40 per cent and 60 per cent, we effectively maintained ours.</P>
    <P>The other notable feature of the summit was the decision about direct elections to the European Parliament and about more power to the European Parliament, the discussion of the economic situation and the establishment of the regular meetings of heads of Governments.</P>
    <P>On direct elections, it was of course on our proposal that the date for direct elections was brought forward from 1980-onwards to 1978-onwards and it is our hope that this can be maintained but we also stressed that there is no point in having direct elections if the powers of the Parliament are not increased at the same time.  The powers of the Parliament will not easily be increased to what they should be unless the Parliament gets its authority directly from the people of Europe.  You have here a circular situation and it is our policy to press ahead on both fronts.  We will <Col N="919" /> have to consider soon this question of direct elections.  This is something which now is before the Council of Ministers in the form of a report on the European Parliament.  It is something that the Council of Ministers will be considering, probably not in any great depth during the Irish Presidency, but later on this year and next year.</P>
    <P>We in this country should begin to consider seriously what is proposed in this report and whether it is acceptable or not.  It is something which Parliament, above all, will need to consider.  Whether this is best done on the floor of the House or by an extension of the functions&mdash;and it may need an extension of the functions&mdash; of the Committee on Secondary Legislation is something on which I personally have an open mind and I am sure the Government have too.  It would be important that before we reach the stage where the Government have to take up a position in the Council of Ministers in this matter that we would have the views of the House and know what the Dáil thinks about this matter.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the dual mandate and the extent to which now or in the future it will be possible for people effectively to carry on the dual role of Member of the European Parliament and Member of this Parliament.  I certainly have been impressed by the extraordinary strain which is imposed at present by this dual mandate, made all the worse by the fact that for a small country with so few members every Member of the Parliament in this country has to be a member of normally two or three committees of the Parliament as well.</P>
    <P>It may be possible, although a great strain, for people over a period to sustain membership of this Parliament and of the European Parliament if they do not have to be members of committees but those members of committees, who may have to have the requirement to attend meetings altogether up to 35 times or even 40 times a year, if they are members of several committees, have an impossible burden imposed on them.  It is an impossible burden to <Col N="920" /> impose on persons who are supposed to be also undertaking their duties in this Parliament and, above all, in their constituencies, if they are going to be re-elected, which is a natural and understandable ambition of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>The question of the dual mandate needs to be looked at very carefully.  It is made all the more difficult in our case by the particular provision in our electoral system which people rightly treasure so much, the multi-seat constituency and the choice given in these constituencies between members of the same party, which is a thing which our people are attached to.  They have said so twice very firmly.  They would like to be able to choose not merely between parties but between members of parties and they do so generally considerately, at times a little harshly. This means that a Deputy in a constituency who has to attend the European Parliament and attend his duties there as assiduously as he should in the interests of this country and in the interests of Europe, may be away so much that another aspiring Deputy in the constituency may be able to move in very rapidly on his heels and of course if this is seen to happen in an election and if several Members of the European Parliament lose their seats or even lose ground, the enthusiasm of people or willingness of people to become members of the European Parliament while Members of this House will be rapidly diminished.</P>
    <P>It is consciousness of this very real practical political danger which has given us an extra incentive in Ireland to press for early direct elections so that hopefully&mdash;the exact date has to be worked out&mdash;at worst there would be only one other election under the present arrangement, which involves the selection of people from this Parliament to sit in the European Parliament. I have always been attracted personally to the idea of a mixed system such as was proposed in 1960 by the European Parliament for an interim stage lasting for the duration of only one Parliament, that is, a system under which, say, one-third of the members of the European Parliament <Col N="921" /> would be selected from membership of the Parliaments of member countries and two-thirds would be directly elected.</P>
    <P>The directly elected members&mdash;this is as I envisaged it because it was not stated in the proposal&mdash;would take on the burden of committee work while the indirectly elected members selected from both Houses would provide a link between the two Parliaments, which is important.  It is too much to try to do both but a mixed system such as I have described could do that work.  This is a personal view; I am not offering it as a Government view because the Government have not considered the matter at this stage. We should begin to consider all these matters in this House so that when the report comes before the Council of Ministers the Government may be fully informed about the views of the House.</P>
    <P>The economic situation was considered at the summit meeting last December in Paris.  There was a sharp switch of views by some countries.  It was recognised there was a serious economic crisis looming and that our policy should be directed towards reflation and the maintenance of employment rather than primarily against inflation.  At the recent Dublin meeting the same emphasis emerged; the same concern was demonstrated and the same solidarity within the Community in favour of policies regarding the maintenance of growth in employment was observable.  The same concern was also to be noted that the evolution of the situation in the United States was not such as to encourage us to feel the world economy could continue to move ahead unless there was a bigger change in policy in that country.</P>
    <P>After the Paris summit, President Giscard d'Estaing had the opportunity to discuss this aspect of the problem with the President of the United States and further discussions of this kind may be necessary in the future. If Europe and the United States are pursuing divergent economic policies this can only be damaging.  It must be said that although the weight of Europe may be great in the world because <Col N="922" /> of its enormous importance in world trade, by its own actions Europe cannot keep the whole world economy afloat if the policies pursued by the United States are leading towards recession.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the importance of securing and maintaining a convergence of economic policies not only within the Community but between the Community and the United States remains almost the major pre-occupation of European leaders at this time.  Perhaps the extent to which we are dependent on this is not sufficiently appreciated here.  Our ability to keep our economy moving ahead obviously depends very much of what is happening in Europe and Europe's ability to keep its economies moving ahead as a whole depends very much on what is happening in the United States.  Perhaps the most important thing for all of us is not any action we can take internally at present to deal with employment but any action we can take externally to ensure the policy of the United States is one that will maintain economic growth there and ensure that the world economy as a whole is moving ahead.</P>
    <P>The other matter dealt with at the Paris summit was the establishment of the new system of heads of Government meetings, the first of which took place in Dublin.  I have dealt with one aspect of this already&mdash;the divergence of views between ourselves and the French Government at one point about the actual form of the meetings but this was rapidly resolved.</P>
    <P>The institution of these new meetings is a matter about which divergent views have been expressed.  We believe they can be extremely useful but there are also certain possible dangers associated with them.  If, in fact, the meetings of heads of Governments were to take decisions on matters to do with the European Community in a manner that was incompatible with the Community decision-making system, real difficulties could arise.  We believe these dangers have been recognised by all the countries concerned and although in one respect the pattern of the first meeting in Dublin may prove unusual and will not be a precedent <Col N="923" /> for the future&mdash;I am referring to the handling of the British problem&mdash; nevertheless we have enough experience from that to say these meetings are capable of operating in a way that can help the Community to develop and need not threaten the institutional framework or the system of decision-making that is established.</P>
    <P>What I think will tend to happen at these meetings&mdash;based on the Dublin precedent&mdash;is that the heads of Governments will concentrate on major issues of policy on which they will give general orientations, leaving the decision-making procedure to be followed through in the ordinary way. The topics discussed in Dublin tend to validate this view.  In addition to the British problem, to which I shall refer again, the heads of Governments discussed energy in relation to the producer-consumer conference, raw materials, the economic situation and certain political issues, notably the conference on security co-operation in Europe.</P>
    <P>In these matters they did not take specific concrete decisions.  They indicated the way their minds were moving and they encouraged their Foreign Ministers to pursue their work along certain lines.  For example, in the case of energy they decided it was desirable to secure, if possible, a concerted approach to the producer-consumer conference that will take place during this year.  For that purpose they suggested an <i>ad hoc</i> committee of senior officials to be established by the Council of Foreign Ministers and to work with them to try to get a concerted Community position at the conference.  The work of carrying that through and of deciding on the composition is a matter for the Council of Ministers, but the impetus to tackle the problem in this way came from the heads of Governments.  It seems to me the system of Community competence that has been established can be preserved if the heads of Governments operate along these lines at their meetings, and this is the intention.</P>
    <P>The British negotiation was, in fact, a somewhat unusual feature of the <Col N="924" /> meeting because it involved the heads of Governments in considering very practical and concrete matters of figures and it involved rather detailed considerations of a kind with which the heads of Governments would not normally concern themselves.  This was necessary in this instance and it produced positive results.  I think the intention is that the heads of Governments will generally concern themselves with overall policy orientation rather than with specific matters of decision-making.</P>
    <P>There was a general view that the Council of Ministers should endeavour to settle their own problems themselves, that they should not fail to reach agreement and refer matters to a kind of court of appeal of heads of Government.  This could clog up the working of meetings of heads of Government and it could render abortive the system of meetings of the Council of Ministers.  There is general agreement on this.  We can see the shape the new system will take and I think most people are reasonably happy about it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the British renegotiation so-called, I need not go into details about it because the House is aware of the results of the discussions. Because of our particular relationship with the United Kingdom we had a strong interest in Britain remaining a member of the Community.  We will remain a member even if Britain leaves the Community, but that would involve a disruption of our trade with Britain which could be quite serious and could have a significant impact on our economy.  It would also involve a disruption of relations between North and South.  Therefore, we would prefer to avoid that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain to the House the implications of the British renegotiation in relation to the export of dairy products from New Zealand to Britain and what effect it would have on the Irish export market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, as the Deputy has raised that point, within the limits of my competence in a somewhat specialised field, I will do <Col N="925" /> so.  The agreement there relates to the continued importation of a certain quantity of butter from New Zealand in the years immediately ahead.  The Deputy will recall that under Protocol No. 18 of the original agreement provision was made for a diminishing quantity of butter and cheese to be imported, cheese to be phased out, however, after a certain period of years, in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>And powdered products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it relates to these two products only.  It was suggested by the British Government that the provision for the total phasing out of cheese, as part of the preferential arrangement with New Zealand, should be reconsidered.  That was not agreed because in fact it would have required an amendment of the treaty, which would have had to go to Parliaments of member countries, and it was not considered that it was worth attempting that, especially as the amount involved was small and did not seem to be a matter of very great concern to the New Zealand Government. What has been agreed is that, on the arrangement in regard to butter, this will be continued on a smaller scale, as envisaged in Protocol 18, as originally drafted, with a provision of prices which would take account both of the costs in New Zealand and of intervention prices in the Community.  This will ensure that New Zealand will be able to continue to export a certain amount of butter to the Community during the three years after the end of the first phase under Protocol 18.  The amounts involved, in our view, are not such as to create significant problems for us, and the fact that cheese is excluded from the preferential arrangement was something that we were, naturally, concerned to ensure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, on cheese, the question of the problem posed for New Zealand, in so far as there is a problem by the termination of cheese exports, is to be looked at.  But, in looking at it, there can be no question of a new preferential arrangement.  The only thing that is theoretically possible, <Col N="926" /> should it prove to be necessary and could be looked at, I suppose, arises from the arrangement under which the Community can, in regard to its overall import regime, make any adjustment <i>vis-à-vis</i> the world in general. This was done in respect of cheddar cheese under the GATT negotiations, under the 24/6, arising from the enlargement of the Community and in fact a small quota for cheddar cheese was opened which operates to the benefit, in practice, of Canada.  Something similar could, theoretically, be done in regard to New Zealand cheese but it would not be possible to make it a preferential arrangement for New Zealand.  It would have to involve some adjustment of the overall cheese regime of which some other country might take advantage rather than New Zealand.  I am not certain that such would be attempted at all and, if it is, the amount involved would be very small and would be an imperceptible part of the total Community cheese market, so that our cheese producers have nothing to fear from that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>The IFA are thinking along different lines.  Is it true that New Zealanders failed to fulfil their quota to the British market, under the Treaty of Accession last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>Of butter and cheese.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to answer a question without being sure of the answer.  Therefore, perhaps I had better leave that until I get advice on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that the shortfall to the British market by New Zealanders was diverted elsewhere to other markets, with particular reference to South-East Asia, and that they are forcing the Irish butter and cheese exporting industries out of these markets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is widening the debate beyond the area with which I am competent to deal, beyond the area that arises for debate, and beyond the area of what was <Col N="927" /> decided at the summit.  The question the Deputy is entitled to ask about the summit is: what did it do about New Zealand cheese after 1977?  The answer is that it said there would be no change, no extension of the protocol, no preferential arrangement. What is left open for consideration is whether there will be any adjustment in the total import quota arrangements of the Community as a whole, of a non-preferential character, if there is a real New Zealand problem to be looked at.  I rather doubt that that would come about and the amount involved and spoken of at the meeting was, in any event, 10,000 tons, which is a negligible amount, and which will not be available preferentially to New Zealand.  It may never arise and the amount involved is very small.  Therefore, from the point of view of anything arising at that meeting as far as cheese was concerned, it has no perceptible impact on and creates no danger to the Irish cheese industry.  Of course, New Zealand exports of cheese to other parts of the world may create problems for us in other parts of the world.  That was not something with which that particular meeting could deal.  It is something which probably lies outside the framework of anything the Community can deal with. On the other hand, it is fair to say that the Community did&mdash;conscious of this problem&mdash;make provision, in the statement after the summit, to look for even closer co-operation between the institutions of the Community and the New Zealand authorities with the object of promoting, in their mutual interest, an orderly operation of world markets.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the problem the Deputy mentioned is envisaged as something which can be looked at but something which can be looked at only if the two sides want to look at it together. The Community are willing to look into this matter with New Zealand and this could be of help, if New Zealand is willing to wait, and could be of assistance to this country in straightening out problems that could arise in other markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="928" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that we should not have allowed this to happen, in view of this extension of the New Zealand concession beyond the date of the protocol.  There is an extension of the concession to New Zealand in so far as the importation of its dairy produce into Britain is concerned.  We should not have allowed this, in view of the fact that last year New Zealand failed to fulfil its quota of both butter and cheese.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no extension of the arrangement for cheese under Protocol 18.  There cannot be without amendment of the treaty and everybody was agreed there should be no amendment to the treaty.  There is no extension of that concession.  There is provision to discuss with New Zealand orderly marketing, and this could be to our advantage.  The possibility exists but no decision was taken on it, of an adjustment in the Community's overall, non-discriminatory quotas for cheese.  If that ever came up, it would be on so small a scale as to be negligible from our point of view.</P>
      <P>On the question of butter, Protocol 18 always envisaged that there would be continued access, on a degressive, reducing basis, for New Zealand butter to the British market.  In any event, this had to be determined later this year.  All that has happened is that we have looked at it a few months earlier than was necessary and that New Zealand, therefore, knows what amount it will be allowed to bring in in the following three years.  The amount is one which is within the limits of what we find acceptable.  In this negotiation we had our own target to ensure that the amount of New Zealand butter allowed in would not be too great but, at the same time, it had to be a reasonable figure, under the terms of Protocol 18, and we are satisfied with the outcome of that negotiation. I think that deals fairly fully with the point the Deputy very properly raised on this issue, which is one of the things perhaps which concerned us particularly in this recent discussion in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> The other matters discussed at this meeting included the question of raw materials where there was a preliminary discussion amongst heads of Governments on this question, because of the instability of raw material prices which creates great problems both for the Community and for the developing countries.  There is also the fact that for certain key raw materials, the Community is dependent on a very small group of suppliers who could disrupt our access to these products.  Therefore, there is a mutual interest between ourselves and the supplying countries in improving the arrangements for trade in raw materials.  On that there was merely preliminary discussion and it is a matter certainly to which we shall have to return.</P>
    <P>However, it is the Community's view that the question of raw materials should not be introduced into the consumer-producer conference to take place later this year because that conference is designed to deal with energy and economic problems arising directly from the difficulties that have arisen in regard to oil. The composition of the preparatory meeting to be held on 7th April next &mdash;and indeed as proposed by the oil producers themselves&mdash;is designed to be appropriate to that particular subject. The four material producers to be represented there are all oil producers who have not in fact produced any significant amount of other raw materials.  Therefore, that conference would be an inappropriate place to discuss the question of raw materials other than of oil.  That does not mean that that problem should be left on one side.  It will certainly have to be considered further and is something which the Foreign Ministers will be studying and coming back to their heads of Government about before long, with some ideas as to how world trade in raw materials could be improved and made more stable.  Those, then, are the main points dealt with at the heads of Government meeting.</P>
    <P>In concluding, I want to turn for a moment to the mission conferred on the Prime Minister of Belgium, Monsieur Tindemans, by the Paris Summit.  M. Tindemans was there <Col N="930" /> asked to undertake a process of consultations with a wide range of interests throughout Europe to try to see how we could best move towards a closer union within the Community, towards this vague objective of European union so christened at the earlier Paris Summit in 1972 but never made explicit or clear.</P>
    <P>The idea of conferring on one individual a mission of this kind seemed to me&mdash;and this was the Taoiseach's view also&mdash;an excellent idea.  There are some things that are not well done by committees, some tasks which are better done by one man taking them on.  Here there is a difficult task to be done, a task of trying to consult with all the different interests in the different member countries and to get some picture of how, not just the heads of Government, but the people of Europe envisage the Community developing, how they would like it to develop, what dangers they see in its development, and what opportunities they see.</P>
    <P>M. Tindemans has very gallantly, on top of his commitments as Prime Minister of Belgium, taken on this task.  He has already started work on it and will be starting his visit to member countries very soon.  He will be coming to this country for this purpose within the next few weeks.  The intention is that he should meet with representatives of the political parties, representatives of the farming community, representatives of women, students, and other groups in the community, with a view to getting as wide a picture as possible of the wishes of the Irish people in regard to this matter.  We are enthusiastic about this and have offered him every facility to make these contacts.  I have personally made initial arrangements for him to have as wide a range of contacts as possible when he comes here.</P>
    <P>I have also arranged that his visit should coincide with a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Nine who are coming to spend a weekend here to discuss in a relaxed atmosphere some of our longer-term problems away from the pressures of a council meeting where there are decisions to be taken and deadlines to <Col N="931" /> be met. M. Tindemans will be able both to initiate his work of consultation with public opinion in this country and also to have an informal discussion with the Foreign Ministers of the Nine about his mission on the same occasions.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have had the opportunity of assessing M. Tindemans with his mission at this point.  We shall be very interested, indeed, to see how it develops and the proposals that come forward from this very widespread and unprecedented consultation of European public opinion.  The Community is rightly criticised at times because its channels of communication through public opinion are too clogged.  It does not always manage to communicate what it is about to the people of Europe and it certainly does not always appear to be effective at listening to or seeking out the views of the people of Europe about the way Europe should be run. This experiment of really trying to find out what people are thinking and what they want, so that the shaping of Europe by the Governments together in the Council of Ministers and at meetings of heads of Government can correspond to the real desires and wishes of the people of Europe, is something hopeful and encouraging, and we are very glad that it falls to us to assist this process at a very early stage.</P>
    <P>The intention is that M. Tindemans will report, perhaps, towards the end of this year on the result of his consultations, and then the heads of Government and Foreign Ministers will have to consider what action they propose to take with a view to ensuring an evolution of Europe towards the goals to which the people of the nine countries of Europe aspire.</P>
    <P>The present structure of the Community was designed for a particular purpose, in order to undertake the task of bringing the members countries together, of developing common policies.  The particular structure&mdash; with a commission with powers of initiative and administrative powers but separate from the Council of Ministers, <Col N="932" /> which has the decision-making powers and which does not correspond to the Governmental structure of a normal state&mdash;was designed to meet the needs of a period of evolution and change.  It was felt necessary to give the European Commission, a body which is not, except in a very vague way, directly responsible to parliamentary control, very important powers of initiative.  This was done in the period of development of the Community because of the recognition that unless some dynamic element of an abnormal character like this was introduced the Community might never evolve.  The structure of government in the Community is not necessarily one appropriate to a community that has evolved to an important stage, and certainly by the 1980s this system of government may prove inadequate.</P>
    <P>When we talk about European union, we talk about the question of where we go from here.  As the Community reaches a certain stage of development&mdash;completion is probably too strong a word&mdash;where it has a certain stability and where the problems of running the Community are beginning to take precedence over the problems of creating the community, then at that point we must rethink the governmental structure.  At that point certainly we shall need a structure which will be much more sensitive to public opinion through parliamentary control than at present.</P>
    <P>Therefore, our timetable is that we should start the process of strengthening parliamentary control within the present structure in 1978 but that we should, at the same time, be planning a further stage of development which might mean a radical reform of the institutions of the Community and a much stronger element of parliamentary control to come into effect some time, perhaps, in the early 1980s. M. Tindeman's job is to sketch out how this latter stage might be reached and what type of institutions might be needed at that time.  This he will do, reflecting the views of the people of Europe as he will try to collect them in the course of these visits.</P>
    <P>I thought I should say something to the House about that aspect of the Community's development because <Col N="933" /> since his appointment to this task, perhaps, his mission has not received sufficient publicity.  As he will be visiting this country and starting his work here within a few weeks, it is important that the people should know this is going to happen and that the various bodies representing different sections of public opinion will have opportunities to put forward their views to him.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Herbert for figures about the extent to which New Zealand had delivered butter and cheese within its quotas.  Deputy Herbert is quite right, that it did not in the last couple of years deliver the full quota.  The butter quota for 1973 was 165,811 tons, and they delivered 129,872.  In 1974 the butter quota was 158,902 tons, and they delivered 129,724.  There is a significant shortfall in the delivery of butter.  In the case of cheese it is even more significant. The quota in 1973 was 68,580; delivery, 46,597.  In 1974 the quota was 60,906 tons; delivery, 18,870, a very marked shortfall, as Deputy Herbert pointed out.</P>
    <P>With that factual clarification, I hope I have dealt with the various points which Deputies opposite have raised and which fall within my ambit. As I have said, the Parliamentary Secretary himself will be replying to the debate fully at its conclusion and dealing with the various points that have been raised.  I am glad to have this chance of contributing to the debate and that my European schedule during the presidency has not been such as to keep me away for the whole of the debate.  It would have been, from my point of view, unfortunate if I had not had the opportunity of contributing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a few questions?  The Minister dealt at some length with the position in regard to direct elections which he expects to take place in 1978.  Could he tell us, first of all, the type of voting system that will be used in this country, because of course there are different voting patterns in different countries, the straight vote in England, PR here?  Will we be voting here under the PR system for the direct <Col N="934" /> elections?  Will we have multi-seat or single-seat constituencies?  As to the type of constituency the Minister envisages, will voting be on a regional basis, something like the health board system, midland region, western region and so on?  Will we be voting in amalgamated constituencies?  The Minister said he anticipated that a debate will take place here involving all parties.  As voting will take place in 1978, could the Minister, at this stage&mdash;I know the pressures on the Government with a great deal of legislation ready to come before the House&mdash;say when the debate is likely to take place?</P>

      <P>On the last point, I could not say at present because it will depend on the timetable that will be adopted for the consideration of the report from the Council of Ministers. Logically, the debate should take place before the Council of Ministers get dug into the problem if it is to be of any use to the Government. This may not be for some months yet; it is not an imminent matter.  Therefore, it may well be in the second half rather than the first half of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other points, some of these are the very matters we want to have discussed and which will be discussed by the Council of Ministers because they are open questions.  I am not certain about the voting system.  I have had difficulty in interpreting the wording here.  The proposals that have been drawn up by the European Parliament talk of a uniform electoral system but I am not clear what exactly the implications of that are, whether it means we must have precisely the same system in each member State or whether any variation will be permitted.  This is something we shall have to examine and we shall make up our minds as to what we want to achieve and then press for it.  If there were to be literally a uniform voting system everywhere we would have to face the fact that our system exists in Ireland only and nowhere else and I could not guarantee that the Irish Government would be successful in persuading the other eight to adopt our system. <Col N="935" /> There may have to be some sort of compromise on something which is more commonly accepted.  Obviously, we feel that our system has great merit but all these are open questions and they will have to be considered in due course.</P>

      <P>It is a rather strange procedure, and one that rather startled me, that allows a Minister to come in as an ordinary contributor to a very important debate such as this, concerning his own Department.  It is an affront to the remaining speakers in the debate which could last for many weeks.  It seems that it is the Parliamentary Secretary and not the Minister who will reply to the debate.  I think what the Minister did just now is unprecedented but it is typical of the Government's treatment of their EEC responsibilities.  The discussion on the Third and Fourth Reports comes rather late when one considers that the Third Report was circulated before the Summer Recess last year and is only now being debated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have thought the bi-annual debate on our EEC involvement should take precedence over everything else after the annual budget debate.  It displays indifference and lack of concern to have it deferred until now.  This attitude seems to me, on my casual observations, to percolate from the Government down to the grass roots at local authority level. I detect an appalling unawareness and a tremendous amount of ignorance at local authority level <i>vis-à-vis</i> our European involvement especially among local representatives and executives of local authorities.  I should have thought that with our accession to Europe&mdash;this may appear paradoxical &mdash;this type of centralised supranational structure, local government would play a role of increasing importance <Col N="936" /> in our continuing membership of the EEC.  In the implementation of the important directives relating to agriculture, it is the county committee of agriculture that is involved.  Also, I should have thought that a new field of involvement would open to local authorities in the implementation of regional policy.  I hope that will be the case and that the implementation of regional policy will not be left in the hands of Merrion Street bureaucrats.</P>
      <P>This total indifference is largely due to the failure of the Government to exploit to its fullest the potential of our European membership and the failure of our Ministers at the Council to protect our vital national interests. To quote the Minister, we have only very few vital national interests to protect but few though they may be, we have failed to protect them. We have seen the failure of the Ministers to use their powers of initiative and veto.  We had the example of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries during last year's beef crisis.  We have just heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs again using the ploy of blaming Brussels, blaming Agricultural Commissioner Lardinois.  This is reprehensible coming from the President in Office of the Council of Ministers when he knows that the blame must lie fairly and squarely on the present Government but with particular reference to the ineptitude of our Ministers at the council table, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall 13 months ago when the European Parliament was requested by the Council to give its opinion on the important question of agriculture. This was in late 1973.  The European Parliament expressed grave and great concern at the continued importation of beef from third countries, specially from Comicon countries.  We appreciated that GATT countries had to be accommodated but this amounted only to some 34,000 tons.  We have pointed out that Ireland being the only beef exporting country of the nine should receive Community preference <Col N="937" /> and, so long as we had a pound of beef to export, the frontiers should have remained closed.</P>
    <P>We further pointed out that an upset in the beef market here would have a very, very serious effect on the store cattle trade and that, in turn, would have a very, very serious effect on our entire economy.  No heed was taken of these warnings.  We asked the Council to close the frontiers to the importation of beef from third countries, but no action was taken. We further asked the Council in December, 1973, to introduce the green £ but again, due to the internal situation in the Government here at home the Minister was reluctant to do so despite the fact that Commissioner Lardinois told me he would be amenable to the introduction of the green £.  The Minister allowed Britain to opt out of intervention knowing that would have a serious effect on the beef trade.  The blame for the agricultural beef prices last year and this year lies fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and, to a lesser extent, on the shoulders of both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister had two basic powers &mdash;the power of initiative and the power of veto.  He used neither.  I appreciate the fact that the veto should be used only as a last resort when a vital national interest is at stake.  The House will agree that the beef industry is a very vital national interest.  I believe it certainly falls into that classification.  With regard to the power of initiative, the Minister must exercise this power at every available opportunity in the Council for the protection of the country's vital national interests.  He must further ensure that the country is also protected at COPER level.  It is the duty of the Minister to inform the Commission of trends affecting the national interests for the purpose of promoting policies which will prevent a problem escalating.  The Minister failed to do that.</P>
    <P>We heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs talk about matters outside our control, market shifts and so on. <Col N="938" /> Surely these things do not happen overnight.  Surely these are things evolving over long periods of months. Surely the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was able at least to monitor what was happening in the Community.  I was amazed to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs adopt the ploy of blaming Brussels. That comes ill, indeed, from him. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries failed in his duty last year to protect our beef producers.  He failed to close the frontiers of the EEC to third countries.  He failed in the green £.  He allowed Britain to opt out of intervention.</P>
    <P>I heard it said by Government spokesmen in the Galway by-election that Ireland was not alone in this respect, that the farmers in other Community countries were equally adversely affected.  That is quite true.  But agriculture is not as vital to Germany, Belgium, Holland, Denmark or France as it is to Ireland.  If one looks at the table one sees the percentage of people employed in agriculture in the member states: Germany, 7.5 per cent; France, 12.2 per cent; Italy, 17.4 per cent; the Netherlands, 6.8 per cent; Belgium, 3.9 per cent; Luxembourg, 9 per cent; the United Kingdom, 3 per cent; Denmark, 9 per cent and Ireland 25 per cent. Another 30 per cent can be added to the 25 per cent engaged or involved directly in agriculture in this country. Of our entire labour force 60 per cent is involved in one way or another in agriculture.  Surely then agriculture is a vital national interest and should have been protected last year.  The ploy of blaming Brussels has worn very thin. I am convinced that the import into Britain of New Zealand butter and cheese&mdash;and this is the outcome of the British renegotiation&mdash;will have a very, very serious effect on our butter and cheese markets.  I am told it will force us into intervention next year. The Minister seems to think it will have no adverse effect.  That is what he thought last year also in relation to beef.</P>
    <P>The net result of the ineptitude of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries last year has been the gross depletion of our national herds because <Col N="939" /> of the doubling with the slaughter of cows in 1974.  We are now witnessing 1,100 calves of high quality being air-lifted from Shannon and Cork every week for the past ten weeks to Italy. These calves should be fattened at home and converted into beef on Irish pastures instead of being exported to Italy at £15 per skull.  Is it any wonder that the enthusiasm which marked our accession to the Common Market has now almost disappeared completely? The small farmers are growing smaller and poorer, but the rich are growing richer.  That philosophy is very close to the Minister's heart because, by tradition, Fine Gael is the party of the big farmer.  Perhaps that is the explanation of the Government's attitude.</P>
    <P>In relation to the creation of employment, another vital national interest, it has been validly pointed out that we have failed in our basic duty to protect employment in our highly sensitive industries, those industries that have proved so vulnerable in the CIO reports in the early 1960s.</P>
    <P>Those industries should have received protection during our transition period.  There is a certain mechanism built into our treaty of accession and also into the AIF, which protects those industries, but this mechanism was not activated and remedial action was not taken.  Under our treaty of accession to the EEC after taking remedial action all we are required to do is to seek <i>post factum</i> approval from the Commission.  We have failed to do this and we have failed to protect our national interests in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs met with limited success in relation to the regional fund in that it is off the ground at last.  He is not without blame because he remained silent from 4th March, 1974 to the Paris summit in December.  During this period of seven months silence the Minister failed to take any initiative to get the regional fund off the ground. We eagerly await the implementation of the regional fund.  The Minister gave a very brief outline of what may happen but there are many question marks in relation to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> Deputies in the European Parliament, who have an interest in the regional policy and who are watchdogs for the people living in the depressed regions of the country, expected a meaningful regional fund would be the basis for a realistic regional policy but this has not happened. What has been achieved?  Now that the clamour of the Paris summit has died down, the ambiguity of the Communiqué has been sorted out and the Ministers' threat of veto did not arise, what type of fund have we got?</P>
    <P>I would like to give the House an idea of the thinking of the European Parliament in relation to this fund, as reflected in a contribution I made in Strasbourg last week when I stated:</P>
    <P>The European Communities finally have a regional fund.  In the next few days the Council of Ministers will formally adopt the texts we are discussing today.  After two years of discussions it is a relief to have something decided on at last.  Commissioner Thomson must be congratulated for his consistent efforts over the last two years.  His original proposals were endorsed by this Parliament.  They contained the basic needs of a realistic regional fund for the European Community. Unfortunately the Council of Ministers did not share his views.  He must be praised for his courage in fighting the Council in the defence of the needs of the underdeveloped regions in the Community.  He must be very disappointed with what is left today of his original proposals.</P>
    <P>We in this Parliament share this disappointment.  We, too, expected a realistic European Regional Fund that would correct the regional imbalances in the Community.  In the many debates in this House and in the Committee for Regional Policy and Transport Parliament was consistent in demanding a regional policy and a regional fund which would counteract the imbalances and revitalise the depressed regions.</P>
    <P>The regional fund we are faced with now, as embodied in the new texts, contains nothing of the spirit expressed at the Paris summit of October, 1972, a spirit <Col N="941" /> which was reflected in Commissioner Thomson's proposals and approved in Mr. Delmotte's report. What should have been a great day for Europe is now a bitter anticlimax. The Community has lost its credibility among the people who needed the benefits of a realistic fund and who expected so much from it.</P>
    <P>The fund we will have for the next three years can in no way be regarded as a Community fund.  It can be summarised as a system of subsidising national aids.  The power of control rests effectively with the member state Governments to the exclusion of the Commission. The fund is not directed at the correction of Community imbalances.</P>
    <P>Instead its aim is to correct national imbalances.  Even though aid is to go to national priority areas, which naturally enough are less developed areas, there can be no comparison between the less developed areas of some member states, such as Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands on the one hand, and those of Italy and Ireland on the other hand.  I think it is fair to say that some of the developed areas of Ireland are worse off than some of the less developed areas of other member states.  On these grounds I have to condemn the method of granting aid from the regional fund based on national criteria rather than on Community criteria.</P>
    <P>There is no real concentration of funds in the worst off areas.  The predetermination of the share-out of the funds makes the regional fund look like a hollow gesture reeking of <i>juste retour.</i></P>
    <P>The system of payment of aid from the regional fund to the member states lends itself to abuse by the Governments in that they can substitute national aid funds by Community aid funds.  This could result in no extra funds being available for regional development projects.</P>
    <P>This is contrary to the philosophy of the regional fund articulated by <Col N="942" /> Commissioner Thomson in his basic report and in his many statements in committee and plenary.  There now exists a great danger of regional fund allocations being hidden and absorbed in the central funds of member states.  The morality of this is questionable.  This Parliament has consistantly emphasised that Community aid must supplement rather than replace national aid.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fact that Community funds can be swallowed up in Central Government funds and in relation to the application of regional aid there is a strong possibility that the regional fund can be swallowed up in the Road Fund so that it could go to the decongestion of traffic in Dublin city rather than providing a basic much-needed infrastructure for the worst developed areas of the country.  Knowing that the Government is orientated towards Dublin, knowing that the vast majority of Government Ministers come from within the Pale, knowing the carve-up of the constituencies, knowing that the result of the next election will be affected by this, we realise that there is a probability that the aid will be concentrated on the decongestion of Dublin rather than in providing the much needed basic infrastructure for the less developed areas.</P>
    <P>The proper allocation of the regional fund should generate a global expenditure of £100 million over a three-year period.  When one considers that the grant to infrastructure projects is approximately one-third, that two-thirds must be put up by the member state, it means that our allocation of £35 million over a three-year period should generate a global expenditure of £100 million.  It will be interesting to see if this will happen.</P>

      <P>I am almost finished. I just want to give the House the reaction of the European Parliament which is a rather important institution of the Community, to the new regional fund and particularly to the regulations, after hearing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy FitzGerald, speaking at length and lauding the new fund.  I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this moment we feel we must submit to the blackmail of the Council of Ministers.  If we are to have a regional fund then a small and a bad one is better than no fund at all.  Our hands are tied at the moment and at least for the next three years.  This Parliament can criticise and condemn the texts <Col N="944" /> but we must accept them.  We cannot be responsible for any further unnecessary delays in implementing a decision which has already been decided.  That is the dilemma which this Parliament faces.  However, we must continue to criticise the shambles of a regional fund which we will have until 1978.  Our criticism must be directed at achieving the type of regional fund we endorsed in the first Delmotte Report.</P>
    <P>That was my contribution in the Parliament last week and I did not make it without having reason.  I gave it very serious thought.</P>
    <P>This speech was to me a bitter anticlimax to two years of hard work and a deep committedness to the philosophy of a genuine regional fund, a policy aimed at the revitalisation of our depressed regions, through an injection to the national intervention capacity.  I have worked for two and a half years, as have other members of my committee.  I have attended about 26 meetings a year.  I did not miss a meeting except during the election campaigns.  I have put in a great deal of work in Europe and at home only to witness now a complete anticlimax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the view of the entire Parliament and of M. Delmotte who is a Belgian Socialist and <i>rapporteur</i> of this report which the Parliamentary Secretary can have. It is a strongly worded report which indicted the Council of Ministers on the sabbotaging of the fund that we expected and hoped for and that the European Parliament had hoped for. It is the view of every group in the parliament from Christian Democrats to Social Democrats, Liberals, Communists and ourselves.  It is not confined to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to a very useful and worthwhile exercise which the European Parliament engaged in last year. This was the study of intra-Community trans-border problems or problem areas.  Commissioner Thomson <Col N="945" /> made money available for the studies and he and his Commission undertook a comprehensive study of all these areas.  In October last I submitted an oral question to Commissioner Thomson on this subject, which is contained in Document 274/ 74.  I asked six questions of the Commissioner: What instructions did the Commissioner give to his Department; what fields of cross-border co-operation are to be covered by the report; what border areas within the Community will be covered by the report; will the report deal with cross-border co-operation with non-member States, that is third countries; when is the report expected to be completed; does the Commission intend to present the report to Parliament?</P>
    <P>Those questions were asked on 2nd October, 1974.  They were taken in conjunction with a similar question submitted by five German parliamentarians who belong to the Christian Democrat group and their question also related expressly to the Irish Border problem.  They asked the Commission and the Council if any plans were there to rectify the socio-economic imbalances which existed on both sides of the Irish Border.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

From the information available to the local authority at the moment, it appears it was caused by indiscriminate and unauthorised dumping in the hill area of Bohernabreena.

As I have told the House, I have set up a water pollution board and I propose to introduce legislation to give more authority regarding the control of pollution in waters throughout the country.  I am afraid it will be close to the end of the year before it will be possible to have that legislation.  It has been in the course of preparation for some time but it is a fairly tedious job and, in view of the volume of legislation before the House, it may not be easy to get it in line.  However, I hope we will have it before the end of the year. I am sure all sides of the House will agree with it.  I do not know when the new Planning Bill will be passed, but when that happens it will strengthen <Col N="948" /> the hands of local authorities.  However, local authorities have a good deal of power at the moment if they want to operate it but some of them do not appear anxious to take the strict action that is necessary to deal with these matters.  Until they do, in the existing situation there will be a recurrence of this kind of pollution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister could give some information from his brief as to the up-to-date situation. Has he made inquiries?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The road authority can finance a pedestrian crossing or remedial works out of local funds which would not involve the Department's specific approval.  Therefore, they do not have to come to me at all.  No proposals have been received from <Col N="953" /> Dún Laoghaire Corporation for the use of the Road Fund grants for improvement of the junction mentioned by the Deputy, either by way of road works or the provision of special facilities for pedestrians.  That appears to me to say that at present there is no proposal by the local authority to do something about it.  I would suggest that Deputy Andrews might take it up, even by way of motion with the local authority, because they are the people who have the right to do it.  I would approve of it if it were necessary for me to give it my approval but, in this case, that does not appear to be necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, the provision of traffic signals, which includes pedestrian crossings and traffic lights, is a matter for the road authority, acting at the request or with the consent of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána. The Department's function arises only if the road authority request the use of Road Fund moneys to meet the cost of providing such facilities, and no such request has been received.

      <P>Very little more.  I am sure Deputy Andrews knows almost as much as I do about it.  To put it on record, the situation is, as Deputy Andrews knows, that the taking in charge of private housing estates is a matter for the local authority.  The estate is the property of the developer until such time as the development is completed and taken in charge.  Dublin County Council have indicated that Clonkeen estate consists of two separate developments, one of 138 houses at Meadow Vale estate and 46 houses at Pottery Road.  The development was carried out by Foxrock and Brewery Limited and the erection of the houses was completed in 1973.  A formal application for the taking in charge of the estate was made to the county council in July, 1974.  A survey of works required to bring the estate to the requisite standard was carried out and the list of outstanding works&mdash; mainly concrete aprons and footpaths &mdash;was notified to the developers.  The developers indicated that they are willing to complete the outstanding works but delay has occurred because of the difficulty in getting a contractor.  A further survey was carried out in February, 1975, and the council are maintaining <Col N="956" /> pressure on the developers and have got a firm indication from them that all outstanding works will be completed soon.  When that is done the council will take the estate in charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, investigation of complaints of water pollution or any pollution which may be occuring are matters for the local authority concerned. The local authorities have been asked in a circular issued to them recently and in 1973, to take all possible steps to prevent and abate water pollution.  There is no information in the Department regarding pollution by waste oil from Bord na Móna machinery at Attymon, Athenry, County Galway and neither have Galway County Council any knowledge of such pollution.  Therefore, apparently it is a secret between a few people. Perhaps if they leak that out, the leakage of oil might be investigated by Galway County Council.</P>

      <P>An essential feature of the farm modernisation scheme is the emphasis it places on planned development of the farm over a period particularly for development farmers.  It is not possible to draw up reliable plans where land taken on the 11-months system may not be available to the farmer even in the following year.  For the purposes of the scheme, therefore, it is necessary to relate farm plans to land which the farmer has some firm entitlement to, at least for the duration of the plan and preferably for the minimum 12-year leasing period envisaged under the farmer retirement scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Continental Press reported <Col N="968" /> that the main source of resistance to the lowering of the ceiling to 25 per cent was the French and Italian delegations and that the Irish delegation, surprisingly, were inclined to acquiesce in the German request to fix it at 25 per cent?  I am glad to hear the Minister say this was not so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>At no time was there any inclination to acquiesce in the proposal regarding the level of 25 per cent.  At one stage we looked for 65 per cent and pressed very hard for it. Personally, I did something that is not very appropriate for a chairman to do. I intervened in this discussion and criticised the German attitude while appreciating the position of the German Minister.  I understood his position and it was a question first of having a price package or having no price package because of the disadvantaged area scheme and then it was a question of having a disadvantaged area scheme which we could operate at the 25 per cent level, or perhaps, of having no scheme for another 12 months.  Sometimes you must do what is possible and that is what happened here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the possibility of a further failure to agree on this hill area scheme is hardly likely in view of the very small amount of money involved, something like 30 million units of account.  Surely they will not defer the whole scheme over a paltry sum like that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>They were going to defer the price package because it was part of a price package at the time and it might mean that we would be left for, perhaps, another two months on the old prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In its recently published document on the stocktaking of the common agricultural policy the Commission indicates that it cannot accept the application of MCAs in so far as they disrupt market unity or distort competition but makes it clear <Col N="970" /> that, in its view, MCAs should continue to be used to prevent short term movements in exchange rates from instantaneously affecting the common price arrangements.  To ensure that MCAs fulfil the latter role within acceptable limits, the Commission proposes that &ldquo;the rules and procedures by which appropriate changes in these amounts are determined should be laid down.&rdquo;  There are, however, no specific current Commission proposals. I will naturally support any efforts to have the MCA system operate in a more rational manner.  I am fully aware of the problems which the monetary compensatory amounts system is causing and, as the Deputy knows, I have already succeeded in having changes made which have been very beneficial for this country.</P>

In my view it cannot be done.</P>

      <P>I have said I am not satisfied with the MCA system.  As the Deputy knows, we succeeded in getting our representative rate reduced by 11 per cent last October and by more than 4 per cent at the last meeting. That totals more than 15 per cent. Of course, sterling is slipping all the time and we must deal with that unfortunate aspect.  We also have agreement to have 1.25 percentage points of the MCA's ignored and in further supplementation, the Commission now have authority where prices for a time are below intervention level, to intervene and use their discretion to ignore a further number of percentage points. I regret that so far the Commission have not used that power.  We are trying&mdash;not without hope&mdash;to get them to use it.  I expect they may now decide to give us certain concessions in that area.  I hope they do.</P>

The net benefit of the devaluation is almost totally dependent on the 4.8 per cent agreed at a more recent Council meeting.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement in regard to New Zealand dairy products which was reached at the meeting of Heads of Government in Dublin last week lays down certain guidelines for the carrying out of the review provided for in Article 5 of Protocol No. 18 to the Accession Treaty.  This review will <Col N="973" /> cover butter only and the quantities to be provided for in the period up to 1980 are to remain close to effective deliveries of New Zealand butter to the United Kingdom in 1974 and estimated deliveries in 1975.  In the case of cheese, Protocol No. 18 provides, of course, that the exceptional arrangement for the import of New Zealand cheese into the United Kingdom cannot be maintained after the 31st December, 1977.  The agreement provides that this situation and the problems which may arise from it are to be given due attention with appropriate urgency.  I am satisfied that the agreement does not have any serious implications for the future of Irish exports of butter and cheese to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Imports of New Zealand mutton and lamb into the United Kingdom were not one of the United Kingdom's renegotiation issues and were not discussed at the meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The financial aids available at present under An Bord Iascaigh Mhara's marine credit plan for the acquisition of new fishing boats consist of a free grant of 25 per cent of the cost of the boat and a subsidised rate of interest of 4 per cent on loans of up to 70 per cent of the cost.  In addition, an incentive grant of up to 10 per cent of cost is payable where the loan is repaid within the normal 15-year period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was made clear to them that in applications for loans in the future the interest rates could be varied if it was so decided. As the Deputy knows, the subsidy on loans for fishing boats is exceptionally high.  The 4 per cent rate was applied at a time when normal interest rates were more than 6 per cent.  The fishermen have been getting a 33 per cent rebate on interest.  Interest rates have soared by almost 300 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that very low prices are now being paid to fishermen for white fish; and if he has any plans to improve the present marketing structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that market prices for certain species of white fish, notably cod and whiting, have not been good for some time past.  This situation obtains not only in this country but throughout the EEC and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question let me say that it was precisely for the purpose of coping with a difficult market situation such as we now have that I have been urging fishermen to set up producers' organisations.  Membership of a strong and active producers' organisation would not only strengthen their market position but by enabling them to operate the EEC withdrawal system for fish would guarantee a reasonable floor price irrespective of the <Col N="978" /> quantities landed or market demand. I am glad to say that there is now every prospect of the first such organisation being established in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the prices offered in the Dublin market at the moment are worse than they were 30 years ago and, in view of the increased prices fishermen have to meet for diesel, gear and so on, has he any notion of doing anything to alleviate the serious position in which the fishermen find themselves?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that prices for cod and whiting are depressed. This depression is not confined to this country.  It is worldwide. Let us hope that, as happened in the case of cattle prices in the latter part of 1974, the position will change for the better.  The information at our disposal is that it is likely to change and we can, therefore, expect an improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that retail prices are just as high as when fish were fetching good prices for the fishermen and the benefit of these is not going back to the fishermen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Better co-operation by the fishermen in the marketing of their fish would bring about an improvement.  Co-operation is very important.  Possibly the cream to which the fishermen are entitled is being skimmed off by agents.  By co-operation some of the cream should come their way in future.  The Department are giving every encouragement to fishermen to form co-operative groups and we are hoping shortly to have a producer organisation which will measure up to EEC standards; 100 fishermen have paid a membership fee of £25 and we are hoping <Col N="979" /> the organisation will be formed shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of orders for new fishing boats placed outside the country in the two years 1973 and 1974 was 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it necessary to place orders for new boats outside the country?  Are we not able to produce in our own yards the kind of boat the fishermen want?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We allow the fishermen a choice.  They can either have the boat built here or buy it abroad if they think they can do better by going abroad.  We are exceptionally liberal in that respect and, as a result, over the period mentioned 12 fishermen opted to buy boats from foreign yards.  From 1st April, 1973, to 31st March, 1974, 14 bigger vessels were built here&mdash;that is from the 50 to 78 feet in length, 47 smaller ones, 26 to 40 feet in length; there was only one foreign boat, a 69 foot boat.  From 1st April to 31st December the position is that of new vessels, 56 to 86 feet in length, nine were built here and of the smaller ones, 26 to 40 feet, 35 were built here and only two abroad.  Fortunately the applicants are now opting for Irish built boats and, since that is the trend, I do not think it is necessary to take any positive action and tell the fishermen they must get their boats built here if they <Col N="980" /> want to qualify for grants.  I am sure the present trend is due mainly to the fact that it is generally accepted the Irish product is as good as, if not better than, the foreign product.</P>

      <P>This is very unsatisfactory as far as the people of the Nire Valley are concerned and I have been taken aback by hearing the Minister say that RTE have no plans to bring about an improvement in reception in that area, which is deplorable at the present time.</P>

      <P>RTE are concentrating on improving reception in the more populous areas where it is below average at present, under a major four- to five-year programme of improving reception.  I am afraid I have sympathy for people who are having bad reception in the Nire Valley but it is clear from the very small pocket involved that it must come relatively low down on the priority list.</P>

The role of the foundation is to advance co-operation between European organisations in the support of basic research and to facilitate the harmonisation of research in all branches of science. Three Irish organisations, the National Science Council, the Medical Research Council and the Royal Irish Academy are members of the foundation and Ireland has played a very full role in its establishment.  Irish representatives participated in the preliminary discussions preceding the establishment of the foundation and co-operated fully with the preparatory commission set up to decide on the location of a seat for the foundation.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the location of the seat of the European Science Foundation in Dublin were prepared by the National Science Council and were presented to the preparatory commission, but the ultimate decision was to locate the seat of the foundation in Strasbourg.</P>

    <P>The price of milk in March, 1973 was 5p per pint.</P>
    <P>In March, 1973 the maximum retail price of milk was only fixed by Order in the Dublin Sale District, the Urban District of Ballinasloe, County Donegal and County Mayo.  In the rest of the country it was controlled by a voluntary arrangement between the Minister and the Pasteurised Milk Bottlers' Association.  The Maximum Prices (Milk) Order, 1973 which came into effect on 13th April, 1973 extended control of the maximum retail price of milk to the whole country.  At present the Maximum Prices (Milk) (No. 3) Order, 1975 which came into effect on 10th March, 1975 fixes the maximum retail price of milk at 8p per pint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will remove the ban on teachers over 65 years who had participated in the capitation scheme and are thus deprived of pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) (for the Minister for Education) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) (for the Minister for Education)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to ensure that posts will be available for the 1,100 newly-trained teachers who will be coming out of the colleges of education at the end of the current academic year, the special concession whereby teachers have, on certain conditions, been retained in the teaching service beyond the normal retiring date will not operate in the forthcoming school year.  It is not possible to make an exception in favour of one particular category of such teachers.  A claim for pension credit for service in capitation schools is at present before the Teachers' Conciliation Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that members of religious orders, nuns in particular&mdash;I have been asked to raise this matter on their behalf&mdash; some of whom have been working in schools for 30 years and 45 years, are now asked to retire this year, that they are not entitled to any pension and would have no function in the school and will not qualify for an old age pension for a two-year period? Does the Minister not consider that this is placing a great burden on a section of the community who have given very great service in the education and other fields to the Irish community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I appreciate the difficulties the Deputy raised and as I mentioned at the end of my reply a claim for pension credit for service in these capitation schools is at present before the Teachers' Conciliation Council.  It is not possible, however, to select a particular category for special treatment because there are other groups for whom claims might also be made of hardship in these circumstances and the balance of human advantage seems to lie with taking <Col N="1006" /> this step of not continuing this practice, which is an exceptional practice, in operation in the current year so as to maximise the number of new teachers who will gain employment rather than create a situation where they could not and might have to seek employment elsewhere in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will accept that I would agree that to make places for those coming out of training colleges is praiseworthy but what I am raising here is the plight in which those teachers have been placed who do not qualify for a pension because of the capitation system of payment.  Nuns and brothers are particularly badly hit, people whose salaries in the past have gone back into the building of new schools and meeting debts on schools.  They are in a particular category having made special sacrifices more than any other section of the community and they are now being left as a severe financial imposition on their orders.  In one religious house of nuns there is a drop in income of £10,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the very real difficulty imposed.  There is a claim at conciliation level that is under consideration and a decision is due shortly.  However, I am not in a position to anticipate that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a similar question with the Minister nearly a year ago and I was then told the matter was at conciliation level and that a decision was expected.  Is the Minister in a position to say a decision will be made in the next month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to convene a further meeting of the conciliation council before the end of the month to discuss this matter and other <Col N="1007" /> claims with regard to teachers' pensions. Immediate action is taking place on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that.  An extension of service which took place previously is not being maintained in the coming year.  It is the abandonment of an exceptional arrangement because of a greater need elsewhere.  Having said that, I cannot accept the Deputy's words.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a computerised system of payment for teachers' salaries and other grants in connection with national schools gave rise to delay in relation to some items of payment, including grants to schools paid under the capitation system.  I regret that this has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> New increased rates of grant have recently been sanctioned with effect from 1st June, 1974, and payment of arrears due on foot of the new rates will be made on or before 11th April. All payments due to date at the old rate of grant have now been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there was gross incompetence and dereliction of duty on the part of the Department of Education in this matter?  Would he not agree that if the computer could not be used it should have been a relatively easy task to get 200 letters addressed by clerical officers in the Department? Money is still owed in some instances from November to March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with what the Deputy has said.  It is regrettable the delay occurred but, as experience has shown, the change-over to computerisation creates problems and delays in the short-term that are far worse than those that preceded the use of the computer.  However, when the system settles down it is accepted that computerisation is more efficient and less costly.  In this instance it is unfortunate that the somewhat more complex types of payment that have to be made and revised for the capitation schools suffered from the change-over, whereas the more straightforward arrangements to other schools were undertaken and, in fact, were speeded up by the use of the computer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that while the computer was being programmed the clerical officers could have been asked to address less than 200 letters a month from November to March?  Will the Minister not agree that when this was taken to the market-place there was considerable speed in paying some of the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to take the Deputy's point about the 200 letters because my information does not run to that figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There were less than 200.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's research and I am not in a position to confirm or to deny it.  If a computerised system is introduced it is not possible to mix it with the old system without causing confusion.  I do not profess to understand the reasons for this but this is not the first time in the public or private sector that I have come across this unfortunate phenomenon.  The main thing is that the problem is being resolved and will be resolved completely in the near future.  I share the concern of the Deputy regarding the delay that has taken place and I accept that it is very unfortunate for the people affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago my Department sanctioned a grant towards the cost of erecting a new central school at Kilgarvan containing four classrooms.  The case recently reached the stage in the Office of Public Works where tenders could be invited.  However, as a result of a recent re-examination of the accommodation requirements, it has been found that five classrooms will be needed.  This change of accommodation may cause some delay in the Office of Public Works as regards the invitation of tenders, but everything possible will be done to bring the arrangements at an early point to the stage when tenders for the larger building can be invited.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only quite recently that the need for five rooms rather than for four emerged.  There is a problem of getting the designs revised to take account of that change. I cannot say how long it will take but there is recognition of the fact that this project has dragged on for rather a long time and, in view of the urgent need to replace the existing unsuitable school, priority is being given to it. The Office of Public Works are aware of this.  Although the change of plan will mean some delay, it should be minimal in view of the priority being given to it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has suggested a reason for a trend.  I am not in a position to comment on his suggested reason.

      <P>I would not wish, on my feet, to evaluate the net effect of these different trends to which the Deputy has referred.  But, of course, a year during which there would be not a total absence but very few teachers qualifying is an essential feature of a particular year.  I do not think it is all that relevant to the longer-term trend.  As far as I can judge from statistics, we are a very <Col N="1017" /> long way from a real problem arising because, in fact, of the total applicants normally speaking only something like one-half or a bit more qualify and the proportion of those who secure places is only a quarter to a third.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if his attention has been drawn to a statement from a member of the National Youth Council to the effect that there are many children wandering on streets in the Dublin area who are a danger to themselves and to the community; and if he will make a statement and outline the steps he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement referred to, which dealt specifically with the need for secure provision for violent or unruly offenders in the 14 to 16 year age group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special school at Oberstown, County Dublin now being phased into operation, will provide accommodation for 60 boy offenders in this age group.  The Kennedy Report recommended that this school should be on &ldquo;open&rdquo; lines, with a closed wing for difficult cases.  However, the order <Col N="1019" /> conducting the school does not feel it appropriate that it should administer a closed unit.  It takes the view that to admit the more disruptive boy would defeat the purpose of the school, in that it would wreck the therapeutic programme for the rehabilitation of the more amenable boys.</P>
    <P>It is clear that secure provision is necessary for certain boys who cannot be adequately catered for in open schools.  Such provision will take a number of different forms, related to the needs of the boys.  Some with psychotic or neurotic disorders will require care in the type of psychiatric environment recommended in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Illness.  Other children, who are mentally handicapped, will need to be provided for in a special unit associated with a residential centre for the mentally handicapped, as recommended in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap.  A small number will simply need a secure centre in which the type of educational and care therapy being developed in Oberstown can be carried on without interruptions.</P>
    <P>A somewhat similar situation exists in the case of girl offenders, but the numbers involved are much smaller.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my supplementary reply to the Deputy's question of 11th February, a capital programme has been approved for the progressive expansion of assessment and treatment facilities which come within the ambit of my Department's responsibility. These will include an element of secure provision.  I am aware that plans are also in hand for the expansion of facilities which are the responsibility of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the very comprehensive reply which is much better than the reply we got the last day.  Might I ask the Minister when will the new school be ready?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The new school?  I have explained to the Deputy that there are a series of different problems <Col N="1020" /> requiring different solutions.  The difficulty here is the complexity of it. You have the problem of the facilities required for boys who have psychotic or neurotic disorders, the problem of the mentally handicapped, the problem of those who are not handicapped in any way but who require to be in secure care.  Then you have the same problems on a smaller scale for girls. Therefore, there is not a simple answer that a school will be ready on a certain date.  These are problems which, with respect, this Government have inherited, ones which are proving extremely intractable.  I can assure the House that the Minister and the Government are aware of the seriousness of the problems that exist here and of the need to find solutions to each of these problems as rapidly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my expression of thanks was premature in the light of that reply.  I am asking the Minister what are the Government doing about the young itinerant children who are sleeping rough in our streets at night. Is the Minister also aware that in regard to a reply given to me in February an organisation called CARE stated that the Government had given me misleading information?  I find the Government's indifference to this problem of children on the streets of Dublin appalling.  I am asking the Minister, who represents the same area with me, what is he going to do to try to find accommodation for children who are put back on the streets by the courts, who say there is nowhere to keep them?  I do not want a long-term view of what is going to happen.  I want to know what is going to happen tomorrow or this evening. There are 100 children sleeping rough in the streets of this city.  I know there are lots of problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The itinerant children to whom the Deputy refers may not belong to one group in the sense of needing one kind of solution but the question of trying to find a solution to the more urgent problems is under active consideration.  A meeting was held in the Department in the last few days with the aim of trying to <Col N="1021" /> find at least an emergency solution to the major part of the problem to which the Deputy has rightly directed the attention of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states there are various aspects of the problem of these boys and girls, but there is one thing common to them all: they need somewhere to sleep at night.  Our courts are releasing them on bail and saying: &ldquo;Sorry, we have nowhere to keep you&rdquo;.  This is a pressing problem of boys and girls who have no homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is not saying the perfect should be the enemy of the good, and that even if we cannot get the right answer immediately to each group we should at least attempt to find an answer to the major part of the problem, even of an interim and not totally satisfactory character.  This is certainly the Minister's view, and I shall convey the Deputy's concern to him, because it is a problem which is very urgent.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware of the grave dissatisfaction among parents in County Kerry concerning the operation of the transport scheme to primary schools in the county; and if he will give a broad outline of the nature of complaints received in his Department during the past six months from parents, teachers and public representatives on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there is grave dissatisfaction among parents in County Kerry or in any other part of the country which enjoys the benefits of free school transport.  There have been representations on behalf of parents in County Kerry similar to those which come from other areas.  These mainly relate to: (a) pupils who are ineligible for <Col N="1022" /> free transport under the conditions of the scheme; (b) those for whom a service is not available because they live in a district in which there are not sufficient eligible children to support a service; (c) those who wish to have transport to a school other than the school to which they are entitled to be brought, and (d) those for whom a service exists but wish to have it brought nearer their homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the particular problem, but it would come within one of the categories I have mentioned.  There is a great difficulty here.  This scheme was introduced, with due respect, in great haste originally without adequate study.  We have inherited a vast number of individual problems.  It would be very difficult to resolve these in a manner which gives maximum advantage but which does not in one area create a precedent which in another area would create an impossible problem to resolve.  It is a matter to which the Minister has given a lot of attention, and bit by bit the problems are being sorted out.</P>

      <P>No.  It arises out of the Minister's reply.  He refers to category (b) where there are not enough children in an area for the provision of transport.  Surely a smaller vehicle can be provided to deal with people like that who have the right as citizens to free transport?</P>

      <P>It is not possible to extend the service as the road to the homes of the children in the Coolbawn district is too narrow for the bus which operates the service.  However, I am arranging to have the network of school bus services operating in and around the area examined to see whether there could be a reorganisation of these services which would release a minibus for the service which caters for the Coolbawn children attending Doon national school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>I share the concern of the Dublin city centre traders at the incidence of crimes of violence and malicious damage to property in the area.  The strength of the Garda Síochána in the Dublin area has been increased over the past four years by almost 15 per cent and I am informed by the Commissioner that beat personnel and mobile patrols are deployed to give the best possible coverage to areas where vandals are most active.  If and when circumstances permit additional manpower will be allocated to the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central):</i> The Minister is aware of a recent meeting of Dublin traders at which they expressed complete dissatisfaction <Col N="1029" /> with the protection they are getting.  There is increased vandalism and violence and personal injury right through the city, and not in Dublin city centre alone.  It was stated at that meeting that there are not sufficient police on foot patrol in the centre and right through the city and this can be borne out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the meeting to which the Deputy refers but I am not aware that the dissatisfaction expressed related entirely to policing matters.  It would appear from the reports of the meeting that it ranged over a study of the causes of increased violence and vandalism in the central Dublin area and many of these causes were put down as social in their root. At the end of the meeting a number of resolutions were adopted only one of which related to more intensive Garda patrolling.  The Garda authorities are anxious to increase the incidence of Garda patrols and the numbers of gardaí deployed in the city centre because they are well aware of the difficulties of traders there and sympathise with them.  The presence of three or four superintendents at the meeting in question was indicative of that.  I am informed that at the meeting the traders praised the guards for their efforts.  It boils down essentially to the level of policing available, having regard to the number of men available.  As I said in my reply, the strength has been increased in the past four years by 15 per cent.  As soon as more guards become available to the Commissioner, I have no doubt he will deploy them in the areas where they are most badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I want to make one thing perfectly clear.  There was no criticism of the police.  There was criticism of the number of police available.  I agree that several other factors were discussed but for the short term it was agreed that additional police patrols were required for the centre city.  Are they not required throughout the whole city?  If additional police are not made available very soon, there will be no law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="1030" /> not consider concentrating on foot patrols?  This seems to be the only deterrent in that area.  Is he aware that while there may have been only one resolution passed, some traders mentioned the possibility of taking drastic measures, such as withholding VAT or rates and some even talked about closing up because no insurance company will give them cover?  One trader said that his shop had been raided three times in one month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that the Garda authorities and I share their concern over the predicament in the city centre.  Whatever can be done within the limits of the manpower available to the Commissioner will be done.  I understand that the incidence of the beat patrols has been increased in certain pressure points.  As more men become available, I have no doubt they will be deployed to the areas where they are most urgently needed.  It is clear that the centre city district would be such an area.  Recruitment is going on all the time.  The numerical strength of the Garda is at its highest ever, over 8,000 men.  Unfortunately, a substantial number of these have to be deployed along the Border.  We can only hope that the exigencies which require their presence may disappear or diminish in the immediate future.  This would release men for the civic duties for which they were primarily engaged&mdash;the protection of law abiding citizens in their own cities.  I share the Deputies' concern about this, as does the Commissioner.  Whatever can be done to alleviate the position for the traders in this part of Dublin, will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I agree. This is the whole difficulty.  Many members of the Garda must be diverted to security duties because of IRA activities.  If the community would only realise the disadvantage and the indirect cost of these IRA activities, that would be a significant factor in ending that problem.  I agree that more gardaí would be the answer, but they must be recruited first and then trained.  When they are trained they will be deployed to priority areas.  I agree that this is a priority area but unfortunately it must take second place to the security of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should concentrate on Garda foot patrols.  It may be a sign of the times for the Garda force to be mechanised but that is a poor substitute for the foot patrol that is needed in this area. Assistants have refused to work in shops because they were intimidated and assaulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Garda authorities believe in the efficacy of foot patrols.  The policy of some years ago of mechanised patrols has changed back in favour of foot patrols.  The Deputy may have noticed that gardaí on foot patrols are a much more frequent sight than formerly.  This policy will be expanded as manpower becomes available.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána that, for some time past, the Garda in Dublin have been making a determined effort to discourage the practice of young persons parading the city streets accompanied by alsatian dogs and that, as a result, the practice has declined considerably.</P>

      <P>I am aware of this problem and so are the Garda.  As I indicated, the Garda have been making a very determined effort over the past 18 months to discourage this practice.  This effort has been successful. The number of youths parading these dogs has declined.  This matter is still getting attention from the Garda.  The Deputy can be assured that if anything more is required, recommendations will be made to me by the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider a more thorough inquiry by the police authorities in the different areas before they issue dog licences to those people?  The increase to £3 does not mean anything to them. Many people have been terrorised by gangs of skinheads or bootboys or whatever they are called.  Even in the suburbs ladies' handbags are being snatched.  Would the Minister consider <Col N="1033" /> instructing the Garda to institute a very detailed inquiry before they issue a licence and insist that all dogs are licensed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda have no discretion to refuse licences.  This is a revenue law, and not a supervisory law relating to dogs.  While I agree that the presence of the types referred to by the Deputy gave rise to concern, we must be careful not to exaggerate or give the impression that this city is a lawless or dangerous area.  It is not.  There are areas in it where there is a higher degree of vandalism than in other areas and there are occasional peaks but we must be careful not to give a wrong impression.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Traffic Acts give certain functions to the Commissioner, Garda Síochána.  It is clear that in enacting this legislation, the Oireachtas did not intend that <Col N="1034" /> the Commissioner's exercise of these functions should be subject to review by the Minister for Justice and the Ministerial authority under those Acts is in fact the Minister for Local Government.  As Minister for Justice I have no function in relation to these matters and it would be contrary to established practice for me to undertake to reply to parliamentary questions of this nature.  As a matter of courtesy to the Deputy, however, and on the understanding that it must be limited to this occasion I have made inquiries and the following is the position.</P>
      <P>Because of his overall responsibility for road traffic, the Minister for Local Government issued guidelines that should be taken into account by local authorities when considering the location of such facilities as pedestrian crossings.  These guidelines take account of such matters as volume of traffic, vehicular and pedestrian, visibility and so on.  The Garda, for their part, also have regard to these guidelines and, as well, to recommendations made by An Foras Forbartha in a report which that organisation published in 1970 concerning pedestrian crossings.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána, in consultation with the relevant professional staff of the local authority, have conducted traffic counts on Wellington Road and in the light of the guidelines and recommendations I have mentioned, the figures are, I am informed, well short of what would justify them in making a formal request for a pedestrian crossing and in those circumstances they cannot agree to make such a request.  On the other hand, the Garda are aware that projected developments in the area are quite likely in due course to lead to a significant change in the situation and accordingly they intend to keep the matter under review so that if and when the figures enable them to justify a request they will make one.</P>

      <P>On the general question of wandering horses in the area, I understand that a temporary corral is being erected by Dublin Corporation adjacent to Finglas Garda station and animals found wandering may be kept there until such time as they can be transferred to the pound at Clontarf or at Churchtown.

      <P>I asked permission to raise the subject matter of Questions No. 33 and 34 on yesterday's Order Paper because in the Minister's tabular statement he referred to &ldquo;relevant demand&rdquo; for grants.  Does that mean that if a particular county submitted four times the number of schemes that another county submitted the grants would be proportionately increased? It must be easy enough for any county to line up additional schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At every meeting of the Monaghan County Council we have discussions <Col N="1040" /> about local improvements schemes. The council are completely dissatisfied with the allocation.  The information I was given yesterday regarding the allocations and the relevant demands is at variance with the information I was given by Monaghan County Council.  They claim the allocation is based on what the council received prior to 1968.  Up to 1968 rural improvement schemes were in operation. Then the local improvements schemes were introduced.  On 1st October last Monaghan had in the region of 221 applications waiting to be attended to and since then I believe 20 additional applications have been made.  The number of schemes attended to in the period has been very small indeed. When the local improvements schemes came in there were some applications which had been referred back from the Department and the council were unable to compile their list of schemes.</P>
    <P>We have no objection to other counties getting bigger allocations but we believe we should get a more generous allocation than we are getting at the moment.  In 1972-73 we received £35,000; in 1973-74 we received £37,500; the allocation for the nine-month period last year was £24,000.  The allocation for this year is £34,000.  I find it very hard to understand how that could be based on the pattern of expenditure in previous years.  Taking 1972-73 as the base, in 1973-74 the allocation was increased by 5.1 per cent.  In the nine-month period last year we got an increase of 8.57 per cent.  The allocation this year represents a decrease of 2.85 per cent.  In 1971-72 Monaghan had a total of 33 schemes at a cost of £1,374 per scheme.  In 1972-73 the number of schemes dropped to 21 and the cost per scheme increased to £2,158.  The allocation in that year was £35,000.  In the nine-month period last year the cost per scheme was £2,141.  With 221 schemes outstanding it would take something in the region of ten years, without any more applications coming in, to carry out these schemes.  Taking the value of money over the past four years, and comparing it with 1968, at a conservative <Col N="1041" /> estimate the cost per scheme this year will be in the region of £2,500.</P>
    <P>Monaghan has a very high road mileage per square mile.  It has also a very hilly terrain.  Some years ago an engineer said that Monaghan had the highest mileage of roads per square mile of any place in Europe.  From that one will appreciate the need for grants to carry out these schemes. The allocation for Cavan is £98,000; for Donegal it is £118,000 and for Monaghan it is £34,000.  We are not asking that other counties should be reduced.  All we are asking is that Monaghan should be up-graded.</P>
    <P>With regard to expenditure in previous years, Monaghan has taken up its full allocation every year.  In fact we always looked for some more.  First we had an increase and then we had a reduction.  I checked against two other counties and in one there was an increase of 22 per cent in the nine-month period last year and an increase this year of 20.4 per cent.  I am sure they took up their full allocation just like Monaghan.  I cannot understand why Monaghan should not get a proportionate increase based on the pattern of expenditure.  On what criteria are these amounts calculated?  If Monaghan got an unfair allocation initially surely now that position should be corrected.  The position should be examined.  We had a deputation to the Minister and I was hoping he would examine this and give us an allocation in line with the requirements of the area.  These schemes are very important now in view of the increasingly heavy traffic associated with nearly all forms of agricultural activity.</P>
    <P>When large machines are engaged in silage cutting, limespreading and fertiliser spreading the lanes are very important.  Each lane will have to be used by more than one person.  There would probably be 1,000 farmers availing of the facilities of those 221 schemes I mentioned if those laneways were brought up to standard.  It is very important with the tankers and heavy equipment used at the moment to have laneways into farmers' houses in good condition.  Would the Minister <Col N="1042" /> explain the basis of the figures for the allocation?  We feel we were entitled, even based on the 1968 figures, to a higher allocation than we got. The Minister should have a look at the allocation and use some other criteria, such as the needs of the farming community in the area.</P>

      <P>It seems it is pretty difficult to please everybody.  Deputy Leonard pointed out that I met a deputation from his council.  I spent several hours discussing this matter with them.  Apart from the fact that one gets some publicity in the local papers, raising a matter here at this stage, as Deputy Leonard should well know, does not add anything to the amount of money made available.  I must, therefore, assume, that this is another of the efforts where at the end of a debate we have this type of thing raised.  I am sure both Deputy Leonard and I have a lot better things to do than discussing in this House something which cannot produce any result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I got is that the system and the information we have from the county council were at variance and I want to have that clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is what Deputy Leonard wanted I would have been delighted if he had made that clear yesterday.  He asked a question following the introduction of a tabular reply. I thought this was a fair question and I attempted to give the answer to him but having got it he proceeded to have it raised on the Adjournment.  Deputy Leonard is talking about the situation as it was before I became Minister. He said the information from the council is that the allocation is based on special scheme grant allowances in the period 1963 to 1968.  In 1973 I changed this.  The criterion now relates to the applications on hand and there is no reference to what a local authority got under the special employment schemes in the allocations now made.  I think Deputy Leonard will agree with me when he hears the figures that not alone was Monaghan well treated but they were treated <Col N="1043" /> better than other counties.  I know a lot of people in Monaghan, as the Deputy knows, both at official level, farmers and workers right through the county. I have a lot of friends down there so if there was any question of trying to be of assistance there I would be inclined to give additional assistance, I will prove I have been.</P>
      <P>The position is that the number of applications on hand on 30th September, 1974 in Monaghan was 224. This represented 3.2 per cent of all the applications in the country.  A proportionate allocation of the funds available would be £32,000.  Monaghan got £34,000.  In other words, they got a bonus of £2,000 on what everybody else got.  What did I get for it?  I got questions in the House, which Deputies are entitled to raise, and I gave information here and have been brought back here when the House is adjourning for Easter Recess to repeat this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leonard, who is a very decent man, is not very long in the House and perhaps may not know the ropes as well as some of his colleagues. It should be noted they did not sit around to applaud him when he made his case but got out of the House pretty quickly because they realised he had stepped into a rather sticky morass and they were determined they would not be involved.  The position is that there is a certain amount of money which can be allocated.  I explained things to the deputation, which came to me.  This is something I am a little annoyed about.  If I said to Monaghan County Council that the allocation was being made, that there was nothing I could do about it and that there was no use talking about it possibly I would have got more thanks than I am getting.  I asked those people to come along when they wanted to see me and discuss matters with me. All I get for my pains is that Deputy Leonard comes in here and raises this matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole basis of the argument seems to be that somebody said it was on the old scheme, under which the old allocations were given, which is <Col N="1044" /> not correct.  I want to make sure that is understood, as I thought it was understood.  Monaghan County Council certainly understand it and I would be glad to know from Deputy Leonard who in Monaghan County Council told him that this was the basis on which the money was divided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Deputy quoted here: &ldquo;Information from the council is that the allocation is based on special scheme grant allowance in the period 1963-68.&rdquo;  That is not so any longer.  I changed it to what I consider to be a much fairer way.  If I was dealing with Monaghan strictly on a mathematical basis they were entitled to 3.2 per cent of the allocations for the whole country, which would give them £32,000 and I gave them £34,000.</P>
      <P>I notice Deputy Leonard skated around something.  Towards the end of last year some counties got money which they were unable to spend&mdash; there are counties who open their mouths very wide but are unable to swallow what they get into them&mdash; including some of the counties which were making a lot of noise yesterday about allocation, and I gave an additional £3,000 to Monaghan, which shows I was well disposed to them and I could see the case they were making. Let us be honest and fair about this. Monaghan have not alone got their fair share of the allocation this year but they have got more than their share.  At least they should accept that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that if one does not take into consideration the £3,000 which was given towards the end of the year Deputy Leonard is using figures which suit his argument, but we must be perfectly honest about this.  I believe in honesty in this House as I believe the Deputy does. Therefore, let us call a spade a spade. The facts are that I changed the system so that there would be a fair share given to all and they would get a proportion of the money in accordance with the amount of schemes which were on application.  Monaghan, having got that, got an additional £2,000. Their allocation was increased from £32,000 to £34,000 but apparently they are still not satisfied.</P>
      <P>One other thing which I disliked about the way the case was made was apparently that this was made on a kind of envy basis.  Deputy Leonard said he did not want to take anything off any other county but other counties got more than Monaghan got.  Of course they did.  Donegal, Mayo and Leitrim got more but would Deputy Leonard stand up among his colleagues and tell them he would like some of their money taken back and given to Monaghan?  We are using money out of a limited pool and out of that pool Monaghan got its share and £2,000 over.  Quite frankly, I am surprised that Deputy Leonard should come in and suggest that Monaghan did not get enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to make an argument as to whether or not the jobs are costing more or less but the information that I have does not bear out the information that Deputy Leonard was giving with regard to the cost of the jobs.  I would suggest that before he raises this matter again he might check with the county council and find out if their figures coincide with the ones that he got.  I am not saying <Col N="1046" /> that he did not get them from someone in the county council.  Irrespective of where he got them, the figures are not correct.</P>
    <P>There is another issue.  I was a member of Meath County Council for 15 years.  That county council took a courageous decision many years ago. Since there were a great many lanes that had to be done and there was not enough money coming from national resources&mdash;they got £3,000 to £7,000 and that was all and there could be a list of 300 lanes&mdash;they decided to provide from the rates a certain sum of money under what is known usually as the McQuillan Act, to have the lanes done where there were two or more houses.  This is the situation there.  Deputy Leonard is saying that this is a different situation, that Monaghan County Council should get not alone their own share plus the £2,000 we gave them this year but also a share of somebody else's.  If he sits back and looks at the situation he will find that while the amount of money which was given in Monaghan is not adequate&mdash;it would require millions extra to do every lane in the country &mdash;the Government which he supported did not produce this type of money. I would not blame them because I cannot produce it and my Government cannot produce it because we have put the priorities where they should be put.  We have supplied a good deal of money.  We have allocated it in what we considered the best way.  We gave Monaghan their pint of milk and a &ldquo;tilly&rdquo; for the cat, an extra £2,000, and in return Deputy Leonard comes in when the House is adjourning for the Easter Recess and brings me back, although I have a great deal of work to do, to answer the silly argument that Monaghan is not getting its fair share.</P>
