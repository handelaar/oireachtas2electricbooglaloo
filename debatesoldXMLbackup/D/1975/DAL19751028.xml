    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that, over several decades, the position has been that when young married couples become eligible for housing and are resident in the South Dublin area, they are invariably housed in the North Dublin area and <i>vice versa</i>, where they have no friends and no sense of community; if he will make regulations or initiate legislation whereby people from a community will be rehoused, in so far as possible, within the community to which they belong: and if he considers that such legislation or regulations would lead to the quicker settlement of each new <Col N="300" /> housing estate with its own identity, not only in Dublin, but throughout all urban areas in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  Responsibility for the provision and allocation of alternative housing accommodation for persons in need of rehousing rests with the housing authority concerned.  I am informed by Dublin Corporation that young married couples from the North Dublin area are not invariably rehoused in the South Dublin area, nor <i>vice versa</i>, nor has it been the practice, invariably in the past, to do so.</P>
      <P>The priorities accorded to categories of persons in the letting of dwellings provided by housing authorities are determined by schemes adopted by these authorities under section 60 of the Housing Act, 1966.  The letting priorities scheme adopted by Dublin Corporation already provides that in the allocation of dwellings preference shall be given to local applicants, other things being equal, subject to the priorities set out in the scheme.  Other urban authorities have similar provisions in their letting schemes.  In the circumstances, I see no need for the additional legislative requirement suggested by the Deputy.  He will appreciate, of course, that vacant dwellings are not always available in a particular area to cater for the needs of all applicants in the area, at any given time.  This arises from the normal exigencies of planning and executing a housing programme, which would not be obviated by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is a local problem in the method of priorities drawn up by the various local authorities whereby the further out and the newer housing estates are invariably given to the small families?  Does the Minister not think that this priority classification is creating a social problem worse than that being solved by housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the local authorities how under section 60 of the Housing Act, 1966, they decide the system of priorities.  I have no right to tell them what to do about <Col N="301" /> this and, perhaps, the Deputy will take it up at corporation level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister if he, as Minister for Local Government, would make a regulation which would take this social consideration into account and not merely give people a number and tell them they are at a certain point on the list and will be sent to whatever area the house may be, regardless of whatever community or social work they may be engaged in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think such consideration would help the situation. The elected representatives of the area are the best judges in these matters. The subject should be raised by the elected representatives with the local authority when the houses are to be allocated and this would solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, I represent the area which is now being reclassified, Dublin-Bally-fermot.  The greatest problem there is the young married couples living with their parents who, because they are employed locally, cannot take the housing accommodation offered to them in Ballymun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Mayo County Council included finance for a 27 house scheme <Col N="302" /> at Kiltimagh in their claim last August for an increased capital allocation for local authority housing in the current year.  Subsequently I allocated an additional £100,000 to the council, allowing them a total authorised expenditure of £502,000.  It is a matter for the council to decide on the extent and timing of the schemes which will be undertaken in the current year within the authorised levels of expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will grant an increase in the maximum SDA loan to £7,000, in view of the tremendous increase in cost of house building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>While I have no immediate proposals to increase the loan and income limits, I am keeping the matter under continuing review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is surely aware that the loans have not been increased in line with inflation. Is the Minister aware that the people looking for local authority housing would probably build their own private houses if they could get a big enough loan?  A young man would have to earn a maximum of £2,300 to get the loan of £4,500.  As the Minister is aware, it will cost £7,000 or £8,000 to build a house.  Where will these people get the remainder of the money if loans are not increased?  I asked this question time and time again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told Deputy Calleary when he asked this question as a member of the Galway County Council less than a week ago, I am aware that a number of applicants are finding it difficult to get the difference between the £4,500 and the cost of the house.  I am also aware that because so many people are availing of the scheme as it is at present it would be a mistake to include other categories without having the necessary money to provide for those extra categories.  While I should like to improve the position, an enormous amount of money has been given for SDA loans and all of it is being availed of.  As I told the Deputy in the deputation last week, it is just not possible to do at present what he is asking I should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there has been a decrease in the number of applicants for loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware there are still far more people applying than there is money available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that all local authorities are experiencing an enormous increase in the list of applicants for local authority housing because of the small amount of money available under the SDA loans?  People cannot see their way to build their own houses.</P>

    <Col N="304" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the information I am getting.  I agree there are many people who are looking for houses now but it is mainly because they consider there is a possibility of getting local authority houses.  That was not the position up to recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state when the review will be completed and when he will be in a position to give us a definite decision?  For the last two years he has consistently said the matter has been under review.  When will there be a final decision, or is it final now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is a continuing review.  As I told Deputy Callanan and his deputation as well as many others, I am aware that extra money could be used if available but, with so many people availing of it now, it would be wrong to give the impression that simply by increasing the income limit and the amount of money they can borrow would improve the situation.  It would have the opposite effect for the thousands of people who are availing of it and finding it useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that people are finding it difficult.  It is not just a question of finding it difficult.  All their security is given for the £4,500&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that this matter is crying out for revision?  When a house cost only £3,000 or £4,000 the grants available were the same.  In rural areas the cost of getting ESB connection is very high, sometimes as much as the amount of grant&mdash;at any rate that amount of money has been asked for in some cases.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter. One of the main reasons people do not attempt to build their own houses is because of the very low grants&mdash;somebody said to me they would not buy the nails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment the whole matter is being reviewed and it would be unfair if I gave an off-the-cuff reply to the Deputy in view of the fact that I hope to have the result of the review in a short while.  Deputy Callanan has made the point that people are unable to build houses but the facts are there for everyone to see.  The houses are being built.</P>

      <P>One of the matters being considered is whether the essential repair grant is of any use, or was ever of any use.  I agree with the Deputy that the amount of money given for this kind of work is often of very little use but if it is agreed that it is for the purpose of just keeping a house from falling down on someone&mdash;which is what the essential repair grant is for&mdash;I consider a hard look should be taken at the whole matter.</P>

      <P>The grant from the Department is £80 but Kerry County Council have to pay as much as £900 to make up the necessary money. Does the Minister not agree that the Department grant of £80 should be increased substantially?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is saying is correct: the £80 is neither here nor there.  If a county council want to <Col N="308" /> repair a house perhaps it would be better to allow them do the work themselves without taking this sum into consideration; or else there could be a substantial amount given.  The whole idea may have to be changed.  There are a number of aspects involved and I am not happy with the situation.  Had I been the Minister of the day, I do not think I would have introduced the essential repair grant of £80.  However, I may be wrong in that and perhaps I might have looked differently on the matter at that time.  In any case the grant is of very little use in today's terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When proposals are formulated for the provision of sewerage schemes it is not unusual for planning permission for housing development to be sought in respect of lands which will be served by such schemes.  If the development can be co-ordinated with the provision of services, the fact that the services will not be available for a year or two would hardly warrant refusal of permission.  It is normal in such cases to impose a condition requiring that the houses shall not be occupied until services are available.</P>

Sections 31 and 35 are in operation since that date also and contain provision for enforcement of planning control which planning authorities may avail of where they consider such action is necessary and appropriate.

Is the Minister not aware that unemployment is widespread all over the country and surely the initiation of a scheme such as this would relieve some unemployment?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he proposes to encourage citizens to take an active interest in the preservation of the historical monuments and cultural features in their town and communities with a view to maintaining and nurturing the architectural cultural heritage as part of the country's national identity; and if he will protect and assist the preservation of these monuments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in previous replies to the Deputy, the co-ordination of activities in connection with European Architectural Heritage Year was entrusted by me to the National Committee which I set up in June, 1973.  I am not sure what kind of tabular statement the Deputy seeks but, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a list of activities sponsored by or organised in association with the National Committee.</P>
      <P>An allocation of £30,000 over a three year period was provided to finance the activities of the National Committee.  I am also sponsoring a film on the architectural heritage entitled&mdash;&ldquo;Places for People&rdquo; the premiere of which will be held shortly. As regards legislation, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1973, the Report Stage of which will be taken shortly, strengthens the powers of planning authorities in relation to the preservation of buildings and structures of architectural, historical and artistic interest.  The activities undertaken at national and local level during the year evidence the interest of the general public in the architectural heritage.  I am confident that this interest will be maintained.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>European Architectural Heritage Year, 1975.</P>
      <P>List of activities sponsored by or organised in association with the National Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish campaign to mark European Architectural Heritage <Col N="324" /> Year has involved a wide cross-section of the community in activities either directly or indirectly marking the year.  These may be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>Seminars: The series of seminars organised by An Foras Forbartha and the Institution of Engineers of Ireland which was commenced in December, 1974, was completed.  The second seminar &ldquo;The Parameters of Choice&rdquo; was held in Cork on 4-6 February, and the concluding seminar &ldquo;Maintaining the Heritage&rdquo; in Dún Laoghaire on 2-3 April.</P>
    <P>Éigse Uladh '75 (7-9 March) organised by Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, concentrated on Irish architecture and featured the Europa Nostra Exhibition, two showings of the film &ldquo;Janus&rdquo; and exhibited some work by the architectural students in Bolton Street.</P>
    <P>Féile na Máighe was held in Kilmallock this year (24-27 April) and had EAHY-75 as its theme.  The Europa Nostra Exhibition was on display with the award-winning entries in the schools competition &ldquo;Fine Buildings and their People&rdquo;. A booklet &ldquo;Old Kilmallock&rdquo; by Mainchín Seoighe was published to mark the event.</P>
    <P>Schools: The judging and presentation of awards in the two major schools competitions &ldquo;Fine Buildings and their People&rdquo; and &ldquo;New Look&rdquo; took place during February, March and April. The former attracted entries from 275 groups of children aged 10 to 14 and approximately 300 children submitted entries in the &ldquo;New Look&rdquo; competition.  His Excellency the President presented the awards in both competitions.</P>
    <P>A special award to mark EAHY-75 was made in the Young Scientist of the Year Exhibition and was won by a Cork school.</P>
    <P>Students: The students of UCD are preparing a wall-sheet on Irish architecture which it is hoped will be useful in schools.  Preliminary work has been carried out but the project will not be completed until later in 1975.</P>
    <P>The students of Bolton Street are preparing a booklet illustrating the types of vernacular building of historic <Col N="325" /> and architectural interest which is being sponsored by the National Committee and published later this year.</P>
    <P>Exhibitions: The RIAI opened in October an exhibition of architectural drawings spanning 200 years in the National Gallery, Merrion Square.</P>
    <P>Competitions: The RIAI award scheme for works of restoration on old buildings and modern buildings which harmonise with older environments has been held.</P>
    <P>The Irish Concrete Society held a national competition as part of a European competition organised by Cembureau.  Six Irish entries went forward to the international competition.</P>
    <P>A competition was organised by the National Committee for projects carried out by local authorities, voluntary organisations and individuals.</P>
    <P>Winners were: Floodlighting of the historic buildings in Trim; Kildare Market House and Square; Grand Canal Hotel, Robertstown; St. Catherine's, Dublin; Village Improvement Scheme in Tyrellspass, Co. Westmeath.</P>
    <P>A selection of the Irish entries is going forward to the European competition.</P>
    <P>An award scheme for journalists has been in operation since January in which an award will be made for the best article published during each of the first six months of the year.  The competition is sponsored by the National Committee in association with the National Union of Journalists.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte's special EAHY-75 award in its 1975 Tidy Towns Competition was presented to Tyrellspass on 12th March.  An architect has been engaged by Bord Fáilte to survey the village and make recommendations on conservation and improvement.</P>
    <P>A national amateur movie-makers competition for films on architectural conservation has been run by the Carlow Amateur Movie-makers in association with the National Committee as sponsors.</P>
    <P>Projects: Work is continuing on the two national projects in Holycross village and St. John's Square, Limerick as part of the European Programme of Pilot Projects.  Two of the projects <Col N="326" /> included in the Irish programme have been completed.  Kilmessan Church was formally opened by the Minister for Local Government and in Wexford the refurbishing of the Old Town Hall for use as a picture gallery has been completed.  Problems and difficulties have arisen with a number of the projects but this fact alone provides interest by indentifying various obstacles to conservation work.  A report on projects is to be published in November.</P>
    <P>Lectures: The Royal Dublin Society marked EAHY-75 in January by presenting two illustrated lectures by the Hon.  Desmond Guinness entitled &ldquo;The Preservation of Buildings in Ireland throughout the ages&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In February RTE broadcast a series of three Thomas Davis lectures to mark EAHY-75 under the title &ldquo;Builders and Buildings&rdquo;.  The lectures were given by Messrs E. McParland, K. Fox and P. Shaffrey.</P>
    <P>A number of other lectures have been given in schools, teachers' centres and to local groups around the country.</P>
    <P>Irish Architecture&mdash;A Future for Our Heritage: This publication by the National Committee which was prepared by the architecture and planning sub-committee was formally launched in January.  There is a continuing demand for the booklet which is available to the public free of charge.</P>
    <P>Janus: Following the formal presentation of the film by Rank Xerox Ltd. to the Minister for Local Government, a private preview was given to representatives of the Press and members of the National Committee in January.  Since then it has been shown at seminars, meetings, Limerick's Civic Week in March, Castlebar's Community Week and in a few schools.</P>
    <P>Publications: The National Committee is assisting with two books which will be published during 1975. These are &ldquo;The Irish Town&mdash;An approach to Survival&rdquo; by P. Shaffrey (O'Brien Press) and &ldquo;Portrait of Cork&rdquo; by T.F. McNamara (Mercier Press).  It has also agreed to contribute towards the cost of a publication by <Col N="327" /> the Architectural Association of Ireland.</P>
    <P>A book relevant to the year by Brian de Breffini entitled &ldquo;The Houses of Ireland&rdquo; was published in March, 1975, and other books due to be published are &ldquo;Irish Vernacular Architecture&rdquo; by Dr. K. Danaher and &ldquo;Ireland's Architectural Heritage&rdquo; by Professor M.J. McDermot.  Two reports by sub-committees of the National Committee dealing with pilot projects and legal, financial and administrative problems will be published in November.</P>
    <P>Council of Europe: The National Committee was represented by the secretary at the seventh meeting of the international organising committee held in Amsterdam in March.  On behalf of the National Committee he welcomed the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe during his recent visit to Dublin when the importance of publicly acknowledging the initiating and organising role of the Council of Europe in EAHY-75 was stressed.</P>
    <P>Sundry: Bord Fáilte has presented copies of an EAHY-75 poster to the National Committee which is distributing copies to members of the public on request.</P>
    <P>Both the provincial and the Dublin editions of the 1975 Golden Pages Telephone Directory have been issued and feature the EAHY-75 theme on the front and back covers.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education circularised secondary schools with a list of text books on the architectural heritage suitable for the teaching of civics.</P>
    <P>The Irish Railway Record Society has prepared material for a special touring exhibition to mark EAHY-75. During September this exhibition was on Display in Cork and Limerick, and opens in Dublin in early October.</P>
    <P>The National Committee had a stand at the RDS for the Horse Show which was most successful.</P>
    <P>A series of six television programmes are to be transmitted by RTE during the autumn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> A lecture and film show was organised for the Irish Girls' Brigade and presented on 20th September, 1975.</P>
    <P>The formal opening of Holycross Abbey took place on 5th October, 1975.</P>
    <P>EAHY-75 commemorative stamps were issued by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on 6th October. (5p, 6p, 7p and 9p).</P>
    <P>From 29th September to 8th October, Dublin Corporation organised, in conjunction with a number of organisations and public bodies represented on the corporation's architectural heritage year committee, a comprehensive exhibition in the Mansion House on the architectural heritage of the city.  The exhibition included lectures, walks and a seminar on the theme &ldquo;The Changing City&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government film&mdash;&ldquo;Places for People&rdquo; will be shown during the Amsterdam conference and will have its Irish premiere early in November.</P>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha plan a series of technical &ldquo;workshops&rdquo; for conservation experts and a series of evening lectures for a wider audience.</P>
    <P>A national conference to conclude the activities of the year will be held in Knappogue Castle, County Clare on 18th-19th November.</P>

General responsibility in relation to such directives rests with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whose Department has been informed that, from the road safety aspect, I would not object to their adoption should the Council so decide.  I understand that the proposals do not present any problems for the Minister for Industry and Commerce from the industrial standpoint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The contract documents for both these schemes are under consideration in my Department.  I cannot say at present when I will be in a position to convey decisions regarding them to the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that technically these are repeats of questions asked about seven months ago?  At that time in relation to the Portlaoise sewerage scheme the Minister invited me to put down another question within a month when he expected to have a favourable reply? Why has there been such a delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a tremendous number of local authorities have submitted applications for sewerage schemes.  Many of them have been carried out.  As Deputy Lemass remarked a while ago, he thought there were not so many schemes.  There is a very big number of applications, in fact, more than could be financed.  We have to get a priority from the local authority and we have to have a national priority.  This difficulty is being dealt with at present.  I would be glad if I could tell Deputy Lalor it will be sanctioned on such and such a date.  I cannot do that but, as soon as I possibly can, I will give that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now saying there is a question of priority and a question of the overall availability of cash.  I am sure the Minister's back-up records will show that, on the <Col N="334" /> last occasion, Deputy Haughey mentioned scarcity of money and the Minister said that they had not fully examined the proposal and if the Deputy put down another question inside a month he would have another reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that at the time.  A great number of applications have come in, some of which would appear to have a higher priority.  This matter is being considered at present. We could spend a couple of hundred million pounds on schemes like this in any year if we could get that type of money.  Certainly it is not my fault that the money is not available. About two-and-a-half times the amount of money which had been made available was made available this year.  I admit it is a drop in the ocean compared with the amount of money required.  I sympathise with Deputy Lalor's point of view.  I said at the time that I felt I could give him a reply, which he assumed would be favourable, within a month. Because of the huge volume of applications for these schemes&mdash;which surprised everyone including myself&mdash; which have come in since, it is necessary to ensure that they are dealt with fairly.  That is why the matter is taking so much time.  I am sorry about it but there is nothing I can do except try to have it expedited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is a brief resumé of the main measures relating to pollution control and environmental improvement, as regards the Department of Local Government:</P>
      <P>Legislation: The Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill now before the House provides for strengthening and improvement in the physical planning system.  It is expected that the Bill for better control of water pollution will be introduced this session.  Other aspects of pollution control legislation are being kept under review.</P>
      <P>Pollution Control Measures: Pending the enactment of new legislation local authorities continue to be encouraged to make full use of their existing control powers to limit water pollution and to deal with incidents. Local authorities have been asked to extend their air pollution monitoring particularly in the context of enforcement of planning conditions, as well as in the vicinity of industrial operations which may be a source of significant pollution.  Inspections of industrial premises under the Alkali etc.  Works regulation Act 1906, which is administered by the Department, have been increased.  My Department continue to promote and assist in the preparation of contingency plans by maritime local authorities for dealing with oil spillages.  A substantial State subsidy is now paid to these authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> Waste Collection and Disposal: A general review of the arrangements relating to the collection and disposal of waste, in both private and public sectors, has been undertaken to see what legislative or other new provision may be needed.  In this connection a number of initiatives have already been taken in relation to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) review by local authorities of public waste collection and disposal facilities; (b) an examination locally of the operation of private dumps and assembly of information on current toxic waste volumes and disposal methods; (c) promotion of arrangements by which the recovery of abandoned cars and metal scrap is assisted by local authorities in the interests both of resources conservation and reduction of disorderly dumping; (d) consideration, in consultation with local authorities of arrangements for implementation of EEC directives dealing with waste.</P>
    <P>Environmental Improvement: My Department's ongoing programmes, including housing and road development and, particularly, sanitary services, are all important components in the overall design for environmental improvement.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination: The Interdepartmental Environment Committee, who have the task of improving liaison and co-ordination, in environmental matters are at present examining the arrangements relating to the various pollution control programmes to see what further improvement may be needed.  The Water Pollution Advisory Council, a widely representative body with the task of advising on all matters relating to water pollution, is now fully operational.  I also have plans for setting up a group of technical experts on the question of water and effluent standards.</P>
    <P>International Aspects: My Department keep abreast of developments in the international organisations dealing with environmental matters.  Their main concern is with the action programme of the EEC, in which they are substantially involved.  Some directives, including those relating to waste which I have mentioned, which are of special <Col N="345" /> relevance to local government, have already been adopted.  I attended a Council meeting of Environment Ministers on the 16th October at which a number of further decisions were made and views exchanged on the preparation of a second action programme on the environment on which proposals are to be put forward by the Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill was introduced in the Seanad and was debated at length through the various Stages before it was passed by that House earlier this year.  Accordingly interested Deputies will have had an opportunity of studying what was said on the general principles underlying the Bill and on the main provisions contained in it.  Its chief purpose is to provide a revised legislative framework for the broadcasting services in the light of changed circumstances since the original 1960 Act was enacted and the climate in which these services are likely to be operated over the next decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to go into great detail about the background to the 1960 Act, which on the whole has stood the test of time remarkably well. Up to the 1950's the broadcasting service was governed by the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was legally responsible for the detailed control and operation of broadcasting.  In 1953 the then Minister, the late Erskine Childers, set up Comhairle Radio Éireann, a committee of five persons appointed in a part-time capacity to be responsible under him for the general control and supervision of the service.  From then on Radio Éireann was free in practice to manage <Col N="381" /> their own affairs and to spend the moneys allocated for broadcasting purposes.  This was a very significant step in the history of broadcasting in this country and one on which it is appropriate to pay tribute to the creativity of our late President in this as in other fields.  Towards the end of the 1950s the pros and cons for establishing a national television service were being discussed and the then Government announced their intention of considering proposals from private interests for a television concession.</P>
    <P>They subsequently set up the Television Commission to consider such proposals and the relations between the proposed television service and sound broadcasting.  The commission reported in May, 1959.  The majority expressed their misgivings about entrusting the operation of the service to any private organisation and indicated that if the necessary capital were available there was little or no doubt that television should be established as a public service.  In the event the Government decided that the two public broadcasting services&mdash;sound and television&mdash;should be under the control of a single statutory authority, and that the television service should be operated without ultimate cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1959, was initiated in the Seanad to give effect to these decisions and when passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas became the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  It is perhaps not surprising that with the passage of 15 years since then there is a need to improve and modernise it in certain respects.</P>
    <P>The present Bill, which is intended to achieve this, has two main purposes. The first is to clarify and expand the duties of the RTE Authority in fulfilling their task of providing a national broadcasting service in the light of developments, experience and new insights since the authority were established.  The second main purpose of the Bill is to provide greater autonomy and freedom for the broadcasting service within clearly defined statutory restraints and obligations, while at the same time improving public control in <Col N="382" /> certain areas.  The Bill as passed by the Seanad also contains an enabling provision to provide for direct retransmission of outside broadcasting services here and a number of provisions in regard to financial matters.  Finally it provides for certain amendments to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, the main one being to facilitate statutory control of local programme origination for distribution on wired broadcast relay stations&mdash;cable systems.</P>
    <P>At this stage it might be appropriate to refer to the enabling provision regarding open broadcasting and in particular to the proposals to arrange for rebroadcast of BBC 1 on the second transmitter and microwave network which is at present being installed as a first step towards the open broadcasting concept.  The indications I had were that many viewers in the single-channel areas believed that a rebroadcast BBC 1 would best meet their wishes for a choice of TV programmes approximating as closely as possible to that available in multi-channel areas. There was much public discussion about this issue during the year.  I welcomed this, particularly the widespread participation in it by the media generally, the public and RTE.  The pros and cons for a second television channel controlled by RTE and for a rebroadcast BBC 1 were thoroughly aired.  Doubts were raised as to what the people, particularly those in single-channel areas, really wanted and in order to resolve this, a survey was sponsored jointly by my Department and RTE in order to determine what the public preference is.  As Deputies will be aware the results of the survey which was carried out by Irish Marketing Surveys Ltd. were announced recently.</P>
    <P>The survey showed a clear preference for RTE 2 over BBC 1 (Northern Ireland) in both the single-channel and the multi-channel areas.  The percentages were: 62 per cent for RTE 2 and 35 per cent for BBC 1 overall; 59 per cent to 37 per cent in the single-channel area and 64 per cent to 33 per cent in the multi-channel area.</P>
    <P>The only significant deviation from this trend was in the cities of Cork. Limerick and Galway, where RTE 2 <Col N="383" /> was preferred by 50 per cent compared with 47 per cent for BBC 1.  Copies of the survey report are in the Library for those Deputies who are interested in further details.</P>
    <P>I said in the Seanad that if it was clearly demonstrated that there was a public preference for an RTE 2, I would be happy to recommend that solution to the Government.  I accept the result of the survey as a reliable indication of a clear public preference for the RTE Authority's concept of an RTE 2 &ldquo;selected from BBC 1, BBC 2, the 15 ITV companies, other overseas sources and additional home-produced material&rdquo; giving, to quote the authority's statement on the survey, &ldquo;a range and a variety of programmes as near as possible to those already available in multi-channel areas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I will be recommending to the Government that the second television network should be used for a second RTE channel as described by the Authority.  I shall be introducing amendments on Committee Stage to delete section 6 and other related provisions of this Bill.  I shall come back to this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the two main purposes of the Bill were to clarify and expand the duties of the RTE Authority in fulfilling their task of providing a national broadcasting service and to provide greater autonomy and freedom for the broadcasting service within clearly defined statutory restraints while improving public control in certain areas.  At present the general duties of the Authority in regard to providing a national broadcasting service are laid down in section 17 of the 1960 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the present Bill, as Deputies will see, is broader in scope, reflecting the growing recognition of the diverse interests and concerns of the people of Ireland, the paramount need for peace and understanding, the variety and richness of our culture, and the need to cherish those elements which distinguish our culture from those of other countries, particularly the Irish language.  The <Col N="384" /> Authority are also required in their programming to uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution and, to guard against our being too inward looking, they are asked to have regard to the need for the formation of public awareness and understanding of the values and traditions of other countries.  I hope that this general conception of what our national broadcasting service should reflect will commend itself to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>As to the second main purpose of the Bill, the statutory restraints on the Authority are contained in section 3 of the Bill which restates and expands the provision in the 1960 Act concerning objectivity and impartiality.  It imposes on the Authority the obligation to apply the same standards as regards objectivity and impartiality to any written, aural or visual material they may publish.  It gives statutory backing to the present practice whereby the impartiality requirement is considered to be fulfilled if all significant views are aired in two or more related programmes if these are broadcast over a reasonable period.  It provides for a relaxation of the prohibition on expression of their own views by the Authority in the case of broadcasts relating to proposals regarding broadcasting which are the subject of public controversy or public debate and which are being considered by the Government or the Minister.</P>
    <P>The section also prohibits the Authority from broadcasting or publishing any matter which may reasonably be regarded as being likely to promote, or incite to, crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State. The present formulation owes a good deal to suggestions made in the course of the Seanad debate which I accepted. This new provision is intended to replace the directive issued by my predecessor under section 31 (1) of the 1960 Act as well as that section itself. That directive will, therefore, lapse with the passage of this Bill.  Normally, the Authority will be left to apply this new provision independently, in accordance with their own judgement. However, because the Government responsible to Parliament must retain <Col N="385" /> the final say in the particularly difficult and sensitive area of the security of the State, I propose to retain, while modifying, the power to issue directions.  I will refer to this again later. Section 3 also prohibits the Authority from unreasonably encroaching on the privacy of an individual.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of other provisions conferring additional powers and independence on the Authority. Section 2 confers greater security of tenure on the Authority by providing that a member may be removed from office by the Government for stated reasons and only if resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Under the existing Act, of course, members of the Authority can be removed by the Government at any time without the necessity to state reasons.</P>
    <P>Section 5 empowers the Authority with the consent of the Minister to appoint advisory committees and advisers&mdash;a power which rests with the Minister under the present Act.  Section 9 provides for payment of net receipts from broadcasting licence fees to RTE for an unlimited period&mdash;rather than for a limited number of years as has been the case under the 1960 Act and later amending Acts&mdash;thus giving the service greater financial security.</P>
    <P>Under section 15 the Authority will have more flexibility in settling the hours of broadcasting and in deciding when advertisements may be broadcast, while under section 22 the Authority will no longer require the consent of the Minister to publish and distribute books, magazines, or recorded aural or visual material.</P>
    <P>I was concerned about the risk of erosion of the Authority's freedom under the system whereby the Minister was the recipient of complaints that the Authority had been in breach of their statutory duty of impartiality, and had unlimited power to judge and act on such complaints.  Since the Minister is a political figure it is clearly undesirable that he should be the sole judge of impartiality in cases which may involve comment on party politics and politicians and even on his own Department.  Nor could the Authority be left as the sole judge as to whether or not they were properly discharging this <Col N="386" /> responsibility.  The Oireachtas itself, under section 2 of this Bill, would be the ultimate judge of the Authority's conduct generally.  But it would be impracticable and undesirable to bring every instance of alleged failure in this area before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The appointment of the RTE complaints advisory committee last year reflects my concern about this problem. This system seems to have worked well and the broadcasting complaints commission provided for in the Bill would give a more precise statutory basis for this solution.</P>
    <P>The commission will be a statutory body, independent of both the Minister and the RTE Authority.  Their independence is reflected in the provision in the Bill that a member of the commission may be removed from office only by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Here much the same principles apply as apply to the removability of members of the Authority itself.</P>
    <P>The commission will deal with complaints alleging that RTE have not complied with the statutory obligations as regards objectivity or impartiality, that they have breached the prohibition on the broadcast of matter which might reasonably be regarded as likely to promote, or to incite to, crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State or that there was a breach of the prohibition on encroachment on the privacy of an individual or that advertisements broadcast by RTE were in breach of the Authority's code of advertising standards.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the Bill provides for retention of power by the Minister to issue a direction in regard to one particular area of broadcasting.  This is dealt with in section 17 which provides that the Minister may issue a direction, by statutory order, to RTE to refrain from broadcasting a particular matter or matter of a particular class which in his opinion would be likely to promote, or incite to, crime or would tend to undermine the authority of the State.  Such statutory order would be subject to annulment by resolution passed by either <Col N="387" /> House of the Oireachtas.  That, of course, is entirely new.  If not annulled it would remain in force for not more than 12 months but could be renewed by order or by a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Minister's power under section 31 (2) of the 1960 Act to direct the Authority to allocate broadcasting time for ministerial announcements will of course remain.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the Minister may direct the Authority to rebroadcast other programme services.  As I have already indicated, I will be introducing amendments on Committee Stage to delete this section and other related provisions.  Since it will no longer form part of the Bill I will not discuss it further here, but I will return to this subject at the end of my speech in order to discuss more fully the implications of the debate which we have had on the subject of television choice.</P>
    <P>On the financial side the Bill contains a number of important provisions.  Section 10 provides for an increase of £11 million in the amount that may be advanced to RTE from the Central Fund for capital purposes. Section 23 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, authorised the Minister for Finance to make repayable advances not exceeding £2 million in the aggregate to RTE for capital purposes. The 1964 Act increased the limit by £1 million to £3 million and it was further increased to £4 million by the 1973 Act.  The present Bill proposes to increase the limit to £15 million.</P>
    <P>The initial capital cost of providing the television service was financed by Exchequer advances, and a few small advances were made in the early 1960s.  No advances were made to the Authority in the years 1964-65 to 1970-71 apart from a small capital advance for the Ballymun multi-channel communal aerial system.  During most of that period the Authority's revenue from licence fees and advertisements was buoyant, mainly because of the increase in the number of television sets in use, and necessary developments were financed in that <Col N="388" /> period almost entirely from internal sources.</P>
    <P>However from 1969-70 onwards there was a falling off in the increase in the number of television sets and the increase in revenue slowed down while expenditure increased rapidly mainly as a result of inflation.  The Authority's financial position deteriorated sharply and despite a number of increases in both advertising charges and licence fees they did not generate sufficient income to finance capital needs.  In the five years 1969-70 to 1973-74 RTE earned a net surplus of about £500,000 out of a total income of some £36.5 million.  Capital expenditure, including expenditure on renewals, in the same period totalled £4.2 million, the bulk of which had to be financed by the Exchequer.  When approved advances to meet RTE's commitment on capital works during 1974 were made, the £4 million limit authorised under existing legislation was exhausted.</P>
    <P>RTE's approved capital programme for 1975 amounts to £3.5 million which includes nearly £1 million expenditure on the second television transmitter network, and £1.5 million on renewal and extension of TV production facilities and regional studios.  RTE have estimated their capital requirements for the five years 1975 to 1979 at £14.7 million at 1975 prices, excluding any extra production facilities needed in connection with the second television channel.  The £14.7 million is made up broadly as follows: £3.7 million for the transmitter network for the second television programme, £1.7 million to renew existing TV transmitters, £2 million for television production facilities and extension of regional studios planned and a further £1.5 million approximately to improve coverage of the existing television service in those areas where reception is below average, a programme which has often been discussed here.  Renewal of other television plant at a cost of £2 million is also envisaged and miscellaneous works on improvement of radio coverage, monitoring and control equipment, buildings, and so on, which RTE consider to be necessary, are estimated at over £3 million.</P>
    <P>RTE could not finance a programme <Col N="389" /> approaching this magnitude from internal sources and it would be unreasonable to expect any organisation to generate sufficient surpluses to finance a major development programme of this kind over a relatively short period.  It must be envisaged therefore that much of future capital investment in broadcasting will have to be financed from outside sources, including repayable advances from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The increase of £11 million on the limit of Exchequer advances provided for in the Bill will enable the Minister for Finance to make available the necessary repayable Exchequer advances to help finance RTE's approved programme for 1975 and capital investment in broadcasting in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Other financial provisions contained in sections 11 and 16 of the Bill enable RTE to borrow in foreign currencies for the general purpose of broadcasting and for current expenditure.  This power can be exercised only with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the Exchequer and Local Financial Years Act, 1974, it was decided that RTE's financial year, which formerly ended on 31st March, should in future end on 30th September.</P>
    <P>RTE earned a relatively modest profit of about £260,000 in the 12 months ended March, 1974, but they ran up a deficit of over £500,000 in the six months April-September, 1974, mainly because of cost inflation.</P>
    <P>Despite the significant increases in television licence fees which came into operation from 1st October, 1974, RTE's present financial position is not healthy.  Like many other organisations their expenditure has soared as a result of higher costs during the present period of high inflation.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the buoyancy of their advertising revenue has been adversely affected by the general economic situation.  They say that they will have a small deficit of £25,000 in the 12 months ended 30th September, <Col N="390" /> 1975, but, although they have made some substantial savings and have plans for more stringent economies, they are seriously concerned about their financial position and have indicated that they will need a substantial increase in revenue from licence fees if they are to break even in their financial year which began on 1st October, 1975.  They have accordingly applied for an increase in licence fees from an early date, and this matter is at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the provision in section 9 of the Bill for payment of net receipts from broadcasting licence fees to RTE for an unlimited period.  This section also provides for payment of net receipts from wired broadcast relay licence fees to RTE for an unlimited period.  These fees which are payable by cable operators under the Wireless Telegraphy (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1974, comprise 15 per cent of annual income from cable systems or £2 a year per connection where there is no identifiable income from a cable system.  Provision is contained in this section also for charging the expenses of the broadcasting complaints commission against receipts from television licence fees.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, contained in the Bill are mostly of a technical kind dealing with a widening of the definition of wireless telegraphy and of the Minister's powers in relation to control of interference caused by electrical appliances.</P>
    <P>The exception is section 18, which provides enabling power to regulate local programme origination for distribution on cable systems.  Quite a number of experiments in relay on cable systems in the Dublin area of locally originated programmes have taken place, as Dublin Deputies are aware.</P>
    <P>I welcome this development, and regard its potential with considerable interest.  It is essential however, that, if local programme origination develops on an extensive scale, it should be subject to statutory regulation and <Col N="391" /> control, including regulation of programme content.  Cable television offers the opportunity for much wider local diversity and thus need not form part of the national broadcasting framework.  Within any one locality, however, the effective availability of channels is very limited.  This is a situation which may change in the long term, but, in the meantime, cable programming will need a framework of control, rather than the degree of freedom which is traditionally available to the Press.  I have in mind that local programmes should be subject to the same type of restraints as those applicable to the national broadcasting service.  It will be possible to arrange this under section 18.</P>
    <P>I should now like to discuss at some length the implications of the long debate which took place in the Seanad and elsewhere on the relative merits of rebroadcasting BBC 1 (Northern Ireland) or an RTE second channel, and, of course, on which much wider issues were quite properly also raised.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I fully accept the public preference shown for the RTE Authority's concept and I will be proceeding accordingly.</P>
    <P>However, I think it is only right that I should explain to the Dáil, as I did to the Seanad, the basis of my general thinking in this matter.  I would also like to dwell a little on the implications of the preference which has been shown, and which are not, I think, generally understood.</P>
    <P>The twin themes on which I have based my policy have been the need to treat broadcasting as a service that is based on popular demand, like all the other media, and a wish to use broadcasting to further what I think we would agree is a primary national concern, that is a greater degree of mutual understanding on this island.</P>
    <P>In matters of broadcasting the state of public demand has to be kept in mind when public policy is formulated or applied.  This is true not only of a view of national culture which would seek to treat Ireland as a unit, but also of any more exclusive view of our national culture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> I would seek to put forward the proposition that there has been a change, perhaps several changes, in the generally accepted view of what the public wants, which has occurred over the past few years.</P>
    <P>This has partly been an evolution in those wants themselves, as when RTE put their ideas across in public discussion.  How such an evolution can occur was evident in the recent debates.  It seemed to me that there was a certain evolution, not only in the more positive public reaction to an RTE 2 but also in RTE's own conception and presentation of what the public wanted and would accept. Discussion is not a one way process, or one-sided in its effects.  During this period also our assessments of public opinion have moved from deputations and letters, the comments of newspaper columnists, through petitions and public meetings, to the kind of systematic assessment shown in the recently conducted opinion survey.</P>
    <P>In general, as regards the evolution of demand, the notice of this has been most dramatically evidenced in recent years by the explosive expansion in multi-channel reception of cable, in those areas where cable has been a feasible option.  Dublin Deputies and many others are well aware of this. This expansion was in conflict with certain narrow definitions of national culture which had gone apparently unquestioned for a long time.  It is fair to say that if these culturally protectionist views, still often heard, had been strongly, sincerely and consistently held, and widely supported, this expansion of multi-channel reception of cable would not have been tolerated.  In fact, it has been given State encouragement from 1970 on.</P>
    <P>By widening the concept of our national culture, by highlighting the importance of cultural pluralism in promoting a wider national identity, the idea of wider access to external channels was deprived of its status as &ldquo;forbidden fruit&rdquo;.  Instead it was possible to debate, as was done recently, the relative merits of systems of control that would either involve direct rebroadcasting of an outside service, or a second national service which, <Col N="393" /> while remaining under RTE control and editorship would consist largely of imported programme material and which was presented by RTE, during the recent debate, as the nearest approach to multi-channel viewing that could be made available in the present single-channel area.</P>
    <P>The latter proposition, as the recent survey shows has been found the more acceptable in the single-channel area. This preference should not, however, be interpreted indeed cannot be interpreted, as a rejection of wider freedom of choice.  On the contrary, RTE 2 was consistently presented as the widest freedom of choice actually available; that indeed was the whole basis of the case made for it.  The RTE official booklet <i>The Second Channel: A statement on television development in Ireland and the question of national choice</i>, published in June 1975, and available in the Library, states as follows:</P>
    <P>On a two-channel Irish service the best selection of programmes from BBC 1, BBC 2, the different ITV channels and other sources would be carried.  This service would, in effect, be a concertinaed version of the British services&mdash;supplemented by other bought-in material and containing a range of new home-produced programmes of a significant kind.  RTE is confident that such a two-channel national service would meet popular expectations while also providing a worthwhile choice of programme for other interests within the national audience.  In RTE's view the criteria of satisfying public demand for as wide a choice as possible and of complying with the statutory national broadcasting obligations can best be met not by rebroadcasting a single external channel but by establishing a second national television channel along the lines set out in this paper.</P>
    <P>This line of argument in more succinct form was given special prominence in the case of RTE 2 which was presented to the sample of viewers including the survey.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from the survey report, in the section, &ldquo;Arguments for <Col N="394" /> RTE 2&rdquo;, the first two arguments used to persuade viewers of the advantages of that service were as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  RTE 2 would be selected from BBC 1, BBC 2, the 15 ITV companies, other overseas sources, and additional home produced material.</P>
    <P>2.  RTE 1 plus RTE 2 would offer single channel viewers a range and variety of programmes as near as possible to those already available in multi-channel areas.</P>
    <P>It has to be assumed, therefore, that those viewers who opted for RTE 2 were opting for a service so defined. The result cannot, therefore, be interpreted as any kind of victory for cultural protectionism or rejection of multi-channel viewing.  The majority who voted for RTE 2, on the case presented for it, were voting for what they saw as the widest freedom of choice available to them.  The minority who voted for BBC 1 were also voting for freedom of choice, but interpreting it differently.  The survey shows no very significant differences between the two groups in terms of class, age, sex or region and probably the differences in general outlook are not as wide as the wilder fringes of this controversy might suggest.</P>
    <P>Now that these questions have been directly faced and answered, we are in a much better position to go forward.  RTE 2, so defined, can now be seen to be the direct choice of those most directly concerned, the individual viewers, rather than a means of protecting them from what they were rather widely presumed to prefer.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, I accept the outcome of this survey as a valid test of public opinion, and shall base my recommendations to the Government upon it.</P>
    <P>I should now like to develop somewhat further the implications of this choice.  This Dáil debate is a culmination of a national discussion on broadcasting which has extended over a number of years.  The crux of this discussion has been, I think, the relationship between our individual preferences as viewers and efforts to formulate a collective national view of what broadcasting ought to be doing.</P>
    <P>During this debate, while the debate <Col N="395" /> was actually going on, this relationship has shifted, giving increased influence to the preferences of the individual.  Broadcasting naturally has its greatest chance to exercise influence in a single-channel situation&mdash;a captive audience.  Once the audience has the choice of a number of channels, whether delivered by broadcasting or cable, the audience and influence of any one programme is split and the mere existence of choice, even complementary or planned choice, reduces the capacity of the broadcaster to lead public taste.</P>
    <P>This Government came down firmly for choice from the beginning.  In October, 1973 the provision of a second television network was authorised, so that the debate about the nature of that choice should not delay the actual provision of the transmission material.  These transmitters are now expected to be ready about the end of 1976.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems in this whole question of television choice is that there had been a build up of rather acute tension between what people appeared to want as individuals and what collective public policy was deemed to require, without either of these concepts, perhaps, being entirely clear.</P>
    <P>The whole history of cable television in this country, has been a history of the abandonment of a series of more or less artificial lines of defence, in which public policy and the institutional interest of RTE appeared intertwined and in continuous retreat. Cable TV systems expanded, through the 10 outlet limit, into Ballymun flats in 1967, then up to a 500 outlet limit in 1970, through that limit in 1973, with the line currently being held against the use of micro-wave links. This continued process of retreat began to look like an elaborate game, perhaps, in which public policy and the RTE interest appeared&mdash;wrongly as we now see&mdash;to be in continual and losing conflict with popular demand.</P>
    <P>As a result of this, an atmosphere was created in which it was difficult to imagine that RTE could actively become the vehicle for a development <Col N="396" /> which was widespread in the east and north and yet had been contested so vigorously in the name of national culture; that is, the conveying of popular British programmes to the south and west.</P>
    <P>Equally, it was difficult to imagine that the process of retreat before the expansion of cable television would not continue, and that popular demand would not lead to a proliferation of micro-wave fed cable systems serving fewer and fewer people at an ever increasing cost.</P>
    <P>In this atmosphere it became fairly widely accepted that popular demand was for direct access to the BBC and ITV channels.  I accepted that view myself, and so clearly did those who, while opposing direct rebroadcasting, also opposed the holding of the recent survey, and sought to discredit its findings in advance.</P>
    <P>Given this conflict between apparent strong popular demand and certain strongly held views on public policy, it clearly made sense to take a fresh look at public policy and what we meant by our national identity and culture, as well as to take steps to ascertain more precisely what public demand was, and precisely what RTE would offer to meet that demand.</P>
    <P>One major discrepancy was that the notion of national culture as traditionally used in the broadcasting context did not altogether coincide with the concept of national identity which was commonplace in the political context.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;National identity&rdquo; has been generally, if loosely, understood as something which applies to the whole island and all its population.  &ldquo;National culture&rdquo; as traditionally used in the broadcasting context, has been, also rather loosely, understood as the culture felt to be prevalent among the population of this State, together with the minority in Northern Ireland.  There has been a great deal of ambivalence and confusion in this area, which has done serious harm both to relations between the two communities in Northern Ireland, and to the prospects of peace and harmony in this whole island.  Out of the growing realisation of the damage and <Col N="397" /> danger caused by this situation, has come a growing sense of the need for better understanding between the two main traditions in this island&mdash;as they actually are not as we might wishfully imagine them to be.</P>
    <P>In broadcasting terms the significance of this is clear; it is not just a question of adequate coverage, of making programmes about Ulster people or reporting their activities and reproducing their views.  It is a question of accepting people as they are with their own understanding of their own identity, creed, aspirations and allegiance.</P>
    <P>There are television services in Northern Ireland and their existence and character reflect the prevalent view there of the nature of Northern Ireland and the interests of its people.</P>
    <P>Many people, of different traditions, now accept, at least in some sense, that there is both a &ldquo;British dimension&rdquo; and an &ldquo;Irish dimension&rdquo; to Northern Ireland.  Broadcasting in this island will have to take account in some way of that pluralism.  A concept of our culture and identity which does not take account of it is less than complete, if we are really thinking, as we usually claim to think, in terms of this whole island and its entire population.</P>
    <P>And in terms of broadcasting it has been long apparent that the population of the eastern and northern part of the territory of the Republic have shared a large part of the broadcasting interests of the population of Northern Ireland.  To regard this as regrettable, as some people do, seems to have depressing implications as regards progress to better understanding with the majority in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I argued rather strongly in the Seanad that, if we aimed to create a society in which the common interests of all the people of this island were recognised&mdash;primarily interests in peace, harmony and progress for all&mdash; it was a necessary precondition to build into the broadcasting system the cultural pluralism which we wish to see reflected in that society.</P>
    <P>In other words, I was arguing that, from the point of view of the national <Col N="398" /> culture, multi-channel television was, in fact, a desirable development.  In principle, RTE, I am happy to say, do not disagree with this, and those who chose RTE 2 in the survey did so on that explicit understanding.</P>
    <P>Having made the case that the national culture would benefit from a move towards pluralism, I invited the RTE Authority to make their case publicly for RTE 2 and to test the reaction of Irish viewers as individuals to that case.</P>
    <P>The RTE Authority did so in TV and radio programmes and in booklet form.  In addition, discussions took place during the summer in a number of centres in the single-channel area, where this debate aroused the most interest for obvious reasons.  I spoke to meetings in Cork, Limerick, Listowel, Clonmel, Westport, and Killarney.  In these debates I presented a case for the people being free to choose between BBC 1 and RTE 2.</P>
    <P>These local debates served a number of useful purposes.  In the first place they countered the proposition that the second TV network should be used for an RTE 2 precisely because BBC 1 would have been a popular channel. That argument was made a number of times by the Opposition and some Independent Members in the Seanad and it never seemed the most democratic of formulations.  It was not often heard in the popular discussion of the matter in the single-channel area.  The argument against popularity was not, of course, appropriate as a response to the greatly increased choice provided by the advent of cable television.</P>
    <P>The meaning of cable television was to shift the balance of influence away from the broadcaster into the hands of the viewers.  One can debate whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. What is clear, however, is that when we seek to match this type of choice through broadcast television, the wishes of the individual viewer have to be taken much more closely into account, and were, of course, so taken, and are now so taken.</P>
    <P>The most important effect of the series of discussions in the summer has been to bring home the reality of what <Col N="399" /> a second RTE channel would be trying to do.  That is something which at the beginning of the debate was not widely understood in the single-channel area.</P>
    <P>As a result of these prolonged explanations, it can be truly said that the RTE concept of a complementary two-channel service drawing most of its additional programming from BBC and ITV sources is now preferred by most viewers.</P>
    <P>Without this discussion and the clarification which emerged from it there would always have been wide acceptance of the view that an RTE 2 was a piece of cultural protectionism designed to prevent people looking at the programmes they actually wanted to see.  As long as that view prevailed in the single-channel area there was a degree of palpable resistance to RTE 2 as the second channel.  It was the achievement of RTE in its ably conducted public campaign to diminish that resistance and degree of irritation and get a hearing, a growing hearing, I believe, for the idea that RTE 2 would work essentially as an anthology of the programmes available to viewers in the multi-channel area.  In doing so RTE spokesmen specifically and firmly repudiated the theme of cultural protectionism as an argument for RTE 2. However, while a series of meetings may generate discussion, everyone would agree that they may not be the most reliable guide to public opinion. The question then arose as to how these individual wishes should be assessed.  In the case of cable TV systems, of course, individual preferences find an expression through normal commercial mechanisms, though the role of the State in progressively permitting these systems is in itself interesting.</P>
    <P>Representations from interested bodies form much of our daily life as politicians, and while this method has its uses, there is always the problem of judging how representative are the bodies in question.  Of course politicians and Governments are there to act as the representatives of their people in the fullest sense.  That is what we are doing here in this debate.</P>
    <P>But the broadcasting field is one, <Col N="400" /> as I have said, where there can be very clear and demonstrable differences between what the individual prefers for himself and what we collectively may feel would be right for the nation.  We are familiar with this situation in many other aspects of political life.  But we should bear in mind, more clearly than perhaps we sometimes do, that the nation is not something different from the individuals who make it up.  Since the preferences of these individuals must form much of the matter of this debate, it is consistent with our functions to have an assessment, as reliable as is attainable, of what those preferences actually are.</P>
    <P>Because of the distinction between collective and individual attitudes and because the content of broadcasting is a matter of individual preference in all the other media of information and entertainment such as the Press, theatre and cinema, I concluded my reply to the Second Reading in the Seanad by inviting RTE to put the question of individual preference to the test.  This has now been done by means of a sample survey.  I have already referred to the results of that survey, their meaning and my acceptance of them.</P>
    <P>The discussion we have had has, I think, rightly focussed much more attention on the role of individual preferences in broadcasting.  The fact that a second RTE channel can now be launched as the preferred choice of the single-channel area, not something imposed on it, is of considerable significance and of positive value both to RTE and to the citizens whose preferences are ascertained and respected.</P>
    <P>Many of the arguments heard in this discussion left RTE 2 perhaps appearing to be the second best solution in terms of preferences, but something to be imposed nonetheless. Some of these arguments may be studied in the report of the Seanad debate, as well as in the Press.</P>
    <P>The atmosphere of resistance from the single-channel area was vividly illustrated by Deputy Robert Molloy <Col N="401" /> when speaking in the Dáil on 23 May, 1973&mdash;Vol.  265, Col.  1772 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>This is a very important matter as far as those people who are only getting RTE reception, that is those people in the west of the country. It is rather disturbing that the Minister is not giving a clear indication as to his priority.  The people who requested that I put down this question, and some of them were on the deputation who met the Minister, are anxious to have multi-channel television before we get a second RTE channel.  I should like to know whether the Minister is committed to doing that before he starts talking about giving us a second RTE channel.</P>
    <P>In this type of atmosphere, when an RTE 2 was apparently being rejected by the very people it was intended to serve, it seemed clear that the essence of the appeal of multi-channel television was direct access at the touch of a button to an alternative source of programming.  I say &ldquo;it seemed&rdquo;.  Now that RTE have made the case for an RTE 2 based on a selection from BBC 1, BBC 2, ITV, overseas and additional home produced material, it has become apparent that the &ldquo;variety of choice&rdquo; element in multi-channel viewing has a higher priority among viewers than the &ldquo;direct access&rdquo; element.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, common ground between us that we would like to seek out and promote those domains in our national life where there is sufficient in common between North and South for an overlap of some kind to be feasible.  We are all aware that this has been possible in certain sectors, such as the traditional ones of religion and sport.  In the communications field, tourism and transport are obvious areas where overlapping and co-ordination are both desirable and feasible between North and South, though indeed some who profess an ideal of unity make a habit of destroying cross-Border links.  Related to the transport field, we enjoy an overlap of the printed media and the important point to notice here is that the <Col N="402" /> pattern of overlap is based on individual preferences.</P>
    <P>In the field of television the existing overlap was geographically limited and was frequently implicitly regarded as undesirable, sometimes explicitly too. Broadcasting has always been closely associated with the State, and the State of its very nature is based on an exclusive territory.</P>
    <P>But in Ireland, our political traditions, our Constitution, the very name of our Twenty-six County State demand that we should explore the relationship between the unitary political State, and the island, containing as it does a plurality of cultural outlooks, political systems, creeds and allegiances.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy J. Lynch, spoke eloquently of the possibility of using broadcasting to explore this area of cultural pluralism, during his speech last year in the Dáil debate on the Northern Ireland situation.  He said in Volume 273, col.  1595, of the Official Report of 26th June, 1974:</P>
    <P>I suggest that, instead of the stated objective of the second RTE channel proposed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the feasibility of a television and radio service which would be neither exclusively British nor, for want of a better term, Southern Irish be examined.</P>
    <P>I suggest further that a body be established to examine the possibility of the three &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; channels, BBC (Northern Ireland), UTV and RTE coming together, instead of RTE 2 as envisaged by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is worth discussing at this point the commonly made assertion, implicit in that quotation, that BBC 1 (Northern Ireland) and UTV are &ldquo;British&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Northern&rdquo; TV channels.</P>
    <P>The first point to be made is of course that a major cultural characteristic of Northern Ireland is precisely that it is inhabited by a large number of people&mdash;a majority there&mdash; who see no contradiction between those two terms.  This concept has <Col N="403" /> been of course traditionally very difficult for us to understand or accept in the Republic.  It would however be fair to say that the mutual incomprehension on this point is perhaps the major failure in communications in this island.  That being so, it was worth considering whether developments in Irish mass communication should not contribute towards bridging this gap.  I think Deputy Lynch did well to focus attention on this point and I hope that he may be able to contribute to this debate for which he was present at the beginning.  I think in fact they have contributed in some degree towards bridging it, through various forms of North-South link up, but there is certainly room for further development.</P>
    <P>In this context it is interesting to note the remarks made in the recent memorandum from the BBC Northern Ireland Advisory Council to the Annan Committee on the Future of Broadcasting, Report of September, 1975, that local Northern Ireland production tended to be characterised alternatively as &ldquo;too Irish&rdquo;, &ldquo;too British&rdquo; or &ldquo;too parochial&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Those who wrote the memorandum saw Northern Ireland as suffering from the particular problem that &ldquo;the threshold of acceptability for opt out programmes seems to vary with the different sections of the community.&rdquo; Thus broadly speaking they say, &ldquo;Republicans prefer more `Irish' programming.  Loyalists resent its displacing `British' programming&rdquo;, as we might expect.</P>
    <P>As in other matters, we often tend to underestimate the extent to which broadcasting in Northern Ireland is a result of its people's tastes.  The clash of identities may be mainly a negative influence, but it can be a powerful influence nonetheless in broadcasting as in other fields.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, one approach which the committee put forward is the concept of &ldquo;pan-Irish&rdquo; programming, reflecting the common aspects of life in Ireland.  They say of this: &ldquo;Scheduling part of the fourth channel simultaneously with the second channel in the Republic might be one way of <Col N="404" /> achieving this without depriving viewers of the principal networks.&rdquo;  It is interesting that that suggestion should have come forward from the Northern Ireland Advisory Council to the Annan Committee.</P>
    <P>The programming of the RTE second channel here will, of course, be a matter for the RTE Authority, who will&mdash;I am sure&mdash;take this view into account.  However, I would like to make one or two observations about it in the context of this.</P>
    <P>The making of co-productions between North and South is of course a trend that I welcome.  However, in so far as the second channel in the Republic is to be used by RTE to expand our intake of British programmes, and the fourth channel in the North might be used for an element of &ldquo;pan-Irish&rdquo; programming, it does not seem likely that these will be identical programmes.</P>
    <P>A two-way flow might be a less constricting concept to aim for, rather than mutually agreed neutral programming.  This would appear I think to be compatible with the ideas which Deputy Lynch has discussed, as well as with the ideas which I believe the Authority to be exploring.  I hope it will be closely and sympathetically examined both in Northern Ireland and here and that there will be close contact between broadcasting organisations in both parts of the island.</P>
    <P>Both sides of the political religious divide can, I think appreciate the other's culture, as long as it is not seen as threatening their status and identity. To avoid that danger is not always an easy matter, especially in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>An interesting sidelight on just how sensitive, delicate and fluid these questions of status and identity are, is shown by the fact that it was thought necessary to state in an introductory note to the NIAC Memorandum:</P>
    <P>This submission is made within the political context of the late summer of 1975.  At this time we have no reason to believe that the principles outlined will not remain valid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> I do not know whether that is not a footnote that should be appended to many public statements on that subject.</P>
    <P>One difficulty to be confronted arises from the fact that the identity of any channel is essentially established by its news service, particularly its local news. Thus, for example, most Northern Ireland TV production effort goes into local news and current affairs programmes.  That is the material which is originated in Northern Ireland, whereas the entertainment and more general material is mainly taken over from the British general network.</P>
    <P>Paradoxically, therefore, an RTE 2, should it exclude this element, would have a greater tendency to draw its BBC material from metropolitan British sources rather than from Northern Ireland.  This would, I think, be a pity, and I think many other Members of the Oireachtas, on both sides would be disposed to agree with that.  As Senator Yeats said in the Seanad at column 304, Volume 80, on 16th April, 1975:</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to suggest that all UTV or BBC or other television programmes that originate and are created in Northern Ireland should be transmitted here, I would be entirely in favour of it.</P>
    <P>The normal flow of television programming does tend to distort our view of, for example, Britain and America because the natural tendency is to import entertainment, since informational programming has often to be local to be felt as relevant.</P>
    <P>That is an understandable and perhaps inevitable tendency though one may sometimes wonder about the relative coverage given to the fictions and the realities of, say, American life. When the question is raised as to whether British programming is not better situated in the context of the realities of its own society the answer is more difficult.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for the value and interest of seeing our neighbours on this island as they see themselves, and studying the intricate relationship of Northern Ireland to Britain at first hand.  These realities <Col N="406" /> are important for us and while we may often profoundly differ in our instinctive approach and in our analysis, it is the knowledge of these differences which is valuable.  RTE have frequently given us direct relays of large set pieces in British broadcasting and British-Irish relationships but the continuing realities of daily life have an important cumulative message too.</P>
    <P>In so far as we wished to expand the area of a wider plurality, the interpenetration of broadcasting offered a number of advantages.</P>
    <P>(1) As I have said, the day-to-day news and current affairs coverage from Belfast would be a major item of British programming which an RTE 2 might be likely to exclude unless a deliberate effort is made to prevent that tendency.  This interplay of news and current affairs programmes between Belfast and Dublin adds a strong element of plurality into the &ldquo;multi-channel&rdquo; areas.  It must be seriously questioned whether it makes sense to speculate about pluralism in politics, if we cannot embrace pluralism in television news programmes.</P>
    <P>(2) One of the major psychological stumbling blocks in the Northern image of the Republic is its picture of a closed and censored society.  This is of course, to a large extent, an outdated image and indeed RTE television has been a major force in bringing that change about.  The debate in the Seanad, however, indicated that some of our public representatives continue to retain this image of ourselves as a culturally protected society or certainly if not that, one that ought to be so.  It will be interesting to see how far similar language may enter into the debate now opening in the House.</P>
    <P>In concluding this part of my statement I should like to come back once more to what still seem to such people the basically opposing concepts of national culture on the one hand and the opening up of broadcasting on the other hand.  It was apparent in the Seanad debate, and in the wider discussions, that there is a minority, but a minority which includes some thoughtful people, who have deep reservations <Col N="407" /> about the whole idea of open broadcasting if by that term we understand, as I understand, the widening of freedom of individual broadcasting choice, and the greater availability of programmes from outside the country.  Let me say here that I remain an advocate of open broadcasting in that sense, and that I see the retransmission of BBC 1 and the selection channel advocated as RTE 2, and now accepted, as alternative ways of advancing freedom of choice in the present single-channel area, and RTE also saw the matter in that light.</P>
    <P>There are, however, those who dislike this whole process, perhaps quite understandably, as tending to reduce us all to the lowest common denominator of common and debased Anglo-American mass culture.  This view is understandable, especially when one contemplates what we feel to be inane or sinister manifestations of that culture, although we should not forget, especially today, that our own culture, even understanding that term in its most insular sense, is itself not lacking in inane and sinister manifestations. But one can understand the appeal of the idea, which sometimes attracted W. B. Yeats, of developing here a unique culture behind a kind of spiritual wall, rejecting the 20th century, and inhabiting &ldquo;our proper dark&rdquo;.  In practice we as a people have not chosen that path.</P>
    <P>We have not chosen to shut ourselves off: quite the contrary, the results of the EEC referendum were clear evidence of that.  Some recent comments, such as a statement by Ogras&mdash;the youth body of the Gaelic League&mdash;published on 27th October, in the <i>Irish Times</i>, have tried to interpret the results of the survey in a contrary direction, saying it showed that people were &ldquo;tired of being pressed to accept foreign opinions and Anglo-American attitudes&rdquo;.  RTE were not of that opinion when they formulated their arguments for a second RTE channel, and only 2 per cent of those questioned rejected both means of conveying BBC and ITV programmes to them.  Both the growth of cable and this whole debate on television choice <Col N="408" /> are evidence that we are not anxious to shut ourselves off either from Europe or from Anglo-American mass culture.  That trend is I believe irreversible; certainly no democratic government has seriously tried to reverse it, though some have sought to project the idea that we were reversing it, and restoring an ancient and exclusive culture, although, in fact, all they were doing was looking the other way while the tide was coming in.  In this way they contributed to raising the double-think content in our actual national culture to a dangerously high level.</P>
    <P>What can our national culture be, when we are already to a great extent submerged in a wider international culture, and submerged in it by our own choice and at our own demand even if we seek, as we sometimes do, to conceal that fact from ourselves. I think the first requirement for restoring a healthy national culture lies in the honest and candid acknowledgement that that situation exists, that our culture can never again be purely national&mdash;if, indeed, it ever was so&mdash;but that it is also part of a wider culture, even if there are many elements in that wider culture which we do not like.  But at the same time there is no need to conceive of that wider culture as a steam-roller reducing all whom it touches to the same monotonous dead-level.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of evidence, both in Europe and elsewhere, of the resilience and versatility under such pressures, also such accepted pressures of national and regional habits, characteristics and even prejudices.  The situation in Belgium, for example, reminds us of these things.  That international culture is in itself uniform enough, but those on whom it impinges are not uniform, and do not respond to it in a uniform, way.  To the extent that we seek to exclude it, or pretend it is not there, we lend it an extra attraction, with all the power of a suppressed reality.  But if we openly accept it as part of our lives, then I think the need for something else, something unique, the peculiarities of our own heritage, is likely to express itself more strongly.  Putting it another way, and somewhat more bluntly, if we can strip the Irish language, and the <Col N="409" /> culture associated with it of the accretions of exclusivism and even the humbug which have surrounded them, and if we can see them as a significant part of our heritage, but neither its totality nor its sacred, dominating element, then spontaneous interest in and love for these things can reassert themselves.  Certainly that concept is reflected in the relevant part of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Too long, in the days of British rule we were taught to be ashamed of speaking Irish.  Too long since independence people have tried to make us ashamed of speaking English.  We now need to stand culturally upright, not ashamed of any aspects of our culture, neither those which are purely Irish, those which we share with our English-speaking neighbours, or those which we share with Europe.  Broadcasting can powerfully help in this process, both through its inevitable international components and through the domestic response of home-produced programmes, both in Irish and in English.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the opinion survey which is deserving of attention is the difference between the urban and rural components of single-channel area. The difference I mean is reflected in the survey in the figures I quoted earlier which show, for example, that the cities of Cork, Limerick and Galway are fairly evenly divided as between the BBC 1 idea and the RTE 2 idea.</P>
    <P>For a start, this goes a long way to explain the contrast between the articulate groups based in urban areas, for whom direct access to an outside channel was seen as an attraction in itself, and the preference of single-channel area viewers as a whole, who are predominantly rural.</P>
    <P>One of the original contradictions in the debate was the call to serve cable TV systems in cities like Cork and Limerick by micro-wave links.  Of course, the question then immediately arose as to why BBC and ITV channels should be transported across the country purely to serve relatively small urban populations.  If this was to be done deliberately in response to public demand, there seemed at first, before <Col N="410" /> we were in possession of the information we have now, no apparent reason to believe that rural tastes were any different from urban ones in the matter of television programmes in the single-channel area.</P>
    <P>Now, however, such a difference has been highlighted by the survey, and, indeed, this corresponds well with the different reactions I got during the series of meetings I participated in. It, therefore, makes much more sense now to study the possibilities here of cable television and micro-wave lengths for the larger centres, Cork, Limerick, Galway and, perhaps, others, since there is evidence that the characteristics of cable TV technology, with its suitability for urban areas, do, in fact, correspond to the pattern of demand among the viewers &mdash;a rather interesting coincidence between technical feasibility and preference.</P>
    <P>One would be reluctant in this country to introduce deliberately any further sources of contention between country and city people, but in the event, on the pattern suggested by the survey, such a conflict does not seem to arise.  Another characteristic of cable TV is that, although it is expensive, the costs are only borne by those who want the full service, while broadcasting has to be paid for through the inflexible method of the licence fee.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the question of an advisory committee.  The Fianna Fáil party have spoken of the need for a single-channel area advisory committee to guide the selection of programmes for the second RTE channel.</P>
    <P>I know the RTE Authority will wish to give this proposal their serious consideration.  This Bill provides for the transfer of power to appoint advisory committees from the Minister to the Authority.  I have already referred to that point.  This amendment.  I am glad to say, was welcomed by Fianna Fáil spokesmen in the Seanad.  Accordingly, it is for the RTE Authority to act on this question and I would not wish to prejudice their decision.</P>
    <P>However, I can see some possible <Col N="411" /> objections to such an arrangement.  The second channel is a second national channel, not the extention to the single-channel area of a service already available in the multi-channel area.  Further-more it is to be run as a complement to the existing channel so that there is to be a single balanced national service on two channels.  Given that this concept has won popular acceptance, I feel it should be allowed to work itself out.  That being so, it may not be considered advisable&mdash;I do not know&mdash; to create a system of committees which would naturally tend to pull in different directions, in order to run a two-channel concept which is intended to be a balanced whole.</P>
    <P>The choice of an RTE 2 in the form chosen has a logic of its own, the logic of complementarity, which during the long public debate was argued by their spokesmen against what was represented, perhaps, a little paradoxically as the strait-jacket of unrestricted competition.</P>
    <P>If there was merit in that contention as holding good against competition with an existing outside service, there is I think all the more merit in it as telling against the deliberate setting up of a service in Ireland designed to compete against RTE.</P>
    <P>I should now like to draw my remarks to a conclusion and I regret having taken so much of the time of the House.</P>
    <P>In opting for RTE 2 as against BBC 1, the survey sample, which I accept as representative, in effect decided in favour of a version of multi-channel broadcasting which would remain under the control of this State as against the direct rebroadcasting of a BBC service from Northern Ireland. This does, however, leave open the question of the relation between such an RTE 2 and Northern Ireland.  In the course of the survey the arguments presented on behalf of the RTE 2 concept did not mention Northern Ireland at all, at least directly.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned, and I believe RTE itself would be concerned, to ensure that the benefit of a contribution to an understanding between <Col N="412" /> North and South should also be pursued and attained by those who are responsible for RTE 2.  In the course of these remarks.  I have tentatively suggested, with the aid of the memorandum from the BBC Northern Ireland Advisory Council, some ways in which this might be approached.  The different aspirations and allegiances of the two main sections of the population of this island make this matter a very difficult one, but also should give it a very high priority in our thinking.</P>
    <P>Among other problems, we have to grapple here with the very ancient problem of the distinction between a nation and a state.  Deputy Haughey, who I am sure will have a significant contribution to make to our debate here, touched on this subject of state and nation in an interesting speech which he delivered recently at University College, Cork, at the conclusion of which he said: &ldquo;It is absurd, therefore, to separate the nation and the State for no better reason than it would appear that a unit of a different size would be preferable or in order to obviate some immediate crisis&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if I entirely understand this formulation or its relevance to our situation, and I hope that the Deputy, if he does choose to intervene, may see his way to expanding it and clarifying it here because it is clearly relevant to this debate on Second Stage.  It would seem to me that our main problems derive, not from considerations of size, or contentions based on them, but from the aspirations and allegiances of people. Our 26-county State, known internationally as the Republic of Ireland, is nationally homogeneous to a remarkable degree but I imagine few Members of its elected parliament would unequivocally affirm that this State constituted the Irish Nation. In Northern Ireland, a significant minority has historically regarded itself as being part of that same nation on which our State is based, but not many of these I think would regard that State as the full expression of their nation.  A majority in Northern Ireland have historically seen the <Col N="413" /> expression of its nationhood not in the Irish State but in the British Crown.  Throughout the whole island there is a tiny but highly dangerous minority, frustrated, confused and angry at these contradictions and their results, who seek to shatter all the State institutions concerned, under the terrible delusion that out of the violent attempt at overthrowing these institutions the unity of the Irish people will in some way emerge. An important source of this destructive and regressive delusion is the widely received notion which I have heard expressed in this House that if the State is not conterminous with the nation then it has no legitimacy. There is no basis for that notion, either in honesty or in logic and in practice it contains within it the seeds of anarchy.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting cannot cure these troubles and may often seem to inflame them.  But the troubles themselves follow in great part from ignorance, prejudice and self-righteousness and these are evils which a serious attempt at mutual understanding can begin to dispel, and is I believe begining to dispel even though slowly, belatedly and in the midst of continuing tragedy. Broadcasting, if sensitively used, in a spirit of dialogue rather than propaganda can, I think, help to promote that better understanding, but a sufficient effort to do will I think require, among other things, closer co-operation between broadcasters and broadcasting services north and south, and the present time seems to be a very good one when the Annan debate is going on there and we have reached this stage of our own debate to press ahead with that.  There would be a great deal more to be said about that aspect of the matter.  I hope that our debate will shed light on it and I hope to come back to it in my reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>I should like before I sit down to pay tribute here to the many Members of the Seanad who contributed, through amendments which I accepted in whole or in part, to the improvement of the Bill which is now before this House. I look forward to similar constructive debate, and further improvements here.  In conclusion, I should also like <Col N="414" /> to pay tribute to the authority and staff of RTE for the manner in which they conducted what might have been difficult and trying debates at the provincial meetings.  The debates were, in fact, well reasoned, good humoured and illuminating, and I believe the spokesmen of RTE convinced the public and deserved to convince them of the merits of the particular proposals which they advocated and which I have discussed here.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> First of all, I should like to thank the Minister for forwarding a copy of the survey and its results.  This Bill has, of course, already been debated on all Stages in the Seanad. On 17th December last the Minister indicated that he proposed introducing a Broadcasting Bill and since then wide-ranging discussions have taken place as to the merits or demerits of the Minister's proposals.  We now know what the wishes of the people are.  We pointed out what our proposals were with regard to a second channel.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated he would accept the people's decision and he has done that, but it must be remembered that the Government and the Minister did favour BBC 1 or UTV.  The public debate over the past three or four months, though useful, has clouded many economic issues.  Attention was focussed on the second channel during a time when the attention of the Government should have been directed to far more serious issues.  I refer to the protection of the institutions of the State, the appalling unemployment situation, rising prices and inflation. As the Minister said, inflation has a very serious effect on the resources of RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government saw fit to pursue this debate.  We have no objection to a scientific survey.  We believe the people should be consulted.  Whether that is the best type of government is problematical.  The Government are elected to make decisions.  I doubt that they could govern very effectively if they were to ask the people what their choice would be on every decision which had to be made.  I doubt that <Col N="415" /> the Minister for Finance will consult the people before he introduces his budget early in January on the question of new taxation which he will have to introduce if he is to rectify the disastrous state of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a very comprehensive statement when introducing this Bill in the Seanad, but he paid very little attention to section 6 which was the most important section so far as the public were concerned.  In section 6 the Minister was taking powers to direct the authority to rebroadcast, in its entirety, a programme from a foreign country.  The entire debate in the Seanad, practically, was confined to the implications of section 6.  The Minister would not agree to amendments put down by Fianna Fáil.  We pointed out that the powers the Minister was taking were too dictatorial. He refused to accept our amendments and then an open debate started throughout the country.  We had no objections to this debate.  I had the pleasure of participating in some of the debates, not all.  We put forward our point of view.</P>
    <P>It was quite obvious from the early stages that the Minister had misread the public feelings and desires.  I am talking in particular about people in the single-channel areas.  If the rejection of the Minister's proposal had come from the multi-channel areas, I would not have paid the same attention to it.  The Minister's proposal was rejected in counties like Mayo and Kerry.  Before bringing legislation into this House, it is the Minister's duty to carry out a survey secretly to learn the feelings of the people.  This Bill occupied a great deal of valuable time in the Seanad.  About three-quarters of the time was taken up by a discussion on section 6.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us today that he is deleting section 6.  He has very little choice other than to delete it.  The people have told him in no uncertain manner that they reject the writing into legislation of the principle that any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has a right to hand over such a valuable resource as our airwaves, in <Col N="416" /> their entirety, to a foreign country.  The people in the cities and in the rural areas made their voices heard in no uncertain fashion.  At the outset we put our case before the people.  We believe they are entitled to a choice of programmes in the single-channel areas. We argued that case in the Seanad and in the public debate.  We wanted to give them the best type of choice, and not just BBC 1 as suggested by the Minister.  The introduction of BBC 1 would not give the people a real choice. When it was explained to them that 40 per cent of the programmes broadcast by RTE are also broadcast by BBC 1, and that this would lead to duplication, the people had no problem in understanding what we had in mind.</P>
    <P>Before formulating his Bill the Minister should have gone into these details. He should have known he was not offering a very wide choice to the people in the single-channel areas. Apart from current affairs and news on BBC 1 there is not a great deal of difference between it and RTE.  The Minister persisted, although he was warned by many of his colleagues in the Labour Party that they did not agree with him.  At a conference of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, members of his own party said they rejected the proposals contained in the Bill.  At that conference only one Senator tried to wave the flag on behalf of the Minister.  The Minister had this knowledge before he introduced the Bill into the Seanad on 12th March, 1975.  He was armed with all this information from his own colleagues.</P>
    <P>He seemed to believe he knew what was best for the people and that he could dictate to them that BBC 1 was the best type of service which could be offered.  When the merits of our proposal were explained to them&mdash;and they were put forward very ably too by RTE&mdash;they realised that the Minister's proposals were not to their advantage. RTE did an excellent job.  If the survey had turned out to be in favour of the Minister's proposals.  I doubt very much that he would be able to deliver the goods having regard to all the objections from the BBC, from British journalists and Irish journalists, the <Col N="417" /> difficulties of copyright and trade union problems.</P>
    <P>Had the survey conducted been in favour of the Minister's proposals I believe he would have been unable to honour his commitment. I am sure the Minister started out with a different concept but, when he saw all the complications involved in the rebroadcasting of any programme in its entirety, he realised the difficulties in which he had placed himself.  It was obvious that where BBC copyrights were concerned, British journalists and the trade unions attached to the BBC had no desire to co-operate in the rebroadcasting of BBC 1.  Here the jobs of RTE employees were at stake.  Had the result been in favour of the Minister this week I do not believe he would ever have overcome the problems involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have carried out research into all these problems before introducing a Bill of this nature and not waste time, as happened in the Seanad where section 6 was discussed for a number of weeks in order to convince the Minister he was on the wrong track and that nobody here would dream of allowing any Minister to hand over our airwaves to a foreign station.  Those are matters which the Minister misjudged.  It is the duty of the Minister to take the right decision with regard to a Bill such as this.  He should ask himself: Am I legislating for the common good of the people? Will this legislation strengthen and improve the institutions in respect of which we are legislating?  If one examines the Bill, as drafted, one will find it was not for the common good.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking about cultural protection.  We are now in the Common Market, an integrated part of European society, and we must broaden our outlook on such matters. The same applies to our people in Northern Ireland.  We must look at their problems and culture and see how they can be embraced in our network.  The Minister mentioned that Deputy Lynch had that in mind <Col N="418" /> already&mdash;embracing the people of Northern Ireland in a cross-Border system of programmes.  We are exercising an outward vision with regard to this matter.  There is no question of our holding narrow cultural views.  But we must cherish our cultures.  Without putting the Minister into a strait-jacket, it is the duty of any Government to protect such cultures to the best of their ability.  We must regard our legislation in a broader, European concept. It was not for that reason that we opposed the introduction of BBC 1 in its entirety.  I have been looking at all types of programmes on BBC for a considerable period, some of which I should prefer my children did not see but that is a fact of life. There are some excellent programmes on BBC and UTV which I hope will be examined closely by the RTE Authority when RTE 2 is established.</P>
    <P>It was the Minister's view that the channels he would like were BBC 1 and UTV.  When introducing the Bill in the Seanad on the 12th March last he expressed his and the Government's opinion when he said, at column 772, Volume 79:</P>
    <P>The Government favour using the second network for transmitting BBC 1 or UTV if, as we hope, negotiations with the British authorities, which have been going on for some time now, are successful.</P>
    <P>It is on that basis that we must examine the Minister's and the Government's thinking on these matters.</P>
    <P>It is the Government of the day who dictate the policy in this country.  It is our duty, as an Opposition, to criticise it.  It is the Government of the day who decide what legislation should be brought into this House and, in so doing, I take it that every Government would bear in mind the benefit of this to the country.  But this legislation appears to be mistaken thinking and bad judgment.  This is not the only bad legislation I have seen in this House this year.  We spent six months earlier in the year discussing legislation which, in my opinion, was detrimental to our economic development.  That was introduced by the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I was merely drawing the attention of the Chair to the fact that a succession of bad judgments have brought the economy to a state of stagnation at present.  The Government of the day would have pushed ahead with this legislation, handing over our valuable assets, had it not been for the voice of the people made loud and clear in this survey: no, you are not going to be allowed to do it.  At least the Minister can be thanked for having put it to the people.  It is quite obvious that the situation would be different had the Minister and the Government had their way.  The second television channel now being established here, needing a capital investment of £2 million to £3 million&mdash; which I presume will have to be borrowed by the Minister for Finance&mdash; may eventually cost £3 million to £4 million.  One estimate based on 1972 figures was £4,500,000 and we know what inflation has done in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Would any Irish Government seriously consider investing £4,500,000 of taxpayers' money and, having done so, hand over that investment to a foreign country?  That is what the Minister had in mind, the Minister, with his colleagues, because it is collective responsibility.  Apart from that, there was also the massive increase in television licences which would follow. If that produced a good programme there might be some merit in it, but it is quite obvious from the research which was carried out that, even at that, the people would have a secondrate television channel.  I think the Minister has grossly misjudged the whole situation.  It is no good for him to come back into the House and say he intends to delete section 6; it is in the Bill we have here.  I know he intends to draw up regulations regarding this matter, but the fact is that he took the decision and intended to go ahead and establish the channel for BBC 1 programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several matters in the Bill which are not that important, some of <Col N="420" /> which I welcome but with certain reservations.  There is the removal of the Authority, which I shall be coming to later.  There are the matters of the complaints commission, open broadcasting, which is provided for in section 6, and the control and content of broadcasting.  There are other sections of the Bill which provide for increasing the capital allowances which RTE can draw upon.</P>
    <P>The Minister had the benefit of the debate in the trade unions on this question of a second channel.  The first time this matter came to light was on 6th December, 1971, in Memorandum No. 26 to the Broadcasting Review Committee, in which RTE recommended the consideration of the case for providing a second national television service.  The first report of that committee deals with four possibilities for programmes: (1) open broadcasting of an external service; (2) a second channel; (3) an RTE monopoly of cable for all the larger centres; and (4) an RTE private company, as at present, to provide multi-channel programmes in larger areas.</P>
    <P>Of these options, the Review Committee at that time came down in favour of No. (2), which was the provision of RTE 2.  The Minister had this advice from the review committee, which was a representative group of people.  Anybody reading the list of members of the review committee would realise they were not politically biased.  I was speaking to a member of that committee who incidentally was not of our persuasion, and he told me that political thinking or political feelings at no time entered into their deliberations.  The Minister, at a later date, expressed a different view.  The members of this committee deliberated for a considerable length of time, three to four years, on this aspect of the broad concept of broadcasting, and their final decision was that the second channel should be under the control of the RTE Authority.  Notwithstanding this comprehensive report, the Minister, in his Estimate speech, at column 873, Volume 265, of the Official Report of 10th May, 1973, said:</P>
    <P>In principle, I favour providing the public with the widest variety of <Col N="421" /> choice that is practicable, both in relation to domestic and foreign programmes.  In that context, I have read with interest the Broadcasting Review Committee's proposal for a second channel which is at present under study in my Department.  I also have some sympathy, however, with those who say the second channel does not meet the needs of those in the single-channel area and who would like to enjoy the same variety of choice as is now available, accidentally, to people in the multi-channel area.  Ideally, I would like to see a much more widely effective freedom of the airwaves over this island.  I would like, for example, not only to have RTE programmes fully available in Northern Ireland, but also to have programmes broadcast in Northern Ireland fully available throughout the Republic.  I have discussed this with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who believes as I do, that such a development would serve to promote better mutual comprehension and thereby serve the cause of peace and reconciliation.  The question is a highly complex one however&mdash;and one which would require the co-operation of a number of authorities and the overcoming of various technical, legal, financial and commercial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I think nobody could dispute the Minister's sentiments as regards Northern Ireland programmes being broadcast in this country and RTE programmes being broadcast in Northern Ireland.  I certainly, and I am sure my party, would like to see this new development taking place.  All that we can see in our television channels regarding Northern Ireland today is the horrid scenes of killing and violence of all descriptions.  This is undoubtedly giving a wrong impression to our children and the people of the younger generation.  I would like to see in this country local programmes relating to Northern Ireland customs and habits, and I am sure there are many people in Northern Ireland who would express the very same feelings as regards programmes from RTE.  These can still be developed and I hope will be developed now that RTE have control <Col N="422" /> of the second channel.  However, there would be no hope of an expansion of this concept which the Minister expressed here if BBC was to be broadcast in its entirety.  I believe that we should broaden our own concept of broadcasting and as I have already suggested&mdash;the Minister mentioned it in his brief&mdash;establish a joint authority or a joint programmes council between north and south and have co-operation on both sides of the Border.  However, if the Minister's proposal were accepted, it would be impossible for RTE to try to develop this concept of broadcasting because they would be too concerned to retain their own audience.  They would have to lean more and more towards popular programmes.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows better than I do that competition in broadcasting is entirely different from competition in business.  Competition in broadcasting, if anything, diminishes and disimproves competition whilst in the private sector, in business, competition is one of the best things you can have.  It was pointed out in the debate over the past three or four months that you must match the type of programme which is broadcast from outside.  This is what RTE would have to do, and they would have to match BBC feature film with feature film, travel film with travel film and they would have no time to concentrate on what the Minister envisaged, in effect, programmes from Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to formulate and implement a regional policy designed to stimulate the growth of the less developed parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing this motion to the Dáil and deploring the failure of the Government in regard to a regional policy because, as I propose to show, the Government have no regional policy.  In addition the progress that was made in that area under the <Col N="423" /> previous Government has been reversed, the EEC Regional Fund is, I submit, being abused by the Government and, small as it is, is not being allowed by the Government to aid the regional development which the country so urgently requires.</P>
    <P>As far as the west is concerned any progress in industrial development or infrastructural development is due to a combination of Fianna Fáil policies and certain economic consequences flowing from those policies.  I referred to this matter in the House on the 16th April, 1969 when speaking as Minister for Industry and Commerce, as reported in Volume 239, column 1614 of the Official Report of that date I said:</P>
    <P>Promoters are now coming here with fairly large scale projects who say to us: &ldquo;We want to go to the west&rdquo; instead of our having to say, as we did heretofore, &ldquo;There are advantages in the west&rdquo; naming the additional grants and so on. There is a change here.  There are a number of factors leading to it.  The point is that it is happening and Deputies will see that this is so in the not-too-distant future I hope.</P>
    <P>I wonder can anybody honestly say that any industrial or infrastructural developments in the west are due to the policies of this Government whose attitude is clearly underlined by the fact that they never have had a Minister and now even have not a Parliamentary Secretary for west of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The development of a regional policy in the country goes back a long way.  Perhaps a convenient place at which one might start a review of this development would be with the publication of the Buchanan Report in September, 1968.  The House will recall that the major recommendation of that report was that we should concentrate the bulk of our resources on two large growth centres, to wit, Cork and Limerick, on the assumption that Dublin would continue to grow and that it did not need the allocation of special resources in order to have it continued as an effective growth centre but merely such resources <Col N="424" /> as would be needed to service its natural growth.  Those resources are, of course, very large indeed. That, as I say, was the major and perhaps the most controversial recommendation of that report.</P>
    <P>I would like to recall to the House that the Fianna Fáil Government issued a statement in relation to the Buchanan Report on the 19th May, 1969.  With your permission, I would like to quote a few of the statements made then.  Paragraph 3 of the then Government statement is as follows:</P>
    <P>A growth-centre programme on the lines recommended by the consultants would have far-reaching implications in regard to physical expansion on development prospects in other areas; the volume of demand on investment resources, public and private; the locational pattern of such investment and future internal population movements.  The Government are concerned to achieve broad-based regional expansion leading to a faster rate of industrial growth and a higher level of employment in industry and services and to keep population dislocation to the minimum consistent with these objectives.  It has been decided, therefore, that the consultants growth-centres recommendations should be further considered in the context of proposals for regional developments generally.</P>
    <P>The Government of that time then went on to indicate the steps they had decided to take in regard to regional development.  The beginning of paragraph 4 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government consider that the potential of every region should be exploited to the full, including the potential of those cities and towns which can develop as growth centres.  Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 the council of every city, town and county is required to prepare a development plan for its area, and those plans have been made in practically every case.  The Act provides for the co-ordination of the development plans and, for this purpose, the country has been <Col N="425" /> divided into nine planning regions. A regional co-ordinating body has already been established in the Limerick Region, and the Government propose that co-ordination groups should now be established in all regions.  The main function of these groups will be to coordinate the programmes for regional development in each region.</P>
    <P>That paragraph then went on to specify the nine regions concerned.  In paragraph 5 the statement continued:</P>
    <P>In their drive to achieve full employment and to reduce emigration, the Government will seek to ensure, as far as possible, that new industrial and service employment opportunities will be created locally in order that population increase and people seeking alternative employment will be able to find work in convenient locations.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from that statement that the Fianna Fáil Government at that time rejected this concept, which was the major recommendation of the Buchanan Report, and favoured a much more widespread development, for the various reasons touched on in the quotations.  I have given, but operated through effective regional planning based on nine planning regions into which the State was divided.</P>
    <P>The wisdom of that decision might be questioned.  I believe that development since and economic studies since tend to support the wisdom of that decision rather than otherwise and to cast further doubt than then existed, which was substantial at that time, on the wisdom of the major recommendation of the Buchanan Report. As I said, that statement was issued in May, 1969 but even prior to that I had already announced plans to regionalise the work of the Industrial Development Authority and in response to an interjection from a Deputy in the House I described briefly the position as we envisaged it as reported at columns 1613 and 1614 of Volume 239, 16th April, 1969 of the Official Report.  The quotation is as follows:</P>
    <P>It will mean that within the <Col N="426" /> region in which Mayo will be situated there will be a local IDA office charged with the promotion and development of industry within the region.  There will be an organisation involving co-operation between the local authorities concerned and any of the bodies within the region concerned with industrial development.  This is aimed at decentralising to some extent the industrialisation programme, utilising local knowledge, initiative and enthusiasm and ensuring that there are people responsible, directly concerned with and having a knowledge of the local conditions within the region, as distinct from depending on the overall responsibility exercised heretofore from Dublin.  I feel this can make for a considerable change in approach to each region.</P>
    <P>In fact, we went on to implement that.  I would point out that the attitude of the Government at the time recognised the vital role of local authorities in any regional policy because the provision of roads, sewers, water, housing and, indeed, general planning considerations&mdash;are vital to regional development.  That role was recognised in the structure outlined and set up.</P>
    <P>Prior to that also and as part of the then Government's development of regional policy, I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, had initiated the small industries programme in 1967 and subsequently, after a trial period, we extended it to all areas of the country except Dublin.  That programme has been very successful. Thousands of jobs have been created under it in towns and villages and rural areas throughout the country and almost all of them have been created as a result of Irish skills and Irish enterprise.  But the Coalition Government recently extended the operation of that programme to Dublin so that there is now no incentive under that programme to locate in the west, certainly no particular incentive as there was before.  I have personal knowledge of projects under that programme which were located in less developed <Col N="427" /> parts of the country and would have been located in Dublin but for the provision that we operated in regard to that programme&mdash;that it would not operate in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the whole approach of this Government is Dublin-oriented and for political reasons, not for any reasons of economic policy or an assessment of what is in the best interest of the country.  The people of Dublin will not thank this Government for that because what the Government are doing is contributing to the huge growth of Dublin with the very unpleasant living conditions that can bring about, with the appalling traffic problems it can create and with the enormous cost of land and roads involved.  Other consequences are the social disruption in Dublin as has occurred and is occurring on a much bigger scale in other cities in other parts of the world because no country has yet learned how to operate effectively urban living conditions in large cities so that the quality of life will be satisfactory for most of its inhabitants.</P>
    <P>Like other countries, we have not learned to master that problem yet&mdash; if it ever can be mastered&mdash;and the policy pursued by the Government is accentuating that problem.  On the other hand in rural areas, in towns and villages throughout the country, that policy is totally disrupting the social fabric.  I believe any Government worthy of the name would be concerned about that and would be trying to remedy it or at least stem the flow instead of which this Government are trying to accentuate it by such actions as extending the small industries programme to the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>This is another example of the extremely defective judgment of this Government, the mismanagement by them which is illustrated only to clearly in their handling of the economy generally and that in this instance also we have grave mismanagement indulged in purely for what the Government regard as a short-term political gain.  Members of the present Government when in Opposition were continually pressing <Col N="428" /> us who were then in Government in regard to the Buchanan Report and in regard to the policy of growth centres. As I indicated briefly in the quotations I have given from the statements of the Government at that time regarding the Buchanan Report and in regard to the policies then announced, initiated and implemented, the attitude of the then Government was quite clear&mdash;that it was opposed to those recommendations of the Buchanan Report.  Members of the present Government professed great concern then.  I think in particular the present Minister for Finance was one of them; certainly the present Minister for Foreign Affairs was very active in this field and Deputy Barry Desmond, chief Whip of the Labour Party was another and is on record in another debate in this House as referring to himself as being blue in the face asking questions on this subject.  It is interesting in the light of that&mdash;Deputy Barry Desmond going blue in the face asking these questions &mdash;to consider the position since the Government took office.  It should be remembered that when in Government we made our position clear and we acted as I have outlined but what have this Government done or said about a national regional policy?  There are few topics on which this Government have been short of words&mdash;there are a few but not many&mdash;and this appears to be one of them.  As far as I know there has not been one word from any member of the Government on this question of growth centres and the kind of policy that should be adopted and implemented in that regard.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the Government stand in regard to growth centres, in regard to the recommendations in that regard in the Buchanan Report.  I invite the Minister for Finance to avail of the opportunity of this debate to let us know where the Government stand in that regard.  It may be late in the day but better late than never.  In the absence of any statement from the Government I suggest their actions speak very loudly for them.  Some of their actions indicate their attitude, including the opening of the small industries programme to Dublin, as I mentioned, and the grabbing of the <Col N="429" /> EEC Regional Fund for the benefit of the Exchequer.  If it is the Minister's contention that that is not what is being done, perhaps he will indicate what items of ordinary expenditure on infrastructural or industrial development have been or will be increased by the amount received from the EEC Regional Fund.  If that cannot be indicated, it would seem clear that the ultimate destination of any moneys received from the EEC Regional Fund is the maw of the Exchequer and not the development of a regional policy here.</P>
    <P>It is notable that in the announcement made by the Government recently concerning projects in respect of which they are receiving repayment from the EEC Regional Fund there was little or no regard for infrastructural needs.  Out of a sum of almost £6 million, £470,000, according to the Government's statement, will go to disadvantaged areas infrastructure.  I have no doubt that if analysed it would be quite revealing but we must assume, in the absence of any information to the contrary, that it is going for what one would normally understand as infrastructural development in disadvantaged areas.  Even if it is it is £470,000 out of almost £6 million.  The actions of the Government in this and other regards speak loudly as to their attitude to regional development.</P>
    <P>Nobody could contemplate a regional policy for this country and the application of EEC funds to aid that policy without envisaging quite substantial, and hopefully, if we could get the fund up to a proper size, massive investment in infrastructural development here.  Any little thought given to this subject will show that this is not only desirable but essential if there is to be any real regional policy and regional development here.  Yet, the first allocation announced by the Government shows £470,000 out of almost £6 million for infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>That statement indicates that other money will be going for infrastructure but it is also described, correctly, as infrastructural projects directly related to industrial development.  That is not the kind of infrastructure one is talking about when one is speaking of regional <Col N="430" /> development.  Many industries have in the past, and will in the future, require certain infrastructural development, a road, a special water supply or a sewerage scheme for that project. There is nothing related specifically to regional policy and the infrastructural development that one would envisage under regional policy involved in that.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most telling action of the Government in regard to alleged regional policy is the spread of these projects throughout the country.  In a debate we had some months ago in regard to the EEC Regional Fund we had contributions from Deputies Barry Desmond and John Esmonde from the Government side and they made it clear that they thought the EEC fund for regional development ought to be used in or close to their respective constituencies.  Deputy Esmonde was specific about a particular area in his own constituency.  I cannot say that Deputy Barry Desmond advocated that the fund should be used in Dún Laoghaire but he went close to that.  In all fairness to him I have a copy of a report of a debate in 1969 in which Deputy Barry Desmond argued very strongly that we should concentrate industrial development in the Dublin area, stretching from Balbriggan to Bray, and forget the rest of the country.  He is being consistent in this regard.  Whatever view one takes of that argument one cannot call it the implementation of a regional policy by an Irish Government.  All the factors to which I adverted previously, social disruption and the economic cost, should be considered in this kind of approach.</P>
    <P>Whether one agrees or disagrees with the views put forward, it cannot be called the implementation of a regional policy.  I should like to remind the Minister that he and his party and I, and members of my party, campaigned to urge people to vote in favour of joining the EEC. The people did so, rightly in my view, but both parties in that campaign laid great stress on the possibilities inherent in the establishment of an EEC Regional Fund.  I challenge the Minister, or anybody on the Government benches, to indicate any speech made <Col N="431" /> at that time from their side of the House, or from this side, which would give any listener an inkling that what was involved was the expenditure of money throughout the country in small dribs and drabs mainly on such things as industrial grants or the recoupment to the Exchequer of money already spent on industrial grants. That is not what we represented a regional fund as being capable of doing for this country.  We clearly indicated to the country that we would be able to utilise it for large scale developments benefiting the poorer parts of the country, especially the west but not confined to the west. That is not what has happened.  I regard it as getting close to a fraud on the voters to implement the EEC Regional Fund in that way.</P>
    <P>We had a statement from the Minister for the Gaeltacht, who I am glad to see is present, in regard to the setting up of a western development board outside of the Gaeltacht. Although it is proper for that Minister to operate outside the Gaeltacht, it was he who announced that.  I would suggest that board are likely to produce the same benefits as the activities of the Minister for the Gaeltacht have produced for the Gaeltacht, that those areas will be the recipients of a very astute, well conducted, clever public relations campaign but that they will not be the recipients of any worthwhile developments or benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht may remember speaking in this House in July last and claiming various projects and job creations and that Deputy Molloy, among others on this side of the House, analysed those claims and pointed out that they replaced plans announced six years previously.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht undertook to reply to those points.  He was asked on a few occasions if he were doing it and he said he was writing a letter to explain the matter, but he had not done so up to last weekend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the real matter at issue here is do this Western Development Board constitute even an attempt towards the development of a regional policy by this Government?  I suggest they do no such thing.  There is no indication of the provision of any money for this board, no indication of what their powers will be, of what the role of the IDA, and in particular of their regional offices, will be in relation to this board, or of what the role of county development teams will be and of the local authorities.  There has been no indication of the role of agricultural development programmes in relation to the activities of the board.  There is no indication of which planning regions will be covered by the board&mdash;will it be one or more of the nine planning regions announced by the previous Government in the statement I have referred to, or are the Government proposing to abandon those planning regions, and if so which are being abandoned and why, and which are being adopted and why?</P>
      <P>If the Minister for the Gaeltacht expects to have any credibility whatever attached to his statement he should spell out the answers to at least some of these questions.  We need a national regional policy anyway, quite apart from the EEC, but we also need it in order to make the best use of the EEC Regional Fund instead of unplanned, non-regional use as we have had and as was shown in the recent Government announcement in relation to the projects which were the subject of the first allocations from this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the Government have been at some pains to describe the amount of money coming from the regional fund as being a pittance.  Other such terms have been used in relation to it.  There is no doubt we should all like to see the sum available vastly <Col N="433" /> increased, but surely if the sum involved is small this is all the more reason why the Government should concentrate its use and so get the maximum benefit from it instead of scattering it around various parts of the country, be they developed or undeveloped in our context.</P>
    <P>Article 6 of the fund regulations requires the Government to furnish a national regional development programme to the Commission.  I should like to know what has the Government done about it and if they intend to publish such a programme and get comments on it from around the country before submitting it to Brussels.  I suggest it is typical of the Government and of their efforts at pulling the wool over the eyes of the people that they have failed to disclose how much aid under the regional fund is designated for each region.  Other member States have not approached it in that way.  Why do the Irish Government take that kind of stand?  Seven projects have been named for Mayo but the amounts involved appear to be a State secret.  I suggest that is contrary to Article 14 of the fund which provides that in publicising infrastructure programmes member States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that assistance from the fund is given suitable publicity.  Ireland seems to be the only member State which does not stipulate the amount of aid going to individual projects.  The Government appear to be simply scattering the relatively small amount available at the moment from the fund on small projects throughout the country, thus depriving any one area of effective assistance from the fund.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the outline of the situation I have given, though it cannot be as detailed as I should like because of time limitation, is sufficient to show that prior to the change of Government there was in being the elements of an effective national regional policy, that it was being implemented, and that from the time of the change of Government there has been no announcement of policy, no development of policy and in so far as there has been, it has been going backwards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> For those reasons I suggest that this House should deplore, as I request in in this motion, the failure of the Government to formulate or implement a regional policy designed to stimulate growth in the less developed parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most significant that Deputy Colley has nobody to second his motion.  So shallow is the Fianna Fáil performance that they have not even enough interest to send any Deputy into this House to back Deputy Colley, still less to utter one word in his support.  It does not surprise me because this is the second time this year Deputy Colley has tried to mislead our people about the regional fund.  For a long time past we have been alerting our people to the seriousness of our current economic position and to the magnitude of the national effort which will be required to overcome these problems and to extricate ourselves from our passing difficulties.  In fairness to the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, he has endorsed the Government's warnings.</P>
      <P>A responsible Opposition and in particular, a responsible Opposition spokesman on Finance, would play their part in bringing home the reality of our economic situation to the people and in creating a national will to solve those problems.  But this is not what Deputy Colley has chosen to do in this the second week of the current Dáil term.  Instead of debating the real economic problems he has chosen to put down once again a vague, condescending and patronising motion, misinterpreting the EEC provisions in relation to regional aid and misleading the people once again along the foolish Fianna Fáil path that words, reports and mere verbiage about regional policy is an adequate substitution for action.  I do not believe the people will accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil put down this motion not because of any concern for the people of the west or the disadvantaged regions but simply because of <Col N="435" /> the West Mayo by-election.  They know they are going to lose this by-election and the only way they can think of to stave off defeat, which would be of gigantic proportions, is to attempt to mislead the people of the west.  However, the people of the west are not easily fooled.  They know what has been done by this Government to ease their conditions of life and offer them sustainable employment for the future.  They see how this contrasts with the very small amount done by the previous Administration.  They showed their contempt for Fianna Fáil in the last general election and they will show it in West Mayo in a few weeks time.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is the second time this year Deputy Colley wasted the time of the Dáil in putting down motions on regional policy.  In June last the Deputy and his colleagues questioned this Government's regional policy in a Private Members' Motion. We had no difficulty at that time. showing how ludicrous that charge was.  I was unable to be present then but I am glad to say the debate was handled in his usual brilliant fashion by the late Deputy Henry Kenny, my Parliamentary Secretary.  He, with his inimitable wit and ability showed how ludicrous was the Fianna Fáil position.  It is ironic that it was the death of Henry Kenny which precipitates the coming by-election and that that occasion should be used by the Opposition to return to the charge. Deputy Kenny had far greater knowledge of the west than Deputy Colley will ever have and he dismissed the Opposition's charge as baseless.  I believe the people will endorse Henry Kenny and his son in a fortnight's time if only to demonstrate their contempt for the Fianna Fáil line.  The only reason they are returning to this issue when there are so many others on the Order Paper is because of the West Mayo by-election.  That is perfectly clear and I do not think that even they have the temerity to deny it.</P>
    <P>I will give facts to show how false is their charge.  If they show nothing else they will show that Fianna Fáil <Col N="436" /> are gluttons for punishment.  Fianna Fáil have always confused action and the appearance of action.  It is this confusion which represents their attitude in regional policy.  When Fianna Fáil were in power there was a certain amount of verbal activity in the regional policy area.  Impressive and weighty reports were prepared by experts and published at enormous public expense.  There was a great deal of talk about how concerned they were about development.  But what came of all this?  Precious little.  When the reports came in and presented the Fianna Fáil Government with real concrete questions and decisions, they were pigeon-holed.  The classic example was, of course, the Buchanan Report.  This was published in 1969. The Government had no idea what to do with it.  They put it on the long finger for three long, tardy years.  We have clearly displayed that this Coalition Government have a different approach.  We believe in action, which speaks a lot louder than words.  The Opposition attitude, as has been demonstrated by Deputy Colley, has clearly not changed.  This motion shows that for them regional policy is what it has always been to them, a convenient platform from which from time to time they can endeavour to obtain rural votes.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have made much play from time to time of the Government's unwillingness or inability to obtain and use regional fund moneys. They accuse the Government of having no regional policy and have suggested that we were unable to put forward projects which would meet requirements of the EEC fund regulation, thus enabling us to benefit from the funds allocated to Ireland at the December, 1974, Paris Summit. This has been shown to be rubbish of the first order.  Apparently it is once again necessary to tell Fianna Fáil, and anybody else who may be mislead by them, that Ireland was the first of the nine EEC countries to lodge in Brussels a detailed list of regional projects.  We were ahead of Europe and it was not thanks to any preparation made by Fianna Fáil before they went out of office.  Within the past fortnight the European Commission <Col N="437" /> decided that the long list of projects which the Government submitted should qualify for fund assistance.  I suppose the Opposition realised when making these irresponsible accusations that they could damage our national interest in Brussels if the Commission took them seriously. Happily the Commission, like the people of the west, do not take Fianna Fáil seriously.</P>

      <P>The second false accusation of the Opposition was that the Government intended to give the west a bad deal in sharing regional funds.  Last June I said that was untrue and, at that time the Parliamentary Secretary said it was untrue.  We said we would give special priority in dispersing the funds to projects in the less-developed regions.  I spelt out what those regions were.  I named them county by county and, in some cases, district by district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Seventy-three per cent of the projects which the Commission have accepted for regional fund assistance, representing 65 per cent of the fund assistance committed, are in Mayo, Clare, Galway, Donegal, Kerry, Leitrim, Roscommon and similar designated areas.  Roughly onethird of the national population resides in these areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the amount of regional fund aid committed per head of the population is over four times as high in the west as <Col N="438" /> in the rest of the country.  For Mayo the amount received in regional fund aid per head of the population is five times greater than the average.  This is a far higher concentration of help on western problems than has ever been given by the Industrial Development Authority under any of the schemes they operate, including the small industries scheme to which Deputy Colley referred.</P>
      <P>County Mayo has received the largest grant of any county, almost £900,000 out of an allocation of £5.9 million.  Deputy Colley has acknowledged that the allocation is a mere flea bite in the public capital programme and in the tens of millions of pounds the Government are directing towards the western, less developed regions of the country.</P>
      <P>The European Commission have confirmed that Ireland is abiding by the regional fund regulation and their decision to commit fund assistance to our projects backs this up.  I asserted that that would be the case and the fact that the money has been allocated to us confirms that all the malicious accusations that have been made against us are totally false.  The Commission will not pay money for regional fund purposes unless the expenditure conforms to the EEC requirements and that includes the provision that money spent must be in addition to what the national Government would otherwise spend.</P>
      <P>The line Ireland has taken in this matter has been supported by other member States.  The Opposition suggested there would be some difficulty in obtaining fund receipts for Ireland.  Our track record shows clearly that so far we have been the most efficient of all the member States of the EEC in submitting projects for Commission approval and in obtaining that approval.  We intend to maintain this record, which is living proof of the falsity, of the mean and unjustified allegations made against us by a discredited Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some other facts that must be stated.  First, when the political decision to establish the regional fund was taken last Dec- <Col N="439" /> ember in Paris by the heads of state and Government, this Government reacted immediately by settling the 1975 public capital programme at a level £8 million higher than it would otherwise have been because that was the sum allocated to Ireland in respect of regional aid for 1975.  Incidentally, all that £8 million will not be received from the Commission in 1975 but notwithstanding that we increased the allocation by £8 million.</P>
    <P>Secondly, this country was the first member State to submit the annual statement in lieu of the regional programmes required under Article 6 (6) of the fund regulation.  Thirdly, when the way was cleared for the submission of applications for fund assistance following the first meeting of the Regional Fund Management Committee in July, 1975&mdash;and it was no fault of this country that the effective decisions regarding the fund were not taken until July, 1975&mdash;Ireland was again the first member State to submit a formal request for a fund contribution.  Indeed, Commissioner Thomson, the commissioner in charge of regional policy, at his Press conference last week when announcing the first Commission decisions on projects submitted by member States remarked that Ireland was &ldquo;very quickly&rdquo; off the mark&rdquo; in submitting its claims.  He said that as a result Ireland would receive 73 per cent of its 1975 entitlement from the initial allocation.  This is a higher percentage than for any other member State.  In everything Ireland has been first.  There are nine countries in the league and we are first in all cases, in our applications, in getting them accepted and in getting money for them, but apparently Fianna Fáil are so begrudging that they are not prepared to give credit where credit is due.  It is surely due to us that we have been the first in all stages in relation to the regional fund operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, I should like to remind Deputies that the decision by the Commission to commit support to projects does not of itself start the <Col N="440" /> flow of regional fund finance to member States.  Before cash transfers can commence, member States must lodge payment claims with the Commission in respect of national expenditure which has already taken place on these projects.  Fianna Fáil know that. They know we must spend the money and prove we spent it before a farthing, a franc or any form of currency can come from Brussels. There can be no payment by Brussels to us until we have first spent the money.  Fianna Fáil sit there and they know this but they keep on persisting in the falsehoods for which they are deservedly famous.</P>
      <P>In relation to presentation of proof of payment, this Government recorded another &ldquo;first&rdquo;.  We lodged our first payment demand on the day on which Commissioner Thomson was announcing the first Commission decisions on projects.  This also demonstrates the wisdom of the Government's policy of putting forward the type of projects from their ongoing expenditure programme.  It is the one sure way of making certain that we establish our claim to and actually receive fund aid with minimum delay.</P>
      <P>There is ample evidence of the increased scale of the regional development effort which this Government have made.  The most graphic illustration is to be found in the operations of the IDA.  Under this Government IDA plans have been implemented on an unprecedented scale.  We have provided the resources that made it possible for the IDA to execute their plans.  Since we came to power the annual allocation for industry under the public capital programme has more than doubled from £33 million in 1972-73 to £67 million in the current year.  It is this Government's intention that expenditure on industry will continue to increase.  In the period April, 1973 immediately after we took office, to December, 1974 a significant rise in the level of IDA grant approvals took place.  The expenditure following on these approvals will fall to be met in this and succeeding financial years and it will be met.  It will have top priority with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only have we made it possible <Col N="441" /> for the IDA to implement their plans, but they have been implemented at a faster pace in the underdeveloped areas than anywhere else, notwithstanding Deputy Colley's tortuous allegations to the contrary. Under the plans job manufacturing targets for each of the regions were set for the period 1973-77.  The IDA plans set out to locate in four less developed regions, Donegal, the north-west, the west and the midlands, one-fifth of new manufacturing jobs.  The recent record of grant commitments shows that a much higher proportion, one-quarter or 14,000 jobs, has been won for these less developed regions.  We have done better in two years than the IDA or our predecessors had ever expected could be done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Grant commitments take some time to be transformed into job creation but we have done much better than any of the forecasts suggested.  In the last two years these four less developed regions gained over 58 per cent of the net national increase in jobs in manufacturing industry instead of the target of a mere 27 per cent that was there when we took office.  In other words, the pace of creation of new jobs has been accelerated, particularly in the regions we are concerned to help under our greatly improved regional encouragement.  We have operated substantially faster than had been intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course none of this happened by accident.  The western region, and Mayo in particular, has gained and will gain markedly from these developments.  For the first time there is now a sizeable industrial sector in the west.  For instance, there are 480 manufacturing enterprises, large and small, in Mayo and Galway which employ 11,000 people.  In the last two years the total number employed in <Col N="442" /> manufacturing industry in these counties has increased by one-quarter, notwithstanding the world recession.  Two of the biggest industrial plants recently attracted there, the Asahi and the Hollister projects, are to be located in Mayo.  These are remarkable achievements which show to be true what the parties of the National Coalition believe and have always believed, namely, that it is possible to create a modern industrial structure in the west which supports but does not destroy its traditional social fabric.</P>
    <P>The work done by the Minister for the Gaeltacht and by the late Parliamentary Secretary, Henry Kenny, in two years has far exceeded anything, even in Mayo alone, achieved by two Fianna Fáil Ministers in the area in a period of 16 years.  This increased emphasis on the west is the greatest evidence possible that this Government are giving greater attention to the problems of the west than has ever before been the case.  We did not have to go through the contortions indulged in by our predecessors of commissioning reports but doing little else.  We simply got on with the job, leaving the ballyhoo to them.</P>
    <P>Infrastructure is essential to the development of industry.  Factories need water supply, sewerage, good communications facilities and houses for workers.  In addition, schools, hospitals and so on have to be provided.</P>
    <P>It is easy to show that the regional development effort has increased substantially since we took office.  The money spent under the public capital programme for housing has more than trebled since 1972-73; that for sanitary services has increased by 64 per cent, and that for roads by 37 per cent.  The underdeveloped regions have benefited substantially from these increases.  In the present year the capital allocated to five underdeveloped regions&mdash;Donegal, north-west, west, mid-west&mdash;and midlands is £37 million, of which £24 million is for housing, more than £5 million for sanitary services and almost £8 million for roads.  More than £7 million has been allocated to the west region alone&mdash;more than £4 million for housing, <Col N="443" /> £1.3 million for sanitary services and £1.7 million for roads.</P>
    <P>Some of the biggest sanitary services projects in the State are under way in these regions.  For example, there is under way a big water supply scheme at Ballina-Killala.  This is required primarily in connection with the Asahi development and will cost more than £2 million.  Also there are water supply and sewerage schemes in Letterkenny which are programmed for completion this year at an estimated cost of more than £1 million.  Both of these schemes are required because of the introduction to these areas of major new industrial projects.</P>
    <P>The degree of the Government's commitment to the development of the west is shown by the recent announcement of the Minister for the Gaeltacht that we have decided in favour of the establishing, following full consultations with all the interests concerned, of a western development board.  The Minister and the Taoiseach have both outlined the functions of the board.</P>

      <P>These developments have taken the Opposition by surprise and have led them to make the charge that it was the Mayo by-election that induced the Government to announce their decision.  However in March, 1971, Fine Gael drew up a policy document, entitled <i>A Policy for People,</i> which was concerned with the creation of jobs in industry throughout Ireland with special reference to the west and other underdeveloped areas. This document proposed that there would be created a development board, the efforts of which would be concentrated on the less developed parts of the country.  Our colleagues in Government, the Labour Party, presented a report on western development to their annual conference in 1971 which said that the Labour Party would establish a regional development board for the west.  The <Col N="444" /> securing of a regional development policy for the west and other neglected underdeveloped regions was one of the 14 points of the Coalition manifesto.  Therefore, before we were in Government we were totally committed to the implementation of a western development board.</P>
      <P>On February 28th last I spoke in Westport and said that the Government were anxious to ensure only the best possible structures, operations and personnel practices in the development of the west.  Do not let Fianna Fáil say they did not know that I spoke then because I was queried on the matter in this House by Deputy Gallagher and joining in the fun at that time were Deputies Haughey and Cunningham who supported Deputy Gallagher in these questions.  They received satisfactory answers because they remained silent on the matter until we copper-fastened our policy with a formal decision issued by the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  I said in my reply last April that the question of co-ordinating all aspects of western development was being considered in the broader context of the distribution of functions of Government at sub-national levels.  This involves consultation and the Government are proceeding with these consultations. When the board come into being it will be seen as a more than satisfactory substitute for the multitude of organisations and agencies which are operating and overlapping in this area.</P>

      <P>Tonight the country must stand aghast at the effort of the man who, as Minister for Finance, is in charge of what should be our regional policy.  The amount we are to get from the regional fund has been described by the Minister for the Gaeltacht as a miserable pittance.  But the people were shocked to learn that the projects which are to benefit from the fund are none other than those started <Col N="446" /> and completed by Fianna Fáil.  The motion before the House reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to formulate and implement a regional policy designed to stimulate the growth of the less developed parts of the country.</P>
      <P>I come from a western seaboard constituency, but I can tell the Government that their blackguardly approach, based on the gullibility of the people of the west, will not be heeded.  Such bluff as we have just listened to will not work.  We want spelled out what we are to get.  We want a programme.  Donegal, for example, is not to benefit in any way from the project.</P>
      <P>This motion is for the purpose of pressing the Minister into spelling out a policy.  The Government have spent the money on projects started by us and the only excuse the Minister could give was that the fund is conditional on an equal amount of money being made available for extra work, work which, I take it, has not been planned and which would not ordinarily be carried out.  What is to be work?  This is the question to which this motions relates.  What is to be done in lieu of the projects that are being supported now?  This is the information that we want from the Minister, not talk of factories which, by the grace of God and the help of the IDA, are in existence.  There are also a few advance factories which we built and financed in our time. These are referred to as projects.  In Donegal, for instance, we hear of an advance factory in Ballyshannon benefiting from the regional fund but that factory has been in operation for almost two years.  It was built by us and as a result, to a large extent, of the efforts on my part at the time.  I defy contradiction on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is what Fine Gael are going to take credit for.  This is what is supposed to come under the heading of infrastructure development.  When we come to the disadvantaged areas infrastructure we meet the Ballyshannon factory again.  That firm opened there a year ago.  Who does <Col N="447" /> the Minister think he is codding in this misappropriation of funds?</P>

Will they be things like sewerage schemes and water supply schemes which councils have already planned and are seeking to finance out of astronomical rates?  Is this the kind of bluff we are supposed to take?  People along the western seaboard were disgusted when this list was published the other day.  A water supply scheme for Letterkenny&mdash;that is regional development.  That scheme was planned three-and-a-half years ago.  If the present Government get away with that there is nothing they will not get away with. Road improvements between Ballyshannon and Donegal&mdash;that road was allocated a special grant every year since the railway closed 15 years ago. That grant was given to bring the road up to a reasonable standard.  The money spent on it is now being taken into account by way of credit for the regional fund.  I never knew such gross misrepresentation and misappropriation of money.  The advance factory at Fintown to be built by Gaeltarra Éireann is a factory for which two sites were purchased.  The first was not close enough to a Fine Gael man's house though it had been paid for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is regional development.  We gave Gaeltarra Éireann a fair amount of funds in our time.  We set up the Gweedore estate and when we were asked for subsidy we gave it.  The idea was to establish industries in areas where private enterprise would not establish them.  However, it was such an utter failure we passed an amending Act.  Deputy Colley, as Minister for Finance, had an Act passed to enable private enterprise to go in and co-operate.  Private enterprise always does a better job than a State-sponsored body does because that body is spending the taxpayer's money.  Let the Minister put himself in the place of the man living on the side of a mountain in Donegal who heard about the regional fund and voted in favour of the EEC because he understood the fund would develop the west.  There is an industrial estate in Gweedore with four factories and a fifth just beginning.  It was established by us. The man reads the newspaper and discovers that the regional fund is for the industrial estate at Gweedore, an estate he has had for seven years.  Does the Minister think he will gull the people of Donegal when he puts that kind of thing down as regional development?  If he does he is making a grave mistake.  That sort of thing will not work any more.</P>
      <P>Go down the list.  You see Killybegs sewerage scheme.  Donegal County Council put years of planning and preparation into that.  I think there were two modifications.  That sewerage scheme would be there if we had never heard of the EEC, the Coalition Government or Gaeltarra Éireann. Fianna Fáil had a very good record where water supply and sewerage schemes were concerned in Donegal and we take a poor view of anyone trying to prove otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> This Coalition Government stopped the amenities scheme programme, one of the best schemes we ever had.  I never experienced such hypocrisy. Loughmorne water supply sceme: the contractor who had that scheme died of old age 20 years ago.  It supplies five towns.  Now it is being used as part of the EEC regional development.  People were expecting a programme and a scheme of development over and above what had already been done or planned.  They were expecting a proper infrastructure, a satisfactory telephone system, a system in which one would not have to wait two hours to contact Dublin or four years to get a telephone installed.  They were expecting schools and colleges, amenities which would encourage people to come in and invest capital.  This is a mockery of regional development.  We have about 800 water supply schemes and about 200 sewage schemes and every single one has been done.</P>
    <P>Up to this year we have done a fair number of them.  Since when did they become regional development?  This is a laugh.  There is an absence of any policy good, bad or indifferent.  That is what this motion is all about.  The same applies to Mayo.  We did not hear one single word about regional development until we had two by-elections in Galway.  Then we began to get statements about regional development in the west.  We heard about regional development, but not only for the west.  Every place was being told about regional development.  Everybody was to get something.  The whole island was a depressed area.  The two by-elections in Galway brought talk of development, but there has not been a word about it since.  Now the emphasis is on Mayo.  The scene of operations is to be Mayo.  The Minister for Finance mentioned Mayo 20 times.  Unless I am seriously mistaken, we have intelligent people in Mayo.  They will not accept hypocrisy.  They will not accept as regional policy schemes which were adopted three years ago, schemes which were established by the IDA, and not directed there, because the IDA will admit they do not direct projects to any particular area.  The Minister <Col N="450" /> tried to take credit for schemes which might as well have been in Clare or Donegal if the promoters had opted to go there.</P>
    <P>The sooner we get a policy and a programme for regional development the better.  We must get highways from Dublin which will serve these areas properly.  The Minister for Local Government disgusted me today at Question Time.  When we questioned him about the building of proper highways to the west, he said it was a matter for each county council and that the initiative now lies with each county council.  That is on the record.  In our time we were planning a programme whereby the central authority would plan and take over the building of real arteries from the centre of activity here, fanning out to each county in the west, and giving those people a line of communication over which they could properly haul exportable goods in the larger trucks which are now becoming the mode of conveyance since we have not got trains in most of the area.  Instead of a planned programme like that, we are now told that it is up to each county council to do their bit and take a chance that they will link up.  I never heard of such a lack of programme or policy in my life. Government speakers on this motion must spell out to the people of the west something definite, something credible, and something which will be acceptable to them, instead of giving them a litany of schemes which are already in operation.</P>
    <P>What is the programme?  Why is there not a programme?  Why are projects for this area not outlined? What about harbour development? What about sea fishery development? What about the linking-up of proper sewerage and water systems?  We should like to see a linkage of sources and supply so that no area could say there were not sufficient amenities for the establishment of a project.  If any decent industry is to come to the west, the promoters must think of power, of the highways that lead to it, of the type of communications which are available.  They must think of the facilities that are available for <Col N="451" /> education.  They must think of the hospitalisation facilities and all the amenities which are ordinarily available to any civilised community in an industrialised area.  These are the things we want to see in a programme of development for the west, not a litany of grants given to projects which were planned and established years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht has a reputation of being more sincere than the other Ministers in the Cabinet.  I do not hold that against him.  That would not be too difficult. He has a human face and I think he would try to do something without bluffing or pretending.  I listened to the Minister for Finance.  He is a decent type of person to talk to but, in all sincerity, I must say&mdash;and I mean it&mdash;I never listened to a more dishonest speech in this House in my life.</P>

There was not one single word of a programme or policy, or one attempt to defend the things which have been listed here.  The Government said to each county: &ldquo;What have you done there?&rdquo; We will use this money to support the old accounts which have been depleted by projects that blooming outfit, Fianna Fáil, planned in the past.  We will take credit for the money now.  I listened carefully to the Minister for Finance because this is the bread and butter and the life and soul of the western seaboard, including my own county.  He said they were permitted to use the money for these projects&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;if they could show that an equivalent amount over and above would be made available for future and further development.  Where is the programme for that?  That is what the motion is about.  That is what we are here for.  That is what the people of Mayo want to know.  What is the planned programme for that money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> The Government can use the money for something we have already done, but what about the future?  Any worthwhile Government have planned for years and years ahead.  Some of the things we did in our last year were planned ten years before.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Before tea I was referring to the Minister's Estimate speech on 10th May, 1973 when he first spoke about his concept of open broadcasting.  In the new situation developing with RTE <i>vis-à-vis</i> a closer relationship with Northern Ireland, I was mentioning that we could get programmes from there and that RTE programmes might similarly be shown in the North.  That is something we, on this side of the House, would favour when the second channel comes into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pointing out also the various proposals put to the Minister early on which should have been taken into consideration.  As early as December, 1973, there was the first expression of views on this question by the trade unions concerned, Irish Actors' Equity, the Irish Federation of Musicians, the <Col N="454" /> allied professions, the British Actors' Equity and British musicians.  At that time they told the Minister in no uncertain fashion they did not approve of his concept of open broadcasting but still the Minister persisted in his view that BBC 1 should be rebroadcast in its entirety.</P>
    <P>I should like now to go to other sections of the Bill.  The Minister mentioned that people had tried to undermine the survey just concluded. Nobody on this side of the House&mdash; certainly not that I am aware of&mdash; criticised the fact that the Minister should carry out the survey.  Once he had decided with RTE to carry out the survey certainly I had no objection.  But I did have objections to other aspects, such as the fact that we had a very valid policy worked out on what we thought should be included in the survey.  We travelled throughout the country.  Deputy G. Collins attended a number of meetings and I attended others.  At an early stage we had proposals on how we thought the second channel should develop.  We proposed a programme council because, whether we like it or not, the view is held in certain parts of the country, especially in the west and south, that RTE is Dublin-orientated. I do not believe that to be quite true but one does hear the view expressed that RTE reflects the views of the east coast and does not give sufficient attention to the west and south.  With regard to news in particular that view may be valid because a problem does exist where RTE is concerned; for example, it is not possible for them, say, to film an incident which takes place in Kerry, Sligo or Mayo.  I am told they would not have an outside unit available for such purposes.  We do see more films of news items taken around Leinster than, say, in the west.</P>
    <P>We advocated the setting up of a programme council to be responsible for the selection of programmes on the new television channel.  We thought that might remove the biased feeling genuinely held by some people regarding RTE.  It was for that reason that we criticised the scientific survey. Being the largest political party in the country we believed, at that time, that <Col N="455" /> our views should be put to the people also.  I have no doubt that had our proposals been put to the people then, they might have examined their views more closely in the recent survey.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may quote from some of our policy in this regard:</P>
    <P>In recognition of the genuine desire of television viewers in the single channel areas for choice of programme&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Party propose the establishment of a Second Channel Programme Council.  This council which must be truly representative of viewers in the single channel area would control the selection of material and production of programmes to be transmitted through the second channel.</P>
    <P>Its terms of reference would provide for a regional quality in its home-produced programmes, news and sports broadcasts.  The headquarters of the new council of management body would be centred outside Dublin in a single channel area.&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and, as far as possible we would base that in the south or west</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;The Programme Council would function under the aegis of the existing Broadcasting Authority whose membership would be enenlarged to strengthen single channel representations.  RTE would continue to function in its present capacity&mdash;broadcasting its programmes as it does and it would co-operate in every way with the Programme Council of our new television channel in order that a truly alternative choice of programmes would be provided for the public.</P>
    <P>We were sincere in putting forward that proposal.  Now that RTE will be establishing a second channel I can see no reason why RTE could not implement those proposals.  At present heavy responsibility is placed on broadcasters, producers and management in RTE.  People have decided they will give them a trial in their capacity of how wide a choice of programmes <Col N="456" /> there should be on the second channel.  I know there was a dialogue between the authority and the Minister on how the survey should be carried out.  I did not have any knowledge of the survey before it was carried out.  The Minister kindly forwarded me a copy and the terms of reference a few days ago.  During the fortnight or three weeks while the survey was being carried out had anybody asked any member of the Fianna Fáil Party could he give any indication as to the nature of the survey the answer would certainly have been in the negative.</P>
    <P>I believe the Opposition should have been given a view of what exactly was taking place, what questions were being asked.  We have positive proposals.  We are the main Opposition party, and it would have been very difficult for us to advise people how to vote because we had not seen the survey.  This is a rather unique situation.  In a normal election or referendum the main political party in the country would be in a position to know what the issues were.  On this occasion, especially during the time the survey was taking place, we were at the disadvantage that we could not decide &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; if any supporter asked us: &ldquo;What do you think of this survey which is being carried out?&rdquo; All we could say was that these were our proposals, that we were not sure whether they were in the survey, and depend on people's judgement.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say about the survey.  The result was very conclusive.  It gave a clear indication as regards choice of programmes throughout the country.  The national preference for RTE was 62 per cent against 35 per cent for BBC 1.  This is a fair indication of the feeling of the people, and the Minister has summed it up in the very fair remark in page 15 of his speech with reference to how, in his opinion, people voted:</P>
    <P>As will be seen from the survey report, in the section &ldquo;Arguments for RTE 2&rdquo; the first two arguments used to persuade viewers of the advantages of that service were as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> 1.  RTE 2 would be selected from BBC 1, BBC 2, the 15 ITV companies, other overseas sources, and additional home produced material.</P>
    <P>2.  RTE 1 plus RTE 2 would offer single channel viewers a range and variety of programmes as near as possible to those already available in multi-channel areas.</P>
    <P>It has to be assumed therefore that those viewers who opted for RTE 2 were opting for a service so defined.  The result can not therefore be interpreted as any kind of victory for cultural protectionism or rejection of multi-channel viewing.</P>
    <P>That is a fair comment.  That is exactly what they have done.  They opted for the widest choice of programmes.  It was not that the people in the multi-channel areas such as Dublin and the east coast were trying to have something better than is available in the west and south of Ireland.  The cruel realities of the situation put before the people are that it is just not possible technically or financially in our present circumstances to provide such a wide service.</P>
    <P>Having that position explained to them by RTE&mdash;we all did it to the best of our ability&mdash;they opted for the best choice available.  There are some people in Cork, Dublin and Limerick who will probably be disappointed that the BBC 1 proposal was not carried in its entirety.  Unfortunately everyone cannot be pleased, but if people study the matter in depth they will find that what is being offered will suit the majority.</P>
    <P>I hope that the programme council we are proposing will be included as time goes on.  I believe that RTE will do what they should do, that is, ensure a fair proportion of regional programmes.  I am not suggesting that they should completely dominate the second channel but we should give our Irish broadcasters, scriptwriters, actors and technicians at least the opportunity of knowing that there is a future for them in this country.  We propose that 20 per cent of the second <Col N="458" /> channel should be composed of home-produced programmes.  We should diversify and get away from the idea people have that we are dominated by Montrose, and move more into Cork, Limerick and Galway for studio productions.  This will be decentralisation in a fashion, which we are all trying to achieve in this country.  Everything is concentrated in Dublin and we know the consequences of the lack of services in an overcrowded city.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned in his brief that a certain amount of capital is being allocated and has been spent already in the development of regional studios.  Having provided regional programmes, RTE will then select the best of the programmes to which the Minister has referred here, such as BBC 1, BBC 2 and a number of ITV companies.  Anyone who has watched multi-channel TV in Dublin will know that there are many excellent programmes.  There are those on current affairs, such as <i>Panorama,</i> and although I do not want to be taken as trying to have our children indoctrinated, there are other programmes during the evening time on BBC and other British channels which should be useful for them.  I would like to see the new channel providing intelligent and useful programmes from different sources.</P>
    <P>A big responsibility is being placed on RTE now.  They have campaigned for it, and I agreed with the proposals they put forward.  I believe they are capable of implementing them.  They have the management and personnel. There is nothing worse in any organisation, in any business, than indecision. You weaken the whole structure of the organisation, and the quicker you make whatever decision has to be made the better.  I am glad the Minister brought this in in the first few days of the new session, so that it would not drag on without a decision.  RTE know now where they stand, and now that the decision has been made, they should settle down and do their job properly.  I believe they will rise to this challenge which is being put before them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> I believe from now on we will see a new image.  It is important that they be seen to represent the people, that they are not attached to any particular group.  They are there to do a job for the benefit of people generally.  That is very important in relation to broadcasting and entertainment in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in relation to section 2 of the Bill the removal of the Authority.  I do not believe anybody could dispute to any great extent that the removal of the Authority will no longer have to be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is not a lot of difference here from the 1960 Broadcasting Bill.  The basic principle is the same.  The Government and the Minister can remove the Authority or members of the Authority.  The Minister has said that this is to provide greater security for the Authority.</P>
    <P>In reply to the Second Reading in the Seanad the Minister referred to Senator Horgan's remarks about writing into law the idea that a body set up by the Oireachtas are fundamentally responsible to the Oireachtas and not just part of the Oireachtas, the executive.  The Minister's comment on that was: that he entirely agreed with that formulation and wished he had thought of it himself. The Minister now appears to be under the impression that because the Authority are established by the Oireachtas they should be brought before the Oireachtas.  I know the Authority are established by the Oireachtas but they are selected by the Minister.  The Oireachtas have very little say in the appointment of the Authority.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any group in the country have had more criticism levelled at them than RTE.  Some of it is not justified but because of the position the Authority hold in our society and how powerful a medium radio and television are it is very hard to ensure complete impartiality.  The important thing is that the Authority should be seen to be impartial.  If the Minister feels that before he can dismiss <Col N="460" /> the Authority the matter should be brought before the Oireachtas, I am not sure that we should not also remove the appointment of the Authority completely from the Government.  I believe that if people in all walks of life, such as farmers organisations, trade unions, the FUE and any other organisation had a say in the appointment of the Authority we would get away from the feeling people have that the Government of the day have their own people in the RTE Authority.  That is damaging the function of RTE.  I would say the very same if this party were in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I do not believe I said differently.  Perhaps some of my predecessors did.  I am only giving my views on the matter.  It is the view of many people that the RTE Authority are politically orientated.  I am not accusing the Authority or any particular personnel.  We are lucky to have such an excellent Director General and other top personnel in RTE.  I would not like to see the Authority discredited in the House or anywhere else.  The only reason I mention this matter is that the Minister will not now bring the Authority before the Houses of the Oireachtas before he can dismiss them.  I do not particularly object to this but there are many small aspects to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for instance, the occasion when a member of the Authority is brought before the Dáil.  I would not like to see the day when a member of the Authority is sacked not for reasons of policy but for some other reason. The Minister might have to remove a particular person from the Authority because he was incompetent in certain ways, perhaps he indulged excessively in alcohol.  I would not approve a motion being brought before the House directed at a member of the Authority. I would not mind debating a motion on the removal of the entire Authority if they were found to be incompetent because we would be debating principles. <Col N="461" />  We should not bring a motion before the House in relation to a man who cannot defend himself because we could use our privilege and could slander that man and take his character.  That is not desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing could happen in relation to judges. We have the same principle for the removal of judges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central):</i> This is slightly different. This is a different situation.  Judges are completely removed from the political arena and are above politics. We are not allowed to discuss them in the House.  If we do we are checked by the Ceann Comhairle.  I believe this is a different arena.  This is the only matter I dispute in the section.</P>
      <P>In section 3 we deal with impartiality.  Broadcasters must have the most delicate job I know, especially broadcasters and interviewers dealing with current affairs, They have the responsibility and they also have one of the most potent means of slanting news or views if they so wish.  This is their great responsibility and I think they will bear it reasonably well.  We have all heard them being criticised but it is important to move away from this type of criticism: &ldquo;He did not give me a fair break; the cameras were on a certain other person more often than on me&rdquo;.  This is small and personally I have no time for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): Personally I do not; I have no time for it.  I think we should get away from that kind of criticism because I do not think it does television any good.  Politicians should be able to survive in their own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had been writing something about how I thought television and broadcasting should work as regards interviews and matters like that.  Almost every day RTE comment one way or another about the Ministers.  Whether they like it or not I do not know but <Col N="462" /> our job here is to put forward our views as to what we think is right and I was trying to write down what I thought of broadcast interviewing.  Since television has brought more knowledge about politics and public policy as a result the voter is in a stronger position to decide who or what to support at election time.  That is a contribution to democracy.  Politicians are naturally sensitive to television and especially to news broadcasters handling them on a programme.  This arises because a broadcaster is in a position, if he so desires, to lean towards or away from a politician or the party he represents. As no one interested in politics is neutral it follows that since the politicians have to take a side, it must often be difficult for a broadcaster to remain impartial as he also has a viewpoint.</P>
    <P>The sensitivity of the politician arises from two natural reactions; one is that his own image and political future may be made or marred by television as well as the political party which he represents.  The other is that if he is a responsible person he has to bear in mind the need for a continuing process of Government which must function in the interest of the common needs of the people.  There is one fundamental difference between the position of the politician and the broadcaster: the politician throughout his active political life has traditionally to face the electorate and retain support for himself and his party.  If he fails he has no prospect of fulfilling the aims or ideals. The broadcaster on the other hand, like the judge, the public servant or the bishop does not have to face the electorate.  He has the knowledge that he can support the aims or ideals in which he believes as long as he wants to.  But the role of the broadcaster is difficult. Often he may not have a broad understanding of the many demands of politics and he may only see things that he feels should be put right.  He should act for the people and represent them in interviewing the politician. In fact it is Parliament that is elected to represent the people and the broadcaster finds that he is not as free to use television or radio as he would be if he were working in a newspaper.  In the last analysis, both the politician <Col N="463" /> and the broadcaster may need to understand a little more about the job and appreciate that each has a significant function to fulfill for the common good.  I think that sums up the position between the politician and the broadcaster or interviewer, that he has a difficult role to fulfil as regards interviewing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I do not intend to go into the matter; I was merely saying this in passing.  We shall certainly deal with it on the Committee Stage but I thought I should mention it now.  I agree it is more appropriate to the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to other parts of the Bill such as that dealing with <Col N="464" /> the broadcasting commission which will be appointed by the Minister. Will it be seen to be impartial?  Suppose the Minister appoints the people and perhaps I make a complaint to the commission about something I feel is unfair.  There will be a feeling &mdash;and if I were on the opposite side of the House I would express the same view&mdash;that you could not expect complete impartiality when the commission are appointed by the Minister.  I know they are away from the Authority and the Minister but that feeling is there all the time.  Appointments to the RTE Authority are different from other appointments. Political appointments have been made in the case of judges and to semi-State bodies, Bord na Móna, CIE, ESB, but once these are named they can only direct the day-by-day working of the company and have nothing to do with the political formulation of policy in the way that RTE can.  This is the sensitive area we are discussing.  The Government have appointed these other appointees and there is no criticism.  They have been very able and have done their jobs excellently.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this is going to change completely.  These are my views as regards RTE.  I would like to see the service being as nonpolitical as possible because it has a very important role to play.  I would like to see it stay in the centre of the arena, reflect views, entertain and give news.  I am aware that this is a difficult thing to do; that it is difficult for a person to submerge his own views at all times but this is what will have to be done if the station is to be successful.  I do not wish to criticise the station, I have not done so in the past and I will not do so in the future unless I have a very good reason. RTE should be allowed to give the best type of entertainment in education, news and current affairs as they are capable of doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the question of borrowing.  I presume borrowing for the establishment of the network is already in progress.  How far has this developed and what amount of capital has gone into it up to the <Col N="465" /> present?  In the Bill the Minister seeks to extend the borrowing power of the Authority to £15 million.  Is it the intention of the Minister to permit the Authority to float a loan independently and outside the country or will the Authority borrow direct from the Minister for Finance?  The Authority was confined to £4 million or £5 million and I should like to know if they have exceeded that figure?  I am violently against borrowing abroad if it can be avoided at all but if there is no other means available it will create a greater burden on RTE as regards financing such a loan.  What arrangements exist with regard to repaying interest on loans from the Department of Finance?  If the Authority borrow abroad, rigid regulations will be placed upon them in regard to interest and the Authority would do better to borrow directly from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 17, in effect, replaces section 31 of the old Bill.  The substance is the same; the Minister is keeping certain powers to himself. This has been criticised by journalists but we agree that the Minister of the day must have some control.  It is important, not that I doubt the integrity of the Director General of RTE or the staff in any way, that the Oireachtas must keep some control. Again in this section we find the words &ldquo;tend to&rdquo; and I will deal with them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In section 15 the Minister lays down regulations with regard to the amount of advertising on television.  The amount of advertising on television agitates many people.  We all know that 60 per cent of the revenue of RTE is from advertising but it can be annoying, particularly when viewing feature films, to have advertisements at brief intervals.  I do not know whether this can be minimised.  I would be more flexible with the Authority as to the amount of advertising and the timing of it; I would not confine advertising to any particular hour.  When RTE were showing the fight between Ali and Frazier&mdash;I did not see the fight live&mdash;advertising destroyed the entertainment on that night.  Before the final round an <Col N="466" /> advertisement was shown with the result that viewers did not know of what was happening to Frazier.  When the station returned live to the fight viewers saw that Frazier had retired. I heard many criticisms about that.  I do not know whether it could have been avoided or not but it should be possible to give uninterrupted coverage at such a late stage in a fight.  It is annoying for those who get up at 4 a.m. not to see the closing stages of a fight.</P>
    <P>Local community radio could be developed in many areas.  Last year during the Festival of the Liberties Radio Éireann did an excellent job in providing a local community station. The Minister should see if similar developments can be carried out in other parts of the country.  In Ballyfermot there is a community television station and it is very entertaining to hear local people expressing their views.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate part about this debate is that it is almost entirely confined to television.  The radio has given an excellent service.  Some years ago radio seemed to be in decline, probably because television had just commenced, but it has improved immensely in recent times.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the financial situation of RTE is not healthy.  No organisation or company I know of has fared well in the last 12 months and I do not know if because of their financial situation RTE have made an application for an increase in the TV licence.  Has the Minister any figure in mind in relation to this?  Naturally, inflation was one of the greatest problems for all companies last year and RTE has not avoided it either.  The Minister stated RTE had made application for an increase in television licences.  He said they had a deficit of £25,000 up to the end of September, or was it a surplus?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>A small deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): RTE will also be caught by the best part of the national wage agreement and we cannot expect any increase in advertising revenue in present circumstances.  When a firm <Col N="467" /> suffers a reduction in profits they have to look around to see where they will effect an economy.  They look at staffing and the various overheads and, of course, advertising has become very expensive.  Therefore, apart from the deficit of £25,000, RTE can expect a fall in revenue.  What will be the position at the end of 1976 or early 1977 when the second channel has been fully established?  Apart from the operation of a second channel, whether BBC 1 or RTE 2, there will be substantial extra costs and this will mean an increase in TV licences. I will not quote from unreliable sources, but the increase must be in the region of at least £7 or £8.</P>
      <P>The Minister had to consider what the economic situation is likely to be in 1976 when deciding to introduce this Bill.  If he did not, he should have. One does not build a factory unless one can be sure one can open it and a shop is not built unless it is possible to open it.  Capital expenditure cannot be allowed to lie dormant; it is too valuable today and has to be borrowed too expensively.  Therefore I hope the Minister before deciding on a second channel took economic factors into consideration.  I am sure the Minister had expert advice and that he took it before making his decision.  If the Minister, having considered the possible economic conditions in 1976, said &ldquo;Go ahead, invest this money, we will be able to afford it,&rdquo; I will not criticise him, but if it happens when the capital has been invested in installations all over the country that the Minister will say &ldquo;Due to the economic situation we will have to defer this&rdquo; I will be critical of him for his bad judgement.  I am not in a position to do that at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the original decision of the Government that they should broadcast BBC 1 or UTV as a second channel.  We expect a Government to be able to make sound, firm decisions. We expect that when a Bill is introduced it is after long consideration. There are Government Deputies who reflect the views of the people throughout the country and who <Col N="468" /> should have been able to tell the Government what their constituents' views were in relation to the second channel proposed.  It has been the Government's idea that they could decide what was best for the people.  Now the people have spoken and in effect they have told the Government: &ldquo;We have rejected your proposal.  You were wrong.  You were trying to say that the second channel should be BBC 1 or UTV&rdquo;.  That is exactly what the people have said and the Government should think seriously about that and not say they know what is best for the people.</P>
    <P>Henceforth we can get away from this discussion.  I appreciate the views of those who were campaigning for multi-channel television throughout the country.  One part of the country enjoys four or five channels and the rest do not.  This, of course, is a geographical freak.  The Minister knows that it was never possible, and will not be possible for a long time, to give the people outside Dublin the same stations as seen in Dublin.  The day might come when we will be able to do that.  If we were economically sound, if RTE did not have to depend on advertising and if the Minister were generous with his finances to RTE, they could compete with other stations.  They could put on home produced programmes which would probably be an improvement on those being shown on foreign stations at the moment.  Today we must accept this position as we find it.</P>
    <P>If we are not satisfied with the programmes shown by the second channel we can come here and criticise them.  Laws are changed every day of the week.  The people have decided that the second channel should be entrusted to RTE.  I think they are right.  We have campaigned for this and I hope our views about a programme council will be reviewed seriously by the Authority and the Minister because in my view it will help us get away from the imbalance we see throughout the country today.</P>
    <P>Once again I would like to thank the Minister for the advance copy of the survey forwarded to me some time ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long.  I listened with some interest to the greater part of the contribution by Deputy Fitzpatrick, Opposition spokesman.  He harped on the allegation that at the outset the Minister took the wrong view on this question of a second channel.  It is well to remember that after taking the views of the viewing public to the people who matter, the Minister in his public statement in the Seanad said he is quite prepared to accept the view of the public and take whatever preference they elected.  This he is now doing.  It is probably right to say, too, as I read it in the Minister's speech, that there was a considerable variation of the inflow of information during the period he was seeking the opinion on what type of second television channel we should have.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said that the first views were expressed by trade unions and the Minister had early warning of their views.  I would like to take issue with the Deputy on one aspect of that. When one wants to get the views on a subject which is of nation wide interest, one does not merely take the views of organised bodies.  It is vitally important to take the view of every type and stratum in society.  This is what the Minister has done with the help and co-operation of RTE.  They worked very well together and we now have a decision for a second channel, known as RTE 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I would like to point out that people lose sight of the fact that this Bill is not just concerned with a second TV channel.  This is a broadcasting Bill which contains in nearly every section matters that are also applicable to radio broadcasts.  It is important to bear that in mind.  In his opening statement the Minister referred to the fact that the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, was the last Act which dealt with broadcasting affairs.  This Bill largely extends that Act, builds on it and greatly improves it, and does so in the light of 15 years' experience. This is not a Bill which has been thought up overnight.  There has been deep and careful consideration given to matters of broadcasting, be they television or radio.  I would ask anybody <Col N="470" /> taking an interest in this Bill to bear that in mind.  In view of the excitement over the second channel many people have lost sight of the fact that this Bill deals with many other matters in addition to the second television channel.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the second channel will be RTE 2.  My constituency is on the east coast.  One might say that we welcome a second RTE channel because it will give us a fourth or a fifth channel.  At the moment we enjoy all normal channels.  In some cases in my constituency reception is better than in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see the second television channel as a more or less conduit pipe for British television&mdash; UTV or BBC 1.  I take that attitude out of ordinary nationalist principles, as an Irishman, because no matter how independent the BBC authority may be from its Government in its day to day management, there is always the <i>éminence grise</i> behind a national television authority to the influence of a Government where national affairs are concerned, particularly <i>vis-á-vis</i> other countries and we would be the other country.  Circumstances might arise whereby BBC 1 or any English channel might be used as a vehicle for that Government's propaganda.  It might be that that propaganda was inimicable to Irish interests.  For that reason I am glad we have RTE 2 which will be subject to the control and power of an Irish authority and in the ultimate to the authority of this House.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why people were interested in BBC 1 as a second channel was that there was criticism of the RTE Authority.  People were asking if the Irish Authority were capable of running a second channel. Irish television has not been in existence for very long.  It takes time for perfection and for standards to improve.  There is still plenty of room for improvement.  This view is not pro- or anti-RTE.  It was expressed to me by my constituents and in public. They had some doubts as to whether RTE were able or competent to take on the extra burden of a second channel.  It is natural enough to have critics of any authority or organisation. <Col N="471" />  I think it played a part in some people opting for BBC 1.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the way the Minister puts the position of the second television channel, particularly when he refers to the matter of selection from the various existing British channels.  There is also mention of &ldquo;other overseas sources and additional home-produced material&rdquo;. Deputy Fitzpatrick has expressed the view that he hoped to see 20 per cent of the second channel produced from outside the Dublin area.  I am sure the second channel will do its best to produce good Irish material, not just Irish material because it happens to be Irish.</P>
    <P>If possible I should like the second channel to produce a fair amount of continental material.  We are now part of the European family.  From my viewing of the existing English channels that can be got here I think there is very little continental material appearing on them.  There should be good scope for the second Irish channel to reproduce continental material.  Europe has much to offer and if what I have suggested is done I am sure there would be a spirit of reciprocity and possibly the showing of Irish material, informing the Continent of what we have to offer, whether it is our national culture, our news or any other material that we produce that is of a good standard.  If we concentrated on that aspect we would have the lead on the existing British channels, whether official British or commercial channels.</P>
    <P>I am sure what I have said is the intention because the Minister in his speech when referring to the amendment of the original section 17 of the 1960 Act, which deals with the general duties of the Authority, stated that we should not be inward-looking in our programmes particularly so far as our national culture is concerned.  It is a fair criticism to say that there has been a rather restricted view taken in the past as to our national historical culture.  Possibly there is room for more looking round in that area, to enlarge our views on what should be included in that category.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in this important section it is clearly and specifically <Col N="472" /> stated that the Authority are required to uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution.  That is timely, well stated and most necessary. When speaking of the interests within the ambit of the Authority, I am glad to see that the section states:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions the Authority shall in its programming&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland,...</P>
    <P>That is well stated, well drafted and necessary in order to clear up any misunderstandings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the independence of the Authority.  As the official spokesman for his party, I think he agrees the Minister must have some control.  There is provision made for that and the Minister can prohibit certain programmes if he considers it advisable.  It is open to any Member of the House to bring the matter before the House to revoke that order of the Minister.  I take it that the Minister of the time will not take his duties too lightly in that regard and will think carefully before he takes steps.  It is necessary to have that power in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be too critical.  My criticism is made with a constructive intent.  I am particularly interested in what I would call the watchdog committee.  Section 4 refers to the broadcasting complaints commission.  It is very necessary having regard to present tendencies sometimes of certain members of the media not to brook any barriers, to go where they want, to publish or republish what they want.  There is provision under this Bill with regard to matters of personal privacy and there is provision for the protection of that privacy.  Section 4 is possibly the longest section in the Bill and it merits careful reading by all the public.  Its existence should be advertised because it would give a certain confidence to those who might be a bit concerned sometimes with the ability or apparent freedom of the media to <Col N="473" /> discuss, publish and circulate material. Naturally there is a reluctance on the part of a private individual to take proceedings in a court of law in regard to some matter that arises where he considers he is harmed.  Under this section people may complain to this Authority and the consideration by the Authority of a complaint or request made under this section shall be carried out by the commission in private.  I imagine there will be some procedure where if it is reported to me that an unfair or untrue comment on a radio or television programme had been made which I had not heard that I could have it played back to me as a complainant.</P>
    <P>In order that the matter might be dealt with fully and properly, there should be some means whereby if any harm were done to any citizen he would have some redress.  A showing on television might be very fleeting but it could also be very damaging if it were unfair or untrue.  There is only one way in which that sort of situation can be dealt with, that is, that there be some record kept so that in the event of a complaint being made, a complaint which might have to be based on hearsay evidence, there would be a mechanism to deal with the situation; otherwise, a person making a complaint would be at some disadvantage and might have to seek out evidence, albeit that the damage may have been done already, so that the Authority could make the <i>amende honorable</i> at the first available opportunity.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a <i>lacuna</i> in the Bill.  I refer to the matter of privilege which, if not provided for, could be a serious omission.  Would a complaint made to the commission be privileged?  I should like to see provision for what I would call absolute privilege in a matter of that sort.  In making a complaint a person might refer to persons outside the Authority but who became involved in the Authority's act or omission in some programme.  I am aware of an act dealing with defamation at meetings, before certain committees and dealing with the newspapers.  This may include radio and television to some <Col N="474" /> extent but this is a subsidiary of the Authority.  Whoever is involved in the drafting of this Bill should consider that aspect carefully if it is not provided for already because I could imagine people being afraid to make a complaint to the commission unless they were protected on the question of privilege.  I have in mind something that occurred in relation to a disciplinary committee&mdash;I shall endeavour to camouflage as much as possible&mdash; but it was a sports-type organisation and everybody thought that complaints made were privileged but discovered that there was only a very vague qualified privilege covering their affairs.</P>
    <P>I know that this committee are not being set up as a judicial committee in the sense of a court but it seems that they are to have certain powers. Whether they have sufficient teeth is another matter, a matter that will be discussed on Committee Stage.  I am anxious to ensure that the good intention of this section and the principle behind the formation of this commission would not be negatived by any shortfall in regard to the matter of privilege.</P>
    <P>This second channel television would be a means of goading and spurring the existing channel on RTE to do a little better.  There is always room for improvement and it would be desirable that there be a slight competitive relationship between the two channels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill. I note that the first 12 pages of the Minister's brief are concerned with the Bill but that from there on it contains the Minister's expressed thoughts and further thoughts on broadcasting in general.  These are welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister states that one aspect of the Bill will be to clarify and expand the duties of the RTE Authority in fulfilling their task of providing a national broadcasting service.  This is good.  Section 7, subsection (2), states that after RTE have recorded a broadcast they must retain the recording for 60 days.  I welcome this provision <Col N="475" /> because in the event of complaints being made to the commission they would have access to the records.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of licences becoming available for people who wish to embark on the production of local programmes on a community television basis.  We all know how important this development could be and what a powerful impact it could have in local communities.  The Minister tells us that section 18 might be expanded to incorporate some form of complaints system also.  He states that if there should be a great expansion in community and local television there might be a need for some form of standardisation, probably by way of a commission being set up to deal with complaints.</P>
    <P>Already there have been a couple of trial efforts in this field.  And I would suggest that at this stage there be established a commission for dealing with complaints so that this concept might get off to a good start.  In the event of the company or an individual having a complaint against RTE it appears that they are free to go to the complaints commission, but is there any redress in the event of a wrong being perpetrated on a local television service?  Is there any regulation in connection with the issuing of a licence to cable companies whereby they would have to retain their recordings for a specific period?  Surely a local group should have to comply with the same regulations in this regard as are to apply to RTE.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the development and expansion of community television because it will afford an opportunity to people at local level to express their views and is not life all about communication of this kind? The more open we are to views the better, provided they are sensible views. This brings me to programme material.  I am not so keen on what I describe as low grade programmes. Situation comedies may be light entertainment but do they raise standards? Are they simply a means of passing the time?  Is that a sufficient criterion?  Is there any uplift in them morally or spiritually?  I do not have <Col N="476" /> an opportunity of watching much television but I cannot tolerate stereotyped programmes.  Possibly they are necessary.  The question is have we too much of them.</P>
    <P>Survey is very much in the news at the moment obviously because of the survey undertaken to examine into the feasibility of a second RTE channel <i>vis-à-vis</i> BBC (Northern Ireland). Thinking of the violence that appears on our screen, I wonder has any kind of examination been carried out into some of the tragic happenings that have occurred to see if there is any relationship between what has happened and what has been witnessed on the television screen.  I think such a survey would be important.  There is too much violence on our screens. Occasionally one hears rumours that a tragedy occurred because of something witnessed on the television screen.  Is there any foundation for that rumour? Have the Garda any views on it?  Has a relationship sometimes been established?  If there is any evidence, has the Minister any view on it?  Has he used any influence on the RTE Authority to examine the situation?  It is rather sad to read that a tragedy occurred because of something that was seen on the television screen.</P>
    <P>We have a duty in regard to censorship and we must protect people. Of course, censorship can be a nasty word.  I believe censorship means freedom for the majority to be protected from certain things.  If those in authority do not see fit to regulate the viewing of younger members of the community, people whose minds have not been fully formed, is it their fault alone if some tragedy occurs as a result of viewing?  Have we any responsibility?  Has the Minister any responsibility?  Ought we to have announcements prior to a programme that the programme may not be suitable for viewing by younger people?  I know there is a certain section&mdash;fortunately it is very small&mdash;who do not believe in censorship.  Sometimes I have seen children's programmes and sometimes I regret that my own children have been watching these programmes.  Can anything be done?  There is a certain responsibility on us in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> Earlier I referred to the necessity for RTE to retain recordings for 60 days.  Where community television is concerned there should be a proviso in the licence initially that programmes should be retained for a certain length of time.  I have not read the Bill in great detail and possibly this is covered in the Bill.  The Minister referred to it in general terms.  I should like him to be a little more specific when he comes to reply.  The first part of his speech dealt with the two main purposes of the Bill: there was a clarification and expansion of the duties of the Authority and the provision of greater authonomy and freedom within clearly defined statutory restraints.  The Minister has said he will amend section 6 and I welcome that.  The fourth part deals with the setting up of cable television.  The Minister stated that:</P>
    <P>...the first two arguments used to persuade viewers of the advantages of that service were as follows: 1.  RTE 2 would be selected from BBC 1, BBC 2, the 15 ITV companies, other overseas sources, and additional home produced material.</P>
    <P>2.  RTE 1 plus RTE 2 would offer single channel viewers a range and variety of programmes as near as possible to those already available in multi-channel areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister then makes an assumption.  The people who were interviewed in the survey would, I believe, have had other influencing factors in the backs of their minds which would have a bearing on the answers they gave.  I discussed this with people and many were concerned about our not having control over BBC 1 (Northern Ireland).  The Minister did not allude to that.  He passed over it as if it were unimportant.  It is not unimportant.  I believe it was that brought about the result of the survey.  People want a say.  A minority, fortunately small, do not supervise the viewing of the younger members of their families.  We have a number of responsible people who did not want to be subjected to the rebroadcasting of an outside channel.  I know they would have the option of switching off, but that is not the point. <Col N="478" /> I went to the Library and looked at the night's viewing in some of the papers. Apart from two small items, involving about 12 minutes, BBC 1 and BBC 1 (Northern Ireland) had the same programmes.  I take it those 12 minutes cover the news and current affairs or local news in the north.</P>
    <P>I am very glad people are aware of the importance of controlling our own air waves.  One of the key words in the two arguments was the word &ldquo;selected&rdquo;.  This indicates that we would have control.  I do not agree with the Minister when he says the majority who voted for RTE 2, on the case presented for it, were voting for what they saw as the widest freedom of choice available to them.  That is a narrow approach.  There was much more to it than that.  That is the Minister's interpretation of the survey, but I believe people felt they had a certain responsibility and, while they wanted entertainment, they also wanted our own people to have some say in what was being offered as entertainment.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of ballyhoo prior to the survey.  That is not to say there was not a good debate and that there were not good articles.  Many people feel the survey was used to distract attention from the state of the economy and from inflation and unemployment.  These factors are relevant when we come to deal with the actual financing of RTE 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be relevant to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned it and I came back immediately to the fact that it would be relevant to the economic situation and the fact that we must make money available for RTE 2.  I wonder is that money available.  When is it hoped that RTE 2 will be available?  Is it next year or many years hence?  Its availability will depend to a very large extent on finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past few years I put down parliamentary questions to the Minister about the 405 line and the 625 line transmission.  As yet, this matter has not been fully resolved. RTE are still undertaking a study into <Col N="479" /> the areas of poor reception and areas which may be without reception after the 405 line system has been withdrawn.  Many parts of Wicklow should have available to them the 405 line reception and also the 625 line reception but, because of their location, they cannot get a picture on the 625 line system.  It is not that the receivers are not suitable.  They have the dual-type receiver.  A picture cannot be picked up.  Many constituents are wondering precisely what will happen when the 405 line system is withdrawn.  I hope the matter will be clarified fairly soon.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there is an application before his Department for an increase in the licence fees.  We must all face up to that.  At the same time, people who have receivers will be expected to pay the increased licence fee without having a service.  Would the Minister look into that again, especially in relation to the Glenmalure area in Wicklow?</P>
    <P>The difficulty about having only one channel is obvious.  There are many groups who wish to have their own specialities available to them.  With a second channel there might be an opportunity for more drama.  We ought to have more drama on television rather than films.  I do not watch very much television but I understand that we have a great number of films.  Have we three per week or, perhaps, even more?  Is there a great demand for these films? How do they rate on the RTE tam ratings? This seems to be a cheap way of filling in time which could be used for many other purposes.</P>
    <P>School programmes have improved considerably.  Many adults now watch these programmes in the day time even in the multi-channel areas.  I wonder are these programmes advertised sufficiently.  In many households, having finished her morning chores, the housewife would prefer to watch a programme on geography or something of that nature rather than a BBC programme.  The programmes are well advertised in the schools but many of the adult population could obtain information from them if they <Col N="480" /> were aware of them.  Very often in the newspapers there is no mention of a programme at 11.30 a.m. or 12 noon. The impression is given that programmes for children start with &ldquo;Sesame Street&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As the housewife has more devices to make life tolerable in the home and has more time to herself, she might take further interest in these if she knew of their content in advance.  Indeed with the number of people idle at present, I wonder if RTE would consider some form of information programmes during the day, programmes showing basic skills or something of that nature in an endeavour to uplift the morale of such people.  Perhaps such programmes would result in somebody finding a system of retraining, that a person might be stimulated by a certain programme which would activate him into purposeful employment.  There are so many things we can do, but I wonder do we make the best use of our time?</P>
    <P>There was no mention whatsoever in this Bill of a possible Telefís na Gaeltachta.  Has any consideration been given to a possible television service for the Gaeltacht areas? Would it be too costly? The first 12 pages of the Minister's brief related to the Bill.  Then we had 23 pages given to his views which have been expressed many times.  I am glad the Minister accepts the result of the survey carried out.  He takes this opportunity also of restating his case, one which the Government ought to realise now was not accepted.  That survey was tantamount to a mini referendum and, to a great extent, the Government were on trial.  They put their proposal to a section of the Irish people.  Indeed the method of selection of those who participated in that survey has not been challenged by anybody in this House, as yet.  The Government's proposals were rejected quite emphatically.  Yet the attitude appears to be: Well, here it is; we presented the options to the people, the people decided, so what? But there are deeper implications than that.  The Minister's assumption that viewers who opted for RTE 2 <Col N="481" /> were opting for a service so defined, a service so defined that it would be selected from BBC 1, BBC 2, 15 ITV companies, other overseas sources and additional home-produced material is only touching the matter; it does not really scratch very deeply at all.  The two Government parties were not in line with what the Irish people wanted.  Do they realise what this means?  There is a great significance to it.</P>
    <P>I wonder will this be the first of many efforts in that direction?  Will we see the Government coming up with further proposals stating their case to the people and finding that they are not in line? Is a survey envisaged for the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, to take one example, or on any other measures which may come before this House? Why have a survey on this Bill in particular? It has been a heavy defeat.  The Minister laid on the line what he wanted.  He made some wonderful appearances on television.  There were two occasions when he appeared on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; expressing his view and receiving good reception and applause. Yet, when it came to the crunch the result was two-to-one against.</P>
    <P>Those questions were posed directly and answered.  The Government appear to think they are in a much better position to go forward, &ldquo;much better" being the operative words.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued: I would now like to trace the implications of this choice in more detail.</P>
    <P>Indeed he has traced the implications for the Irish people but I hope the Government have not overlooked the implications for themselves.</P>

      <P>Will this be the end of it from the Minister's point of view? I know he has said he is recommending this decision to the Government.  Will they immediately come up with the money and see that the wishes of our people are met?  I am glad we shall not have another survey on this issue but I would ask still: are any further surveys envisaged in respect of any other Government Bills which might come before this House?</P>
      <P>On the aspect of a person being appointed to the Authority, then being removed and a motion of that nature coming before this privileged House, I have certain reservations.</P>
      <P>Could this not be done through a committee? I often wonder if this is the best forum.  Would the member of the Authority so involved have the right to state his case? Is this the best way of doing things? It would appear as if the Minister has decided that it is, but perhaps we shall see some amendments on this later on.</P>

On the general principle, I am not too happy with the fact that the circumstances of an individual could be bandied around this House without his having some method of stating his own case.  This is an extremely short Bill.  There is practically nothing in it now that the contentious section has been omitted.  The Minister's brief could be summed up in possibly six pages.  I do not have his ability to stretch the subject over 35 pages.  Therefore I will conclude and look forward to Committee Stage and the amendment of the Bill.</P>

      <P>It says in the Minister's speech the survey was carried out by Irish Marketing Surveys Ltd. I question how that was done.  I live in a very populous area and I have never heard of one of these fellows coming in.  It might be one of these &ldquo;gallop&rdquo; polls&mdash;a gallop in and a gallop out.  How did they come to the conclusion that people do not want BBC? I would like to know how this survey was approached.  Let me remind the House of the municipal authorities meeting in Cork.  I think some of the Members of this House can remember it well&mdash;I happened to be in the chair and took no part&mdash; and the vote of the municipal authorities representative of all Ireland was 58 to five in favour of BBC.</P>
      <P>We talk of the damage the BBC is going to do to us.  There is more damage done to our people by drink advertisements today than the BBC could do to them.  We can get BBC on radio if we want it.  I have never heard Fianna Fáil denouncing it or trying to jam it.  If they do not want BBC they can switch it off.  They are going to dictate to the people in the west.  They have this attitude: To hell or to Connacht.</P>

If BBC is to pollute us and make little Englishmen of us, then Dublin must be soaked with little Englishmen.  We talk of Irish culture.  What is the present station dependent on? If you think back you will find we had the &ldquo;Fugitive&rdquo;, a good programme, &ldquo;Kojak&rdquo;, &ldquo;Upstairs Downstairs&rdquo; and so on.  Every night of the week they depend on outside programmes. Are we to have another station doing the same thing?  If they cannot cater as it is, how will they cater on the double? I am reminded of the souvenirs we find in tourist shops, perhaps an Irish leprechaun, but turn him upside down and he is &ldquo;made in Japan".  It is the same with these programmes.  They are all made somewhere else.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with them.</P>

      <P>Listening to all the &ldquo;bull&rdquo; the Deputy has been putting up here tonight, that is where he should have gone.  As I say, I challenge this marketing survey.  Why employ a marketing survey to do a job like this? Two or three girls in the Minister's Office could send out a questionnaire to every licence holder in the single channel areas asking: &ldquo;Do you want it or do you not?&rdquo; It is as simple as that.  I know the reply that would be received because I have my ear to the ground and I hear the views of the people.  I would like to know how RTE can supply a second station if they cannot give us an Irish programme for one night without <Col N="486" /> depending on the BBC or the United States for films.</P>
      <P>We have the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; which holds our interest.  There are some other programmes I would like to comment on.  I would like to see on Irish television something enlightening for the country.  There could be a first-aid programme to help young people to be more responsible and helpful to their neighbours.  RTE could do a lot in this respect.  I would like, if possible, to see the news first in Irish on one programme and a few minutes afterwards to see it in English on another: This would be of great help to the language.  People who did not understand Irish would know what was said when they heard it in English afterwards.</P>
      <P>RTE have done a fairly good job in their own field but I fail to see how they can look after a second station when they cannot fully cater for one. Our culture is one of the most abused things in the country.  We often hear somebody singing through the medium just because he has a few words, but he can no more sing than my kettle. These are some of the things that are dubbed Irish culture.  We have heard some good things in Irish but because such a man is a friend of somebody he is allowed sing.  This should not be dubbed Irish culture.  It leaves a lot to be desired.  I ask the Minister not to be guided by a group that nobody knows of.  He should send out the questionnaire to the people in single channel areas and act on their replies. I do not see why people in the Pale should tell the west what they should have.</P>

      <P>The Minister is acting on the marketing survey report. He said RTE are confident that such a two-channel national service would be most popular.  How can they be sure of that when the present one is not so popular? How will they divide it?  Will they give half to one section and the other half to another?  We will have to import more films.  There will not be enough Kojaks to go around. This is what RTE have been giving us, so why are they now saying they will give us Irish culture? The wise men from the east will not open their mouths to condemn the BBC.  It is about time the people were given their choice.  We saw gallup polls in the country before and we saw how wrong they were.  I warn everybody about this type of vote.  I do not accept it because I have my ear to the ground. I was in the chair in Clonakilty and we know what was expressed there by the municipal authorities of <Col N="488" /> Ireland.  I am telling the Minister what I want and I do so fearlessly.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said that this survey was decided by the people in the east but he can see, in relation to his own county, there was a bigger vote for RTE 2 than for the BBC. The Minister and the Government, during the last few months, have put on a wonderful charade which succeeded not in deciding whether or not control of the second channel should be handed over to RTE or the BBC but in keeping the people's minds off much more serious matters.  As we head west these days over towards Mayo I notice many women carrying buckets of water from pumps and wells.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to W.B. Yeats who spoke about accepting &ldquo;our proper dark&rdquo;.  I think from listening to Deputy Coogan that he has accepted &ldquo;our proper dark" in his contribution.  The Minister is off-handed in accepting the result of the survey, of course.  This is <Col N="489" /> really big of him but he knows quite well that had the result of the survey been otherwise and if the people had voted for a transfer of power to the BBC it would not have taken him anywhere near getting a second choice of station because the trade unions and Equity and even the British trade unions would ensure that this did not happen.  Even if the Government were able to surmount these difficulties there would be the question of money.  I fear Deputy Coogan will still have to accept that even though the survey showed a certain result he is no nearer a multi-channel service than before the survey.</P>
      <P>The Government must take this result as a challenge and reminder to them that they are not in touch with the people.  This was the idea of the Minister who foisted it on the Government and the Government acquiesced rather tamely.  The survey result has saved the Government a great embarrassment but at the same time the Government must admit that they tried to get the people to accept this part of their policy and it has been rejected.  It is, therefore, right to ask when will the Government give all the people a chance of deciding a bigger issue, the continuance of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the ruling of the Chair but I submit that when there is a financial provision in the Bill, as there is, I may mention inflation and inflation alone may defeat the Bill since the money would not be there.  We have much more serious things to discuss and I believe this is only a big attempt by the Government to divert people's attention from the burning questions which I may not mention but which still exist and the Government must be called on to pay some attention to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that section 6 is deleted from the Bill has taken a great deal of meat from it and what follows is of less importance.  The Government have given us a document which it appears to me Deputy Coogan would not agree with and one cannot blame him.  But the television service is very important, not because you cannot have BBC or some other English channel or because if, by accident, you live on the east coast you can have BBC, UTV or ITV or any of them.  I do not regard this as a very serious issue.  I do not suggest that those receiving BBC can become more anglicised than they can become by reading English papers.  Nobody can or will try to stop people from reading English papers if they want to do so.  My point is that we regarded the attempt by the Government to hand over control of a broadcasting service to another country as wrong&mdash;not the fact that BBC programmes would be shown in all parts of the country but the fact that the attempt was made to hand over ultimate authority for the broadcasting of television programmes to another country.  No country in the world does this and <Col N="491" /> those interviewed in the survey answered as people in any other country would answer if the same issue were put to them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one feels grave doubt about the ability of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to handle anything regarding broadcasting, this most important part of the media. The Minister here this evening acted, and for the past few months has been acting in a most pedantic manner, talking down to the people and telling them what he thought was good for them.  The people have rejected his approach to the matter and in many countries a Minister would accept this indication as a rejection of his ideas and it might well be suggested that the Minister here should offer his resignation to the Taoiseach.  I do not know if he will do that but the Taoiseach must have lost whatever confidence he had in his Minister on seeing his ideas rejected because even though the Government sanctioned the proposal, in fairness to many Members of it, I do not think they would be wholeheartedly behind it.  The fact that I live on the east coast and can enjoy&mdash;if that is the word&mdash;outside programmes is not the issue.  The issue was: should we hand over control of some of our television programmes to another country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not forget that was the second thought.  The first thought was to hand it over.  It was only when the trade unions objected and said they would not work this idea that he thought that if he could get public opinion behind him on the matter the trade unions would have to agree.  It was only then he thought of this.  If he could have got away with his first idea he would have done so.  The Parliamentary Secretary need not try to defend him.  Deputy Kelly did not get the point I was making which was that this was an attempt to hand over control. <Col N="492" />  Deputy Kelly now says that the Minister was not arrogant in arranging this survey but the arranging of it was a second thought.  By that time he had aroused the ire of the trade unions, of Equity and the British trade unions and even the BBC.  That corporation were not sure if this could be implemented if it was accepted here.</P>

      <P>There is grave confusion on the Government side.  If Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Kelly permit me to do so I will confine my remarks to the Bill.  I hope the play-acting of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is over and that he will <Col N="494" /> now get down to helping RTE to give us a good television service.  I am talking about a service for the whole country.  The Minister mentioned the pan-Irish programme and I should like to know how far he has got in trying to get the British to accept that we could have a programme which would show the best of the Irish character whether it is on the Shankill Road or in west Cork.  The Government, and RTE, must give us programmes which are good, educational and entertaining.  I sympathise with the Authority in that they are often compared with the BBC which has been in operation for more than 40 years. It should be remembered that RTE, as well as being in financial straits, is only 14 years in operation.  It is laughable when talking of the second channel to consider that the Government cannot get enough money to run one channel properly.  We all know that RTE cannot generate enough income to run the station as they would like to.</P>
      <P>The Government have come forward with grandiose schemes and mentioned figures as high as £4 million but they cannot afford to give money for essential things like schools.  I attended a meeting tonight of a parents' committee of a local school who were promised that work on a new school would commence this year but so far it has not started.  The last despairing effort of the Minister for Education was to ask the committee what kind of native fuel they intended using, as if that mattered.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, the Minister's gimmick about BBC 1 or UTV served the purpose of diverting attention from more serious matters. It created the impression that the Government had the money to help to finance a second channel.  Today, television plays a very big part in the lives of our people and we are entitled to an attempt by the Minister to ensure that the very best we can afford is given. <Col N="497" /> We had an interesting announcement from the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Kelly, that he was not behind the Government in this survey.  Some Members may not have heard me.  The Parliamentary Secretary said he was not behind the Government in this survey.  RTE have to show certain outside programmes anyway.  They have been showing US programmes and some of them have been very good. One can realise their trials trying to keep going so many hours per day with limited resources and one can appreciate why they went out to preach to the people that they were capable of running a second channel.  The people who participated in the survey have backed them up.  We take it, therefore, that the Government will seriously get down to the job of helping the RTE Authority but this Bill does little to give them power to borrow abroad.</P>
      <P>I am very apprehensive because of the Government's handling of this. They seemed to have been prepared to give away control of TV broadcasting to another country if it would save money and this brings home to us the frightful financial predicament the country is in.  RTE cameras can go anywhere but to suggest they would show the queues at the unemployment exchanges is too harrowing.  The Government and the Taoiseach must seriously consider the future of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister must take seriously the rebuff he has got from the people in the survey.  It would be sufficient to ask that the Minister should consider changing his portfolio.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the only Government in the world which took their involvement in the national television service in such a lighthearted manner. One cannot imagine France handing over her service to Germany or <i>vice versa</i> or the Danish Broadcasting Authority handing over their service to Sweden.  We have many problems which might be helped by television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We asked the Government to show <Col N="498" />&ldquo;Open University&rdquo; which would be a great boon to our educational service. If we cannot afford to build schools we could bring into each home this educational programme for adults which would not cost a great deal of money.  RTE are doing their best at the moment.  They will be the cat's paw in the Government's scheme and will be blamed for the shortcomings of the national television service.  They are starved financially and told to borrow abroad.  From the figures for RTE given in the Minister's speech they may find it very difficult to borrow abroad.</P>
    <P>Some people may dream of the day when we have a fine television service.  My dream is to see a service without advertisements.  I commend the BBC in this respect.  At the moment if one wants to watch a programme on RTE one must watch advertisements because no programme can be seen right through without a break.  Until the Government do some rethinking on the financing of television, RTE, unfortunately, must continue to sell time.  I cannot see an end to this.  If the Government decide to have a purely commercial station it would be very easy and economical to run such a station showing only canned material.  We must ask ourselves if such a station would be worth running.  Unless the Government have a financial plan for RTE, the Authority will be forced to buy more and more canned programmes, whether American or British.  This will mean a lean time for our actors because the money will not be there for home-produced programmes.  This may drive more and more people on the east coast in desperation to look at other channels.  This would be a grave error.</P>
    <P>No matter what the Minister says, I see no hope for the service unless there is a change of heart or a change of Minister who will bring some new thinking on the subject and give the people what they want and not what the Minister thinks they want.  I believe we have many men and women of ability both inside and outside RTE who can present good home-produced programmes.  I do not want to sound insular and reject outside programmes, <Col N="499" /> but I believe in today's world that no man is an island: it might even be said that no country is an island. We must develop our national genius. We should be able to develop such a television service that because of its excellence we will be able to sell our programmes to other countries.  A short time ago an RTE production won a prize at an international competition.  I am convinced that RTE, despite its many faults, have men and women who, if given the opportunity and financial backing, could make it a better station so that people might not want to watch other stations.  This is the ideal at which RTE must aim but they must be assured by the Government that they will have sufficient backing and freedom.</P>
    <P>When another Government was in power we often heard criticism from the Minister about the interference of the then Government in the RTE service.  We know that if RTE step out of line, or appear to do so, the present Government, through the Minister, <Col N="500" /> will rap them on the knuckles.  When in Opposition the Minister was a great liberal but now he is in Government it is a different situation.  He is now trying to tell the people what is good for them but the small number of people interviewed in the survey, exercising their democratic rights, have rejected his proposal.  This is a healthy sign because it shows that the State was not able to take over completely.</P>
    <P>Far from being a gesture by the Government, in my opinion they took the easy way out of an embarrassing situation when they realised that the trade unions&mdash;Equity or the Irish and British unions&mdash;would not allow this new transfer of power from RTE to the BBC.  In years to come people may look back and wonder at a Government who contemplated such a step.</P>

There was no evidence that he had been made redundant by his employer.  The claimant, who subsequently obtained other employment, has appealed against the deciding officer's decision and an oral hearing of the appeal at which it will be open to him to attend and give evidence on his own behalf is due to take place this week.</P>

      <P>The essential purposes of the small farm (incentive bonus) scheme was to encourage the planned development of eligible farms. Similarly the farm modernisation scheme now places particular emphasis on the concept of planned development for all farms and the levels of aid available under that scheme provide an adequate incentive to farmers to undertake such planned development. The farm modernisation scheme is based on EEC Directive 159/72 and discussions have recently been initiated with the EEC Commission concerning a number of aspects of that Directive which it was felt merited reappraisal in the light of experience here up to now.  Any changes in the present system of aids will depend on the outcome of these discussions.</P>

      <P>The enrolments in Scoil Mhuire, Brosna, having fallen below the figure which would warrant the continued employment of two teachers, the assistant teacher there was placed on the diocesan panel on 1st July, 1975.  This means that the teacher in question will be required to accept the first vacancy for an assistant teacher occuring in the diocese as from 1st October, 1975, whereupon Scoil Mhuire will become a one-teacher school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances consideration is being given to the closing of the <Col N="376" /> school and its amalgamation with another school in the parish.  Arrangements will be made, in consultation with the school management, for an inspector of my Department to meet the parents to discuss the matter with them.</P>
    <P>Only minimum essential repairs to the school could be authorised and it would be preferable to await the outcome of the meeting before incurring any expenditure.</P>

      <P>The material referred to in the question comprises (a) photographs and (b) an advertisement for a book of photographs in the named magazine.  Accordingly, the statement in the question that the publication of these items is contrary to the law is clearly an expression of opinion on a matter in which only a court can give an authoritative decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institution of criminal proceedings is a matter for the Garda Síochána acting where necessary in consultation with or on the directions of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is open to the Deputy, or to any other person who may think that the publication of particular material involves a breach of the criminal law, <Col N="377" /> to make a formal complaint to the local Garda Síochána, who, if it appeared to them that there was some reasonable ground for complaint, would submit the matter for the directions of the law officers.</P>

      <P>Crime statistics are compiled annually in respect of the 12 month period ending on 30th September in each year and are published in the annual reports of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on crime.  The following are the number of cases of rape which were reported or became known to the Garda during the five years up to 30th September, 1974:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1970, 15; 1971, 24; 1972, 26; 1973, 42; 1974, 29.</P>
      <P>During the quarter ended 31st December, 1974, a further six cases were reported or became known to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 48 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, provides that a person convicted of the crime of rape shall be liable to be kept in penal servitude for life.  No minimum penalty is provided.  It is a matter for the courts to determine the penalty to be imposed in individual cases and <Col N="378" /> I have no proposals to introduce amending legislation to provide for a minimum penalty which would limit the discretion of the court.</P>
    <P>Calculation of the average period served by persons sentenced to imprisonment for any offence would require a special examination of individual files.  It may be taken that, in general, the period served in prison is the period to which the person is sentenced less the usual one-quarter remission for good conduct.  In some cases, when circumstances of a mitigating nature apply, somewhat earlier release under supervision may be allowed.  In this connection it might be mentioned that in 1974 prison sentences imposed for rape ranged from 18 months to ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that it would be defensible to have a provision which would oblige persons to undergo medical tests and treatment for disease simply because they were accused of certain offences, since, for one thing, an accused person is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is proved in court.</P>
      <P>If legislation of the kind suggested was justified on health grounds, consideration of it would not be a matter primarily for me as Minister for Justice.</P>
