    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I <Col N="756" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>During the present year I had a series of lengthy meetings with the Irish Veterinary Union on the subject of our disease eradication schemes at which representatives of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association and the Irish Farmers' Association were also present.  There was general agreement on many of the issues discussed but there was total opposition on the part of the union to the proposed employment by my Department of trained lay personnel for the taking of blood samples under the brucellosis eradication scheme.  I had proposed this measure basically because I considered it would give speedier, more controlled and therefore better service to herdowners while costing less to the Exchequer.  In the course of the discussions with the union I made one concession after another in an effort to secure the union's acceptance of my proposal.  I had at the outset decided to introduce the lay blood samplers in the 13 counties in which the brucellosis eradication scheme is in operation.  As a compromise, I then indicated that I would confine the lay blood samplers to the six north-western counties of the brucellosis free area where brucellosis has already been eradicated but where control testing must be continued to clear small pockets of infection and to guard against the reintroduction of the disease.  When this, too, was rejected by the union my final offer was to confine the lay personnel to the sampling of 50 per cent of the herds in those six north-western counties leaving to the veterinary practitioner the sampling of the other 50 per cent of the herds in the area, that is, the herds that would normally fall to be tested for TB purposes by the veterinary practitioner under the biennial TB testing already in operation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The union also objected to the proposed tuberculin testing by veterinary officers of my Department of 50 per cent of the herds in Waterford and Kilkenny where the incidence of TB has not improved in recent years and is now the highest in the country.  I am satisfied that a reduction in the <Col N="757" /> level of TB in these countries can only be secured by the type of intervention by the Department's veterinary staff which has in the past proved successful in other problem areas.</P>
    <P>Another item which has been under dispute related to biennial TB testing. This is already in operation in seven north-western counties where the low disease incidence warranted that course.  For this reason I proposed to extend the area to cover Counties Longford, Louth, Meath and north Galway but, as the union complained of insufficient notice, I agreed to postpone this measure to the beginning of 1976.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that damage has been done as a result of the dispute. In fact the concentration during the current year on known reactor herds, on problem herds and on problem areas has proved very successful in reducing or eliminating infection. The incidence of disease in herds generally should not have deteriorated unduly, provided herdowners have continued to exercise good herd management and to comply with my Department's movement and other veterinary regulations.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I am not in a position to indicate when TB and brucellosis testing will return to normal.  This largely depends on the acceptance by the union of what can only be described as a set of very reasonable proposals, based on procedures adopted by other countries which have been more successful than we have in their efforts to eradicate these diseases.</P>
    <P>I am still hopeful that the Irish Veterinary Union will appreciate that my proposals have been reduced to the bare minimum and that they will withdraw their objections so that the future of the disease eradication programme and the position of the farming community will not be put at risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it now that no negotiations or attempted negotiations have taken place since last July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="758" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>And there are no signs of negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no arrangements for further negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he was not aware of any damage.  I defy the Minister to prove that.  He knows how important eradication is.  Surely the Minister knows damage is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised there is no undue damage being done because we have been concentrating on reactor herds, on herds where lesions have turned up in the factories and in herds adjacent to those herds, and the number of reactor herds has been reduced very substantially in the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that farmers who want to sell cattle have to pay to get them tested privately and they are afraid other cattle are not being tested?</P>
      <P>The vets are still earning money testing and the Department are saving money because they have not got to pay for the tests.  The feeling is that neither side is too worried about fixing the strike.  This is what the ordinary farmer thinks.  He has to pay all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The veterinary profession this year have already got £1.37 million from the Department. They are earning money from the Department as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>How much are they earning from the farmers from whom they should not earn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Very small amounts for testing.  They always earned a small amount for testing for farmers in cases where cards were lost or ear tags disappeared.  When the identity of the animal could not be decided they had to pay for their own tests. They have to pay only a very limited amount.  Cards are being updated by the people in the local office if the herd has had a reasonably good history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it is in the interests of <Col N="759" /> disease eradication to update cards without a test?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being done where the history of the herds concerned justifies this procedure.  The veterinary section of the Department must get credit for the fact that they always erred on the safe side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have five very important questions down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I have given the Deputy a lot of latitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not take sides in this dispute but I have been informed by the veterinary profession that the Minister told them some time ago to plan a five years practice and assured them there would be testing for brucellosis for five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said previously to the Deputy, we had discussions lasting for four half days about the middle of the year.  We agreed on procedures which we considered would be very much better than the existing ones over the whole range of disease eradication.  We got stuck completely on the proposal to introduce lay technicians for blood sampling.  That is all that went wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state if one of the concessions offered was that the lay personnel would work under the supervision of the vets?  Is the Minister prepared to grant the supervision of the scheme to the vets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a concession was not sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were sought would the Minister grant it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was prepared to listen to any proposal put forward. That was not one of the proposals put forward.  They simply do not want lay technicians.  Their attitude was that the effect of this would be to reduce the income of veterinary surgeons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="760" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the vets are concerned that cattle medicines should not pass into the hands of laymen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very routine job.  It is amazing the way it can be done.  Blood samples can be taken from human beings without doctors taking them.  We are all aware of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the supervision of doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's analogy with blood tests being taken from human beings, are there certain qualifications which the lay technicians to whom he refers would be required to have for the purpose of taking tests from animals? The second part of the question is: is it a fact that we will require to be brucellosis free for EEC purposes by 1978?  If that is so, could the Minister say what effect a continuing strike will have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The lay blood samplers will be trained by the veterinary surgeons.  They eliminated tuberculosis entirely on the basis of lay technicians in Northern Ireland and did quite a good job.  They also have them in the UK.  It is quite right to say we are supposed to be clear of these diseases by 1978 but these things are negotiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us any hope that negotiations will resume?  Can we tell the farmers there is some hope this dispute will be resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the veterinary profession will see the senselessness of the path they are following.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The testing to which he refers is a purely private arrangement between the farmer and his veterinary practitioner. Apart from other important considerations, I have not been involved in determining the level of the fees now being charged to farmers for private testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many farmers think they should sue the Department for the private tests and that they would be entitled to get this money from the Department because they are supposed to be tested free to eradicate the disease.  All farmers selling cattle have to test.  It is very unfair.</P>

      <P>Official cattle identity tags are made available only to officers of my Department and to veterinary practitioners engaged in tuberculin testing and blood sampling under the bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication schemes.  They were also supplied to a limited extent to artificial insemination stations in connection with the warble fly eradication scheme which operated in the years 1971-1974.  Cattle identity cards are made available only to officers of my Department.  If the Deputy is aware of any instances where tags and cards were available to persons other than the categories I have mentioned I would be glad if he would let me have full particulars so that the matter may be investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is satisfied that his Department are doing enough to encourage the use of mole draining in the drumlin soils; the scope of the grants available for such work and if they are adequate; and if the necessary ploughs are easily available for the work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department encourage mole drainage of drumlin soils in all cases where the soil conditions are suitable.  The grants available for mole drainage are on the same basis as for ordinary land drainage and reclamation works, that is 50 per cent or 40 per cent of the cost depending on the applicants category under the farm modernisation scheme.  I am satisfied that these grants offer a sufficient inducement to farmers to carry out mole drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants have been made available from the special regional development <Col N="763" /> fund towards the purchase of drainage equipment, including mole ploughs, for County Leitrim.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 16 inclusive together.</P>
      <P>The cattle feed vouchers were provided by the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters Society Ltd.  My Department co-operated by having the vouchers distributed to eligible applicants through the local Farm Development Service (Land Project) offices.  As stated on the vouchers, they were returnable by the feed suppliers to the society for encashment.</P>
      <P>The vouchers were financed first by a contribution by beef export factories to their society's fund from intervention beef payments to the factories, the fund being later supplemented by an Exchequer advance against the temporary withdrawal of a VAT credit payable to meat factories and other registered cattle purchasers so that the cost should be met in full by the cattle and beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The society received more than enough money to pay all genuine <Col N="765" /> vouchers issued.  Pending Garda investigations into a fraud in relation to forged vouchers encashed by the society, my Department would not be justified in advancing further money out of public funds for the discharge of the society's remaining liabilities of about £200,000 for genuine vouchers. The society has been informed that appropriate consideration can be given to its position <i>vis-á-vis</i> my Department when the outcome of the Garda investigations becomes known. Encashment of the outstanding genuine vouchers is, therefore, the liability of the society.  My Department has informed the society that it should now arrange, as was done at the commencement of the fund, to raise money from its members or from such other sources as are available to meet the outstanding claims; and that my Department would be prepared to give their co-operation if the society and its members should wish to contribute this by means of a deduction, as previously, from the moneys payable to factories for intervention beef.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it from the Minister that he is not accepting liability at all even though it was a Departmental scheme?  I understand what the Minister said is correct about the mechanism of the scheme. But it was a Departmental scheme and merchants honoured these dockets because they understood they could rely on the credibility of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, which is at stake at present. Never again will merchants supply anything under a Departmental scheme if these are not honoured. Would the Minister state that, when everything is over, they will be honoured by somebody?  It is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised, first of all, to hear Deputy Callanan emphatically describe this as a Departmental <Col N="766" /> scheme because, on a previous occasion, I heard him describe it emphatically as a fresh meat exporters' scheme.  It suits him on this occasion to take this view when, in fact, the moneys have come entirely from the industry the vouchers are headed &ldquo;Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' Society Limited&rdquo; and the dockets for encashment go back to them.  The one thing the Department did was to supply the people to distribute the vouchers for the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters and I am legally advised that the Department have no responsibility in the world for the payment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a criticism of the Department.  It is a criticism of the Irish fresh meat exporters, if it is a criticism of anybody.  We simply induce them to contribute this money for such a relief scheme.  Everybody in the House will agree that this was a satisfactory scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To that extent at least is it not true that the Exchequer was involved in the financing of it?  As Deputy Brennan has established, the scheme was devised by the Department. This being so, would the Minister accept in view of the hardship being created for many people who cannot afford it that he ought to ensure payment of the outstanding genuine vouchers without prejudice to his rights in regard to either the society involved or anybody else who may be involved and pursue his remedy afterwards?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The high level of cow slaughterings this year is due mainly to the fact that in recent years, while the national herd was being built up, many cows were retained beyond the normal culling stage.  Inevitably there had to be increased slaughterings at a later stage, and this is what has been happening this year.  It is expected that cow slaughterings in the coming year will be at a much more normal level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that cow slaughterings this year are a result of their not getting the bull last year because calves were so cheap?  Is this not the whole reason for the reduction in the cow population?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The total breeding herd in the country at present is quite high and at a very satisfactory level, which indicates that people have kept cows that they would not otherwise have kept because the price in 1973 was so good and in anticipation of a continuation of that price which did not materialise.  Therefore, people simply got out of the older cows and they certainly got out of some of the single suckle cows.</P>

      <P>According to the June figures, the breeding herd was 2,249,000, and if you go back to 1973 it was 2,347,300, not a significant drop having regard to the number of old cows that were kept on to have an extra calf.</P>

      <P>While disposals of cattle this year have been unusually high, this has resulted from the carryover of large stocks from 1974 and the removal of cows which had been retained beyond the normal culling stage.  The overall cattle supply situation is very sound and it is expected that disposals during 1976 will again be at a satisfactory level.  The beef market has strengthened significantly and the future outlook for beef is now very promising. Farmers should therefore have every confidence in continuing to expand production.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if his attention has been drawn to the statement (details supplied) that the lifting of the sanction on the importation of South American beef into the EEC may be happening gradually; if this is correct; and, if so, the adverse effect it will have on the marketing of Irish beef.</P>

      <P>Decisions on the relaxation of the ban on imports of <Col N="773" /> beef from third countries are made exclusively by the European Commission. I have strongly opposed the relaxation measures already decided upon by the Commission and I have also emphasised on several occasions in the Council of Ministers that the ban should not be removed until cattle prices in all member states have reached satisfactory levels.</P>
      <P>As regards the effects on Irish beef the increasing buoyancy of the Community beef market and the improving conditions for exports of Irish beef as a result of monetary changes are operating to counter the effects of the relaxation measures already taken by the Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the ground limestone transport subsidy scheme purchasers of ground limestone in all counties pay a flat rate of 46p per ton towards the cost of transport from the quarry to the purchasers' premises.  The greater part of the transport cost is met by an Exchequer subsidy, which averages over £1 per ton and cost £1.52 million last year.</P>
      <P>While there has been a regrettable decline in limestone usage, the cost of liming land in this country is still cheaper than anywhere else in Europe.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>By Government decision CIE have overall responsibility for operating the scheme except for limestone produced by CSET, the Irish Sugar Company.  The subsidy is paid by the Department to CIE as haulage rates negotiated from time to time and approved by the Government.  Up to 3rd December, 1974 the Exchequer <Col N="777" /> subsidy covered the total cost of transport from the quarry to the farmers' premises subject to mileage limitations. This averaged £1.03 per ton on a national basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In August, 1974 the Government decided that any increase in CIE's operating costs of the scheme would not be met by a subsidy and that the users of ground limestone should contribute to increased transport charges at a flat rate of 21p per ton of limestone purchased.  I believe that is what the Deputy was looking for.  The increase was 21p.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost 100 per cent increase, as the Deputy has pointed out.  In the context of that, is the Minister serious in urging farmers to continue applying limestone when clearly the Government are not trying to encourage them?  On the contrary, if they are allowing an increase of nearly 100 per cent they are doing the exact opposite?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have illustrated with many examples the results of putting on lime and artificial fertilisers and the returns that will be got from the money spent.  If the Deputy is trying to discourage people by pretending that 21p extra for a ton of lime should induce them to make up their minds not to put on lime he is doing a great disservice to farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the start of the energy crisis there has been a fall in fertiliser usage due mainly to rising fertiliser prices.  The improved prices for the main farm products have, however, offset some of the increased cost.</P>
      <P>With a view to stimulating the usage of fertilisers I have brought together a committee representing all the interests concerned to advise on promotional work in this sector.  I, myself, have emphasised on several occasions that it is false economy to curtail the necessary level of fertiliser application to grass and crops and that even at present high prices it pays to apply the optimum levels of fertiliser.</P>

Would the Minister not now agree that it would be money well spent because of the way in which the use of fertilisers has gone down during the last 12 months?

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has said is partly correct.  There was a previous decision to set up a plant at Cratloe and a site was purchased for that purpose.  There was very considerable disagreement on this and where the supplies would come from for it. I had numerous meetings in the Department with the suppliers from Clare and Limerick.  In fact, I had a number of meetings at which public representatives from all parties were present.  My only concern was that the decision the producers wanted was eventually arrived at.  It was their decision that the right thing to do was to sell the properties of the Dairy Disposal Company in Clare and Limerick to Golden Vale who purchased them on the assumption of getting a certain supply of milk.  Since that time they have lost 18 million gallons of their normal supplies which have by-passed Golden Vale plants. In these circumstances it was extremely difficult for them to maintain the same level of employment.</P>
      <P>As we have seen quite recently in the papers and through other channels it was necessary for them to make the sort of rationalisation they have set out on.  A number of the people employed have accepted conditions for retirement and have not seriously objected to them.  I do not think anybody wants to see people become redundant but in the case of this society it was felt, if they were to remain in existence, that this was the only thing that could give them continued viability, that these reductions had to take place more especially when the milk was diverted elsewhere. This is happening in a year when milk production has already gone up 8.4 per cent.</P>

      <P>Was this possibility not envisaged by some people at least at the time of the decision to locate at Cratloe?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Cratloe would not have made the slightest difference.  It could have made no difference whatever in deciding to set up an unwanted plant.  No extra plant was necessary because there was not enough milk for it.  Incidentally, we have sold some <Col N="782" /> of the equipment since and hope to sell the remainder of it.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take together Questions Nos. 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44.</P>
      <P>The number of redundancies notified to my Department by employers as qualified for payments in the year ended 30th September, 1975, was 18,480.</P>
      <P>The estimated expenditure incurred by the redundancy fund in the year ended 30th September, 1975 was £5,860,000.</P>
      <P>The fund is financed by way of weekly contributions by employers and workers and the present rates of contribution are providing an income of approximately £4½ million a year. Because of the increase in the number of redundancies, this income is not sufficient to meet the outgoings with the result that the level of the fund on the 30th September, 1975 as expressed in terms of money in the investment account, was nil, as compared with £185,000 at the same time last year.  However, under Section 27 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, the Minister for Finance may authorise repayable advances to the fund from the Exchequer to supplement its income from contributions. On 30th September, 1975 the fund had received a total of such advances of £1.3 million to meet its statutory obligations.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, concerned that the fund is not at present self-supporting and if the employment situation does not improve I shall have to consider increases in the rates of contributions. As these increases will require affirmative resolutions in both Houses of the Oireachtas before I can make the necessary order, the House will have the opportunity of debating the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the question of increases in the rates of contributions I am reviewing the operation of the scheme and I shall seek to give effect <Col N="788" /> to what changes I consider appropriate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that disbursements from the fund come under three headings, namely,</P>
    <P>1.  Weekly payments to the workers.</P>
    <P>2.  Percentage rebate payments to employers in respect of lump sums paid by them to the redundant workers, and</P>
    <P>3.  Payment of lump sums to workers from the fund in cases where the employer has failed to pay, for example, insolvency.</P>
    <P>Unless there were some extraordinary features in a particular case, there is no delay in making the normal weekly redundancy payments which the workers are entitled to in addition to their social welfare benefits.  These payments are made through the employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>In line with the increases in the number of redundancies, there has been an increase in the number of claims for rebate payments being received from employers in respect of redundancy lump sums which they have paid to redundant workers.  My Department have on hands 1,100 such claims to a total value of £870,000 from approximately 900 employers.</P>
    <P>In a case where an employer fails to pay the lump sum to a worker, I am empowered to authorise payment of the lump sum out of the fund. Authority is given only after careful investigation to establish the facts in the particular case.  There are on hands at present claims for lump sum payments in this category from approximately 600 workers to a total face value of £230,000.</P>
    <P>I have recently ordered that priority should be given to the work of clearing these arrears and I expect that this will be achieved during the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if the £1.3 million which he said had been advanced by the Exchequer to the redundancy fund because of a <Col N="789" /> short-fall in the amount available came from the excess money on hands which is lying to the benefit of the Exchequer in the pay-related fund?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé, signed on 28th February, 1975, together with the related internal agreement on the measures and procedures required for implementation of the convention and the internal agreement on the financing and administration of Community Aid, signed on 11th July, 1975, copies of which have been laid before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Convention of Lomé represents the outcome of negotiations opened on 17th October, 1973, after an inaugural conference in July of that year, and concluded some 15 months later on 31st January, 1975.  The convention was signed, subject to ratification, at a ceremony in Lomé, Togo, on 28th February, 1975.  I am advised that legislation may be required to give effect to some provisions in the instruments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The origins of the negotiations of 1973-75 lie in two previous agreements between the Community and groups of African States.  In 1963, 18 former colonies of member States of the Six signed a Convention at Yaoundé, Cameroon, by which they entered into <Col N="799" /> an Association Agreement with the EEC.  This was followed by the agreement signed at Arusha, Tanzania, in 1969, establishing an association between the Community on the one hand, and Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda on the other.  These agreements provided for reciprocal preferential trading arrangements.</P>
    <P>By 1973, when further periods of association were to be negotiated between the parties to the Yaoundé and Arusha Conventions, Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom had acceded to the European Communities.  Instead of the extension of the provisions of the existing conventions to the new member states, it was envisaged that a new form of association be negotiated between the nine on one side, and a wider range of developing countries on the other, including in particular, the Commonwealth countries enjoying a special trading position with the United Kingdom.  Accordingly, the Community invited certain African, Caribbean, Indian Ocean and Pacific countries in June, 1973 to take part in negotiations designed to define their future relations with the Community. The following countries were invited: the 18 signatories of the Yaoundé Convention; the 20 independent Commonwealth states mentioned in annex VI of the Accession Treaty, including the three Arusha signatories; and four other independent African states&mdash;Ethiopia, the Republic of Guinea, Liberia, and the Sudan.  Invitations were subsequently extended to four states who had become independent during the period of the negotiations namely Grenada, the Bahamas, Equatorial Guinea, and Guinea Bissau.</P>
    <P>The negotiations between the EEC and the 46 ACP countries were held during a period of great significance for the future relations of developed with developing countries.  In April, 1974 there took place the Sixth Special Session of the UN General Assembly, the first Special Session devoted to Raw Materials and Development, to which the Seventh Special Session this September was a sequel.  The Sixth Special Session adopted a declaration, as well as a programme of action, on the establishment <Col N="800" /> of a new international economic order.  These resolutions were followed by a Charter on the Economic Rights and Duties of States, adopted in December, 1974 at the 29th Regular Session of the United Nations General Assembly. These resolutions did not command the unanimous support of UN member states, as the industrialised countries had reservations in varying degrees on several points.  In this context the successful conclusion of the EEC-ACP negotiations was an important break-through as an example of successful co-operation between developed and developing countries.  In the goodwill it engendered, in its wide range, in the fact that all sides saw themselves to benefit, the Lomé Convention is already recognised as a model for relations between states at different stages of economic development and of widely diverging economic and political interests.  In my view there is more to be done in devising more equitable relationships between developed and developing countries in general and there are other areas of economic policy in which the needs of developing countries will have to be taken into account.  But given the practical situation facing the EEC and ACP negotiators we have every reason to take satisfaction from the outcome of their work.  The Lomé Convention was a step on the road to real consensus between developed and developing countries, and, hopefully, to a relationship that will be generous and fruitful.</P>
    <P>It is a cause for particular satisfaction that the convention was signed during the Irish Presidency of the European Community.  I had the honour of leading the Community's delegation in the arduous concluding negotiations last January that led to this agreement and in the signing ceremony that took place in Togo at the end of February.  I had the special and memorable honour of signing the agreement both on behalf of Ireland and on behalf of the Community. During the negotiations it was possible to observe at first hand both the extraordinary complexity of the problems that faced us, representatives <Col N="801" /> of 55 states in seeking to place our relations on a new basis beneficial to some degree at least to every one of these 55 and also the goodwill shown by all sides in seeking solutions to the problems raised by negotiation.</P>
    <P>The new convention is set out in the form of titles governing various areas of co-operation.  The full text, as well as a useful explanatory memorandum prepared by the Council secretariat of the European Communities, has been made available to Members of the House.  It might be useful to summarise the contents of the different titles and to touch on their more important implications.</P>
    <P>Title I provides for access into the Community without customs duties or quantitative restrictions for industrial and agricultural products from the ACP countries, except for agricultural products subject to the common agricultural policy for which special arrangements have been made.  Title II concerns the stabilisation of export earnings&mdash;a novel feature in the field of international economic co-operation to which I shall revert later.  Title III governs industrial co-operation, to which I shall also return.  Title IV on financial and technical co-operation provides for projects and programmes which will contribute to the economic and social development of the ACP states.  Title V governs provisions relating to establishment, services payments and capital movements.  As regards the arrangements to be applied to establishment and provision of services, the convention lays down the principle of non-discriminatory treatment in ACP states in respect of nationals and companies or firms of member states, and in the member states, in respect of nationals and companies or firms of the ACP states.  Title VI on institutions provides for an ACP-EEC Council of Ministers, Committee of Ambassadors and a Consultative Assembly.  Title VII on general and final provisions provides that the convention shall expire after a period of five years from the date of its signature, namely on 1st March, 1980.</P>
    <P>In addition to the titles there are <Col N="802" /> seven protocols, dealing with the concept of &ldquo;originating products&rdquo;, the application of financial and technical co-operation, the special products sugar, bananas and rum, the operating expenditure of the institutions, and privileges and immunities.</P>
    <P>Title I on trade co-operation is, of course, central; it provides for access into the Community without customs duties and taxes of equivalent effect, and without quotas or quantitative restrictions, for all ACP industrial and agricultural products except for agricultural products that fall under the common agricultural policy.  This is a concession of major importance, and it is in accord with the new emphasis placed by developing countries on improving their terms of trade.  It might be noted that the trade provisions in the Lomé Convention are not restricted to manufactured and semi-finished products, as is the generalised scheme of preferences already implemented unilaterally by the Community.  In consequence, the Lomé provisions extend to primary products of tropical origin, which are a major element in the export trade of many of the ACP states.  Another key aspect is that the Lomé Convention, unlike the Yaoundé Convention and the majority of preferential agreements, does not involve &ldquo;reciprocity&rdquo;&mdash;no obligation in principle is laid on the ACP states as regards the extending of preferences to the Community.</P>
    <P>As already indicated, another main feature of the convention is the provision for financial and technical co-operation, designed to correct structural imbalances in various sectors of the ACP countries' economies.  For this purpose, the convention allocates a total of 3,390 million units of account&mdash;almost £2,000 million at current values&mdash;of which 3,000 million units of account&mdash;or £1,710 million approximately&mdash;will be made available from the European Development Fund (EDF) while the remaining 390 million units of account&mdash;or £220 million approximately&mdash;will be furnished by the European Investment Bank (EIB) from its own resources.  I should mention here that the Council of Ministers and the governors of the <Col N="803" /> bank have decided that, for the purposes of the convention, the unit of account should be defined in terms of a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of the currencies of the member States and that the value of the unit in the various national currencies should be calculated by the Commission using daily market exchange rates.  Accordingly, references to amounts in sterling in relation to the convention are made on the basis of the current value of the unit of account which is £0.57.</P>
    <P>The composition of the aid from the European Development Fund is 2,100 million units of account&mdash;or £1,200 million approximately&mdash;in the form of grants, 430 million units of account&mdash;or £245 million approximately&mdash;in the form of special loans, 95 million units of account&mdash;or £55 million approximately&mdash;in the form of risk capital and 375 million units of account&mdash;or £210 million approximately&mdash;in respect of the stabilisation of export earnings.  Article 46 of the convention outlines the very wide variety of projects and programmes which may be financed.  These include: capital projects in all the main economic and social sectors; schemes for the improvement of the structure of agricultural production; schemes relating to technical co-operation, industrial information and promotion, and marketing and sales promotion; projects for the assistance of small and medium-sized firms and, finally, what are described as &ldquo;microprojects&rdquo; for grassroots development, in particular in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Among other main provisions are those relating to regional and interregional co-operation, the special needs of the least developed ACP countries and the granting of exceptional aid in the case of serious difficulties arising from natural disasters. Moreover, the Financial and Technical Co-operation Title is supplemented by a detailed Protocol, namely, Protocol No. 2, specifying the relevant administrative arrangements and procedures governing the implementation of these provisions of the convention. Both the convention and this protocol provide for a high degree of participation <Col N="804" /> by the ACP countries in the management of Community aid.  In general, it is recognised that this aid can only be complementary to the ACP countries' own development efforts and that it should be integrated into the economic and social development plans and programmes of these countries.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the provisions for financial and technical co-operation will afford new opportunities for foreign earnings to the Irish business community.  Under Title IV of the convention and Protocol 2 on the application of financial and technical co-operation, machinery had been established whereby Irish firms can tender, on equal terms with their Community and ACP counterparts, for works and supply contracts, financed by the European Development Fund, whose resources are managed by the Commission.  In addition, it is open to Irish firms to register with the Commission for selection for consultancy contracts in the architectural and engineering sectors.  I am happy to note that several Irish business interests are already active in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to forecast how much of this business will go to Irish firms. As I have already said, competition will be with firms both in the other member States and in the ACP.  It is reasonable to hope, however, that Ireland's share of the new business could be considerable.  Exactly how much success we enjoy will depend on the energy and imagination shown by Irish concerns in competing for the available contracts.  The advice of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and of my Department, will be available at all times to members of the business community who wish to be appraised of the formalities involved for Irish exporters, consultants, construction companies, and so on, under the new arrangements in order to enable them to take advantage of the opportunities which these present.</P>
    <P>It is worth drawing attention to the innovatory significance of the provisions for the stabilisation of export earnings.  This scheme, known in abbreviated form as &ldquo;stabex&rdquo; is the subject of Title II.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> The problem which the stabilisation scheme is designed to counteract is the disturbance caused by fluctuations in export receipts, as, for example, when a country with very few major exports is dependent on a commodity from which the income is unstable. Such fluctuations create difficulties for economic planners: they disrupt investment projects, force Governments to increase taxes or resort to borrowing in order to maintain the level of public expenditure, and provoke other undesirable reactions in the economy which inevitably result from a climate of uncertainty.</P>
    <P>In looking for measures to prevent excessive fluctuations, the EEC and ACP negotiators avoided a solution which would have seriously interfered with the free play of the markets or created confusion in international trade.</P>
    <P>The stabilisation system incorporated in the convention involves the Community making moneys available from the European Development Fund to compensate producers in the ACP countries for sudden, sharp falls in their income from particular commodities.  Compensation is in the form of concessional loans.  The ACP States which receive such financial transfers are obliged to contribute in the five years following allocation of each transfer towards the reconstitution of the resources made available for the system by the Community. ACP countries which are regarded as being the least developed&mdash;these are listed in article 48 of the convention&mdash; are exempted from having to make any contribution to the reconstitution of the fund.  To become eligible for compensation, a country has to depend to a certain degree on income from a particular product; and secondly, income on that product in the year in which a claim is made must fall below a certain level.</P>
    <P>The detailed workings of the system are set out in article 19 of the text of the convention.  As a final observation, I will point out that the reference level in establishing whether there has been a significant fall in income in respect of a particular product covered by the system is the average of the previous four years' <Col N="806" /> income; it is, therefore, a figure which changes from year to year; so that the conditions on which compensation can be claimed by the ACP exporters adjust themselves in accordance with long-term trends in the patterns of trade.</P>
    <P>This stabex system is novel in that it compensates states for a fall in export receipts for particular commodities, and helps them to plan their economies without the pitfall of unpredictable falls in earnings in key sectors.  It is thus a system which is designed to encourage, if I may use the phrase, the organic growth of economies, and it is moreover a system which seeks to avoid seriously disrupting the workings of market forces.  As the scheme is original in conception, so it tries to be generous with respect to the detailed arrangements negotiated between the European Community and its ACP partners.</P>
    <P>Another innovatory feature of the Lomé Convention should also be mentioned, namely, the separate and extensive provision made for industrial co-operation.  Although financial and technical co-operation is the most important factor in this field, a separate title, Title III, attempts to cover the full range of possibilities for co-operation with the ACP States in their attempts to expand the industrial sector of their economies.  This corresponds to the resolve in the Preamble to the Convention to establish a new model for relations between developed and developing States.  In the provisions for industrial co-operation, the European Community recognises the increasing part to be played by developing countries in industrial production and in the international trade in processed products.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most original part of the industrial co-operation chapter of the convention are the &ldquo;animation&rdquo; or promotion arrangements.  The convention provides for an industrial co-operation Committee to monitor progress on the implementation of Title III, and also for an Industrial Development Centre, operating under the supervision of the Committee and concerned with the exchange of information, the making of contacts, and <Col N="807" /> other activities connected with industrial promotion.</P>
    <P>The mechanisms established at Lomé for the stabilisation of export earnings and for industrial co-operation are of relevance to those engaged in other fora in the devising of new forms of relationships between the developed countries and the Third World.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Lomé Convention itself, the Dáil is being asked to approve two related internal agreements.</P>
    <P>This internal agreement provides for Community consultation in determining the common position to be adopted by the representatives of the Community in the Council of ACP-EEC Ministers, as laid down in the convention, and has provisions for implementing the various articles of that convention which may require action by the Community, joint action by the member States, or action by a member State.  In addition, the agreement lays down the rules governing implementation within the Community of decisions, recommendations and opinions of the Council of ACP-EEC Ministers, and provides for procedural rules for the settlement of disputes which may arise between member States with regard to the convention.</P>
    <P>The second internal agreement concluded by the member States establishes the provisions for the financing and administration of Community aid under the convention.</P>
    <P>As regards financing, the agreement establishes the fourth European Development Fund consisting of 3,150 million units of account, i.e. 3,000 million units of account for allocation to the ACP countries as prescribed by the convention and an additional 150 million units of account for the overseas countries and territories which are associated with the Community under Part IV of the Treaty, as amended by Article 24 of the Act of Accession and the French overseas departments.  Ireland's contribution to this fund has been assessed at 18.9 million units of account or 0.6 per cent of the total <Col N="808" /> which corresponds to our share of the Community's GNP.</P>
    <P>For the reasons already indicated, it can be expected that the value of the unit of account in terms of each national currency will fluctuate throughout the period covered by the convention.  It is not possible, therefore to indicate precisely what overall contribution in Irish pounds this country will be called upon to make. However, on the basis of the current value of the unit of account, <i>viz</i>, 1 unit of account=£0.57, our overall contribution would be in the region of £11 million.  At this stage, it is not expected that our annual subscriptions will follow a uniform pattern: they will be lower than average initially and rise to a peak in the later years of the convention.  Moreover, while the Community has agreed to endeavour to implement fully the financial provisions within the period of the convention, it is possible that the call-up of subscriptions from the member States might not be completed and would, therefore, extend beyond that period.</P>
    <P>As regards the European Investment Bank, the internal agreement provides for loans from the bank of up to 400 million units of account, i.e. 390 million units of account for allocation to the ACP countries in accordance with the convention and an additional 10 million units of account for the overseas countries and territories and French overseas departments, already referred to.  In this connection, the member States undertake to act as guarantor for the bank, in proportion to their contributions to its capital, to the extent of 30 per cent of the credits opened by the bank.  These undertakings will be the subject of contracts of guarantee between each member State and the bank.</P>
    <P>The internal agreement also determines rules for the management of financial co-operation, the procedure for programming, examining and approving aid and detailed rules for supervising the use of the aid.  It is provided that two committees of representatives of the Governments of member States should be set up under <Col N="809" /> the auspices of the Commission and the bank respectively and with terms of reference as prescribed: one, the EDF Committee, will furnish an opinion on financing proposals for projects or programmes financed by grants or special loans while the other, the &ldquo;Article 22 Committee&rdquo; will give an opinion on requests for loans with interest rate subsidies and on proposals for financing by risk capital.  Ireland will, of course, be represented on each of these committees and we propose to play an active and as positive a role as we can in their deliberations.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to give the House a general review of the content and objectives of the ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé.  Advance implementation of the provisions relating to trade began on 1st July.  It was agreed at Lomé in an exchange of letters that these provisions would be put into effect by means of unilateral decisions; the necessary regulations were adopted by the EEC Council of Ministers on 24th June.  The convention itself, however, cannot enter into force until it has been ratified in accordance with the appropriate internal procedures by at least two-thirds of the 46 ACP States and by all the member States of the Community.  To date 26 of the ACP countries have completed ratification procedures.  Denmark is the only Community member State to have done so as yet.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the motion before this House is worthy of our wholehearted approval.  In the first place, the Lomé Convention is an appropriate response on the part of the European Community to the very considerable needs of the developing world, in keeping with the pattern already established by the Community's generalised scheme of preferences, and other concrete efforts by the Community in recent times to respond positively in terms of the evolution of a new order of economic relationships between developed and developing countries.</P>
    <P>In this convention, as I have said, the Community is entering into a commitment to open its markets fully to products from a large number of developing countries, without those countries having to undertake a reciprocal <Col N="810" /> commitment; this substantial improvement in the ACP partners' terms of trade is supplement by generous financial aid and by innovative schemes in the fields of export earnings and industrialisation.</P>
    <P>The convention is not one-sided, however; the European Community, too, expects to benefit from it.  This is true first in the general sense that the Convention of Lomé is designed to establish a special and more equitable form of relationship between the Community and a large group of developing countries.  Moreover, by entering into this co-operative venture, Europe has been strengthened in its relations with the rest of the world; Europe now has a special relationship with about half of the developing countries in the world&mdash; countries which are responsible for the production of a substantial percentage of the world's raw materials.</P>
    <P>Finally, we should recognise that in so far as the ACP countries increase their prosperity as a result of the Lomé Convention, there will be an increased demand in those countries for European goods and services.  The Irish business community can hope to benefit substantially in the longer term by seeking to supply this increased demand.</P>
    <P>On all counts, we in Ireland should be especially pleased to lend our goodwill to the new enterprise of the Lomé Convention.  It hardly needs to be argued in point of history, we have a great deal in common with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific, Ireland being the only member of the European Community which has itself been a former colony.</P>
    <P>We know the importance of economic development, and the difficulties to be overcome.  Our own economy has been undergoing a transition of the kind to which our new ACP partners aspire&mdash;I mean the transition from being a predominantly agricultural economy to becoming one with a strong industrial sector.</P>
    <P>We recognise too that we ourselves have much to gain from the Lomé Convention, and from the type of <Col N="811" /> international co-operation it represents. We are an open economy and stand only to benefit from increased stability in international trade.  And as a small country, we have an interest in ensuring that international relationships, both political and economic, be conducted on the basis of mutual interdependence and cooperation&mdash;be conducted, that is, in the spirit of the Lomé Convention. Without hesitation, I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Without hesitation we support the motion introduced by the Minister.  One is reminded to a certain extent of the constant need to reiterate the obligation all of us have to destroy the almost terrifying problem of world hunger.  It was said of Cato in the Roman Senate that, so that he could activate his colleagues in the Senate and the Romans in general, on every occasion on which he made any speech he prefaced it by saying, &ldquo;Carthago delenda est&rdquo;.  Generally, we here could preface any major speech that we might make in the matter of international relations by saying, &ldquo;Fames delenda est&rdquo; because not just to preserve our own position but to making a commitment to destroy hunger and create development in those countries, we, too, maintain our own position of security in the western world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over and above that, we have an obligation which I am glad to say this convention goes a considerable way towards meeting.  It is another positive consequence of our EEC membership that we can be a party both in our own right as a nation and fortuituously as President of the Community, to such a convention.  At the outset I should like to acknowledge the personal contribution which the Minister has made towards finalising the details of this convention.  It was a happy coincidence that an Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs should have had the honour and that opportunity. By way of the diligent and enthusiastic manner in which the Minister set about this task he earned for this country a degree of recognition <Col N="812" /> of our concern for this problem. Also, from the point of view of the Community it is an indication of the determination to solve this problem.  I pay tribute to the Minister and to his staff for the very effective way in which they discharged their responsibility to this nation, to the Community and to the ACP Countries.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has reminded us, the Irish position in regard to this convention is a very special one because we are the only member of the Community that have shared the experience of most of these ACP countries.  We know to some limited extent, because of our historical experience, the problems these countries now face.  To that extent we can expect to have for them a greater degree of understanding and support.  Our position imposes on us a greater obligation but it gives us also a greater opportunity than may be the case of other countries.</P>
    <P>If we consider our own progress from being what one might refer to as a static economy to a developed economy in comparatively recent times, we become aware of the agencies through which our economy got off the ground.  In this way we can identify the agencies through which we can help most effectively those ACP countries.  In making comparisons between our economy and theirs we think first of the intense lack of capital which this nation experienced, a problem that must be faced by these other countries now.  In a sense we have overcome this problem.  At least, we have progressed from a situation in which little or no capital was being generated to a point where considerable native resources are being applied although we are dependent yet on foreign investment.</P>
    <P>Like these other countries, we know the problem of emigration.  This is a problem which has been characteristic of all these countries except in so far as restrictions on emigration from them to certain other countries may have prevented emigration.  Coupled with their emigration factor is a high level of unemployment.  Unfortunately, the latter is still a problem for us, too, but it is mainly a question of national resolution, having regard to what may be our economic conditions.  On this <Col N="813" /> occasion I do not intend to become involved in the overall area of policy-difference in this regard as between the Government and ourselves.  Suffice it to say that the problem can be remedied.</P>
    <P>As we overcame to a large extent our emigration problem and as we progressed from that period of the fifties to the period of growth of the sixties, so, too, we can help those ACP countries with their difficulties.  They have specific machinery for making use of assistance from states such as ours. We can make our contribution by way of personnel services and technical advice and we can apply to them the knowledge we gained from our own experience.</P>
    <P>Another factor is that each of these countries has a very weak industrial arm and, like us, was dependent for a considerable time on major world economies.  Basically, they are dependent on their primary produce and raw materials.  They have very little industrial development or processing of these materials within their own countries. To this extent, too, they are in a position similar to that which we were in in the thirties, forties and even the fifties. Their exports have been almost exclusively to markets of much stronger economies and in so far as each country was concerned involved a single commodity whether one thinks of sugar, cocoa or coffee.  Their main exports were coffee and cocoa which accounted in some cases for as much as 70 per cent of total exports.  This is an indication of how vulnerable they can be in times of recession in the market for those products or, more particularly, when the market forces throughout the world can bring about a reduction in the price of those products.</P>
    <P>They have suffered, too, from a lack of expertise and this can be as great a problem as the lack of capital. The development of native expertise and technology is an essential part of the growth and development of any country.  It is in this field that lies one of the crucial problems associated with these countries.</P>
    <P>We, too, experienced those problems in the early days of this State.  We were dependent to a considerable extent on <Col N="814" /> the goodwill of other nations but we had no real international association during the thirties and forties on which we could rely to ensure our economic development.  In this regard the countries we are talking of here have an advantage compared with what was our situation in that they belong to what has been described as a surprisingly uniform political grouping. This is what the ACP countries have proved themselves to be.  This advantage puts them in a bargaining position and this is important.  It is a position which the Community, the US and the USSR must recognise although I am not suggesting that that is the basic motivation for this convention.  However, it is a factor that we must take account of not only in relation to this convention but in relation to any associations we may have with what are referred to generally as the developing nations of the Third World.</P>
    <P>No comparison can be completely accurate.  We are ourselves still in the process of developing and learning and to some extent, many of these countries may in some areas have surpassed our experience.  One of the problems we had to face some 50 years back as an emergent nation was that of understanding and appreciating and having respect for the institutions of our State.  We had good reason here not to have very much respect for the Establishment, as it was then, and I believe the same can be said of the people of these countries.  When they look back on their experience under former colonial powers it is understandable if they have a certain inhibition&mdash;antagonism would be too strong a word&mdash;in regard to their understanding of former colonial powers. From that point of view our experience in the development of the institutions of this State can be helpful to them and I see real opportunities now for putting our experience into practical effect in whichever of these countries it can be most effectively applied.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that we should establish good relations with these countries.  It is not at five minutes to 12 the clock has stopped.  It has actually stopped at ten seconds to 12 as far as these countries are concerned.  It stopped <Col N="815" /> for them because many of them are caught up in constant hunger and starvation.  It has stopped for us and if we do not recognise that then all of us in this secure western world are in a very vulnerable position because we cannot expect these nations to tolerate the level of starvation they have tolerated up to this.</P>
    <P>That starvation is in some measure due to the fact that they have been exploited and so we owe it to these countries in both a moral and a literal sense to pay a debt and give back what we have taken from them. When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I include Ireland as one of the developed countries though we did not have any colonial associations but anything we can do to repay the debt we must do.</P>
    <P>I hope the remarks I have made as to the Minister's commitment and his contribution will be seen clearly as an indication of what I think his contribution is.  The commitment he has shown is in a real way a great lead to us and to the community.  The Minister said that our contribution to the fund is approximately £11 million over roughly five years.  There is provision for extending the period, if necessary, beyond five years.  It is possible we may not be called upon to contribute the total amount within that period.  It must be remembered that our contribution will be seen as being in satisfaction of our obligation under the UN target of .7 per cent of GNP by way of direct aid to developing countries.  This, therefore, does not impose any new financial obligation on us.  It does, however, in a very real way give us an opportunity of using whatever contribution we make to much better effect through the agencies established under this convention. I do not doubt the Minister's commitment to maintain what he said when he first came before this House but I have to compare it with the actual support he has got from his Government.  Let it be noted we are behind the recommended UN target.  We had something like .1 per cent as distinct from .7 per cent and the signs are we will have to increase considerably our contributions to <Col N="816" /> maintain the target which we have an obligation to honour.</P>
    <P>This is one area in which there should be no political debate.  The hands of any of us are not entirely clean.  I invite the Minister and his Government to accept that and, in turn, to remind us, when hopefully our turn comes, what the position is.  There must be bipartisanship on this to the extent that our contribution must not come up for grabs at the annual budgetary review.  Our contribution must not do battle with the demands of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, with the demands of the Minister for Education and the demands of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, particularly at a time of fairly stringent economic conditions. Looking at the last budget on the basis of that kind of competition it is not surprising that the Government failed to meet their commitment in honouring the Minister's application. If the reaction is that in a relatively bad economic climate we will cut back on the contribution we owe to those in much greater need and difficulty, then what hope will there be for them if the Germans, the French, the British and the Americans all react in the same way?</P>
    <P>What hope will there be for these countries if we go back on, instead of maintaining, our commitment?  The target does not demand too much and we must set aside the requisite amount every year in the budget so that we honour our obligation.  If we have not within ourselves the determination and community sense to meet our obligation that is a sad reflection on the state of Irish society and on the leadership we give to that society. How can we preach unselfishness to our community when we do not practise unselfishness?  Are we too remote from our own suffering past to recognise the suffering present of others in many of the countries referred to in this agreement?</P>
    <P>The Irish people do not need to be activated.  It is we, the &ldquo;leaders&rdquo;, who need to be activated.  The people have proved what their commitment is by their huge and continuing contributions at the voluntary level.  If we <Col N="817" /> do nothing but follow their lead, we can be consistent in our associations and discussions with other members of the Community in the United Nations and elsewhere.  We can speak with conviction. We can speak in the knowledge that we are attempting to play our part to the fullest possible extent, no matter how much it may hurt us in the short term.</P>
    <P>The Irish people recognise that whatever our problems may be&mdash;and we have problems&mdash;they are as nothing in comparison with the problems experienced by these countries.  We must not make them pay for the causes of our problems here.  I do not want to go into the national economic argument because that would not be appropriate.  I hope our national budgetary position will become stronger in time and then we can resume our obligations to these countries.</P>
    <P>Those who are engaged in activities concerning the Third World, as it has been called&mdash;and now we have a new category, the Fourth World&mdash;are devoting almost a third of the funds made available by the Irish people to educating the public to their obligations at every level.  This is an indication of what we must do here.  This cannot be a once a year debate during which we satisfy ourselves that we in the Dáil are doing our bit.  There must be a constant awareness at every level, the voluntary organisations, the young people at school, the trade unions, at every level of administration, at local government and national government level, of each of those areas.  That is what I mean by education.  There must be a constant programming towards each of these areas, matched by a determination to use every possible opportunity such as this convention gives us to discharge our obligations.</P>
    <P>Coming to some of the opportunities which arise under this convention, because of the reasons I have stated&mdash; and they are obvious and needed no great original thinking on my part&mdash; we have had experiences similar to the experiences these countries now face.  We devised different forms of development during that period, and <Col N="818" /> particularly the State bodies.  We can now apply some of their techniques and experiences and, perhaps, learn from the mistakes made by many of these bodies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the development corporation the Minister has established which is the overall co-ordinating body for the State bodies.  Its potential will be very great, particularly through the agencies of this convention.  It is particularly appropriate that it was established around about the time the convention was being concluded.  Because of their experience and because of the associations they have had, our State bodies will be able to play a very real role in the development of suitable institutions and structures for development in these countries.</P>
    <P>The export of industrial goods to world markets is a key to economic prosperity.  It was not until we launched the export promotion in the late 1950s and 1960s that we came into a period of prosperity.  Our experience in the various State sectors such as the IDA, and the association they had with the infant industries and their experience in attracting foreign industry, can be applied through the agencies established under this convention.  We must play the fullest possible role in these agencies to help them to achieve what was achieved here during a similar period.</P>
    <P>As a small nation we are reasonably sensitive to the fact that there are characteristics, particularly of culture and tradition, which are peculiar to each country which do not always correspond to those of their neighbours. Thank God for that.  The characteristics of each nation are the guarantee of the development of what might be called a world culture.  All these countries have long traditions which are very different from the traditions in a western democracy, some of which may make it a little more difficult to establish certain norms of industrial activities which would be readily established in a western democracy.  They make personnel relationships that little more difficult.</P>
    <P>We have not always been regulated <Col N="819" /> and disciplined in our approach to the demands of an industrial society. Many of the people who have been associated with industrial development here know the problems of a society coming into a period of industrial activity out of a period of industrial lethargy.  Through the agencies of this convention, we can play a real role in overcoming some of the problems which will arise inevitably. Allowing for the assistance which is being provided either through the European Investment Bank, or directly from the European Development Fund under this convention, because of the lack of capital in all of these countries there is a great need for the efficient use of capital for problems which we also had, and more especially for the development of labour intensive industry to cure the unemployment and emigration problems as we did from the 1950s into the 1960s.</P>
    <P>There will have to be the development of technology suited to small scale rural industries of the type we developed during that period.  Almost all these countries have a relatively small population in relatively big land masses.  A great proportion of the land masses of each of these countries is almost inaccessible.  To a very considerable extent we are not dealing with overpopulated areas but areas which are rural, basically, in their traditions and in their geographic structures.  For instance, in an area of 246 square kilometers there is a population of 4,000,000 people&mdash;that is not very intensive by any standard&mdash; that is in Guinea and Upper Volta.  This pattern continues throughout and, to a considerable extent, reflects the pattern we knew here&mdash;the need to develop the outer arms of the country, particularly through regional policies such as we have implemented and which we need to continue to implement with a greater degree of urgency.  Through those same policies we can also use those opportunities in relations with these countries.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office the Minister has established two organisations.  One known as APSO, the Association for <Col N="820" /> Personal Services Overseas, and DEVCO, which is appropriately named, the Development Corporation for State Bodies and Departments. Perhaps the Minister would tell me whether he has yet been in a position to adopt what was proposed to him from various sources&mdash;a development desk, so called, in each Department and each State body to ensure that a particular section of each Department or State Body is totally committed to and taken up with the potential of that Department or body in discharging its obligations under the convention and in discharging our obligations generally. There will have to be that constant type of liaison, or constant reminder, within the Department or body.  Unless there exists within each Department such a permanent structure there cannot be liaison with other Departments. I know some steps have been taken in that direction and that it is not entirely the responsibility of the Minister but perhaps he could indicate to what extent those recommendations have been implemented.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note also that things we might take for granted&mdash; although the public at large might not do so to the same extent&mdash;constitute, in a very real sense, the problems of newly developing democracies.  For instance, we tend to take for granted here appointments to Government bodies, State bodies, semi-State bodies, local authorities and the civil service because the Local Appointments Commission function very effectively on a very fair and equitable basis, as does the Civil Service Commission, guaranteeing that people are appointed on merit and opportunities made available within the public service to those best qualified.  Such is now taken for granted despite whatever doubts may be held by certain sections of the public and despite certain regrettable trends to which I do not want to refer now, in areas under the direct authority of the Government.  Again, none of our hands are that clean.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not make comparisons of cleanliness but the Government who, when in Opposition, proclaimed their virtues so constantly <Col N="821" /> and their determination so vehemently when in Government fell far short not just of their own standards but of ours leaving some cause for question.  When one makes a virtue of one's virtue and finds that it falls very short even of the other's, or merely measures up to it, there is some ground for concern.</P>
      <P>Having said that, our structures&mdash; which do not depend on governments that come and go&mdash;are indeed commendable. In the development of the democratic activity of each of these countries I am sure they can learn from us, for example, through the operations of the Local Appointments Commission, the method of appointment to State bodies, the operations of the Civil Service Commission.  It is understandable that these countries, having been deprived for so long by those in a certain position of power and influence, would have a degree of corruption in their operations, particularly as the examples given by their predecessors will not always have been generally commendable.  To that extent, in a very practical way, we can help in the development of democracy as we know it.</P>
      <P>I welcome particularly the system called &ldquo;stabex&rdquo; mentioned by the Minister which relates to the stabilisation of exports and export prices of basic commodities of each of these countries.  Until such time as they can be guaranteed stable prices for their almost sole commodity&mdash;certainly they have had no diversity of export commodities&mdash;they will be in a very weak position, as they have been in a very weak position.  This innovation, as the Minister correctly called it, is a very effective way of tackling that problem. It means now they can be guaranteed at least a basic price for their commodities. In so far as such is being guaranteed by a Community as economically powerful as the EEC, it should help to stabilise also their development and secure their economies.  The problems they have experienced to date, on an uneven path of export price, with obviously fluctuating economic conditions at home, have prevented them from maintaining any constant pattern of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> They have always been in the van of those under attack whenever world conditions changed.  We thought we suffered during the energy crisis; we howled about our suffering, but if we did suffer it was nothing in comparison with their suffering.  This stabilisation of prices, guaranteed by a Community so strong, should help and should also set a target for other groups, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and others can in the interests of the development of and their associations with these countries.</P>
    <P>While all that is being done it is well to remember that Ireland is classified as a developed country.  We are too often ready to put on the poor mouth, to point to conditions outside Ireland as being the cause of all our problems. I do not believe that is good for a national character, morale or dignity. If we excuse ourselves for our failings, always with reference to what happened outside and more particularly when the storm of inflation has passed &mdash;in the sense that our rate now is higher than countries to which we point&mdash;we are not doing ourselves a service.  Similarly, we must recognise that we are a developed country by comparison with the countries included in the ACP group of states.  It may be a rather strange admission to have to make but such is the case.  By comparison with other developed countries we are an undeveloped country. For that reason I am glad also that article 10 of this convention contains the safeguard that, when difficulties arise within any one of the member states of the Community, which may result in a deterioration of a sector of the economy of a region of the Community, there is provision for correcting that problem.</P>
    <P>It is fairly evident that Ireland is potentially, if not in fact, the most vulnerable member of the Community as a result of any new negotiation entered into or arrangements made, even with countries as undeveloped as are these to which I have been referring.  While we must always recognise our obligations and our comparative security and comfort, nonetheless there will <Col N="823" /> be time when some sections, particularly of our industry, may need to apply the protections introduced in article 10 of this convention, not, I hope, to the detriment of any member of the ACP states, but by way of ensuring that we can help them mutually and not at the cost of injuring some sensitive area of our industrial development.  I know it is not an article under which we would want to apply for or claim relief too readily.</P>
    <P>I think it is realistic that it should be there, and I hope that the need to protect our position under that article will not arise, or that it will arise only rarely.  Would the Minister clarify what I am not able to understand from the explanatory memorandum, which has been very helpful?  I quote from page 10 in relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention:</P>
    <P>Treatment applied to products originating in the ACP states may not be more favourable than that applied by the member states among themselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that seems fair enough but then it goes on:</P>
    <P>An exception to this limitation was, however, agreed for products originating in the ACP states, since the retention.... as a transitional measure of certain residual customs duties and charges having equivalent effect between the original member states and the new member states does not apply to these products.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand that.  I am sure the Minister will have the answer.  It seems contradictory when it says you will not have any more preferential treatment for these states than for the member states and it then goes on to say that an exception was made for products originating within these states.  I expect the Minister will be able to solve that little puzzle.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of this which I think must be enthuasiastically welcomed, as well, of course, as the whole general principle behind the convention.  However, Article 38 states generally&mdash;and this is again I think by way of a recap on what I said about the need to be sensitive to the culture, attitudes and economic condition of the countries that one attempts <Col N="824" /> to assist under that programme that each state itself should establish what it sees as its priorities and to the extent that the member states of the Communities can satisfy that state that it will work in accordance with the priorities established by the ACP state, then this guarantees that the developments will be directed according to the wishes of the states who are being assisted.  This is very important because, if simply by virtue of programmes of assistance that are implemented, any member of the Community or the Community as a whole would think that they had the right or obligation also to direct the nature of industrial development, they would be making a great mistake, indeed.  I think that the provisions written into Article 38 will ensure that as far as possible what is done will be in accordance with the wishes and character of the country concerned and that the assistance which will be applied throughout the Community or member states of the Community or for that matter made through the industries of the Community who can use this convention to give their assistance, will be fully in accord with the development programmes of each of the states, whereever they are applied.  The institutions which are established under this convention, such as the Centre for Industrial Development and the Committee for Industrial Co-operation, again will give great opportunity to Ireland to provide what we have in a very rich and constant supply, personnel and experience.  We may not have great resources of capital or extensive technological equipment, but we do have experienced personnel who share both dedication and determination. Agencies such as those, the Industrial Development Centre and the Industrial Co-operation Committee will enable the organisations that have been established here in recent times, the Development Corporation, the Association for Personal Services Overseas and many other bodies to play a proper role in achieving the targets set by the convention.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister say what part can the voluntary organisations play <Col N="825" /> and how can they be fitted into the structures of the convention here? This may not be a matter of such pressing importance to the other countries of the Community, but everyone will recognise that the voluntary organisations here in Ireland represent substantially our constant contribution to the Third World.  I do not, on the face of it, see how they can be fitted into the constitutional structure and the framework set up by the convention.  I hope the Minister will be able to assure me and them that there is a place for them in the institutions being established here.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is a provision in the convention for special rates of interest in the least developed countries of the ACP states is very important, because there are, unfortunately, degrees of hunger and starvation.  Some of these countries are in a much more critical condition than others, although that is not to suggest that any one of them is not in a critical condition.  Most particularly, I welcome the provisions which stipulate that special loans for a duration of 40 years, with a grace period of 10 years&mdash;in other words, a possible duration of 50 years&mdash;can be made available at an interest rate of 1 per cent.  That type of facility, first of all, long term and, secondly, at a low interest rate, can guarantee, in so far as anything can guarantee, a real effort at solving the long term problems of these countries.</P>
    <P>An interesting aspect of the convention and one that will, I hope, work to great effect in the interest both of the Community and of each of these member states is the establishment of institutions to give effect to the decisions which were reached under the convention.  To simplify it, one could say that, as you have a Council of Ministers in the European Economic Community so you will have a Council of Ministers of the Community and the ACP states; as you have a Parliament, though not a very strong one, in the European Community, so you will have parliamentary representation between the Community and these states; as you <Col N="826" /> have a Commission, so also you will have a permanent structure of civil service administration between the Community and these states.</P>
    <P>All of this guarantees constant association, constant planning and, above all else, greater understanding at every level, at parliamentary level, at executive and administrative level.  It is only by having these institutions established that you can ensure this constant contact and understanding which is the best guarantee of the success of this programme. This economic co-operation is a matter for political commitment and political decision.</P>
    <P>You cannot give effect to political decisions unless you have political institutions through which you can give effect to them.  I particularly welcome the detailed instruction of this convention for the institutions through which the member states and the Community can co-operate with each other.  I have some queries with regard to details which the Minister may be able to deal with in his reply or, if not, when he has had a chance of considering them, I hope he will be able to deal with them at a later stage. Under Article 56 the principle of the convention is that for operations financed by the Community participation in tendering procedures and other procedures for the award of contracts shall be open on equal terms to all natural and legal persons of member states and the ACP states.  Legal persions are obviously intended to refer to corporations.  I note that an exception to that would be that where the contracts are for amounts less than two million units of account a 10 per cent preference is applied to the tender being supplied from the undeveloped ACP states.  Relatively small contracts get a 10 per cent preference but apparently this does not apply in relation to the major contracts.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, because of the advantage which the contractors from the Community would have over their counterparts in the ACP states there should possibly be a 10 per cent preference supplied all round not just to contracts under two million units of account.  I know this is something <Col N="827" /> which must have been considered in great detail and it may be easy for me to make such a suggestion here. Obviously, if the intention is to develop the industrial arm in these countries, then one must acknowledge that even in projects being financed by the European Community, the best way of doing that is to put them in a position where they can at least have a more than equal opportunity of being awarded the contracts which are being applied if they are equipped for them.</P>
    <P>In so far as many multi-national companies, who do not have their original base within the Community, will have a base in one or other of the Community states, it would seem, on the face of it, that they will be entitled to tender on an equal basis for contracts which will be implemented under this Lomé Convention. In so far as they would be entitled to tender on an equal basis with potential contractors from the member states of the ACP, that would seem to me to guarantee that they would be tendering on a more than equal basis.  I do not expect a ready response from the Minister but I would like him to look into that in some greater detail and perhaps, make some suggestions which will correct this potential problem.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister confirm what seems to be implicit in the convention that there will be a permanent resident delegate from the Commission in each member state?  I presume that would involve a permanent structure from the Community in each of the states to implement this convention.  I believe that can be only towards the benefit of the states and the Community. I should like to have confirmation from the Minister that this will be the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That there will be a permanent representative from the Community in each member state.  This seems to be the case from the explanatory memorandum but it is not quite specific.  Generally, one must welcome <Col N="828" /> the spirit of this convention, the part the Minister has played in it and, in particular, the intention of this convention subject to the few reservations I have expressed.  I should like the Minister to clarify for me how this general spirit coincides with some alarming indications we have had from the Community recently in this area, especially in relation to the proposed budget cuts for development aid which we hear were suggested by the Germans, not just in relation to the regional fund and the social fund but also in relation to the development aid programme of the Community.</P>
      <P>I should like to know if such proposals have been made and, if so to what extent the Minister has resisted them strenuously and to what extent these proposals could in any way be consistent with the principles and provisions of this convention.  We have not had an opportunity of discussing that in the House up to the present.  It seems to me that if we are to believe the reports of these cuts in the development aid from the Community to the Third World we have reached a very sorry position.  It would then seem the first thing the Community, as distinct from the individual members of the Community, will do, when things are difficult within the Community, is to dishonour the obligations they have to those who need the most.  I hope that if there is any such proposal our Minister will strenuously resist it.  I also hope he will be strengthened in his hand in doing so by saying: &ldquo;What I am asking you in the Community to do we on our part in Ireland have done.&rdquo; He would not be able to say that at the moment but I hope he will be able to say it when this matter comes up.  The Minister should not look puzzled in relation to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have not maintained their commitment for our proportionate contribution from our GNP.  I hope the Minister will not try to bamboozle us with figures in relation to that.  Anybody who is concerned with the matter is aware of this. The Minister's hand would be all the <Col N="829" /> stronger if he could say to the European Community Ministers: &ldquo;We have honoured our obligation and we insist on you honouring yours as well.&rdquo; If the Minister's hand is weak he cannot have much conviction in calling on the Germans or others to honour their obligations.  While the cutback in our aid will be of relatively little importance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The cutback from our target.  It may not be a cutback from our contribution last year but it is a cutback from our stated target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It still is a cutback and the Minister can argue until the cows come home on this.  He must notice a cutback in our stated target. I hope we can mend our hand there. No matter what happens there cannot be a political discussion in the House. If we mend our hand we are in a position, with determination and conviction, to call on others to mend their hand.  If we cannot move this problem at least we can help to motivate those who can.  While one is only talking in terms of hundreds of thousands of pounds where Ireland is concerned one is talking in terms of millions of pounds so far as the Community and other countries are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must also take account of the fact that one of the effects of the decision of the Council of Ministers sometime last year&mdash;I thought it extraordinary&mdash;was basically that the Community would maintain its level of financial contribution to the Third World provided that other developed countries, notably the United States and Canada, did likewise.  We are left with the position that if the United States or Canada apparently do not maintain their level of development aid for reasons best known to themselves the Community do not find themselves obliged to maintain their level.  I hope that if these reports of supposed cutbacks in development aid from the Community are true that the Americans and Canadians will not react by saying: &ldquo;Because you have <Col N="830" /> now cut back, we are entitled to cut back.&rdquo; That would seem to be the strangest and saddest conclusion.</P>
    <P>I never did understand how the Council of Ministers could justify the apparent conclusion that they would maintain their commitment provided others over whom they had no control, maintained theirs.  I should have thought it would be rather the opposite if there was a real commitment; that if and when others failed to meet their commitment the Community would so far as possible try to step up its aid so as to correct the problems arising as a result.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the convention is sensitive to the political traditions and history of each of these countries and while, I suppose in a selfish way, the Community could see that through the agency of this convention they are not just discharging their obligations&mdash;and they are obligations; they are not repaying a debt&mdash; and there are debts&mdash;they are also&mdash;I suppose they could see it this way&mdash; protecting themselves, western democracies and the democracies of the world as we know it.  Indeed they are, but at the same time we should not use or attempt to use these conventions as an agency by which we should impose our systems on them. I am glad this convention does not seek to do this.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for each of these countries to develop their structures of Government as they see fit.  It is only when we show no concern that it is likely that they will react against selfish democracy, as they may see it. If we prove that democracy in its real sense is true to itself, can never be selfish, cannot be selfish within itself for its own members, and neither can it be selfish <i>vis-à-vis</i> those outside its limits, then I expect they will contribute in a real way to the further development of democracy because the African and Pacific countries are the hope of the world of the future. Of that there can be no doubt. Nations that have been so deprived, so exploited for so long have now come to a new sense of dignity and appreciation of their own right and their role in the world and if we can <Col N="831" /> effect a real understanding with them and make a real commitment to work with them I can be quite sure that whatever systems emerge in these countries will be systems which will guarantee an understanding and tolerance towards the democracies that we are most closely associated with and can also guarantee a fair development and economic expansion in each of these countries.</P>
    <P>In a very real sense we owe to these countries what is being provided in this convention.  We should not look on it in any other way.  Even at this late stage although Ireland has not been in a position to extract benefit from the resources of these countries as other countries have, even if we only look at it that way we can reach a new respect from them towards the countries which for a considerable time may not have shown the concern they should have shown.  Our own contribution will never be very significant but our commitment to whatever contribution we make can be.  Ireland has a respect from these countries because of our experience and because we also were under a colonial power and because we have emerged from a period of repression&mdash;I am not trying to suggest a state of slavery or anything of that nature but it was a period of repression in one form or another; of economic disadvantage&mdash;into a new awareness and understanding and because of that we have a very special obligation <i>vis-à-vis</i> these countries.</P>
    <P>I hope through this convention we can implement it and I hope the Government in their own area will ensure that henceforth the targets we set we will maintain because if we do not, we are doing ourselves and our community a disservice.  They have proved to us what they want by their voluntary contributions and we should not expect very much in our own national programme if we are not prepared to face up to our obligations in this area.  This convention, in my view, does much to help us to meet those obligations.  I hope the Minister will be able to clarify some of the points I have raised in his concluding remarks.</P>
    <Col N="832" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal very briefly with one aspect of the Lomé Convention but before doing so I want to join with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the spokesman for the Opposition, Deputy O'Kennedy, in giving a very warm welcome to the ratification of the convention by this Parliament.  We are the second of the nine to do so after Denmark.  Perhaps if it had not been for the Recess we would have been first.  The remarks of the Minister and of the Opposition spokesman sum up what we all feel in this Parliament about the terms of the Lomé Convention.  It is a great step forward in international relations. I should like to pay a very warm tribute to the Minister on his handling of the final negotiations that led to the completion of this convention on 28th February last.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the aspect of the convention which I would like to examine further and that was under Title VI on the institutions being set up under the convention. The Commission state that the convention will be jointly administered by a council of ministers, a committee of ambassadors and there is provision for a consultative assembly consisting of members of the European Parliament and representatives appointed from the ACP countries. Article 80 of the convention reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The consultative assembly shall be composed on a basis of parity of members of the assembly on the one side of the Community and of the representatives designated by the ACP states on the other.</P>
      <P>It also states that a consultative assembly shall meet at least once a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been considerable discussion, and a little dissension with the European Community on the one side and the ACP states on the other, about the form and make-up of this assembly. On 29th January last the President of the Parliamentary Conference, Mr. Yace, on behalf of the APC countries and Mr. Spenale, President of the European Parliament, had discussions about the parliamentary institutions of the new convention.  Last May, they <Col N="833" /> met again in Dublin and produced a formula which suggested that an assembly of 92 members from the ACP countries&mdash;two members from each country&mdash;and 92 members from the European Parliament be set up.  They also suggested that there should be a steering committee consisting of one member from each of the APC countries and 46 members from the European Parliament.  This was in line with the old institution of the Yaounde Convention which was set up on a similar basis although the steering committee was set up on an area basis. One-third of the assembly was represented on the steering committee on the basis of area and region rather than a single member from each of the countries.</P>
    <P>Those who attended the conference in Dublin in May will remember that there was considerable dissension between the ACP and the parliament about this question.  The ACP countries felt they could not be adequately represented on a joint committee on a regional basis and that each country should have a member appointed.  This was not acceptable to many members of the European Parliament and, I am afraid, is still not acceptable but, nevertheless, this formula has been proposed by the two Presidents.  Some disagreement has been voiced about the proposal in the parliament.  The Secretary General of the parliament, at the instigation of the Committee on Development and Co-operation of the parliament put forward a formula that there be one member from each of the ACP countries and a like number from the European Parliament for the assembly, and that there be 18 members from the ACP countries and a similar number from the parliament on the joint committee.</P>
    <P>The duties of the European Parliament are expanding while the membership remains the same.  All the members of that parliament have dual mandates and to add another important and extensive committee, or assembly, to the work of an already overloaded body would put too much demand on the time of members of the parliament.  An assembly of 184 members as suggested in the Yace-Spenale <Col N="834" /> document, would be an unwieldly body and would require a lot of back-up staff.  The discussions of the steering committee of 92 would be most unwieldly and would lead to weeks and months of endless debate about agendas and the like.  This is an important topic and I hope the Minister is taking note of it.  I would welcome suggestions from him in this regard.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the Yace-Spenale suggestion, for many reasons&mdash;not only membership but also cost&mdash;is running into a good deal of trouble.  Many of the ACP countries have not democratic institutions and, therefore, their representatives are not elected by the public. I can see problems with members of the European Parliament, who are elected by the public to their national parliaments, debating with representatives who are not directly elected.  It would be a pity if this convention should run into problems like this but it is a problem we should consider.  I know the Minister, who put such a lot of work into the successful conclusion of this convention, will want to see that this important aspect of the convention is successfully dealt with in the near future.</P>
    <P>The fact that article 80 demands equal numbers from the EEC and the ACP countries leads to a problem. That aspect of the convention may have to be looked at again.  There is no necessity for 92 people to sit down for a day, a week, or once a year, to discuss the problems.  If they have to because of their duties in the European Parliament, and their national parliaments, they will not be able to attend. Therefore, the assembly would deteriorate into a farce, a sad occurrence if it is allowed to happen.  The Minister should pay attention to this aspect of the convention and I hope he shows the same interest in it as he showed in the rest of the convention.  In his speech he hardly mentioned this problem.  I congratulate the Minister on his work in bringing this convention to a successful conclusion.  He will probably look back on the Lomé Convention as the highlight of his term as President of the Council of Ministers.  It was one of the outstanding initiatives of the EEC and <Col N="835" /> the Minister is to be congratulated on the part he played in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputies O'Kennedy and Kavanagh in welcoming the motion and to offer our appreciation of the efforts of the Minister and his staff, in bringing about this tremendous instrument for world humanity.  When one sees that 55 nations were involved at one stage, one can appreciate the amount of hard work and dedication it took to perfect this instrument.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister started his speech at 4 o'clock many people have died of hunger or thirst.  This Lomé Convention is a highlight in international co-operation and justifies this country's decision to join the EEC.  It is as a member state of this Community that we will play a big part in helping these countries all we can.  I do not want to stress help as if it were a hand-out, but we should strive to give these people an opportunity to develop their countries to the same high standards as those attained in European countries.</P>
      <P>We are classed as a developed country, and we are developed when compared with the conditions in many ACP countries.  Even before the foundation of the EEC or the League of Nations, the Irish people admitted their commitment to international aid by contributing the small amount they could afford for international development.  I refer specially to the Red Cross Society, Gorta and Trócaire.</P>
      <P>We support this motion and feel that the Irish people will be generous in their support of any commitments by which we are bound when we sign this convention.  We must not disappoint these nations by not going far enough with our help.  Would the Minister consider helping these countries by providing educational institutions?  The people could be taught technology, commerce, local government and so on, which would help them develop their own resources. They could also avail of the expertise of the more advanced countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the nine, Ireland is the only former colony.  Luxembourg and <Col N="836" /> Ireland are the only two countries who have never had colonial possessions. France and Germany will contribute very heavily to this development fund.  By comparison our contribution will be puny.  Belgium will contribute 6.25 per cent, the Federal Republic of Germany 25.95 per cent, France 25.95 per cent, the United Kingdom&mdash;who are in an impoverished state at the moment&mdash;18.7 per cent, and our contribution will be 0.6 per cent.  Would the Minister tell us what percentage of our total GNP will this 0.6 per cent, plus other commitments which we have entered into, amount to?  Will it be 1 or 2 per cent? It has been suggested that we should provide a certain percentage of our GNP for international aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Our contribution looks rather small when compared with the contributions of the other countries. But if we contribute the amount for which we contracted, that is 0.6 per cent, we will be playing the part we agreed to.</P>
      <P>The former colonial powers may feel that they must pay back something to the nations they exploited. Let us not pull our punches here: those countries were shamelessly exploited through the centuries.  The fact that the former colonial powers intend providing a large slice of their national wealth to helping these countries will be appreciated by the men of goodwill in the ACP countries and will help to build a better world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this agreement there will be great opportunities for our trade to <Col N="837" /> expand.  As the Minister rightly said, much will depend on the amount of hard work our industrialists, farmers and everybody involved put into their businesses.  In this way not only will we benefit the developing countries, but we will also be helping our economy.  There is a certain amount of goodwill between those countries and Ireland because they realise we never exploited them&mdash;whether we could or not is another matter.  The point is we did not do it and we are now joining with our EEC neighbours to ensure that the wealth of Europe will be made available to the ACP countries.</P>
    <P>One must be realistic, however.  It is laid down in article III that an ACP country may not get any better terms from us than we allow to our fellow EEC members.  Has this worked as smoothly as we would wish?  One reads occasionally that France, for instance, would not allow Italian produce in and we have our own trouble here from time to time.  I am sure there will be in-built assurances that there will not be dumping through the operation of this convention.</P>
    <P>We look forward to the operation of this tremendous movement but we must face a situation where there may be hold-ups, when things will not always run smoothly.  I assure the Minister, as did Deputy O'Kennedy, that we will help to ensure the continued operation of this, which will require good husbandry and bookkeeping by the Government in the next five years so that the value of our 0.6 per cent contribution will not be diminished by inflation.  This convention will mean an enormous element of goodwill between the ACP countries and ourselves because we will have shown as a small country that we are prepared to play our part in this great work.  I am sure the Minister, during our Presidency of the EEC Commission, felt a touch of pride that after prolonged negotiations he had the honour of signing this great convention.</P>
    <P>The convention is a good lesson in geography because of the many new developing countries.  Perhaps we had been inclined to become rather complacent <Col N="838" /> over the years despite all we had been told by the various organisations. It is good to know that so many men and women had been working for so long preparing this document. The welcome it has got in the House shows the dedication of our people to help the less fortunate in the developing countries.  I hope the work of the convention goes through without political overtones or attached strings.</P>
    <P>We might join with the US, that country which despite all the criticism disburses a huge amount of its national wealth towards helping the less well off nations.  It must now be realised that the Americans' generosity is not influenced by a desire to extend their influence but for the good of mankind. They with the peoples of Europe realise the debt we all owe to the ACP nations who, I am sure, realise that we are offering them a charter to help them to develop their resources&mdash;that this is not a charitable hand-out but assistance to develop their nations in line with a developing world where we hope to see the abolition of injustice and suffering and where the wealth and expertise of Europe will be available to the developing nations.  In this way we shall be able to build a commonwealth of world nations in which, following centuries in which Europe acted in a way she should not, there is now a new understanding and a sincere wish to help the less fortunate peoples of the world to develop.  France has been known as the cradle of western civilisation and we are now joining that cradle of civilisation in the help we are offering to the ACP nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputies O'Kennedy and Moore, I welcome the convention. It would be surprising if anyone in the Dáil were to oppose it.  The opportunities it appears to offer to the developing countries are fully in line with our normal thinking.  The 46 countries with which this agreement has been drawn up need the greatest co-operation and encouragement.  I was surprised to note that the Minister departed from his circulated script towards the end of the second paragraph and that subsequently he did not endeavour to develop his statement further.  Having declared that the convention <Col N="839" /> was signed, subject to ratification, at Lomé on February 28th, 1975, he went on to say that he was advised that legislation may be required to cover some of its provisions.  On hearing that it occurred to me that this was a very important announcement, that it should have been part of the circulated statement.  I think from the Minister's reaction that this formed part of his script but not of that which was circulated. I am somewhat suspicious of this type of operation and would hope that when replying the Minister would give us some idea of the advice he has received in this regard.  I cannot visualise a need for comprehensive legislation in relation to the convention.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of other points that I should like to refer to.  I was a delegate to the recent meeting in London of the Inter Parliamentary Union.  There are some who say that this organisation is merely a talking shop for parliamentarians from all over the world.  I go some way with that opinion but at the same time I realise that personal contact among parliamentarians can be beneficial. From that point of view I consider our association with the IPU useful. However, at the recent meeting I was a member of a sub-committee that was suggesting freedom of access for imports from all developed countries. I was endeavouring to table an amendment to the effect that steps be taken to protect industries in respect of which there was a recession in any country.  However, I was opposed strongly in this effort by the Eastern block which was supported fully by the developed countries which claimed that if this exception were built into the resolution it would spoil the whole effect and would mean that any country could build up a barrier to prevent the importation of any commodity on the grounds that they were in economic difficulties in regard to the commodity concerned.  Consequently I had no success in regard to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the circulation of the document relating to the conference and of the explanatory memorandum issued by the Department of Foreign <Col N="840" /> Affairs I set about ascertaining what were the principal products of the ACP countries with a view to finding out whether we were opening our doors to, for instance, boots and shoes and textiles from those countries. Any fears I had in that regard appeared to be groundless apart from the question of sugar exports since some of those countries produced a considerable amount of sugar.  I was thinking in terms of this situation having an effect on our agricultural industry but I discovered that built into the convention is a provision whereby these exports could not interfere with the CAP arrangements within the EEC.</P>
    <P>I then set about ascertaining how the GNP of those countries compared with ours.  In this regard I could find no grounds for opposing the convention in so far as this question is concerned. We had been making very good progress in relation to our GNP up to a couple of years ago but as a result of Government mismanagement since then there has been a falling back. Despite this, however, we are very far ahead of the ACP countries and with a change of Government we shall be able to get back once again on the path of progress that obtained up to the time this Government assumed office.</P>
    <P>Of the 46 states involved, a number are mentioned under article 48 as being the least well-off and it is specified that certain states shall be eligible according to their needs for the special measures established under that article. Built into the arrangements for assistance there is the provision that all countries which are benefiting by way of grants or loans are to be able to take certain measures and that they will be helped by way of funds from the EEC.  Under this article there is a list of countries that may not be expected to generate wealth from their own resources and to which money can be advanced.  This is a point that the Minister might expand on in his reply.</P>
    <P>Regarding the GNP of the ACP countries I calculated that the figure per head of the population is 100 dollars in most cases.  While appreciating <Col N="841" /> that the dollar continues to appreciate as against our £, a mean average GNP of 100 dollars is very low.  Some countries such as Nigeria and Kenya are not included within the terms of article 48.  They must therefore be looked upon as that little bit more developed than the countries mentioned here.  There are some countries which have a greater GNP than Nigeria, where the GNP is roughly 100 dollars per head of the population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Deputy is confusing Niger and Nigeria.  I think Nigeria is substantially higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The GNP is 7,840,000 dollars.  The population is 79 million. If we make the GNP 7,977 million, which is a little higher that it is, and do a population job on that, on my reckoning we finish up with 100 dollars per head of the population.

      <P>Togo has a GNP of 300 million and a population of 2 million so the GNP there is 150 dollars per head.  Doing the same kind of sum in relation to Nigeria we find the GNP in Nigeria is 100 dollars.  I cannot come to any other conclusion.  Kenya works out at 156 dollars per head and Nigeria at 100 dollars per head.  Zaire is not included in the list.  I am not finding fault.  I take it the bigger countries like Kenya and Nigeria have a better way of developing trade, particularly as they are encouraged to provide moneys themselves for development. Basically I was trying to find out how the countries mentioned came to be segregated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if we have a great deal of trade with the Bahamas.  I am inclined to think that with our <Col N="842" /> present rate of growth, or lack of growth or falling back in growth, we will not have very long to wait before the GNP in the Bahamas will be ahead of ours.  I am wondering whether at that stage the Bahamas will be regarded as a developed country and we will find ourselves in the position of having to go on contributing towards its further development. Its GNP seems to be extraordinarily good.  I know it is an approximate figure.  I do not want to be accused of faulting the convention but there are a few points I find it difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>The life of the convention is five years.  The ACP countries regarded as being the least developed are listed in article 48 and are exempted from making any contribution to the reconstitution of the fund.  That is why I make comparisons between these countries and others of the 46. According to the Minister it is not expected our annual subscription of the total £11 million will follow a uniform pattern.  Initially it will be lower than average.  That supports Deputy O'Kennedy's point that we seem to be falling short of our target.  I am very happy about the Minister's projection of the result of the next general election.  Perhaps we will get a more solid Government prepared to pay the amount to which the Minister committed us in February last. Apparently the Minister could find himself in the position of having to settle for something less than £2 million in the provision for next year. Deputy O'Kennedy has already dealt with the way we view that particular aspect.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Title I provides for access into the Community without customs duties or quantitative restrictions for industrial...products...</P>
    <P>He stressed this was not of major importance.  But it is of major importance. A short time ago when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I remember the IDA endeavouring to attract industry here, particularly the the multinationals, which are now frowned upon, in order to provide <Col N="843" /> employment and I always found the IDA were competing with, say, Puerto Rico.</P>
    <P>I am wondering whether in due process of time we may not be creating a problem for the IDA here as a result of the benefits and assistance offered to specific Caribbean, African and Indian Ocean countries.  I should like the Minister to let us know whether we may visualise a situation in which under the two different forms, the European Development Fund and the European Investment Bank, we will have under article 46 the grant-aiding of selected industries, perhaps industries which the IDA are trying to attract here.  Is there any likelihood or any possibility that some of our £11 million, together with all the other moneys which will be made available to those countries, may be used to counter-attract industries the IDA might be endeavouring to attract here?</P>
    <P>We are finding it difficult to get money from the regional fund.  I am not cribbing about this contribution. I wonder would the Minister persuade our colleagues in Europe to increase the units of account under the regional fund which we so badly need. If I were to embark on a discussion on regional policy and the availability of money from the regional fund, it might be suggested that I was opposed to this convention.  Can the Minister tell me is there any possibility of people in some of these 46 states attracting some of the multi-nationals the IDA are trying to attract here for the development of industry?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for the kind things they said about the efforts this country made, and which they were good enough to attribute to me and, above all, to compliment the Department of Foreign Affairs on their work in the negotiations for this convention. One Deputy said we must have taken some considerable pride in our involvement.  That is perfectly true.  We take considerable pride in our contribution to the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It happened that the concluding negotiations&mdash;and they were certainly <Col N="844" /> the most difficult since all the difficult problems were left to the end&mdash;took place at the very beginning of our Presidency.  It was a somewhat intimidating problem to be faced with. In the first fortnight of our Presidency we found ourselves leading the Community delegation and tackling an enormous range of very complex problems with which I had not been able to become thoroughly familiar during the preceding months.  The fact that in the two separate negotiations in mid-January and at the end of the month we succeeded in finding our way through these difficulties is a source of great satisfaction to us. Many thought at the time that it would not be possible.</P>
    <P>There were moments during the negotiations when I almost despaired because of the extreme complexity of the problem of producing an agreement which would give something to every one of 46 countries, all with very different economies and very different problems, and which would not impose, as a result, a burden on any or all of the nine which they would find intolerable, individually or collectively.  The mind should boggle at the complexity of that.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations at certain points we found ourselves dealing with the best part of 50 outstanding problems simultaneously and trying to juggle with them to achieve a result which each country could accept.  It was a very complex negotiation indeed, and it certainly was a test of the Irish team.  I should like to pay tribute to the extraordinary assistance I got from what necessarily, because of the nature of the work, was a very small number of people whose command of every detail enabled me to carry this through.  I should also like to pay tribute to the negotiators of the ACP countries who carried out their functions in a notable manner, negotiating with great skill and in a way which made the whole thing possible.  They did not try to win every point.  They did not try to achieve success on every single item.  They had a strategic view of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>It was possible to do business with them at a very high negotiating level <Col N="845" /> and to work closely with them and, with great mutual trust and confidence, to achieve this result.  It was an experience which I shall recall for many years to come.  The fact that this country was involved at that level of negotiation had a particular value because we were probably less suspect to the 46 countries than any other member of the community.  We could hardly be seen in the guise of capitalist exploiters.  The fact that our own historical experience was so akin to theirs, as I had the opportunity to point out at the Parliamentary Conference at Abidjan between the two sets of negotiations, gave them confidence that we would not be seeking to impose unfair decisions on them and that in the negotiations we would be taking their interests into account as well as those of our partners in the Community whom we represented.</P>
    <P>Before coming to the details of the convention&mdash;and many interesting and worth-while points were raised in the debate&mdash;I should like to join issue with Deputy O'Kennedy and, to some degree, with some other Deputies on the question of our general commitment in regard to development aid. Obviously there is a misunderstanding about this.  It is not confined to the Opposition benches.  Other people of goodwill seem to feel that, in some way, we are failing to live up to commitments entered into.  Therefore, I think it is right that I should answer this allegation and make it clear what the Government are doing in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Government decided last year, on a proposal which I put forward, to enter into two commitments in respect of development aid.  The first of these was a commitment which applies to every year, that is, to increase both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GNP, the amount devoted to official development assistance. The second is a quantified commitment with regard to the target we are aiming at, which is expressed very carefully in terms which involve taking one year with another.  It sets out a line we should be following, a direction in which we should be going, an ultimate target at which we are <Col N="846" /> aiming and which we intend to achieve.</P>
    <P>This is expressed in the following form: aiming at an annual increase in official development assistance of the order of 0.05 per cent of GNP taking one year with another over the next five years.  That is the course we have set ourselves.  The ultimate results can be roughly quantified from that, although the precise amount involved in the fifth year will depend on the rate of inflation which affects the arithmetical calculation.  It is expressed quite specifically as an aim, an object.  We are aiming at an annual increase.  It is quite specifically stated &ldquo;taking one year with another&rdquo;.  This makes it quite clear that there will be years when we will fall behind and years when we will move ahead.</P>
    <P>Because of the economic situation we must impose some flexibility in the rate of progress.  All of that proviso is within the framework of the absolute commitment to increase both in absolute terms&mdash;which I and the Government take to mean real purchasing power and not just money terms&mdash;and as a percentage of GNP the amount devoted to official development assistance each year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that not run contrary to the decision of the Council of Ministers&mdash;and I presume the Minister was present on that occasion&mdash; that increasing the proportion of GNP should not be influenced by budgetary considerations of the member states? If one takes one year with another that is a very saving factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The commitment we have is an absolute one in relation to the amount in absolute terms of percentage of GNP each year.  The question of the exact amount in any one year is something which is subject to some margin around a general course towards the target.  We entered into that commitment after a careful consideration of where we stood at the beginning of this period and where we had to get to at some point in the future.  Where we stood at the beginning&mdash;and the House has to be reminded of this whether or not Deputy O'Kennedy welcomes it&mdash;is that we inherited a position where, <Col N="847" /> under the last Government after 16 years in office, the progress made towards the UN target was that we were spending .035 per cent of GNP on official development assistance in the year 1972-73.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The UN target was established in 1970, as the Deputy, as a member of the Government in office at that time, should know.  In 1972-73 Fianna Fáil had reached the stage where they were spending £750,000. There was no bilateral aid programme, no agency for personal service overseas, nothing but the absolute minimal commitment of an absolute obligation to subscribe to certain funds as a result of multilateral obligations entered into with the United Nations &mdash;nothing but that.  A figure of .035 per cent of GNP meant we were at a point one-twentieth of the target, 5 per cent of the target, with the remaining 95 per cent left to this Government to make up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then we have made immense progress in catching up on the situation we inherited from Fianna Fáil. Perhaps I may give some figures to indicate this progress.  In the year 1972-73 it was £750,000, or .035 per cent. The following year the amount spent was of the order of £1.35 million.  We provided for £1.5 million but a number of the commitments we entered into were not taken up by the international organisations concerned and we replaced the great bulk of that shortfall by special <i>ad hoc</i> payments.  Because of that the amount we actually spent <Col N="848" /> fell slightly short of the amount to which we were committed.  For 1974 the figures are complicated somewhat by virtue of the fact that we had here a nine-month financial year.  There is some difficulty in disentangling the nine month financial year, the notional financial year 1973-74 and the calendar year 1974.  But if we use the calendar year 1974 as a base, the actual amount spent was £2.4 million, which was .082 per cent of GNP.  In the current year&mdash;the year in respect of which all these cutbacks are referred to&mdash;the amount we will have spent, as far as I can estimate it at present, and there are two months to go, will be approximately £3.8 million or .107 per cent of GNP.  Therefore in the current year we will have increased the share of GNP by almost a third, thereby going far beyond the commitment entered into to increase the figure both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GNP.  We are not merely increasing it marginally as a percentage of GNP; we are increasing it by a very big proportion indeed.</P>
    <P>The result is that after a period of less than three years in office&mdash;that is from 1972-73 to the calendar year 1975&mdash;the amount we are spending is five times what Fianna Fáil were spending and, as a share of GNP, is almost three times as large.  That represents substantial progress.  It is my intention and that of the Government that in the year ahead that progress will continue and that we will add substantially both to the amount of development aid and to the share of GNP devoted to it; that there will be an increase in the amount of the order of magnitude of that required by our more precise formulation, that is, aiming at an annual increase in ODA of the order of .05 per cent of GNP.  Obviously at this stage it is premature to go into details, because the budget is not yet formulated.  It is our intention to increase official development aid in 1976 by an amount approximately of that order of magnitude&mdash;the precise figures are not yet available&mdash;.05 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Any talk of our failing in commitments is completely false and it is important that that should be said <Col N="849" /> because people of goodwill have been asserting the contrary.  It is my intention to publish these figures in due course and to explain in detail how we see the future development of our official development assistance programme.  This is something which is best done when we have the firm figures for 1976, something which can be done in a couple of months time. But I have said enough to make clear the extent of Government commitment and the extraordinary contrast between what we have been doing and what was the situation we inherited in 1973, three years after the UN target was set and when nothing whatever had been done about attainment.</P>
    <P>Incidentally I should make the point that in each of these recent years&mdash;last year, this year and next year&mdash;we have not confined ourselves to the very substantial increases required of us by our obligations within the EEC.  Another Government might have&mdash;and I am afraid a Fianna Fáil Government would have &mdash;simply rested on the laurels of what we were obliged to do through EEC membership&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me recapitulate, as non-controversially as I can. The position we inherited from the previous Government, the amount provided for official development assistance was simply that amount which was obliged to be subscribed to United Nations funds of which we were Members.  There was no additional element; no voluntary contribution beyond that; no bilateral element in the programme; no arrangements for voluntary service overseas.  We have not merely found ourselves in the position, because of EEC membership, where we are obliged to increase the payment substantially through the EEC mechanism, <Col N="851" /> and to some degree also through the United Nations, but have gone well beyond that and have introduced into our programme an additional, voluntary element of a substantial character.  Even though our obligations alone would have involved a quadrupling of the ODA figure we inherited from the previous Government, we have not been content to quadruple it, as we have been obliged to do, but have gone beyond that to add a substantial, additional element.  It is important that that point be made and be clear.</P>
      <P>Having said that, let me now answer a point raised by Deputy Seán Moore. First of all he raised the question about the 0.6 per cent Irish contribution to the Lomé Convention development aid provisions.  The figure of 0.6 per cent is small but, of course, is one arrived at by reference to our share of the Community's GNP.  It represents exactly the proportionate share we should subscribe by virtue of the fact that we produce 0.6 per cent of the Community's GNP. Therefore our contribution to this fund is directly proportionate.  There is no question of our not paying our full share.</P>
      <P>Indeed it may be said that the negotiations within the Community on who was to pay so much of the fund were extremely difficult and thorny.  It was perhaps the most difficult element of the whole of the negotiations.  But I was facilitated in carrying out that task by virtue of the fact that, almost alone among the Governments of the nine, I was put in a position by my Government to offer to pay our full share and no argument about it.  That gave me the moral position necessary to knock the heads of the other eight together and get them to agree to pay shares appropriate in varying degrees to their contribution to Community GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore also asked what proportion of our GNP the commitment to the Lomé Convention would represent. I said to him it was a little difficult to calculate because this £11 million was spread over five years and would be paid over a longer period <Col N="852" /> and some of the commitments involved would probably overlap into the next five-year period.  However, roughly speaking, I think in the years immediately ahead, 1976 to 1979, it will probably be of the order of 0.04 per cent of our GNP, plus or minus a certain margin.</P>
    <P>There was another query raised by Deputy Lalor who misunderstood a reference in my speech.  I would like to clarify it because on rereading it I can see how he did genuinely misunderstand it.  I said:</P>
    <P>At this stage it is not expected that our annual subscriptions will follow a uniform pattern; they will be lower than average initially and rise to a peak in the later years of the convention.</P>
    <P>It was not clear from that reference as put that this is a reflection of the way in which the total fund will be spent.  There is no question of our share of the fund being lower in some years than in others.  Our share is fixed at 0.6 per cent of whatever amount is required in each year, but the amounts required each year will rise over the first few years and reach a peak later on because of the way in which the Community will enter into commitments to spend this total amount.  The House will appreciate that it takes some time to get the whole thing moving into gear so that the amounts actually being spent represent the full size of the Community commitment, because you may enter into a commitment in the first year but some of the money may not be called for until, perhaps, two years later.  There is no question of our not paying our full share in each year. Deputy Lalor misunderstood me there, but I can see that the fault lay with me in the phrasing I used and that the misunderstanding was genuine on his part.  We will pay our full share of whatever amount is called up each year by the Community.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the other points raised by Deputy O'Kennedy.  He expressed his happiness at the emergence of DEVCO, the initiative taken by the State enterprises in the development aid sphere. I regard this as one of the most encouraging <Col N="853" /> aspects of this whole area of development aid in Ireland, because in this instance it was the State agencies themselves who initiated this idea, who developed this commitment to contribute something of what they have been learning in the process of developing our economy to the economies of the developing countries and who came up with the idea of making this contribution and of co-ordinating their own activities in this area so as to make the contribution effective. They are to be congratulated on this initiative which goes beyond what one could reasonably require of busy executives of State enterprises who have responsibilities in this country to carry out.  The fact that they are willing and able to look beyond this country and to see their commitments in a wider framework is encouraging, and the initiative they have taken is one about which the Government are very happy indeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question of whether we have a development desk in each Department.  No. The major State agencies who are actively involved in this will certainly have a development desk in the sense of at least one person who will be responsible for this kind of work and for organising their involvement in it. Our Department have, of course, a development desk in the sense of a section of the Department dealing with the assistance and dealing particularly with the expanding bilateral aid component of our programme.  This would not be true of other Departments of State, and the involvement of many Departments in development aid would be so sporadic in many cases that it would not warrant one officer being set aside for this purpose.  A situation could arise in the Department of Transport and Power where the activities of the ESB in the development aid sector would involve the Department in making <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements on a particular occasion, but it is only as and when particular issues arise that this would happen.  Therefore, outside my own Department, I do not think at this stage the scale of what is being undertaken would warrant people being set aside in each <Col N="854" /> Department for this purpose, although I am sure that in the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries and Finance there must be provision of this kind because they have an important role in development aid, but outside those Departments I would not have thought that at this stage there was a need for a person or persons to be operating continuously on this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned the fairly obvious Departments, Agriculture and Fisheries and Finance and possibly Industry and Commerce, but he is not quite sure that a desk does exist even in the two Departments to which he has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall mention to my colleagues the point the Deputy raises but, having regard to the amount to be done in these Departments, I am not sure that it warrants having a regular arrangement of that kind.  What is mainly involved in the case of Finance, for example, is a decision as to how much money has to be allocated each year, say, to the International Development Association. I could not say offhand whether there is a need to have a person or persons continuously engaged in that work, but I shall mention the point raised by Deputy O'Kennedy to my colleagues.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy seemed to be scandalised by the fact that in a particular instance the Community made the aid it was giving to the developing countries conditional on others contributing too.  The case he is referring to is, I think, the UN Emergency Fund of 3,000 million dollars which was proposed and put into effect last year to help the poorest countries who were suffering as a result of the sharp increase in the price of oil.  What happened here was that the Community took up the initiative that had been originated elsewhere and sought to give it impetus by saying: &ldquo;Yes, we are willing to pay our share, but our willingness is related to other people's willingness, and we expect other people to pay their share too.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> This was a successful way of twisting the arm of other countries, and it produced the desired result.  The Deputy suggests the Community should have said: &ldquo;We think this is very important.  If other countries do not pay their share, we will pay it for them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That seemed to be the suggestion.  I think the Community acted rightly in trying to get other countries to take responsibility, and the fund was fully subscribed.</P>
      <P>Within the Community itself we were unhappy about what happened because, instead of the Community subscribing from Community funds the whole 500 million dollars, it subscribed only 300 million dollars, because several countries said they were making bilateral contributions of their own which would count towards this emergency fund.  As a result of those unilateral decisions of member countries to subscribe directly, the Community contribution was, therefore, only 300 million dollars and that left countries like ourselves having to make separate bilateral contributions to make up our share.  This we did, but it was not to the advantage of the developing countries because, owing to the complex method of calculation of contributions&mdash;I hope the Deputy will not ask me to explain this because I could not offhand without careful briefing&mdash;although we subscribed the full amount in Irish pounds that we would have been committed to had the Community honoured as a Community the whole of its commitment, these Irish pounds did not buy as many dollars when we subscribed them directly at that stage as they would have done had they been channelled through the Community at the right time.  Therefore, although we honoured our commitment in full in terms of the amount we were required to provide, it did not produce as good a result as if it had gone through the community, and this is true of other countries' contributions as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> It is most unfortunate that several countries insisted on doing their own thing on this occasion for their own reasons, which may not have been solely concerned with the interests of the developing countries. We, in any event, paid the full amount we would have had to pay if this had gone according to plan.  I would like to say, on this occasion as on so many others, the Minister for Finance has shown understanding and sympathy with problems of this kind.  It might have been easy for him to have said: &ldquo;The money is not being called up by the Community. What do you want to pay it for?&rdquo; In this, as in many other instances, he has been very willing to honour our moral commitments as well as our legal commitments.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of recent threatened cuts by the Germans in the budget and German opposition to some aspect of development aid.  The aspect in question is development aid for non-associates and food aid.  The German proposals in respect of this were resisted by us.  The position is that in advance of the Development Council of the 13th October the Federal German Republic advised the other eight member States that they considered that more time was required to allow member States to assess the overall level of their commitments arising from the seventh special session of the United Nations, the commitments due to arise in the context of the forthcoming conference on international economic development. This resulted in the Council being unable to take positive action on aid to non-associates and on the increase in food aid.  We strongly supported both of these and, in addition, advocated Community contribution to the international fund for agricultural development.</P>
    <P>The motivation of the German objection to this is not perhaps entirely clear.  It has been suggested in newspapers that it is in some way linked to the question of British attitudes to participation in this conference.  I have no reason to believe that this is true and I have no knowledge of whether or not this is true.  I hope the German <Col N="857" /> resistance to the provision of aid under these headings will be withdrawn and that we can in the Community expand food aid and extend our aid provision to non-associates.  This is a matter which the British, the Netherlands and Irish Governments have been pressing quite strongly.  I hope we will be successful in securing agreement on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised a point&mdash; when I look at the text I can see why he raised it&mdash;about the wording of article 2.  He referred to page 10 of the explanatory memorandum of the Community.  I should explain that this is an explanatory memorandum of the European Commission.  It is not ours and this might perhaps help to explain the fact that the language is less than clear.  It took me quite a long time, after the Deputy raised the point, to understand what the language is meant to convey.  I will read out the second paragraph on page 10 as I think it ought to have been written and the Deputy may understand it a little more readily than in the form in which it is printed at present:</P>
    <P>An exception to this limitation was, however, agreed for products originating in the ACP states, since the retention by Community member states amongst themselves, as a transitional measure, of certain residual customs duties and charges having equivalent effect between the original member states and the new member states does not apply to the products concerned when they come from the ACP states.</P>
    <P>You have to spell out parts of it to make any sense and even at that it is still not very easy to understand. I hope I have helped to clarify that point.  I had not noticed how unclear this particular explanation was in the Commission's document.  It certainly needed to be clarified.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question of the possible role of voluntary organisations in relation to the Lomé Convention.  The position is that the European Commission are endeavouring to take action on this to help to ensure that voluntary organisations can play a part.  There is a proposal <Col N="858" /> on this which I hope will come into effect.  While not specifically provided for under the Lomé Convention the Commission have commenced a series of discussions with non-governmental organisations in the member states with a view to assessing the extent to which these voluntary non-governmental organisations can participate in joint aid projects, that is aid projects financed up to 50 per cent from Community funds.  This proposal was on the agenda for the Development Council of the 13th October but was not considered in substance.  Earlier on the Budget Council had not accepted the token provision of five million units of account which the commission proposed for this purpose. The Commission are continuing to pursue the idea and we have already indicated general support for it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was quite right in raising this question.  It is an issue which needs to be followed up.  I might perhaps take the opportunity of this reference to voluntary organisations to say how much we value, and depend on, the work of voluntary organisations in the whole field of development assistance.  I am consulting with these bodies.  I have already had preliminary discussions with APSO as to how we can set up structures in this country that will bring the voluntary organisations into the whole area of policy formulation for development aid.  The Parliamentary Secretary is particularly concerned with this area.  I hope to be able in a few months time to come to a conclusion and to announce proposals for this purpose.  It is clear that development aid, while it is an area which must be under Government control and where Government policy has an important part to play is also an area in which the voluntary organisations have a very important role.  We must try to ensure that in this area the voluntary organisations, the Government and State enterprises all work harmoniously together with a minimum of structures of bureaucracy and the maximum effectiveness.  I want to ensure that whatever structures we establish are ones that are the result of close consultation with the interests concerned <Col N="859" /> and that we have worked them out in common.  I hope to have the opportunity to spend a little time with a number of interested parties in discussion of this during the next month or two before coming up with proposals as to how this should best be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy asked why the 10 per cent preference element was not extended to all contracts but only to the smaller ones.  This is something which some of our partners in the Community had a view on.  They were not prepared to give this preference to the larger contracts.  It is fair to say that for many of the larger contracts the ACP countries would not have people to undertake them so it is probably not as serious a disadvantage as it seems.  There was not willingness to extend this to all contracts and in these matters we have to accept the certain consensus which emerges.  We would have had no difficulty about it but some of our partners have important interests here which they were concerned about.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised the question of multinationals and their possible role in these matters.  There is no distinction made between multinationals and others.  Contracts are open to all natural and legal persons of both the member states and the ACP states. They are awarded on a merit basis of open competition, having been advertised in the <i>Journal Officiel.</i> As there is no explicit restriction on subsidiaries of multinationals based in the EEC or ACP states tendering for such contracts consultancy contracts, which have tended to constitute between 10 and 15 per cent of European Development Fund contracts hitherto, are awarded from a short list of candidates registered with the Commission on the basis set out in a note which I have here.  I do not want to waste too much time going into detail.  In this area also there are no explicit restrictions on subsidiaries of multinationals.  Such distinction would be discriminatory and perhaps not possible within the Community. In any event it is not done.</P>

      <P>I am not engaging in the usually popular game of knocking multi-nationals; I am simply saying that because what he states now is the position that it puts them in a &ldquo;more equal&rdquo; position than those who would be contracting or tendering for contracts from the ACP states.</P>

      <P>This is equally true of large Community companies. Within the Community it is not possible to distinguish a native, Community company and the subsidiary of a multi-national which might be of American origin, for example.  Such a distinction is not made and it would be difficult to make it.  It would introduce a whole new element into the legal system of the Community.  Certainly it is impossible to do it just for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked whether there is a permanent representative of the Community in each state.  The position is that the Commission will be represented in each ACP state or in each regional grouping which expressly so requests.  They will be represented by a European Commission delegate approved by the ACP states themselves under article 31 (1) of protocol No. 2 of the convention.</P>

      <P>Will be represented, yes.  Deputy Kavanagh raised the parliamentary question, the question relating to the consultative assembly. This is a very tricky one and I do not want to get involved.  It really should be settled by the parliamentarians <Col N="861" /> themselves.  The problem is, as he says, that you have 46 ACP countries and if they are all to have at least one person, that is 46.  If you are to have equal representation from the Community you are already committed to one-quarter of the European Parliament being involved and if they are to have two each, it is half the European Parliament.  There is an inherent arithmetical problem here and I do not know the best solution.  I take his point also about the fact that some of these parliamentary representatives have never been elected.  Many of them have never been elected.</P>
      <P>But that is an old problem which we will not solve very quickly because many of these countries do not have parliamentary systems similar to ours.  Yet there is a desire to have some kind of parliamentary relationship between the European Parliament and such parliaments as exist in these countries.  If you begin making distinctions as to which parliament is properly elected and which is not you would be running into great difficulties.  This is a problem because of the non-representative character of a number of parliaments concerned and because of the disparity in numbers. I cannot help Deputy Kavanagh here.  This is something that must be tackled by the parliamentarians and I think we would go along with whatever solution they find.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore suggested that we should put the emphasis on our own development and bilateral aid programme for these countries and perhaps more widely on educational aspects. It is interesting that the bilateral projects which we have financed&mdash; I think already £200,000 has been committed for this purpose&mdash;are largely educational in character.  Perhaps I should mention them as I do not think the details have so far been published.  First, there are IPA training courses, training courses by the Institute of Public Administration&mdash; for example, in hospital administration for Zambian officials.  Secondly, there are projects which involve UCD and Córas Tráchtála in conjunction with the International Trade Centre <Col N="862" /> in Geneva, the United Nations GATT body.  These involve assisting in preparing people for the work of export promotion.  It has an educational element in that it is training and UCD is involved.  Thirdly, there is the development centre at Shannon where we are assisting SFADCo to establish this centre for the purposes of providing training facilities for participants from developing countries.  Fourthly, there is provision of aid to Lesotho, a country for which we feel a particular concern because it is completely surrounded by South Africa and has particular problems arising from that.  We are looking into the question there of helping them with a teaching centre and with scholarships.  Again, this is in the educational area.  Finally, there is provision also to assist Irish management training courses in Kenya and Tanzania.  So that Deputy Moore hit the bulls-eye in that in fact the emphasis of our bilateral policy as it has emerged in response to interest shown by bodies here and the demands from some of the countries we are in touch with is on education and training.  I think that is right and that we have much to offer in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor said that I departed from my script in referring to the need for legislation and I must apologise to the House.  I was unaware that I was doing so because the script in front of me contains a reference to this and it was only when he drew attention to it that I realised that it was not in the copy given to him.  This was because we were getting advice on this point as to whether legislation would be required and unfortunately in the version circulated to Deputies this reference was not included.  It seems that legislation will be required certainly in respect of the immunities and privileges attaching to the Lomé Convention but this is a matter which is under consideration by the Attorney General and exact details of what will be needed are not yet completely clear.  The House should take it that some legislation will be needed, but the exact nature and extent of it is something I could not go into at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> Deputy Lalor spoke of the possible need for safeguards in regard to trade from developing countries.  He also raised the question as to whether the assistance we are giving through the Lomé Convention to countries to develop their trade and establish industries might not cut across our own industrial promotion efforts.  We must be clear about this: there is a potential clash here.  It is a clash that I think in practice will be minimised, but there is a clash of interest because what these countries need above all is the opportunity to develop industries of the kind they can cope with and a level of technology they can cope with and access for the products of the industries to markets in the industrialised world including EEC.  If we give them no assistance with this we would in fact inhibit their development very much.  The transfer of technology to these developing countries must be a very major element in their future development. However, the kind of industries they will tend to develop at this stage in their economic progress will be those with a relatively low level of technology whereas the industries we are promoting here through the IDA are, on the contrary, industries with a very high level of technology.</P>
    <P>But it is important that we should recognise that some of the kind of industries we have traditionally had here are really low technology industries more appropriate to countries at an early stage of development.  A large part of the work carried out in the 1960s by, for example, the Committee on Industrial Organisation was designed to get this message across to Irish industry: that Irish industry should not continue to invest in types of industry and technology which would be vulnerable to this kind of competition from other countries whose labour costs would be lower and which would be quite capable of undertaking the kind of industrial production involved.  It is important for us to shift the level of our technology upwards so that we would move out of the area which would be vulnerable to this kind of competition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> There is a problem here and Deputy Lalor was quite right to raise it.  It is one we must face.  There is an inherent clash of interests between some of our least technological industries and some of the industries in the developing countries which we must help to get off the ground if these countries are to have a chance of achieving any kind of viability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it does.  However, I am saying to the House that we should not pretend to ourselves that there is not a problem here; there is a problem and we ought to be honest with ourselves about it.  Of course, there is safeguard provision in Article 10 but in the long term we have to face the fact that these countries are going to develop with the kind of industries we used to have 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  If we continue to rely on these industries and do not develop higher technology industries as we are doing successfully with the assistance of the IDA, we will be in trouble and we have to face this. There is a natural division of activity here between countries at different stages of development.  We belong to the industrialised world and we will have to gear ourselves up to that or we will be vulnerable in this respect.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lalor raised the question of whether the list of 24 worst off countries in Article 48 is a fair list if, as he said, Nigeria is not on the list while that country's <i>per capita</i> income is only 100 dollars.  I have not been able to check this in the time available to me.  Deputy Lalor was working from the explanatory memorandum and on the figures he has produced his point is well taken but my own recollection is that Nigeria is at a significantly more advanced stage of development with a significantly higher GNP per head.  I can only say that the figures do not look right to me.  Nigeria, with its oil resources, is a relatively wealthy country by African standards. I cannot offhand explain or say what the answer is to Deputy Lalor's point but there may be some error in the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="865" /> I have dealt with the points raised in the debate and I trust I have answered them adequately.  If there are any other points Deputy O'Kennedy should like to raise I will be happy to give him a quick reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is well that I have not received the copy of the Official Report when the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was deputising for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs acknowledged 12 months ago that the level of direct contribution was less than the target the Government set themselves.  That Minister acknowledged that and the figures are there to prove it.  I do not want to go on in this vein because of the clear and absolute statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that we had not fallen short.  I do not want to set any division between himself and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, one is taking one year with another and the other is a saving clause as the Minister must know.  If in one year we fall below our stated commitment, we have to have a much more significant increase to get back on the path we set ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that we would aim at an annual increase in ODA of the order of 0.05 per cent of GNP, taking one year with another over the next five years.  It is perfectly clear what that means.  It does not mean that in every year we will be exactly on that figure; it means that we are committed to moving along that course and to arriving at that result.  In 1975 we have gone far beyond the absolute commitment we entered into to increase both in absolute terms as a percentage of GNP the amount devoted to Official Development Assistance.  We have increased it by almost one-third.  In 1975 the amount is not dead on the line <Col N="866" /> of 0.05 per cent and I have made that clear.  Taking one year with another, there is no commitment to do it in each year.  If the Deputy found us year after year falling further behind, he would be perfectly entitled to raise doubt as to whether we were serious about our commitment but that is not the case.  It is our intention to increase the amount of ODA in 1976 by an amount which would be of the order of 0.05 per cent of GNP and there will be no question of falling further behind.</P>

    <Title>Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1975 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a certain reluctance that I offer to intervene in this debate and that reluctance is occasioned by two circumstances.  The first is that the level at which the Minister has approached this problem is such and has been such, particularly in his speech in the Seanad, supplemented by his speech here, that to give an adequate rejoinder or comment on the content would call for an analysis that I have not had the time to assemble.  I should like the Minister to take that as a compliment.  In the introduction of this Bill in the Seanad, and again in his comments in this House, the Minister showed a creditable depth of thought which contrasts sharply with the all too frequently and superficial contributions or <i>clichés</i> and doctrinaire platitudes which so many politicians have to offer, even Ministers, where constructive political thought is called for.  Unfortunately, those comments are intended to pass as a serious contribution to economic, social and political problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judged by that norm the Minister's <Col N="867" /> contribution in the Seanad, and in this House, stands out sharply.  Although I am opposed to him here, and would be opposed to him on certain points of principle and much of detail, it should be recognised that the level on which this debate was cast at the outset was exceptional and one I would like to see achieved more frequently.  My second hesitation originates in a certain familiarity with the problems that are posed in this area, certainly a familiarity with them in the sense that they have frequently been intruded upon me.  I must confess that one feels that some of these problems when stated in a certain way are insoluble and that, perhaps, part of the art of finding practical solutions is to find the proper way of posing the problem.  For these reasons I approach this with considerable hesitancy.</P>
    <P>Now to the Bill itself.  Instead of attempting an overall approach, as the Minister very creditably did, I should like to draw attention to the fact that this is an amending Bill.  Therefore in a sense in addressing ourselves strictly to the Bill as it stands we are dealing with a series of amendments.  I do not think there is any basic change in general approach in this Bill to that in the parent Bill because there is only one logical way of approaching this problem.  If one accepts the overall principle that it is the business of the State, then the homogeneity of this amending Bill and the parent Bill follows as a matter of course.  That is not to say that the Bill does not effect some very significant amendments, because it does.  It effects not only significant amendments but significant improvements.  This Bill must command sympathy because of the ordered thought which has gone into its construction in relation to the parent Bill and because of what is enshrined in it, but, like every other Bill and amendment, it is not perfect.  Those remarks in themselves dispose of the first section.</P>
    <P>The second section raises the question of the autonomy of the authority and the relationship of that body to the Minister of the day.  In the parent Bill and this Bill there is no question, <Col N="868" /> it would appear, that this is a State enterprise.  There is no difference of opinion between us that it is a community service for which the community is paying.  It is the community's property with the Government as custodians or executors and, as executors, they have their duties to perform.  Therefore it is a question of how much should be delegated, how much autonomy should be divested directly from the Minister and the Government and how much should be retained by the Minister and the Government to enable them to discharge their trust and responsibility.</P>
    <P>These questions arise under the parent Bill and this Bill and answers have to be found within a common framework.  At the risk of inaccuracy I will paraphrase what the Minister said.  He said that in expanding the duties, he was also adjusting them to the circumstances of the time, in contrast to the time of the original legislation. He also said he wanted to give greater autonomy, within limits, while at the same time improving public control in certain areas.  Basically the question the Minister asked is this: Is it necessary that the Minister should keep the general control he had under the original section 31, which was a general discretion on power of intervention at all points, or if it would be more effective to delimit the areas where he had control and delegate real autonomy?  Quite rightly, he pointed out that while such a blanket power existed, the appearance of delegation of autonomy lacked reality. Furthermore, the Minister made the point, correctly, that not only did the body fundamentally lack autonomy but that responsibility was back on the Government and they would have to proceed to detail in the matter.</P>
    <P>That is a large area of debate, but all I will say is that some of the Minister's arguments convinced me.  In principle the Minister was right to try to delimit authority and place the responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the people who are to carry it, and then provide for two things, namely, the ultimate power to see that that responsibility as a whole was carried, and power to directly control certain areas.  The Minister made a <Col N="869" /> strong case for that.  Perhaps if one were so minded, a very protracted debate could evolve from this problem. I do not propose to enter into that debate, neither do I wish to appear to be washing my hands of it.  But I am not prepared to concede the Minister's arguments without qualification. That is perhaps a very safe thing to say, but the Opposition have the privilege of taking up such an attitude.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the removal of a member of the Authority or the Authority as a whole.  There is merit in the Minister's proposal.  At least it means this House must take its responsibility, that the subject would be debated with full public knowledge.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, looking at another aspect of it, the Minister said&mdash; I will refer to that in more detail at the end&mdash;that this can be a very inhibiting provision for him.  When he talks about retaining direct power in certain areas and provides for it, he still precludes himself from the possibility of exercising the sanction that may be necessary to enforce that power and he may come up against a managerial difficulty.  This section provides, in effect, that any member of the Authority may be removed in certain conditions.  One asks naturally what about the Authority as a whole? Of course, from the strict legal point of view all the Minister has to do is to remove them individually, but the practical difficulty remains.  It is not so serious if it is the case of one recalcitrant member, but if it comes to the whole Authority the Minister may very well find himself with problems.  He may have urgent reasons as well as cogent ones for giving a directive within the limits he has defined and the Authority may refuse to carry out his directive. There may be a practical urgency in such a case.  What then does the Minister do?</P>
    <P>The procedure the Minister has provided for here can be cumbrous.  What happens, for instance, if in a situation&mdash;I am not thinking of an ordinary political situation but the type of problem the Minister digressed on in the Seanad and a little in the Dáil when presenting his philosophy&mdash;<Col N="870" /> when the Authority might well flout the Minister to his face?  It might be Oireachtas vacation time and it might take a period to assemble the Dáil or the Oireachtas as a whole.  Then because of the democratic nature of the Oireachtas there might be delays, perhaps some recourse to the traditional filibuster.  Meanwhile the Minister is powerless; the thing he seeks to control goes on out of control and the mechanism he has set up here will aggravate it.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the justification, the advisability or anything else of the decision that might have been taken, but it was made and the directive given.  There was a directive under section 31 given by the Minister's predecessor. What about a case like that?  If the provision had been there as in section 2, in practical terms the consequences might have been serious. I am putting a hypothetical case. Supposing the Authority do not act in accordance with the Minister's directive. There is in such a case a stmulus given in the opposite direction. The object of the exercise under section 31 was to minimise publicity and incitement, but the result of this provision will be to maximise publicity and incitement in such a situation. That is the difficulty I see in a section of this nature.</P>
    <P>I must say that the section appeals to me.  In principle I feel that when authority is delegated it should be delegated thoroughly because a body or an individual cannot carry responsibility unless he has the inner certainty that comes from security to carry out that responsibility.  Therefore, I see this section as a dilemma for the Minister in which the last state will be worse than the first.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am a little sensitive in certain areas like many other Deputies who have been here for some time.  It has been fashionable to try various devices for dealing with problems.  At one period in our history there was a tendency for Ministers and Governments to escape from their responsibilities by appointing commissions, authorities and the rest of it.  Some of this was justified but, as I say, the suspicion remains <Col N="871" /> that the device tended to be used to avoid awkward responsibilities.</P>
    <P>For instance, directly cognate to this was the old practice of appeals to the Minister for Justice on convictions. That became a real nuisance and the setting up of other mechanisms to deal with it were naturally a temptation.  Other problems were referred to commissions as a way of putting off the evil day.  Other devices were apparently successful, such as the setting up of State bodies, but now we find that the result of setting up semi-State bodies and companies, no matter how useful they have been, has been that they are not thoroughly under public control&mdash;that it is impossible for the public to get all the information they would get if the Minister and the Department in question had retained the power.  They have been carefully insulated from questions in this House although at the same time they are in receipt of large subsidies from the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>This kind of problem can arise again out of this section and can be a dilemma for the Minister.  I see it also as something much more embarrassing and potentially dangerous, nationally, than what I might call the guillotine operation of section 31.  It is a matter on which debate might have been expanded but the debate has been concentrated in other areas.  I should have been interested to hear the answer because in modern circumstances there is the great danger of the arbitrary power of the machinery of Government, something from which we all need to be protected.</P>
    <P>The Minister is conscious of this need but he should be conscious also of the equally arbitrary&mdash;in the sense of sole discretion of a blinder but more powerful force&mdash;total force of governmental or departmental machinery, in other words, the collective force of a psychology that is generated within the administrative machine. The Minister has made a strong point on these grounds but it is on these grounds hinge the arguments for all he has done.  In the area of the executive <Col N="872" /> responsibility of the Government I fear that the Minister has put himself in a straitjacket.  This reminds one of what is happening all over the world with the majority of the forces of law and order in straitjackets and unable, because of a certain type of liberal thinking, to control effectively and safeguard the interests of the peaceful majority of mankind.</P>
    <P>I am grateful that it is no part of my duty as a member of the Opposition to offer the Minister a solution. If I were in his seat I should be very concerned with finding a solution. However, regarding the Minister's statement in the Seanad&mdash;I have not the reference available to me at the moment&mdash;where he said that his second aim was for greater autonomy within limitation while at the same time improving public control in certain areas, I believe a qualification may be necessary to this section albeit that it is strictly delimited to the area in which the Minister wishes to exercise more effective public control.</P>
    <P>Section 3 must be the one of greatest interest to anybody who thinks politically or who is interested in human affairs and, in particular, to politicians who, as the Minister pointed out correctly in the Seanad must not shirk their responsibilty. This section must be of much interest, too, to those engaged professionally in broadcasting, particularly journalists. The section provides for objective and impartial reporting, for accurate news and for fair comment.  I do not think that any professional involved in this field would seek any other ideal. Exception is taken often by <i>bona fide</i> journalists to their being accused from time to time of a deliberate lack of objectivity or of fairness.  In the main these charges are unfounded but they are resented by those concerned.  Unfortunately, as in every other field, instances will be found where comment is made in such a way as to give colour to the story but every decentminded journalist, and that goes for practically all of them, accepts objectivity and fairness as the basic tenets of his creed.</P>
    <P>We might ask, then, how these unjust charges are made and repeated. <Col N="873" /> It may not be difficult to assemble circumstantial evidence which may appear to substantiate such charges. This is something that has impinged on my mind on more than one occasion but each time I have had to ask myself what is objectivity, a question that is much akin to asking what is truth&mdash;the question which Pilate asked but which has never been answered. I suspect that there is reality in the concept of objectivity and I believe that there is an absolute truth.  But I fear that that objectivity, like absolute and perfect truth, is beyond the power of any human individual, group or community to realise.  That, I think, is what we are up against here.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment deny the concept of objectivity but in the reporting of and the commenting on human affairs it is impossible to achieve complete objectivity in a single, so to speak, contribution or in a series of contributions.  This is where the difficulty arises. We cannot seperate completely what we commonly understand as objectivity in reporting from the subjective approach of the reporter.  The more honest and imaginative he is the greater the difficulty he has.</P>
    <P>I should like now to pay tribute to the general objectivity and the very high standard of the new services of both radio and television.  It is, however, inevitable that they can be faulted, if one is so minded.  I think every politician has had the experience of saying: &ldquo;Oh, my God, he gave that bit but he did not give the subsequent qualification&rdquo;, and so on and so forth.  That problem arises under this section but I think the paragraph should stand and should be emphasised because it is an ideal to be aimed at.</P>
    <P>The question is how to achieve that ideal.  What I have to say now may be a slight digression but it may serve to show the difficulties that are there in achieving objectivity.  In the old days the Minister&mdash;I shall not say will recall&mdash;will appreciate from his knowledge of history that before the days of any modern form of communication, written news was largely <Col N="874" /> confined to certain serious areas like politics or the local county council. It was customary for a reporter to go to a meeting and his problem was very largely solved for him because he was required to take the whole thing down verbatim.  He was merely the medium through which the verbatim report was transmitted into print.  Whatever William Smith O'Brien or anyone else said was there as he said it.  That standard minimised the problems of objectivity. Today there is a time factor.  There is also the human factor.  One cannot under present circumstances expect a reporter to take down everything, knowing very well that only a paragraph will be used.  To expect him to do so would be asking a little too much of human nature.  The reporter must use his head and, after he furnishes his report, it goes to the subeditor who again has to tailor it to the requirement of the medium concerned and, when all these processes have been carried out, the problem of objectivity takes on a more intimidating form.</P>
    <P>To my mind there is only one way of achieving objectivity in regard to news presentation, and that is to set out clearly this ideal: to publicise everything but, more importantly, to have as many media as possible, to have a multiplicity of media, each giving the news in the first instance with the same idea according to their lights and then providing honest and fair comment.  Honest and fair comment are words understood by any human being but they are not words that a group, even a small group, will find a consensus of agreement on when applied in a particular place. If you have a diversity of comment aiming to be fair and complete I believe the sum total will be the informing of the community.  That will be the best and only practical way of achieving what the Minister envisages in this section.</P>
    <P>What he has written is excellent.  The principles are well worth stating but, in order to achieve them, it seems to me you need, not a concentration on and not a tendency to narrow the number of communicating channels, <Col N="875" /> whatever they may be, print, or radio, or anything else.  The ideal is to diversify and maximise and give the freest possible opportunity for the expression of&mdash;I am going to use the word&mdash;&ldquo;responsible&rdquo; views.  That brings me up against the question of censorship.  The only practical and fair form of censorship is the censorship of a mature mind.  In saying that I am quoting an editor.  This section introduces aspirations which are practicable, desirable and in every way laudable. What I have said about fairness applies in equal measure to provisions later in the section about promoting or inciting to crime, tending to undermine the authority of the State or an intrusion on privacy.  I am glad that in the Seanad the Minister recognised that incitement to crime and the promotion of violence is something in regard to which a journalist, whether in television, on radio, in the newspapers or anywhere else, is not any more lacking in responsibility or anti-patriotic or anti-social than any other citizen.  He pointed out two things: the appetite of all of us for what we consider to be news, and the very fact that the persons who should not be encouraged are the very persons who seek out the television cameras and the media for exploitation of their points of view.</P>
    <P>The responsible journalist will subscribe to principles but he will be very much aware of the difficulties the Minister pointed out.  He will also be aware that, in some cases, the executive, the people who are directly involved in the matter may have a super-sensitivity which may distort their overall long-term judgment.  It is a sobering thought that we, and particularly the executive, may be super-sensitive in certain areas and that the Government's judgment of the values for the community may not be as sound as the journalist's judgment. The journalist is more detached and, like the hurler on the ditch may see more of the game, although he is by no means the hurler on the ditch in the context.</P>
    <P>It is a sobering thought to add that dimension to the dimensions the Minister has rightly considered, particularly in his speech in the Seanad.  Both <Col N="876" /> journalists and other members of the community will deplore the tendency for groups or interests to try to gain control of or at least to influence or affect the presentation of comment and news in the media.  People with these intentions actually infiltrate the media. Some time ago&mdash;fortunately it has eased off&mdash;there was a considerable amount of incitement to young people to take up journalism for such motives. The geuine journalists resented this as much as the rest of us.  This was not confined to the secular area where this idea of commitment was being sold to young people.  They were encouraged to go into the media with a commitment which was nothing more nor less than an incitement to demoralise an area of paramount public importance and to prostitute an honourable profession.</P>
    <P>That phase has passed.  It never amounted to a significant danger but for a while it did seem to be a significant threat.  Whether from the community's point of view or from the professional's point of view, the ideal of objective reporting, unachievable as it may be, and the ideal of fair comment, responsibility and sensitivity for individual privacy, by and large have been achieved by the media in spite of all that is said about them. They should be encouraged in this approach.  To encourage others in the commitment approach is an incitement to demoralise the media and prostitute a profession.  People who do that must bear a very heavy responsibility. I am glad to have the opportunity of saying this here.</P>
    <P>It is important, therefore, in the area of education that these ideals of the journalistic profession should be instilled into young men and women at the sensitive age instead of the distorted idea that the media achieve everything and therefore they should try to gain control of the media.  Nobody is more alive to these dangers than journalists, both collectively and individually.</P>
    <P>To come back to the problem in the Bill, the section should be there. By and large, the requirements are being met by RTE.  They are also met <Col N="877" /> in our own immediate environment. Occasionally an interviewer may have his own views.  There is also the technique of cross-examining a person on the box as if he was a hostile witness. That is becoming more rare.  It could have been said of broadcasting at the beginning.  I am thinking of somebody in another system who made his name on it.  I have seen cases in which one person begins to feel a criminal and the other canonised.  At its worst there is malice and that malice should be eliminated and at its best, this is merely another symptom of the impossibility of getting objectivity. We should not be too sensitive in interpretation; there must be understanding. Much greater danger can occur, not so much with the interviewer or with the journalist, but when free comment is allowed, shall I say, out of a crowd.  There are certain people&mdash;like those who propound the commitment doctrine&mdash;who come in when they get the chance and trot out the same old thing; who make a point of trying to denigrate whoever is being interviewed. This usually happens in a programme where there is an audience and some care has to be exercised in selecting these audiences who participate. That is about as far as my adverse criticism would go.</P>
    <P>Section 4 simply deals with the complaints commission and has very wide and detailed provisions.  But what does the commission do in the long run? A charge is made; they try the charge; they give their result&mdash;and I should be glad if the Minister would correct me if I am wrong in this&mdash; but then the Authority either take it or leave it.</P>

      <P>This is very like the Press Council in England.  I wonder how much effect has a body of that nature.  The fact that somebody can comment is useful but we would be deluding ourselves if we thought this would have any great influence. There is the Press Council in England. Every day almost, and particularly in a paper like <i>The Times,</i> which is reporting <Col N="878" /> them, or the paper concerned, there is a case in which a complaint is upheld or disallowed.  When the complaint is disallowed the newspaper concerned makes a point of publishing it without fail.  But I have noticed that it is a universal rule to publish all cases decided on in any particular medium or any particular paper. Where it is published fairly regularly I wonder how many people give the proverbial damn when it comes down to practice?  Perhaps at their inception such bodies or mechanisms have their uses.  Perhaps they are something at which somebody may look over his shoulder but, after a while, they become very much a part of the landscape; everybody gets used to them whether directly interested or otherwise. I wonder how really helpful they are.  Theoretically, yes; in practice, I do not know.  Quite cynically, if I were asked to decide the matter, I would turn to my adviser and ask: What is it going to cost?  If it does not cost very much, it is doing no harm; if it is going to cost a lot of money, I do not think it is worth it because it is not very effective now that the autonomy exists.</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with &ldquo;Advice to Authority&rdquo;.  There is one reservation I should like to enter here.  I do appear to be making a Committee Stage speech but it is an amending Bill and each section stands on its own.  On the question of seeking advice, I say yes, but, on the question of the finance involved in seeking advice, there should be some restriction. This is the type of section that makes it very easy to do one of two things, neither of which is very desirable. One is to set up advisers to stall something or to avoid answering an awkward question.  That is the type of mentality I mentioned when I spoke of commissions earlier.  The other is a tendency to seek information and advice and indulge in what are really unnecessary exercises that may be costly.  Therefore, I will enter that <i>Caveat</i> on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is dropping section 6. I am glad and I shall come back to that at the end in the same spirit in which the Minister made his contribution <Col N="879" /> when he reserved certain comments for the end.</P>
    <P>Skipping some sections, I come to section 14.  In so far as anybody can attempt a definition of functions in this way the Minister's clarity of thought here is commendably evident and the formulation, on which I see his hand, is one to be commended also.  But, again like section 3, there is the ideal and the practical&mdash;how to give effect to the ideal.  In saying that I am really propounding the problem of humanity or, shall I say, even that of salvation?</P>
    <P>Excellent as were the foregoing, we come now to section 17.  Rightly, the Minister must keep some reserve of powers but I seize immediately upon the words &ldquo;likely to promote, or incite to, crime or would tend to undermine the authority of the State, he may by order direct the Authority...&rdquo;.  It is the use of the word &ldquo;crime&rdquo; about which I am not clear here.  What is crime in this context?  Admittedly the words &ldquo;or would tend to undermine the authority of the State&rdquo; would suggest that crime is to be taken in its traditional meaning in our jurisprudence, but the definition of crime with the intrusion of statute over the past 50 years makes one wonder what can be crime.  I question whether that section is not so wide as to practically restore to the Minister power that he professes to be divesting himself of. However, the difference between this and section 6 and the autonomy conferred by section 2 is that here the Minister is only giving a direction to refrain from doing something; he is not giving a direction to do something. That is a difference in quality that is important, and unless he is to abdicate I think he has to have such a power.  The word &ldquo;crime&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps on Committe Stage we might come back to it&mdash;raises a question mark as to what the Minister means.</P>
    <P>The same word is used in section 3: &ldquo;incite to crime or tending to undermine the authority of the State&rdquo;. What the Minister was talking about is violent crime.  There is a difference there, and I hope the Minister is thinking of something more than <Col N="880" /> violent crime here, because I could give instances which are more contagious. To come to a technicality, suicide is a crime and it is a wellknown fact the over-publication of the incidence of and detail about suicide seems to increase the number of crimes of that nature.  There are other instances like that.  However, I do not think the Minister will have to call on this section except in respect of the so-called news value and &ldquo;what the people want&rdquo; aspect of the thing or in a quasi-political context.  The people in the media are conscious of these matters already, it having been demonstrated that visual representation of a certain type of crime has aggravated the situation.</P>
    <P>The type of incitement that is most objectionable&mdash;and I say this in criticism of something I saw some time ago on television&mdash;is the indirect. There was a canned feature film in which the criminal was involved in a whole series of murder crimes perpetrated against women.  In the end, in a very subtle way, a corrosive liberalism, of which some of us have complained on more than one occasion, became evident.  He was justified and almost made a hero by an appeal to his own unfortunate background and psychiatric base.  There are perspectives being lost here, but if they are being lost on television they are being lost to a much greater extent not in newspapers or magazines but in books. The pathological authors are the people to be thought of in this context, not the medium that is considered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is here because I wish to comment on his approach to the Bill.  His analysis of the problem both in abstract and in concrete terms, may I presume to say, was masterly.  In his analysis of the psychological and other factors involved, he has shown his power as an historian and a political philosopher. It is a pity that such a contribution should not have been more widely available <i>in toto.</i></P>
    <P>The Minister approached this problem on two planes.  On that level there is much for us to ponder on.  Much has been made clear but there is another level.  The Minister has written a book <Col N="881" /> and he is intensely interested in another problem.  It is unfortunate that in his approach to the Bill he allowed his own strong views and his conceptions about the problem of the North to intrude on the general problem of broadcasting.  That was a pity because it seems to me that he came down from the level of the philosopher to the pragmatic level of the executive. This tempts me to join issue with him.  As he probably knows, it is on that level that I disagree with him as much as I agree with him on the other level.</P>
    <P>I want to keep within the ambit of this debate.  The Minister referred to the broad concept of culture.  Pluralistic culture is becoming a <i>cliché.</i> Cultural extremists are what I take the Minister to mean when he refers to cultural protectionists and whether in religion or anything else they are a menace at either extreme.  One has to take into account the evolution of human society.  I agree with the Minister, when he quoted Connolly, and pointed out that the abstract that is talked about is nothing more nor less than the people involved, that the Ireland we talk about is, in the last analysis, the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I agree that society evolves and if it was nothing more than modern communications technology, even the communications media we are talking about, forces are broadly interlinking humanity all over the world. In the earlier debate we were talking about an even broader range of interlinking.  I do not fault the Minister on that basis in his comments on culture.  He can defend his general thesis all the way through but I join issue with him in descending to the level of application.</P>
    <P>While realising the values of what is conventionally called Irish culture, a certain element of conservation is needed.  If that is added, then I thoroughly agree that culture, instead of being hemmed in, isolated and an exhibition piece, should be integrated in the broader social and cultural development of mankind.  It would then find its place both nationally and internationally.  Many of us saw a great possibility in our joining Europe that we would re-establish the <Col N="882" /> broader links with Europe which were broken about the time of the Union. I am not an historian but I strongly suspect that many of our ideas that we characterise as national and cultural have their genesis in the French Revolution, which is about spent now.  I believe there are older and deeper things that must come through.  I could hardly undertake a coherent and continuous comment that would do justice to the whole philosophical approach of the Minister, especially in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as a logical corollary to this broad approach to culture, arrives at the need for the dissemination of ideas and what he calls open broadcasting.  This is very much akin to what I advocated in relation to the multiplicity of the media.  We are basically on the same wave length here but in the application to the particular problem of the North the Minister is making a mistake.  It seems to me that implicit in his thinking is that if we encourage the free flow of British and Northern television, radio and newspapers in here we will, reciprocally, be able to purvey our complimentary contributions. We will not be able to do that because this is where size matters.  Unfortunately, in human affairs action and reaction are not equal and opposite. Both action and reaction depend on relative size and power, weighted in favour of the greater.  That is the first factor the Minister overlooked when he came down to this level.  For that reason I think that the RTE solution, which in the end led to the Minister's promise to change section 6, was a sounder estimate than the Minister had at the beginning.  I should like to pay the Minister this compliment. Not every man would be big enough to come in and repeal the section as straightforwardly as the Minister has done.  I respect him for that.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the Minister has been too preoccupied with the Northern situation in dealing with this Bill. I am not faulting him on his preoccupation with the Northern situation; he is entitled to his point of view, much as I disagree with it fundamentally.  By focussing on it in <Col N="883" /> that way he detracted from his very fine contribution or dissertation on the matter.  If the suspicion is abroad&mdash; and it was&mdash;that the Minister's ulterior motive in section 6, as it was originally there, was to further his political aims in regard to the North, as he is reputed to hold them, the Minister must blame himself.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has removed section 6 and that he can disclaim or refute any suggestion of that nature. I believe this was what disturbed most people about the Bill and what caused the controversy to rage around the Minister's head: the suspicion that a propaganda method was being constructed in order to swamp or to brainwash the Irish with a particular point of view in regard to the North. The repeal of section 6&mdash;and indeed the whole structure of the Bill&mdash;removes this suspicion.  It was a pity that it should have been there in the first place and, leaving out the Minister and his views, it points to the real dangers inherent in that section as it was and the sounder judgment of the people whose recommendation was accepted in the end.  When I say that, again credit is due to the Minister and should not be taken from him for the way in which he reacted. I wish other Ministers would be as objective and openminded.</P>
    <P>What I have said about the Northern situation was necessary having regard to the way in which the Minister presented the Bill.  It does not really arise on the Bill; it was something extraneous. But it has arisen and I should like to say two things in this connection to the Minister, both as a Minister and an historian, without repeating something that has been said here&mdash;I said it myself years ago.  Certain aspects the Minister stressed in his Seanad speech do not happen by accident.  I have compared them to the symptoms of a disease; he spoke about the eradication of the disease. That could bring me within the category the Minister castigated in his speech&mdash;the category of, shall I say, the fellow traveller.  That I disclaim. The problem is that one has to recognise all the factors of the case.  If the <Col N="884" /> Minister wants to know my views I repeat what I said on 26th June, 1974, in this House as reported, I think, in Volume 273.</P>
    <P>I also say to the Minister that surely as an historian he knows that when one is trying to solve a problem such as is there&mdash;I am going away from the violence, going to the basic thing &mdash;where there is negotiation and bargaining&mdash;it was very interesting to listen to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, talking about the bargaining that led up to the agreement which was discussed just before this Bill&mdash;it cannot be all give on one side.  The greatest historical mistake that can be made is concession by the politician where the community are not prepared to concede the whole way, particularly concession without <i>quid pro quo.</i> This is really irrelevant but I think the Minister as an historian will probably get my range.  I only say this because I am sorry that the Minister in his anxiety and interest in regard to the other problem introduced it as he did on this Bill, not that it was not in a sense relevant but I think it had the unfortunate consequences I have mentioned. Were it not for that flaw in the Minister's own approach his analysis of the problems behind this legislation and the philosophy involved could not be better.</P>
    <P>With these disjointed remarks I shall conclude the few words I had to say. I am glad section 6 has gone but the practical executive problems in regard to the other sections remain. I hope that whatever the outcome of this legislation in practice it will be like its predecessor which by and large has proved itself.  I hope the trends we see in our broadcasting service will be maintained.  The standard of the news is very high and there is a commendable standard in regard to fairness also.  It would be a pity to distort such a spontaneous sense of values by over-anxiety or, worst of all, by anything smacking of an ineffective censorship.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the Seanad, did not shy away from the word &ldquo;censorship&rdquo; and neither shall I.  In the long <Col N="885" /> run it defeats itself but if proper standards are encouraged and there is a reasonable approach to these things in my view there will not be a need for censorship in such matters.  I should like to end on a pessimistic note.  I often wonder in our modern western society whether we are not suffering from two serious diseases&mdash; a pessimistic historian might think them fatal diseases.  I wonder whether the western economy is suffering from a form of cancer in the urban centres, the indiscriminate and disorderly replication of cells and the poisoning of the whole body through disorder; another disease of the nervous system which is distorting all intercommunication between the parts of the body.  The communications media are the nervous system.  With the advent of television as a technical progress a new factor has been built in here.</P>
    <P>One is left wondering whether in its repercussions directly on the viewer and on the community and its indirect repercussions on the values of the other media there is not basically a serious problem that goes far beyond the confines of this country.  If there is it is hard to see how it can be adjusted within the democratic framework and that is the task.  In his own local area the Minister has made a good start, subject to the criticism I have made, in adjusting our television system to the democratic needs of our society if we all remember the suffering, silent majority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera covered most of the points I intended to make in relation to the Bill.  In opening, he compared this legislation with the original Broadcasting Authority Act which was introduced in 1960.  When one looks at this Bill, which is being introduced 15 years, after the introduction of the original Act, one can only marvel at the foresight of the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Hilliard.  The changes in this Bill, while dressed up in a significant way by the Minister&mdash;some of the changes are not in line with the Minister's thinking when he was speaking from the Opposition benches <Col N="886" />&mdash;indicate a certain amount of backtracking by the Minister.  It is remarkable that a Member expresses himself in a different way when he speaks from the Opposition benches without the responsibility of introducing responsible legislation.  This Bill indicates some backtracking from the views held by the Minister when he had not the responsibility for running the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>In relation to what took place recently the debate on section 6 is stale but it would be no harm for me to put on record a view widely held in connection with RTE 2, or the alternative programme to the existing programme we have.  I have read reports of Muintir na Tire meetings and other meetings where this topic was discussed but this morning, as Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party, I received a letter from the secretary of the Tipperary Comhairle Ceanntar of Fianna Fáil in relation to this matter and I should like to put the contents of this letter on record.  It states:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Lalor,</P>
      <P>At the last ordinary general meeting of the Tipperary Comhairle Ceanntar of Fianna Fáil on 5th October the following resolution was passed:</P>
      <P>Having regard to the many more pressing and urgent problems facing the country this comhairle considers that a second television channel is far from necessary; that in the event of a second channel being established control of it be retained in Irish hands and we condemn the attempt by the Government to govern by opinion poll or survey.</P>
      <P>I was directed to convey this resolution to the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that letter was written the result of the survey was not known. Those attending that meeting were not aware of the views of the people who took part in the survey and the members of that comhairle live in a singlechannel area.  In my view the more responsible people in rural areas were <Col N="887" /> following that line even though they were being offered the choice of BBC 2 or BBC 1 (Northern Ireland).</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted defeat in regard to this matter and he spent a considerable amount of time explaining how he miscalculated in this regard. The whole thinking of the nation, for which it would appear he took a certain amount of credit, had changed.  He welcomed this change but the end product was that the people told him to stuff his BBC and give us an Irish controlled programme. He went on to say that the selling point from Mr. MacRedmond and the various spokesmen who had contributed to the pro-RTE 2 debate was that they would give us the best of BBC 1, BBC 2, UTV and foreign stations.  Some years ago when we were canvassing throughout the country to join the EEC the Minister and his colleagues in the Labour Party and other organisations were very worried about our culture.  Maybe that is when he learned that we are not terribly worried about culture, but we want what is best for us economically.</P>
    <P>Having spent some time in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I have a little knowledge of the operation of RTE.  The then Deputy Cruise-O'Brien was always interested in how successive Fianna Fáil Ministers were able to manipulate RTE.  In my short time as Minister I never found that one of the easiest things to do, but since the Minister took office it is obvious that he is reasonably happy with the operations in this regard.  He always felt that the Minister should be, and was, capable of manipulating RTE in the normal course of events.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs the then Deputy Cruise-O'Brien said at column 2483, Volume 263 of the Official Report, on 23rd November, 1972:</P>
    <P>The Authority, being what it is, and the Government, being what it is, I find it hard to believe that the Authority would have been altogether heedless of the Minister's views thus gently expressed or that <Col N="888" /> the Minister would have been altogether heedless of the Authority's views.</P>
    <P>At that time that view was fairly acceptable.  He made that statement shortly after the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy G. Collins, had had a run-in with the then RTE Authority.  It is interesting to note the views held then by the present Minister on the powers given to the Minister at that time.  I have a clear recollection of the present Minister criticising the power a directive gave the Minister under the 1960 Bill.  Section 31 (1) of that Bill was quoted by the present Minister at column 2487, Volume 263, as follows:</P>
    <P>The Minister may direct the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matter of any particular class and the Authority shall comply with the direction.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that the Minister proposes to amend that section by section 17 (1) of this Bill, which reads:</P>
    <P>Where the Minister is of the opinion that the broadcasting of a particular matter or a matter of a particular class would be likely to promote, or incite to, crime or would tend to undermine the authority of the State, he may by order direct the Authority to refrain from broadcasting the matter or any matter of the particular class, and the Authority shall comply with the order.</P>
    <P>I am quoting what the present Minister said in 1972 to draw attention to the way his thinking has changed.  He went on to say at column 2487:</P>
    <P>I would think that when the Oireachtas passed this legislation, when they gave the Minister this power, when they gave the Minister power to ban&mdash;that is the word&mdash; matter of any particular class they surely imagined that &ldquo;class&rdquo; would be rather sharply defined.  It is not sharply defined here.  Here there is a distinction which shows that the Government are not, in fact, driving at what they purport to be driving at.</P>
    <P>He said that when he was speaking <Col N="889" /> about a difficulty which arose from a directive which had issued from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs after a head-on clash between the then Authority and the then Minister and the Government which resulted in the Authority being disbanded.  The present Minister is using the same form of words in preparing the order directing the Authority to refrain from broadcasting.  That proves that up to two-and-a-half years ago the Deputy did not know what responsibility was all about.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this amendment to the Broadcasting Act I find myself hamstrung to a certain extent because of my experience in Government. From the point of view of playing politics I regret the fact that I have had experience in Government and that of necessity my approach from this side of the House has therefore to be more responsible, having had experience in various Departments.  I can well imagine the type of arguments which would develop over here were I and my colleagues introducing the amending Bill the Minister has before us.</P>
    <P>I hope I shall be able to approach these amendments to the Act in a more responsible way than the present Minister then did when he spoke of the manner in which, he claimed, the then Government were misusing their powers in this respect.  He has had a rethink.  He has operated and still continues to operate, of necessity, the power of the directive which he promised to do away with as soon as he took office.  The change he has brought about in section 31 he promises will be more definitive in relation to the matters he wants covered by the order&mdash;I hope this will prove to be outdated very soon.  He puts into the new section 17 the matter of the authority of the State being undermined.  This is a constant danger. Even when he was making his contribution in 1972 in relation to RTE, the Minister went so far as to admit that from his knowledge of the people in the communications business, and I quote from column 2485 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> There is a tendency on the part of communicators to be more radical than other members of the community. That is stressed by the fact that in television the communicators tend to be younger.</P>
    <P>He said during that discussion his experience was that there was a far greater number of radicals in the television medium than one would find in the normal course in the general news media.  At column 2486 of the same volume he said:</P>
    <P>I do not entirely know why our commentators have such a high propensity in this direction as they have. I am not saying the majority of them have it but I would guess&mdash;it is a very empirical observation&mdash;that, whereas in the population at large of such sympathies depending on the intensity with which you might hold them, there is about 5 per cent, in the media there is, say, 25 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Minister was speaking fairly and frankly on that point and I concur with his views.  It is unfortunate that one has to build into a section the necessity for the Minister to make an order when he is of the opinion that matters of a particular class would incite to crime or undermine the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>I believe that when it came down to the preparation of the amendments in this Bill the Minister genuinely found that section 31 of the Act was quite suitable for his purpose, but in view of the manner in which he had committed himself in 1972 he had to change the wording of the section and dress it up in order to convey that he was not muzzling the television medium&mdash;that he would not be as strict with them as the Fianna Fáil outfit before him had been.  As long as there is a broadcasting station there will be occasion when somebody will make a political sort of statement with which members of a Government will not be entirely happy.  I accept the Minister may have a word with the chairman of the Authority and say, &ldquo;That is pretty rough&rdquo;.  I have no doubt the Minister already has found occasion once or twice to say that.  As he said himself, the Authority being what they are and <Col N="891" /> he being what he is, that type of communication should be there, and I am satisfied it is regularly used, but I cannot see any difference in the power the Minister can operate under section 17 of the Bill and that provided in section 31 of the Act, apart from the beautiful provision that there will have to be an order laid before the Oireachtas which will become void after a certain time.  Such an order can be reviewed and there is provision for extensions.</P>
    <P>The former Government were reluctant to use section 31 and it was used only to the minimum extent.  I am sure the Minister, in regard to the power he gets through section 17, is honestly looking forward to never having to use it, but it is a necessary provision.  There was a time when he did not think it was necessary, when he thought that the freedom of the media and the responsibility of the staffs were such that there would be no need to use the provision. He has changed since he came to power.  The three lines in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, were just as effective and will be proved to have been as effective as the new section 17.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say that neither he nor the Government will use any order under section 17 for petty reasons, such as to deal with a case where somebody on the Authority has a grudge against a Government Minister, for example, because in that event the authority of the State would not be undermined and there would be no inciting to crime.  However, I have read much of the material that is on record from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and I am sure that if he were on this side of the House he would be able to explain to us how easy it would be to accuse someone of inciting to crime.  He would tell us how the appropriate bold Fianna Fáil Minister for Posts and Telegraphs could use the power being given to him under section 17 to take action against, say, the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; team if on a programme a participant should say that a stone should be thrown at the Minister for Posts and <Col N="892" /> Telegraphs.  In such circumstances would the Minister not say that there was incitement to crime?</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that for such a simple form of incitement the present Minister would take action under section 17 but in this Bill he is taking this power.  I agree that there is provision for an order to be laid before the House and debated before action is taken in regard to the Authority, but when the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs found it necessary to direct the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting some item there was a format found for having the matter debated in the House.  Therefore this grandiose section which is put in here as an amendment to section 31 (1) of the present Act makes no difference because subsection (2) of section 31 remains.  This is the section which gives the Minister the power in relation to the Authority, which this Government consider to be very necessary and I agree that it is necessary.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Second Stage the Minister devoted considerable time to explaining why the poll went against him.  It is my opinion that this survey should never have been carried out.  Different people have different ideas as to how a country should be run.  That is why there are two sides in this Parliament.  But the Minister has become so preoccupied with the question of media control and with the success that he has achieved by way of his influence on the media&mdash;press, radio and television&mdash;that he has become lulled into a situation where he thinks he can swing public opinion behind him on any issue.  Therefore it must have been very disappointing for him to realise that he had failed to bring the people with him on this occasion and that they have indicated that they are not willing to spend all their time watching imported programmes.  The Minister's ego being so deflated, it was only natural that he should have embarked on such a long dissertation by way of apologia and explanation as to how his calculations went wrong. I shall not deal with this matter to any extent other than to say that this <Col N="893" /> long explanation was given in support of the proposed removal of section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We must concern ourselves with this Bill, which is intended to amend the 1960 Act.  The dismissal of the RTE Authority in late 1973 by the Fianna Fáil Government obviously prompted the Minister to include section 2.  In this section it is provided that a member of the Authority may be removed from office for stated reasons, but only if resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas for that member's removal.</P>
    <P>I shall not say that I can think of thousands of reasons why a Minister or a Government might consider it necessary to remove a member of the RTE Authority but it is not beyond the imagination to conjure up some type of situation whereby a member of an Authority can flout Government views and can become rebellious.  If only one member is concerned it is not likely that he can exercise much influence in the over-all Authority.  But if, for instance, this year at the end of July, when the Dáil went into recess, it became extremely necessary to dismiss a member of the Authority, we would have had to wait until the beginning of November to be enabled to do that. For the Minister to tie his hands and those of the Government in this way is to renege on his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>We have a number of State-sponsored bodies.  Each Government responsibly&mdash;I use that word deliberately&mdash;appoint the members of various bodies such as the IDA, CTT and so on.  Here we have a Minister who because of recent history, as he interprets it, or because he feels a past Government made a mistake or did something discreditable, finds it necessary to introduce a section to the effect that a member of the Authority may be removed from office by the Government for stated reasons if resolutions to that effect are passed by both Houses.  This is an unqualified guarantee that no Authority will in future be interfered with in the way in which Fianna Fáil interfered with the original RTE Authority away back in November, 1972.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> May I ask the Minister if in order to score a political point he is proposing to do something here which is very unwise?  Suppose for a moment the former Government were justified in the action they took.  I cannot expect the Minister to concede that, but let us assume that the Authority were dispensed with&mdash;some very good friends of mine were on that Authority&mdash;in November, 1972, and let us assume they rebelled against the Government of the day and refused to comply with the directive issued, what would have been the situation?  If following the enactment of this legislation the same situation were to occur and the Authority decided to go ahead with the programme because they did not believe it was an incitement to crime or undermined the authority of the State, what would be the situation? Things could be very very awkward. All the members of the Authority would have to be removed from office and that could only be done by tabling a resolution and that resolution would have to be passed by both Houses.  It is very wrong for the Minister and the Government to tie themselves by that section and debar themselves from exercising a right which they as a Government and the Minister as a Minister should have. To gain some political kudos the Minister is here divesting himself and the Government of power.  Things have a habit of happening very peculiarly and the Minister could find himself hamstrung or a succeeding Minister could find himself hamstrung.</P>
    <P>I must of necessity go back to the events of 1972. The Authority did not reply to the directive saying: &ldquo;To blazes with you.  We will carry on.&rdquo; The present Authority is constituted of very honourable men and nobody could visualise anything like that happening, but it is possible it could happen. It may be stretching imagination too far to suggest that some communicators or some members of the Authority the Government might wish to get rid of could force a situation in which opposition to the Government moye might throw up rebels on the Government side thereby bringing down the Government.  That is not beyond the <Col N="895" /> bounds of possibility.  The Minister may smile but sub-post offices brought general elections on the heads of two Governments.  Section 2 of this Bill has in it the makings of a general election.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 3 which deals with impartiality.  The old section 18 (1) stated:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes out of his way to say the same thing in three, four or five different ways.  I do not see the necessity for that except to introduce change for the sake of change.</P>
    <P>Dealing with section 3 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It gives statutory backing to the present practice whereby the impartiality requirement is considered to be fulfilled if all significant views are aired in two or more related programmes if these are broadcast over a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>This came up in the context of a &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme on the North of Ireland some time ago.  If under the existing Act, the balance of the significant views is aired in two or more related programmes, why is there a necessity to give it statutory backing in view of the fact that the existing arrangement apparently seems to have statutory backing under the old section 18 (1)?</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It provides for a relaxation of the prohibition on expression of its own views by the Authority in the case of broadcasts relating to proposals regarding broadcasting which are the subject of public controversy or public debate and which are being considered by the Government or the Minister.</P>
    <P>That is already allowed obviously. Recently, without this amending Bill, <Col N="896" /> spokesmen on behalf of the Authority were traipsing around the country and putting on programmes justifying their stand.  Under the existing Act they were not allowed to do that but perhaps the Minister allowed them to do it as a concession and told them he would not hold them in contempt of the Act.  This was in relation to the RTE 2 <i>versus</i> BBC 1 controversy. Apparently that was allowed under the existing Act.  If not, it would appear that the Minister condoned a breach of the Act by RTE.  He said the new provision is intended to replace the directive issued by his predecessor under section 31 (1) of the 1960 Act as well as that section itself.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposals in subsections (1A) and (1B).  Subsection (1A) prevents them from putting on programmes which incite to crime or tend to undermine the authority of the State.  I am fully in agreement with subsection (1B) which spells out that the Authority shall not unreasonably encroach on the privacy of an individual.  I welcome that because there were occasions down through the years when the privacy of the individual was encroached upon.  It will be difficult for the Authority to enforce this subsection.  I imagine a number of complaints will reach the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to deal with the setting up of the broadcasting complaints commission.  Perhaps the Minister can quote precedents in other Bills, but I feel it is rather extraordinary that he should build into the Bill a provision that the commission shall consist of a chairman and not less than two other members who shall be appointed by the Government.  The Minister did not go out of his way in his introductory speech to give us any idea of how many members of the commission he contemplates appointing. This is a pretty vague section.  It tells us that the payments to the commission will be decided by the Government. There is a limit of their tenure of office.  It is rather remarkable that it does not set an upper limit.</P>
    <P>This is the creation of a new State body.  There is a limit to the membership <Col N="897" /> of the RTE Authority.  The Minister is creating a problem for himself by not setting an upper limit to the membership of the broadcasting complaints commission.  I have observed the conduct of the Government and the pressures by people who want to be fixed up from PCs upwards, and people who are supporters, new found or old found.  They cannot all be taken in as economic advisers, private secretaries and experts in this, that or the other.  They cannot all be embraced into the civil service.  Now another body is being created.  We are not told what the remuneration is to be.  That has to fixed, and that is understandable.</P>
    <P>We are having a complaints commission of not less than three people and we could finish up with one of one hundred people on the basis that: well, we have to get the views of the people from Kerry, Waterford and, naturally enough, from west Mayo. We shall get their views in sufficient time.  This means we will have the secretaries of the local Labour branches vying with those of the local Fine Gael branches for appointment to this commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Chair, I can deal with it on Committee Stage.  Half of the Minister's speech was devoted to a referendum which had nothing whatever to do with the Bill, a gallup poll.  I am actually speaking about the Bill.  I have departed from the market and survey gallup poll, of which there is not a word in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect the ruling of the Chair although I felt I was in order because I was speaking about the Bill.  We had an indication from the Minister during his speech that he proposes to withdraw section 6 on Committee Stage.  Arising therefrom it would be in order for me to suggest that he introduce an amendment to section 4 setting a ceiling. I would even go so far as to suggest that it would ease the Minister's problems in due course, be the ceiling six, eight, ten, 12 or whatever number he wishes.  Further on there is reference to the fact that the quorum would be two.  The Minister is thinking in terms of a small group but, human nature being what it is, opportunities like that can be abused. Even though that section covers two-and-a-half pages of the Bill I shall not dwell on it.</P>
      <P>Of necessity I must refer to the elaboration by the Minister on section 14 where he is amending the original section 17.  It would appear that we change for change's sake in this Bill.  The original section 17 was adequate, it conveyed the message. I am inclined to claim that the Minister, in changing the format of this section, was having the traditional Coalition attack on what he would describe as Fianna Fáil's lip service to the Irish language.  The Minister, dealing with this section, went out of his way to say that it was an effort to guard against our being too inward looking.  The only conclusion I can come to in that respect is that the old section 17 was responsible for our people becoming too inward looking, which I find a little hard to swallow.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the Bill provides for retention of power by the Minister to issue a direction in regard to one particular area of broadcasting.  This is dealt with in section 17 of the Bill which provides that the Minister may issue a direction, <Col N="899" /> by statutory order, to RTE to refrain from broadcasting a particular matter or matter of a particular class....</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with that.  The Minister has changed that for change's sake and has worked himself into a very wrong situation.  I am somewhat inhibited by the ruling of the Chair because I had notes here in relation to section 15, on which perhaps I might be permitted to say a few words. The Minister referred to various sections, which I think is quite in order on a Second Stage debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>All the Chair is saying is that the normal procedure on Second Reading is to deal with the principle of the Bill and then on Committee Stage it is dealt with in detail.  Otherwise, there would be duplication of debate.  That is all the Chair is conveying to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>But section 15 deals with the question of advertising time on television on which I am sure I can say a few words.  The Minister proposes to change the advertising times.  In this Bill he proposes to say that he can fix a maximum and minimum number of hours for advertising. I presume the object of that is to give more flexibility to the Authority.  At present my understanding is that there is a limit to the amount of time per hour that the Authority can fix.  I gather that the arrangement at present is that the periods fixed by the Authority for broadcasting&mdash;this is not in relation to advertising&mdash;shall be subject to the approval of the Minister. That situation is being changed and the Minister proposes to let the Authority fix them.  The Minister proposes the maximum and minimum hours and the Bill provides:</P>
      <P>The total daily times for broadcasting advertisements fixed by the Authority and the maximum period so fixed to be given to advertisements in any hour shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a new proposal and it is too restrictive and will prove far more difficult than the existing arrangement. <Col N="900" /> I hope the Minister will endeavour to give the reasons, particularly in relation to advertising time, for introducing a more restrictive provision. The existing arrangement is that the Authority, with the approval of the Minister, fix the total daily time for broadcasting.  The programmes are broadcast from, say, 4 o'clock until 11.30 p.m. or 12 o'clock.  Now that it is proposed to introduce a second RTE channel, I presume that eventually we will have advertisements on both channels. I gather that even now RTE are having difficulty in attracting advertisements, and this is no time for the Minister to become more strict.  There was an arrangement that the Authority would have consultations with the Minister, and my understanding is that the Minister might have one view and the Authority might have another but they could arrive at a consensus of opinion.  I would like to know why the Minister finds it necessary to take this power at present.  In general it is accepted that the rough part of this debate went with the promise of withdrawal of section 6, but there is quite a deal of power which the Minister is taking on to himself and peculiarly enough power that he has given away, to which I have referred.  I am satisfied that I would not be able to influence him to drop the proposal in section 2.  If I felt I could, I would spend more time on it because this is one of the responsibilities he has as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is a responsibility he should hold on to, and I think he is passing the buck.</P>
    <P>In the existing situation a person who goes out of line can be removed from the Authority by the Minister. Under the new proposals of the Minister he cannot sack that person without coming into this House and, for stated reasons, making an order calling for his removal, and that order must be passed in this House.  That is a person who was selected by a Government to take a place on the RTE Authority, was looked upon as being responsible enough to occupy that position.  He blots his copybook, but unfortunately he cannot be removed by the previous practice of <Col N="901" /> writing a letter and informing him of his dismissal.  We had a debate previously on the manner in which some members had been dispensed with without an expression of gratitude for the services they had given over the years.  Actually the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was critical of the form of dismissal adopted.  That is fair comment, but here the Minister is depriving himself of that right.  Now the Minister must come into this House and make a public show of that member of the Authority who, three or four years previously, had been selected because of particular qualifications in one field or another.</P>
    <P>If such a situation is unlikely, if the Minister cannot think that that could arise, then there is no point in having provision for it.  If I were not a Member of this House and were to be asked to become a member of the Industrial Development Authority I would graciously accept and take up the appointment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce could discover in two or three years' time that I was not suitable for the job or that I had committed a misdemeanour which would make it improper to keep me there.  He has simply to send me a letter telling me that on 31st July next my year of office will be up and he is proposing to replace me, &ldquo;thanks very much and goodbye&rdquo;. That is all right.  I am out but I am not going out in disgrace even if I committed an offence which hit the public headlines.  However, if I am a member of the RTE Authority and if the Minister wants to dismiss me, I presume I could get a telephone call from the private secretary to the Minister saying: &ldquo;Mr. Lalor, would you drop up to see the Minister this afternoon at 4 o'clock?&rdquo; I would then call in to the Minister and he would say: &ldquo;I am giving you a chance to get out.  Would you care to give me your resignation because, if not, I will have to put the matter on the table of the House and then I will have to state publicly why I have to get rid of you.&rdquo; That is only one member of the Authority.</P>
    <P>The reason he is bringing this in here is understandable.  He wants to <Col N="902" /> show how wrong Fianna Fáil were in the manner they dispensed with members of the Authority and he is justifying the speeches he made at that time criticising the Fianna Fáil Government for doing that.  He is deciding that if he wishes to dispense with a member of the RTE Authority he will ensure that, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, he will not do it but come into the House and ask the House to do the work for him.  That is not right.  The man who is Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for the time being should accept the responsibility of his seal of office just the same as Deputy Gerry Collins did when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when he did what was very unpleasant to him.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is getting the House to do the dirty job and publicly disgrace the man whom he saw fit to appoint to the Authority in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the Exchequer and Local Financial Years Act, 1974 it was decided that RTE's financial year, which formerly ended on 31st March, should in future end on 30th September.</P>
    <P>Why was that decision taken?  The Government are finishing their financial affairs at the end of the calendar year.  We had a situation where RTE, like all other bodies, finished the financial year on 31st March.  As far as I know, the fiscal year and the calendar year are the same for all other State bodies but RTE will now finish their financial year on 30th September. In the case of local authorities we had a nine months year the first time the financial year ended on 31st December.  Why have we got a six months year as far as RTE are concerned? Is it an effort to keep them from showing a £750,000 deficit rather than one of £500,000?</P>
    <P>Some time ago we read in the newspapers that the Director-General of RTE at one of the monthly meetings of the top brass at Montrose, having discovered that RTE were going further down the hill financially, told the lads to do less think-tanking and go <Col N="903" /> ahead with the job.  The comment in the papers was: &ldquo;Good man Director-General.&rdquo; RTE, like many other State bodies, have become top heavy with too many top men and not enough workers.  During the course of the survey campaign the trade union element came down heavily on RTE so I can quite imagine the amount of think tank that went into the survey. The man-in-the-street constantly tells us in relation to any of the State bodies such as the ESB, CIE and even RTE, although they have had no redundancy there yet: &ldquo;You never see any thinning out at the top.  It is always the lads on the ground floor who suffer from redundancy problems.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During the last 15 years RTE have been expansion-minded.  I was quite interested in an RTE programme the other night when the chairman of the Authority was interviewed and the interviewer <Col N="904" /> referred to figures quoted by the Minister.  I read on the paper the next day that the chairman said at that interview that that was not quite accurate.  It is the responsibility of the Authority to make sure that the work is done.  There is no comparision between RTE and a business institution and knowing who is working and who is not.  The ordinary man-in-the-street thinks that Gay Byrne is the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; but at the end of the programme one sees the various people listed who do the camera work, the research work and all the other jobs. It is beginning to appear in relation to the home-produced programmes that there is a lot of: &ldquo;You rub me and I will rub you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 5th November, 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of drug treatment centres in each health board area; the number of patients treated for drug <Col N="791" /> abuse and addiction for each year from 1965-66 to the latest available date; and if he will list those drugs most commonly abused in Irish society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>A national residential drug treatment centre has recently been opened at Jervis Street Hospital, Dublin, to cater for young drug casualties.  A national advisory centre also operates at this hospital.  The Eastern Health Board provide residential services in a unit at the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, for drug abusers who cannot be treated in an open unit.  While there are not special treatment centres in other areas persons suffering from addiction are treated within the ambit of the general psychiatric services both on an in-patient and out-patient basis at the psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>In regard to the numbers of patients treated for drug abuse and addiction there is an arrangement under which cases of addiction coming to the notice of the services already mentioned are recorded.  The numbers of new cases notified for the years 1970 to date are as follows: 1970, 159: 1971, 268: 1972, 252; 1973, 160; 1974, 130; 1975 (to end September), 84.</P>
      <P>I regret that this information is not available for the years 1965 to 1969.</P>
      <P>Apart from alcohol the recent records show that the drugs most commonly abused in this country are barbiturates, cannabis, heroin and morphine.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of international drug symposia at which his Department were represented since 1965; and the number and names of the countries with which his Department conferred prior to the drafting of the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1973.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is presumed that the question relates to international symposia, meetings and so on, on various aspects of drug abuse in the context of the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  Since 1969 the Department have been represented at 25 such meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> The phenomenon of drug abuse in western Europe began to manifest itself as a serious problem in the late 'sixties and hence there were no international symposia or conferences dealing specially with the problem in that context held prior to 1969. The Department of course maintained the closest contact with international organisations concerned with the control of illicit traffic in drugs.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the question the main provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Bill are based on experience of the working of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934 and later controls for the prevention of drug abuse and illicit traffic.  The Bill takes account of the recommendations and conclusions of various expert bodies both here and abroad on various aspects of the problem and is designed to enable this country to conform to and ratify the UN international conventions on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the Bill did not involve any direct consultation with the Governments of other countries although certain aspects of it were the subject of informal contact between officers of the Department and of the United Kingdom Home Office.</P>

      <P>All proven natural gas resources, consisting of the Kinsale Head field, have been allocated to the Electricity Supply Board, Nitrigin Éireann Teo. and Cork Gas Company. In the event of further finds of gas in commercial quantities consideration will be given to the various possible uses of the gas before decisions are taken on its utilisation.  The distribution of the gas through a pipeline grid systems is one of the possibilities which must be examined.</P>
      <P>The feasibility of providing a national or regional grid would depend on a number of factors including the location of the gas field, the quantity of gas in the field, the technical and cost factors involved as well as considerations related to national energy policy.</P>
      <P>Because the factors mentioned would have a significant bearing on the conclusions of any feasibility study, the most appropriate time for a specific and detailed study would be when further finds have been confirmed.  In the meantime, many of the general considerations arising can and will be under examination.
