    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy G. Collins).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which we discussed this Bill I spent an hour attempting to discuss the Bill as rationally as possible but, because of the continual interruptions from the Government benches, the Members of which seemed anxious to prevent the Opposition giving their reasons in a rational and articulate fashion, I did not really have the opportunity of setting out the main burden of my argument.  It appears from the official record that during the hour I spent on my feet I had a clear run for 50 per cent of the time. This, I think, raises the question of the rights of Deputies to be permitted to articulate their point of view without interruption.  The main culprit on that occasion was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that occasion the main burden of my argument was the motivation of the Opposition in opposing this measure and the grounds on which they were opposing it.  The constitutional question was ably dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition with a complete breakdown of the arguments put forward by Government speakers on its alleged constitutionality.  A member of this side of the House will today deal specifically with the constitutional arguments put forward by the <Col N="1205" /> Attorney General and it will, I believe, be quite clear when that point of view has been expounded that there is an unanswerable case to have this Bill sent elsewhere before it becomes law.  Another reason for opposition to the Bill was its operability on practical grounds, the difficulty of securing the attendance of witnesses, the whole concept of the infringement of natural justice&mdash;witnesses being heard in their own cause.  This principle is fundamental to the code of criminal law but this Bill rides roughshod over the ingredient contained in the concept of natural justice.</P>
    <P>On the last day, in spite of the interruptions by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, I endeavoured to set out that the Bill contained in many respect a complete denial of the rights protected under the European Convention on Human Rights to which we are a party.  I set out many instances in the various sections where these rights were given scant attention.  I realise when the institutions of a State are under seige by elements who if they were in power would not exercise justice good, bad or indifferent that certain draconian measures may have to be taken but, nevertheless, we must conform to international law and the tenets of acceptability of nations adhering to the democratic process.  It appears that the Government are swinging so far to the right that they will fall off the democratic spectrum.</P>
    <P>This Bill introduces for the first time a concept which prejudices the proper trial of an individual.  We realise that an individual may be charged with shooting somebody, robbery with violence committed in the name of his country but in spite of the fact that that individual might deny us rights if he was in power we have a duty to ensure that he receives a fair trial.  This Bill engages in a form of prejudgment which is wrong philosophically in any democracy. It is a complete denial of the rights protected by the standards of the democratic institutions under which we operate: it is a denial of the concepts of the law of crime under which we operate, the criminal law code; it flies directly in the face of <Col N="1206" /> those.  It is also contrary to the Europan Convention on Human Rights. On the last occasion I put forward an unanswerable case that the European Convention on Human Rights had been abrogated, abused and undermined. If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach has not already contributed, I have no doubt that he, or somebody on behalf of his Government, will answer my arguments.</P>
    <P>The Bill maintains two separate jurisdictions and is, therefore, a continuation and recognition of the division of our country.  That is an unanswerable statement.  We have proposed the creation of an all-Ireland court which would establish one jurisdiction for the trial of offences coming within its terms of reference.  The reasons for this proposal were clearly set out by our spokesmen.  The Bill proposes to recognise the real cause of what is going on at present, Partition, and as long as Partition prevails on this island there will always be uncertainty, unease, mistrust and the horrendous situation which prevails in the North, and sometimes transfers itself down here, would arise from time to time.  I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if the Judiciary were consulted during the drafting of this Bill.  Do the Judiciary realise the implications to them in this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very improper to consult the Judiciary during the drafting of a Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree that it would have been improper to consult the Judiciary during the preparation of a Bill.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that the Bill compromises the court system as we know it here, a system which has operated well and has been discharged with integrity and honour by the judges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must refer his remarks through the Chair rather than direct to any Member. I have already indicated that we <Col N="1207" /> should proceed by debate and not by way of question and answer across the floor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will direct myself towards the Chair.  I should like to know if the Judiciary were consulted. Do they realise that this Bill compromises the system which has worked well over the last 55 years, since the foundation of the State, in this truncated country of ours?</P>
      <P>I do not think there will be any question that the system here has worked well and that the judges have operated it and have functioned exceptionally well.  That raises the question about the operation of the system up there during a like number of years, and that is what this Bill asks us to do&mdash;to associate the Judiciary down here with the courts system which has operated unchallenged up there.</P>
      <P>Then we come to the security forces, and we have to raise further questions.  The only way you would get acceptance of the security forces would be under the aegis of an all-Ireland court.  As things stand, a serious question hangs over the security forces in the North of the country. Here, again, what we are being asked to do is for the Garda Síochána, which has operated well in the interests of this nation, this part of the country, in an impartial manner, a force which has enjoyed and is enjoying the confidence of the people, to associate themselves with a security force which has been rejected by a large minority of the people living in that part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána have not been asked for their views on this Bill.  That they were not consulted in the context of the Judiciary is wrong.  Were they given any chance to articulate what they would like to see in the Bill, any opportunity to express a view on the main headings of the Bill?  It seems totally reasonable, despite what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, that this should have happened.  This Government are engaged in prosecuting Britain in Strasbourg over the treatment of prisoners in the North in <Col N="1208" /> recent years.  Are we then to take it that the Government are satisfied that by virtue of the introduction of this Bill that that situation has come to an end?  If they are so satisfied, have they said so and if they have not said so will they say so?  It now appears that the prosecution instituted by the previous Government against Britain will be continued in Strasbourg.  According to what one can glean from the media, the case has gone against Britain.  I am taking this from what I read in the newspapers.  I may be totally wrong, I may be doing a disservice, but one can only ask on the basis of the information available to us if the case has gone against Britain.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances, are the Irish Government satisfied that the reasons for the bringing of that case in the first instance have now disappeared, that they no longer exist, that a situation exists in the 6-county area which did not exist before the case was brought?  Why, if the Government do not come out and say that all this brutality has ended do they try to justify the production of this Bill?  We do not see this justification.</P>
    <P>There is another argument, put up by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whose whole reason for being in politics, we have been told, is to see the end of Fianna Fáil.  That presupposes that what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wants is a one-party State with himself on top of the sordid little pile.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will not have that.  One of the great reasons for the existence of Fianna Fáil may be the fact that&mdash;I will not say it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Tell us privately some other time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will write to the Parliamentary Secretary about it.  During the course of the debate the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has attempted in some way to associate opposition to this Bill with the men of violence.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  On a previous occasion I set down during an argument which is on the records of the House a number of examples of Fianna Fáil policy over the years: a statement by <Col N="1209" /> the late great Éamon de Valera quite clearly rejecting, as far back as 1921, the use of force; a statement by the late great Seán Lemass and by the present Leader of the Opposition, the then Taoiseach, at the Garden of Remembrance&mdash;a continuous statement of Fianna Fáil's attitude to violence irrefutably set down in black and white&mdash;and it is most unfair and wrong of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and others to associate opposition to this Bill and those who express it with the men of violence. We reject the men of violence who have been committing crimes in the name of this country which would make any decent civilisation ashamed. They are the actions of barbarians. We reject them, we will continue to reject them and as often as O'Brien and his clique make these allegations we will reply to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien&mdash;as long as he insists that one of the main reasons for his being in politics is to see the end of Fianna Fáil, as long as he makes that kind of statement we will resist, reject and fight against it; and as long as he makes the statement that those who have been articulating opposition to this Bill are associating with men of violence we will equally fight that all the way.  Our record in Government has been well proved and founded as far as the security of this country is concerned, and it is well to remind Deputy O'Brien that in 1972, when he was wearing his liberal habit which has become a bad habit as far as he is concerned, he ran for cover when the bombs went off in this city that evening, and when he and Cluskey and Desmond were condemning Fianna Fáil for introducing the Offences Against the State Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Cluskey, and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney. I thank the Chair for having interrupted me because it reminded me of one of the most important men in the litany of liberals who stood up and condemned Fianna Fáil.  Also, I believe that during the course of that debate somebody suggested that they would repeal the Act as introduced in 1972.  There is not a whimper or a whisper from them.</P>
      <P>I do not intend pursuing this matter. As I say, I have spoken at considerable length on the previous occasion. I thank the House for its attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate here has been characterised by a good deal of defensiveness on the part of the Opposition and the defensiveness was expressed or came to light even in the last contribution of Deputy Andrews when he said, not only this morning but also the other evening when he began, and said with great vehemence and, indeed, even passion, how much he was against the men of violence and how wrong it was for anyone to attribute to his party in their resistance to the Bill any sneaking sympathy with the men of violence. I want to say at the beginning of my speech this morning&mdash;I hope it will not sound sanctimonious&mdash;that I have no doubt whatever about the sincerity of Deputy Andrews personally in this matter and when he describes the murders that have disgraced us as he so eloquently did a few minutes ago as barbarous and the people who commit them as barbarians, I completely accept that he means what he says and I believe the same to be true of the better part of his party and much the biggest part of his party.  I do not think that they have any conscious sympathy with the men of violence and I do not think that their opposition to the Bill arises from an anxiety to allow the men of violence to run riot in the country <Col N="1211" /> and I want to make that clear at the outset.</P>
      <P>I also want&mdash;and I will be giving reasons for this as I go along&mdash;to cast doubt on the sincerity of the arguments which they have raised against the Bill and in particular I wish to complain about the way in which they have told the public that this Bill is in some ways unprecedented, that in some ways it reduces civil liberty, that in some ways it is a radical inroad on fundamental freedoms, on constitutional rights and that the people in some way should take fright when they see it before this House.</P>
      <P>The fact is that jurisdiction of the kind which this Bill aims to create is not a new thing in the world.  It has existed in other countries at other times and even in this country for specific purposes and it could be said that these purposes fall broadly into two categories.  Extra-territorial jurisdiction of the kind here being created has existed for a very long time all over the civilised world in connection with certain offences which by their very character tended not to be committed on the territory of a particular State or if they were so committed tended to be associated with travel and distance and could not be effectively punished if the strict territorial principle of criminal law were applied.</P>
      <P>The simplest and oldest example of that is piracy but the Deputies in this House and the Senators in the Seanad as recently as early this year added another one to the list in the shape of hijacking of aircraft.  That is another offence which by its nature resists the application of the strictly territorial principle or, if that principle is applied to it, frustrates the common desire of civilised people to put down this particular offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, there are offences, and I am sorry to say they are there&mdash;it may be that they are growing in number or it may be that the civilised world is getting better organised in dealing with them&mdash;but there are offences which because of their gruesomeness and because of the impossibility for any rational or civilised <Col N="1212" /> person to stand over them or to defend them, must be opposed by the united force of mankind, and must call for a jurisdiction to be exercised against them which transcends the traditional boundaries of a State.  An example of that to which we ourselves gave effect as recently as late 1973 is genocide, when we in this House and in the other House of the Oireachtas gave genocide an extra-territorial character here.  I cannot recall offhand the exact definition of it but it is presumably the offence of trying to exterminate an entire race because it is a particular race rather than a collection of individuals.  That offence is now given an extra-territorial character here.</P>
    <P>I can recall that in the months in the second half of the year 1973 the business of this House came in starts and spurts.  Some weeks we had very little business; some weeks we had a lot; but there were weeks, I admit freely, as I admitted then, when we did not have a great deal of tough legislation of the kind of which we have had so very much this year and last year; and we were getting complaints from the Opposition then that the time of the House was being taken up with unnecessarily protracted Estimate debates interspersed occasionally with very minor measures and I distinctly recall the Bill on the genocide convention being so described by the Opposition.  It contained some of the very features which are complained about in this Bill before us.  It passed through this House after a very small debate and the Opposition who, naturally, should be alert for any lack of constitutional right in a Bill, as they say they are in this instance, did not raise any argument along those lines.  In fact, the Bill, as far as I can recall, was not only unopposed but welcomed on the other side.  No argument of the kind that is being raised here was even mentioned.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that several of the kinds of terrorism that we are seeing in the last weeks, months, years are appropriate for inclusion in the category of which genocide is the first conspicuous member.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> I think all murder is wrong, naturally, and I think all cruelty is wrong.  I can see some kind of distinction between a man who commits a crime which is directly personally aimed at someone whom he considers to be incapable of political elimination in any other way&mdash;it remains a crime, it remains a horror and a murder and so forth; but, even though it is not easy to articulate, I believe most citizens would agree about this: there is a distinction, however it be expressed, between that kind of crime and a crime of a much deeper and blacker kind, which is the crime of indiscriminately inflicting cruelty, indiscriminately subjecting to savagery innocent people merely to make a political point or merely to work on the soft hearts of everybody else so that they will acquiesce in some course of action which otherwise they would have resisted, out of pity for the innocent people who have been deliberately involved.  I do not think there can be a blacker crime than that, whether it be taking hostages or exploding bombs in crowded restaurants or anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Irish are by no means the only people in the world doing it today. Unfortunately, it has become a widespread thing.  Civilised mankind will have to stand shoulder to shoulder in resisting this movement and it will be no good, and nobody will want to hear anyone talking about arguments based on national sovereignty or the traditional doctrines of territorial jurisdiction and so forth.  That is no use to the society which is being victimised by this kind of activity.</P>
    <P>As I have tried to make plain, I do not draw a very clear distinction between different kinds of terrorism, but the sort of terrorism which has come very much to the fore in Ireland in recent years, involving innocent people, is a particularly black form. It absolutely requires the co-operation of civilised people, irrespective of their political aspirations, their religion, their origins, social background or anything else like that, on the lowest common denominator of the common humanity they share with one another to defend innocence, to stand up to <Col N="1214" /> and finally to crush&mdash;I am sorry to use those words in regard to what, after all, are human beings&mdash;the kind of savagery which has disgraced us and other countries aside from us.</P>
    <P>Jurisdiction, such as this Bill is creating, may not be in every line or paragraph a model of what ought to be sought in the civilised world generally but it is not a bad start.  I hope we shall all live to see an extension of this kind of jurisdiction throughout all European countries, in all similar democracies and in which it will be possible for politicians arguing the case for reciprocal measures in their own countries to point to the Irish experience.</P>
    <P>This system of an extended extra-territorial function of our courts seems to the Government, as it seems to the Law Commission and to me, the best alternative which is practically in front of us.  The point of view of the Opposition, apart from their criticisms&mdash;which I accept are seriously intended&mdash;of the particular shape the Bill has taken, is really a rather feeble one, namely, that they want an all-Ireland court.  We would all like an all-Ireland court, an all-Ireland State and we would all like an all-Ireland Parliament but we just cannot have them at present.  For an Opposition to take this line and simply say: &ldquo;If you want to put down terrorism or savagery, you must go back to the beginning and do away with Partition&rdquo; is not a reasonable way to behave in this year.  Perhaps it would not have been reasonable ever but certainly it is not reasonable now. Everybody on the Opposition benches knows&mdash;whether he cares is another matter&mdash;that that kind of talk puts back the day when this country will be united, because the obstacle to ending Partition is the determination of a million Ulster Unionists that it should not end.  It is the only obstacle. All the talk about British interference, British malice, British crookedness and so on may be perfectly true&mdash; there may be occasions on which the British have deserved these epithets&mdash; but they are not the obstacle to the ending of Partition.</P>
    <P>The obstacle is the absolute determination of a million Irishmen that <Col N="1215" /> it should not end, and their willingness to fight to make sure it does not end.</P>
    <P>I measure all talk in this area against a simple criterion.  How is it going to fall on the ears of those million people whose hearts have to be changed if the Border in this country is ever to go?  I consider that if they would not touch us with a barge pole before, they would not touch us with an even longer one now if they found we were to adopt the attitude being wished on us by the Opposition which boils down to this: unless you do away with your Border we will not do anything about putting down savagery.  I hope that is not too unfair a gloss on what is the Opposition viewpoint but that is what it will sound like to the average Ulster Unionist.  He will say to himself: &ldquo;If I understand the Fianna Fáil attitude correctly it is this.  They disapprove of savagery; they are very free with condemnation in words of what is going on; they are very willing to describe the murderers as barbarians and so on but, unless I forfeit a constitutional position, which rightly or wrongly I have grown up to expect to be my own and look on as legitimate, they are not going to do what common justice and humanity requires them to do, namely, to put down savagery and barbarism in their own territory so far as they can do it, and that includes arresting and dealing with people who have committed savageries on my territory and have escaped over the Border or are in hiding there.&rdquo;  I realise I have, perhaps, stated the Fianna Fáil position over-vehemently.  I know there are people on the other side who have the best of intentions about the North.  I make that concession in regard to the Leader of Fianna Fáil and in regard to their North of Ireland spokesman, Deputy Brugha, very willingly.  But I cannot see how their attitude in regard to being willing to settle for an all-Ireland court and nothing else can be interpreted in the North of Ireland, against the background of what this Government are trying to do in concrete terms, otherwise than as I have suggested.  That is one way of looking <Col N="1216" /> at it&mdash;the fact that they are shouting for something they cannot have and, apparently, they are unwilling to do even what can be done until they get it.</P>
    <P>There is the other point on which we might be faulted for not having sufficiently emphasised ourselves.  It may be that this Government are frequently accused of being a government of salesmen and television personalities who are great at putting a story across but not so great at delivering goods.  That is a line the Opposition are very free with and I am prepared to admit that on this occasion we have not really lived up to this reputation wished on us by the Opposition because I do not think we have sold this Bill for what it really is.  I deliberately say&mdash;and I hope it will not be taken as provocative towards people in the North who disagree with me, who are Unionists instead of Nationalists&mdash;this Bill tears the biggest breach in the Border in 50 years.  This Bill, as I see it, is the largest practicable step towards an all-Ireland policy that has been taken in 53 years.  This Bill provides the substance, the essence, the guts of an all-Ireland court even though I will not pretend it has the form of an all-Ireland court.  I admit that in many by no means trivial particulars it falls short of the advantages which a formal all-Ireland court would provide. I admit that freely.  But I ask Deputies and those who attend to the proceedings of this House to consider that there are several features in the institutions which this Bill proposes which are indistinguishable in their guts from an all-Ireland court.  The main such feature is this, that a very large range of offences&mdash;essentially the offences which have been associated with the troubles here over the last six years&mdash;will be triable anywhere in Ireland by Irish judges. Anyone who says that is not a breach torn in the Border is not talking the same language as I am.  I will say no more than that about it.</P>
    <P>If the draftsmen were not to get into inextricable tangles, there must be a certain degree of looseness in trying to recognise as an offence a <Col N="1217" /> set of facts which is, perhaps, differently defined in the criminal code of the other jurisdiction.  But still, these offences will add up to what is, in effect, an all-Ireland criminal code.</P>
    <P>Last, but not least, to some extent &mdash;because of the rights reciprocally conferred&mdash;there will be a merging of the Irish legal professions.  Perhaps it is least.  I admit it certainly comes behind the other two matters I have mentioned in importance and a long way behind.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be differences of procedure and differences of jurisprudence as between the courts here and those in the North of Ireland. But anyone who dispassionately looks at what this Bill sets out to do must see it as something beside which the co-operation in electricity, fisheries and in a small number of other matters of which we have been very glad in the past pale into relative insignificance.</P>
    <P>This is something which really bites, which breaks the old moulds that Deputy Lynch talked about.  I laughed at him at the time but I suppose I have become more understanding of him since then.  He was talking of breaking old moulds back in 1971 when he was making efforts to reconcile the Northern majority with the Northern minority, with the Southern majority and the fault I had to find with him was that he had done no ground work, that he was attempting this while decades had passed with nothing concrete being done to remove the suspicions and doubts which make people hate each other.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch was attempting something which was perhaps even positively dangerous without that groundwork having been done, but I recognise that he meant very well.  He was talking about breaking old moulds. The message which came through to me was that we would all have to readjust our perspectives.  There could be no question of each side any longer saying &ldquo;What I have got in symbolism, philosophies and so on is non-negotiable. What I have got even in territory <Col N="1218" /> or institution is non-negotiable&rdquo;.  These are the old moulds.  I understood Deputy Lynch to be trying to persuade people and make them see that there could never be peace, let alone unity, in this country, as long as the old moulds were rigorously and inflexibly held on to.</P>
    <P>I consider that this Bill breaks a very substantial old mould.  I regret that just because Deputy Lynch has changed sides in this House he should find it impossible to recognise that.  I believe that in his heart he sees the point I am trying to make and I am sorry because he leads that party and is on that side of the House that he is unable or unwilling to acknowledge that fact.</P>
    <P>I cannot pass from the practical approximation of this Bill to the central features of an all-Ireland court without expressing regret that it should be in this sad and tragic area that that first step should be taken.  It is a sad and horrible reflection on us that it should be in the area of the enforcement of criminal law against horrible offences, which nobody in this country would have thought possible ten years ago, that this big step towards Irishmen behaving like brothers with one another is being taken.  I would far sooner it had been taken in another sphere and in another way.  I would far sooner see a peaceful Council of Ireland working on electricity, fisheries, bogs, drainage and other matters of common concern.  I appeal to Deputies on the other side and to those who watch the proceedings of this House to consider this Bill under this aspect.</P>
    <P>I want to hold up for a moment the Opposition point of view to the all-Ireland court and to look coldly at their argument that it would be preferable to what is now proposed.  I am afraid the Opposition, as a party, easily fall into the habit of getting a slogan or tag and waving it around without really looking at it but taking it because it has a nice sound.  An all-Ireland court is not too far from an all-Ireland final.  It has a homely ring about it and on the surface does not seem to require much detailed examination.</P>
    <P>An all-Ireland court of the kind <Col N="1219" /> envisaged by the Law Commission, although I agree it would be in form and some matters of detail different from what is now proposed, would not do away with the formal Border nor with the formal existence of two different police forces.  The very argument which we have heard so much about in the last few days&mdash;the undesirability and difficulty of getting accused persons to consent to travel across the Border into a different jurisdiction&mdash;would exist in an all-Ireland court.  If not, I would like to be told why not.  The all-Ireland court proposal, I agree, in its original form was part of a package which included an all-Ireland police authority.  A great number of the other parts of the Sunningdale package had gone by the board and it was in theory open, as the Law Enforcement Commission said, to have an all-Ireland court even without an all-Ireland police authority.  Had there been such a thing alleged offenders and witnesses would still be crossing a border and they would still be in the physical power, and in the case of the accused person, in the custody of a police force from which the Opposition tell us, and I am sure it may be true in many cases, they would still have a great deal to fear.  That would still be true.  An all-Ireland court would have an element of its judges drawn from a section of the population which might be instinctively hostile to the accused.</P>
    <P>The all-Ireland court, while an attractive idea, does not really do away with the difficulty which has been mentioned here, namely, that accused persons and witnesses once they find themselves in one jurisdiction will refuse to cross back into the other.  I cannot see how the Fianna Fáil suggestion, practical though it is, could have done away with that difficulty or how that difficulty would be less present if their suggestion were put into effect than the difficulty which to some extent exists under the measure now proposed.</P>
    <P>I have not listened to all this debate but I have listened to a good deal of it and read the contributions from the Opposition.  I do not think the <Col N="1220" /> revolutionary nature of this Bill&mdash;in a good sense from our point of view&mdash; has been sufficiently adverted to.  By a curious accident, which I am sure he may regret, the editorial in the <i>Belfast News Letter</i> from which Deputy Lynch quoted makes the very point to which I am trying to draw the attention of the House.  This editorial does not feature in the duplicated script which Deputy Lynch intended to read and hand around the House.  He read this excerpt into the record of the House but there was no reference to it in his original prepared speech.  From that I must conclude that some bright young member of his think-tank met him in the corridor and said: &ldquo;Use this, Mr. Lynch, this will really slay them&rdquo; and handed him a scrap of newspaper with this passage ringed in red.  I should like to read the passage read by Deputy Lynch.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Bill now before the Dáil represents a gesture, if nothing more than that, of some willingness to act against those who resort to violence.</P>
    <P>The point Deputy Lynch was getting at was that this was only a gesture. The context of the editorial&mdash;if it is to be cited as an authority by the Leader of the Opposition, I hope it is no harm if I cite it for my case&mdash;was that even if it turned out to be no more than a gesture it was infinitely preferable to the attitude of Mr. Lynch's party.  That editorial is headed &ldquo;When it suits the book&rdquo;.  The passage following that quoted by Deputy Lynch says, referring to the gesture:</P>
    <P>But even this has been too much for Mr. Lynch's Opposition party, Fianna Fáil, to swallow.</P>
    <P>By that curious blend of fantasy and fiction which is so often put forward by the South as an incontrovertible argument, Fianna Fáil has declared that the Government's extra-territorial courts scheme is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The Eire Constitution is specific. It claims jurisdiction over the whole island of Ireland from Fair Head to Mizzen Head, from Mullet to Ardglass.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> If a terrorist planted a bomb in Ballymena and was subsequently arrested in Mullingar, both the crime and the arrest would, in the terms of the South's Constitution, be within the jurisdiction of the State and Mr. Lynch would be the first to uphold that contention.</P>
    <P>That is what it says, apart from a parting swipe at Deputy Lynch for the elasticity of his speech and that of his party.  That is the point I want to draw attention to in the House.  Of course, the Bill does not purport to extend the court's jurisdiction over Ballymena in the same way that it does over Mullingar, but it goes a long distance towards doing that within the terms of Article 3.</P>
    <P>The very point singled out by the <i>Belfast News Letter</i> as one which they thought, had it suited his book, Deputy Lynch might have approved of in this Bill.  is the one I am trying to make here.  This Bill has a very large and very important all-Ireland element in it and the all-Ireland court, which the Opposition and all of us would like to see and which, of course, we cannot have, would be a more formal all-Ireland court.  The formality, the title and the name would be there but the substance would not be very different from what is now proposed.  I urge Deputies and anyone listening or reading this debate to ponder in their hearts the practical reality of this Bill, sad and tragic though the context is in which it has been introduced.</P>
    <P>I want to go through the four main arguments made by Deputy Lynch, the four pegs on which he hung his speech and on which other Opposition speeches were hung, and to deal with them as briefly as I can.  His first one, to which he did not give a great deal of time afterwards, was that this measure would tend against reconciliation of North and South rather than towards it.  He gave less than enough attention to that point in developing it later on.  I must confess I am foxed by this contention.  I simply cannot see how it is that a measure which would have the effect of removing, so far as we can do it, from ourselves the reproach we must now bear in the minds of the Northern majority&mdash;that <Col N="1222" /> we are harbouring wanted criminals&mdash; to the extent that it is successful will hinder reconciliation.  That seems to me a Kremlin-sized perversion of the truth.</P>
    <P>I just cannot see how, if we remove the main bone of contention, because that is what it is, the main complaint which the Northern majority have had against us, we can be said to be hindering reconciliation.  Let nobody say that the Northern minority will be hampered or injuriously affected by it, because the Northern minority time and again in election after election have demonstrated that they reject and oppose the violence and the horrors which are committed in their name.  I cannot be persuaded that the Northern minority will regard this Bill as in any way aimed against them.  It is aimed against the people who are disgracing them and against the people who are hindering the progressive pacification of Ireland and the uniting of its people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch's second line was that the Bill was unconstitutional.  I originally intended to speak at length about that but I read the Attorney General's concise and very conclusive reply to what Deputy Lynch had to say.  It would be wasting the time of the House if I were to go back over the same ground again.  The Attorney General was promised a full reply by Deputy Andrews a few minutes ago.  I am not sure who intends to deliver it.  I certainly will be listening to it or reading it with great interest.  It seems to me that the Attorney General's reply to the points of a constitutional kind raised by Deputy Lynch was devastating.  Significantly since then there has not been a peek out of the Opposition of a detailed kind about the alleged unconstitutionality of this Bill.  However, the mere fact that the Attorney General produces a good reply which may leave the Opposition speechless does not guarantee that the Bill is constitutional. We cannot foresee what will happen to it and we cannot, perhaps, foretell a particular case, which draftsmen or anybody else have not guessed might arise, in which the Bill would work in an unconstitutional way in defiance of constitutional justice or something of that kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> No Government ever ought to be so sure of themselves as to say &ldquo;This Bill is constitutionally immaculate.&rdquo; We do not say that.  We say that we have reasonable grounds for saying that it is constitutional.  It rests, as has been said before, on the deliberation of a commission on which very distinguished and experienced Irish lawyers from both jurisdictions, but particularly lawyers from this jurisdiction experienced in interpreting the Constitution, were active.  While that of course does not open and shut the case, it seems to me to give to the Government a fair assurance that they are in the clear constitutionally. We may be shown to be wrong.  Without anybody's authority for saying so I will admit that where a serious Opposition raise serious doubts in regard to the constitutionality of a Bill it probably is desirable to have it tested by the Supreme Court.  I am not exactly pressing for it.  It would be quite wrong for anyone to do that. I can see the desirability of it where an Opposition have made serious points about serious alleged unconstitutionality. There is a good deal to be said for the Article 26 procedure being then invoked.  I will say no more about it and will listen with interest for the Opposition's reply to what the Attorney General said.</P>
    <P>I want to say a couple of words about the allegation&mdash;this was his third argument&mdash;by Deputy Lynch that the Bill would only be workable if justice were defeated or if things which we have always regarded here as unjust were done.  For example, in column 1775, Volume 285 of the Official Report for 20th November, he said in the context of the alleged workability of the Bill:</P>
    <P>Is it likely that an accused person charged with a crime of violence committed in Northern Ireland or for escaping from lawful custody in Northern Ireland will voluntarily go to Northern Ireland and place himself in the hands of the authorities from which he has just escaped?  He is given the questionable &ldquo;right&rdquo; to attend the <Col N="1224" /> taking of evidence on commission in the North provided he gives himself up into the custody of the Northern police.  To appear to confer a right and then make it impossible of exercise is, in truth, not to confer a right at all but to impose disability, because the failure of an accused so to exercise the alleged right may lead to the comment that he had his chance to exercise and failed to do so.  Thus, I believe his last position is worse than his first.</P>
    <P>That is a perfectly serious argument. But before anyone runs away with the idea that this Bill has got a practical flaw in its heart I want to remind the House that the provision we are talking about is a provision for collecting evidence for a trial taking place in this State, let us say, in Dublin.  There are two ways for collecting that evidence.  It can be done before the court in Green Street or wherever the court is sitting.  That will be done if the witnesses from the North come down and give evidence in the ordinary way, as they have done countless times in the past where offences, admittedly committed in this jurisdiction, require the presence of witnesses from the North of Ireland, England or elsewhere abroad.  It is no new thing in our jurisdiction.  It is a very common thing&mdash;every solicitor and barrister sees it every day of the week&mdash;for a case, whether civil or criminal, to depend in the evidential sense on the presence of witnesses who in the ordinary way do not live within the State.</P>
    <P>There is nothing revolutionary about that, but this is the point brushed over very quickly by Deputy Lynch, a point barely adverted to. What is to stop witnesses coming down from the North of Ireland and giving their evidence in front of the accused in the ordinary way in a trial for an offence envisaged under this Bill?  I know the answer will be given that these witnesses may be afraid to come.  My answer to that is that, if they are afraid to come, at least this State has done its best.  If they are afraid to come, then at least we can say to the people in the North: &ldquo;We <Col N="1225" /> have got this man here.  We have arrested him and we have charged him.  The court has been empanelled to try him.  He is sitting there and all we want is evidence.  We have given the evidence we have got.  You are the ones who have defaulted on the evidence. We are completely in the clear.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If the prosecution witnesses were afraid to come we would have to be in the clear.  There could be no way of disputing that.  There could be no way of leaving this State under any reproach if it was on the prosecution's side, if the prosecution witnesses had failed to turn up.  Deputy Haughey interjected: &ldquo;What about the defence witnesses?  Suppose it is they who do not turn up?&rdquo; I say: &ldquo;Why should they not turn up here?&rdquo; He says: &ldquo;Because they might face certain difficulties.&rdquo;  There are two kinds of difficulties&mdash;unless there is something that the Deputy has not envisaged or that I have not understood: they may be apprehensive about giving evidence at all on the grounds that they would be treated as informers by these gentlemen and have their kneecaps shot off.  That difficulty will exist whether they give evidence in Dungannon or Dublin.  Or, on the other hand, they may be afraid of crossing the Border and of being arrested here themselves for some offence or on some charge by our police and put on trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this Bill goes, that cannot be done, should not be done and if it is done I can easily see this whole system breaking down.  I admit that this Government, and perhaps our predecessors, may not carry much authority with some of the kind of people who would be witnesses on one side or the other.  That may be so, but if we want this system to work we must play fair with everybody, accused and witnesses, whether they are police or <Col N="1226" /> otherwise.  If we do not play fair I am willing, on the next occasion when it is in order to do so, to admit that this whole Bill is a failure and a farce from start to finish.  If this Bill becomes an Act and we do not operate it according to the spirit in which it was conceived, then we have wasted a great deal of time and become upset and angry&mdash;some of us&mdash;for nothing.</P>
    <P>I cannot see&mdash;apart from the possibilities envisaged by Deputy Haughey to which I have tried to reply&mdash;that there is any great problem about witnesses coming from the North, defence or prosecution.  However, if that problem does exist and a witness rightly or wrongly&mdash;and I think it would be wrongly&mdash;gets it into his head that he will not be safe if he comes here, either that he will be the object of reprisals, as though we were not able to protect him, or that he will be charged by our own police for an offence under our ordinary law, say a smuggling offence, the Bill provides a procedure whereby the scene of action can shift to the North for the taking of evidence on commission.  If that happens the witnesses are in just the very same danger in regard to giving evidence or information and there is no difference whether it is North or South.</P>
    <P>So far as the accused is concerned it is envisaged that the accused on being informed of his right to stay where he is may stay where he is and refuse to travel to the North.  If the first accused tried here who accompanied the court to the North to take evidence on commission is molested in the slightest way by the RUC or by anybody, that, as far as I am concerned, would be the end of this measure; I would not wish to see it operated further.  It requires absolute good faith from the authorities on both sides and if that good faith were not forthcoming I would not open my mouth in defence of the Act and would be glad to see it lapse.  In other words, if the authorities in the North do not respect the immunity which the accused is supposed to enjoy on the taking of evidence on commission during his sojourn there, that would be the end of the operation of this Act as far as I was concerned.</P>
    <P>The provision about which everybody <Col N="1227" /> was so upset, from Deputy Lynch downwards, for the possible taking of evidence on commission in the absence of the accused is certainly an unusual provision in our law.  However, it exists even in criminal cases in other countries and in those other countries the European Human Rights Convention applies in some cases or the countries are signatories to it.  I agree with the principle that an accused person in any kind of serious case ought be present during the whole of his trial and that the chance should not be an illusory one in the way Deputy Lynch hints.  I would be very sorry to see our law take a step backwards in that direction, but I call Deputies' attention to the wording of section 11 particularly in the context of a principle which the Supreme Court enunciated here eight or nine years ago and which they apply ever since, in interpreting a statute.  That principle is, I understand, known as the principle of double construction and I think it means that if on the wording of a statute two constructions are possible &mdash;if the wording grammatically admits of two different constructions&mdash;and that of these two constructions one is constitutional and the other is not, the courts here must presume that the Oireachtas intended the constitutional one.</P>
    <P>If we look at section 11 (1) it says that the court of trial at the request of the prosecution or the accused, unless it is satisfied that it is not in the interests of justice to do so, may issue letters of request for taking evidence on commission and so on.  That is a very vital clause in my eyes&mdash;&ldquo;unless it is satisfied that it is not in the interests of justice to do so...&rdquo;.  Do not forget that we are dealing with the trial which is still taking place here, at which the accused is still professionally represented and that before the court, whether at the request of the prosecution or otherwise, makes up its mind to send for evidence on commission it will be bound to hear what defence counsel has to say on the point.</P>
    <P>This whole question of the interests of justice and the extent to which <Col N="1228" /> they may be impugned or prejudiced by the taking of evidence on commission will come under the court's scrutiny and it will do so in the setting of vigorous representations by counsel.  The greatest baby at the Bar will see the position if his client says: &ldquo;I cannot go over the Border because there is a particular person there who has sworn to kill me on sight and I know he will do it if he gets his hands on me&rdquo; and that clearly he meant what he said and feared for his life to put his nose across the Border.  Suppose the accused were also to say to his counsel: &ldquo;What is more, the witness they are calling up there is a notorious blackguard whom I could convict out of his own mouth a hundred times over if I could get at him but I cannot get at him because I am afraid for my life to go over the Border.&rdquo;  That, essentially, is the situation envisaged by Deputy Lynch's words, &ldquo;to appear to confer a right and then make it impossible of exercise.&rdquo;  As the Deputy says quite rightly, that is not to confer a right but to impose a disability.  But a court here, before it issues letters calling for the taking of evidence on commission, will have put to it by even the greatest baby at the Bar the argument: &ldquo;If you do this it will not be in the interests of justice, if you send up to take evidence in the conditions which my client talks about and he has sworn that he is in mortal terror of his life if he crosses the Border.  He has also sworn that the witness from whom evidence is proposed to be taken will not give satisfactory evidence unless confronted with the accused person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope I am not going beyond the bounds in saying this, but I think no court here would issue that letter of request.  Even if this clause were not in the Bill, I believe no court would do so because a court has a duty above and beyond and irrespective of what is in the Statute to administer justice fairly.  No court here, with the additional requirement laid on it specifically by this Bill that it shall do so only if it is satisfied that it is not against the interests of justice to do so, would do so.  I think the Opposition <Col N="1229" /> are right to raise this point but I think that what I have said deals with it completely.  First, we are ignoring the likely possibility that in a good number of cases we will get witnesses to cross the Border southwards.  We will have to protect them properly and exercise total good faith towards them.  The same will have to be done on the Northern side towards our witnesses who go over there.  That is essential and if it does not work that way I do not want to hear any more about the Act.  I believe the intention on both sides is that it should work that way, because each side is a hostage for the other side's good behaviour.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why there should not be in most cases, certainly in a substantial, useful number of cases, free passage of witnesses from North to South.  Where the question arises that an accused person might need to go North under this section in order to attend the taking of evidence on commission, the Northern authorities must exercise total good faith towards that accused person.  His immunity must be respected and if it is not I believe that probably will be the end of all this procedure.  So far as the fears of the accused might go that he might be murdered when across the Border, I believe that a court in Dublin would be very slow even without this clause being in the Bill but with this clause in the Bill will absolutely refuse to have evidence taken on commission if it is persuaded &mdash;and I do not believe that the Special Criminal Court has ever been alleged to ride roughshod over prisoners' rights in this regard&mdash;that the prisoner is in fear and has substantial reasons for not wishing to go over the Border.</P>
    <P>I think that request for taking evidence will not issue; and even if that means the acquittal of the accused and the falling down of the State case against him, that course would be preferable. I do not want to see men sent over the Border against their will if they have substantial reasons for being afraid to travel over the Border.  Everyone knows my views about the IRA and so on, but I certainly think that it <Col N="1230" /> would be an indefensible thing if this Bill, when it becomes law, were to operate in that way and I think it is protected from operating in that way by the requirements of section 11 (1).</P>
    <P>I had it in mind to say some more general things about the Opposition, but in the interests of coming to the closing stages of this debate quietly and without loss of temper, perhaps I had better not.  Let me conclude by saying that while I have never joined in the view that Fianna Fáil are collectively a front for gunmen, I do say that their opposition to this Bill, I think is insincere&mdash;they have not sufficiently explored and do not want to explore the possibilities which this Bill opens up, that they are making unduly much of the difficulties which the Bill undoubtedly may contain in its operation.  While I do not think they are fronts, consciously or unconsciously for gunmen, I do think there is something in the ethos of the Opposition in its history and so on which makes them soft in a predictable direction and hard in another equally predictable direction.</P>
    <P>A rather revealing thing was said here the other night.  I probably overreacted to it, but it seemed to me that Deputy Colley was equating the former leader of the old Irish Parliamentary Party with West Britons.  I need not tell you that the old Irish Parliamentary Party consisted of men who would but your throat if you called them West Britons.  To use the words &ldquo;Redmond&rdquo; and &ldquo;West Briton&rdquo; in the same breath is a barely forgivable insult to the memory of people who worked their lives out for Ireland and who commanded the respect and affection of hundreds of thousands of Irish people even when they were at their lowest ebb.  I do not need to tell you also that the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of every man and woman in this House fully thought they were doing their duty for Ireland in voting for that party.</P>
    <P>The reason why I called that interjection&mdash;probably he was provoked into it&mdash;that spontaneous automatic reaction of Deputy Colley the other night revealing is that in the minds of the party which he represents a question mark hangs over parliamentary <Col N="1231" /> procedure.  It is not 100 per cent legitimate in their eyes.  It has to be to some extent apologised for and it has to be defended every day of the week by those who really believe in it, but in some way it is not in their eyes or in their hearts 100 per cent legitimate.</P>
    <P>The converse is also true, that the gun is in some qualified situations not 100 per cent reprehensible.</P>
    <P>In order to make that orthodoxy stand on its feet it is necessary to reduce the memory of men like Redmond, because everything he stood for is hostile to everything that orthodoxy represents.  However, I want to say&mdash;and I am sorry we all had to learn this lesson the hard way &mdash;that it is that question mark, that equivocal character which has been forced on democratic, parliamentary evolution by the Opposition party which in no small measure has been responsible over the years for the misery, the bloodshed, the hatred, the heartbreak that have made this country a world byword.</P>
    <P>That is not to deny or, in my turn, place a question mark over the nobility of purpose of men who, when this country was part of the United Kingdom, saw the matter otherwise and who became impatient of parliamentary procedures.  I salute the nobility of purpose of many, if not most of them.  Many if not most of them would not be seen dead in a ditch with the people who invoke their name today in the carrying out of nameless horrors.  I salute their memory even though, with the hindsight of 60 years, I say I probably would not have been with them because I would have said to myself: that course, noble though the hearts are of the people who are entering upon it, places a question mark over a form of evolution which may be slow and undramatic but which will not leave broken hearts, broken homes and a torn community behind it.</P>
    <P>It is because of what seemed in the past to be the necessity to keep that question mark hanging over that parliamentary evolution and the complementary <Col N="1232" /> necessity to attribute some kind of, even if only a very small and qualified, justification to people who take the law into their own hands, that we are here today discussing this Bill.  I recommend it to the House.  I regret very much that a measure of this kind which, as I say, has torn a large breach in the Border, should have been called forth by these tragic events over the last six years.  I would far prefer if it had been otherwise, but I ask Deputies to consider whether the orthodoxy to which many of us have sold our souls here over the last generations has not been in part to blame.  I say no more in that way about the Opposition.  I accept that for the great majority of them there is no question of trying to make a defence for barbarism and murder.</P>

      <P>In debating this measure we need not, I believe, be unduly concerned that the proposal emerged out of and is now all that remains of the ill-fated Sunningdale Agreement.  What matters is that it is now before us for decision.  These are anxious times, and this measure is of such far-reaching importance that it must be assessed on its own merits and in the context of this current situation.  It is the Bill itself which is relevant and not its origin.  What we have to do is to try to measure as realistically as possible the effect its provisions are likely to have in present conditions should it become law.  Sunningdale is dead and gone, and there is no more point in raking over its ashes than there is in recalling that the victory of William of Orange at the Boyne was celebrated by a <i>Te Deum</i> in Rome.  Our concern must be with the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In times of public disquiet and alarm the legislator, more than anyone else, has a duty to be calm and wise.  Any community which is under strain, whose members fear for their own safety and the safety of their friends and neighbours, very often accept all too readily courses of action which appear to offer immediate protection but which they will live to regret bitterly.  The history of Europe <Col N="1233" /> in our time provides us with many tragic examples of how this can happen. Therefore, it is in times of crisis especially that legislators must prove their worth and must justify the trust placed in them.  They must try to be both the guardians of the people's safety and security and at the same time the ultimate custodians of their liberty.  Nor should the Executive, in its understandable anxiety to discharge its basic responsibility of protecting the security of the State, lose all sense of proportion and pursue that objective to the exclusion of all other legitimate considerations.</P>
    <P>The Government would be unwise to ignore the widespread unease that exists in regard to this legislation and to simply use their voting strength to push the Bill through the House regardless of criticism.  This is one occasion when the Government should listen seriously to what we are saying on this side of the House and they should, even at this late stage, take our views into account seriously in their deliberations.  In this House we must respond to the needs of the moment but we must ensure that in meeting those needs we do not simply sow the seeds of greater future troubles. It is in that frame of mind that we should approach provisions of the type that are before us.  If legislation is to be effective in dealing with the situation it is intended to deal with, it must be fair&mdash;fair to those who will be affected by its provisions and, at the same time, fair to the community as a whole in ensuring their safety and welfare. Unless a piece of legislation meets those two tests, it will not secure that acceptance by the public which any law needs in order to be effective and workable.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I propose to examine this Bill from three points of view: its purposes, the actual provisions it contains and the effects and repercussions it is likely to have if enacted.  First, I shall consider the purposes of the legislation. In his opening speech the Minister for Justice gave the House what seemed to me to be a very restricted and confined interpretation of those purposes. In effect, he said that the purpose of the Bill was to make certain criminal <Col N="1234" /> acts&mdash;a horrifying catalogue he very rightly called them&mdash;when committed in Northern Ireland offences against the law of this State and triable in our courts.  He argued that it is wrong that criminals should escape the consequences of their deeds, that it was detrimental to have such people at large in our society.  He went on to say that the purpose of the Bill was to ensure that the sanctions of the law were visited on these people and that Parliament should show its abhorrence of violence and do something realistic to try to stop it.</P>
    <P>However, that outline does not explain the real purpose of the Bill.  I believe that the Government have a much wider purpose, that they have set out to achieve political objectives rather than to procure a strictly legal objective.  There is a great deal more involved in this Bill than simply ensuring that wrong doers are punished. When I say that the Bill is intended to achieve political objectives I am using the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; in its full meaning and not in any sense of party political advantage.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Harte's contribution to this debate and he seemed to come nearer to interpreting the Bill and its purposes than did the Minister for Justice.  The Deputy's argument was to the effect that the only group&mdash;and this argument was repeated to some extent a few moments ago by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach&mdash;who can deliver a united Ireland are the Northern Loyalists and that any one who aspires to a united Ireland should placate that group and should undertake every course of action possible to win their confidence and their gratitude.  His argument seemed to be that this Bill was necessary in order to demonstrate to the Northern Loyalists that they are anxious to bring terrorism to an end and that this legislation will help to do that. The Government's real purpose is to demonstrate to the British Government, to the Northern Loyalists and, perhaps, to world opinion, that they are anxious to make a contribution by way of this legislation to bringing violence to an end in the North and in that way contribute to the good <Col N="1235" /> opinion in which they are held in these different quarters.  If that is the Government's real purpose, and I believe it is, I suggest that they reconsider this proposal entirely because it will not succeed in securing that objective.  It will fail in so far as the Northern Loyalist is concerned because there is no action we can take, no sacrifice or concession that we can make, no departure that we can undertake that will change his outlook and attitudes at this time.  Of all the people in this land he is firm in his convictions and clear about his objectives.  He will acknowledge and accept concessions of this sort and go on without the slightest deviation to pursue his own policy of self-interest and, as he believes, self-protection.</P>
    <P>If the Bill becomes law, its operation will have the very opposite effect to that which is intended.  It will be counter-productive in the worst way. Far from promoting good will or gratitude or appreciation in these quarters it will result in disillusion and recrimination from the very people it is intended to please, as its inadequacy and ineffectiveness become apparent.  This is of paramount importance.  The first prosecution which fails because of the inadequacies of the machinery in this Bill will excite more attention and animosity than anything which is happening here at present.</P>
    <P>Unpalatable and repressive though they clearly are, and alien to the principles to which we are accustomed, the procedures laid down in this Bill still cannot guarantee successful prosecutions.  The machinery that is proposed is cumbersome and will be ineffective.  The operation of machinery of this sort would be difficult even in normal times between friendly neighbours.  In the circumstances in which we expect it to operate, I cannot possibly see it succeeding.  Furthermore, it is impossible to see the operation of the Bill having any real or significant impact on the level of violence in the North of Ireland.  We all recognise that within that part of our country law and order have collapsed totally.  The ordinary norms of a civilised society are adhered to no <Col N="1236" /> longer.  Violence there has become self-perpetuating.  For every law breaker at large in the Republic of the sort this legislation is intended to deal with, there are at least 100 such people walking freely around Belfast. How, then, can we expect this legislation to make any real or significant impression on that sort of situation?</P>
    <P>Therefore, I cannot see the enactment of this legislation serving any worthwhile purpose.  In so far as it is intended to placate Loyalist opinion and to try to establish goodwill in those quarters, it will not be of any significance but I can see it being responsible directly for the opposite results.  A few recent incidents have shown how easily and erroneously bad feeling and recrimination can be generated out of the most innocuous circumstances, not just in Northern Ireland but in Great Britain itself.</P>
    <P>I think everyone will recognise that this Bill in its machinery and provisions is heavily weighted on the side of the prosecution.  In his introductory speech, the Minister for Justice devoted most of his time to the prosecution machinery, to outlining the procedures whereby persons can be brought before the courts, how the evidence against them is to be assembled and how the trial is to be prosecuted efficiently.  He was at pains, perhaps understandably so in the circumstances, to try to prove that the machinery he was creating in this Bill will work.  However, there was very little about the situation of the defendant.  Surely it is obvious that the defendant not alone will be at a disadvantage but will be clearly seen to be at a disadvantage.  His or her very presence before the courts will set up a presumption of some sort of guilt in the first place.  He or she obviously will find it very difficult to make any proper arrangements for their own defence, to seek out evidence and to assemble witnesses to contradict police evidence.  Those difficulties are inherent in this situation and in the machinery provided by the Bill.  The accused will be cut off from their friends and associates and, at the same time, very often they will be confronted by hostile witnesses.  In the <Col N="1237" /> circumstances it is difficult to see how our courts will be able to maintain their reputation for impartiality.</P>
    <P>I suggest these are very grave considerations. We must fully understand in this House that we are entrusting to unknown agencies and individuals, about whose integrity we have no guarantees, about some of whom we are entitled to be deeply suspicious, important aspects of the administration of our justice here.  I am referring to matters such as the prior assessment of the worth of evidence, assembling all the relevant witnesses&mdash;I emphasise relevant in that connection&mdash;the whole composition of the circumstances and the facts and the basis on which the charges are to be brought.  Is it not clear that once this unprecedented arrangement comes into operation our Government will thereafter be the prisoners of decisions taken elsewhere by persons unknown to them and about whose standing and integrity they have no knowledge whatever? How are instances in which the public feelings of justice and fair play are outraged to be avoided in these circumstances? If we believe in this part of the country that prosecutions are not lightly, mischievously or vindictively initiated, is public trust and confidence in that situation to be put in jeopardy by our having to stand over prosecutions being taken on a basis of which we have no real knowledge whatever?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there are two entirely separate and distinct categories of persons covered by this Bill.  The Bill makes no distinction between them, although in my view it should do so.  There is one category of persons, those who travel from this jurisdiction, who commit an offence in Northern Ireland and return here.  In the other category there is an entirely different type of person; a person who is normally resident in the North of Ireland and who, having become involved with the security forces, members of a para-military organisation there, seeks genuine political refuge in this State.  He or she may have been the victim of aggression, intimidation or brutality.  A confrontation with the security forces may have arisen in defending his or her home or family. <Col N="1238" /> That person, hopeless and despairing of procuring justice in the North of Ireland, flies to the south.  The Bill makes no distinction between these two categories and I believe it should because they are fundamentally different sorts of people.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill with regard to extradition are complex and it is not easy to understand or discern their real purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know only one extradition.  The fact that we have had this discussion in the House proves my point, that it is difficult to interpret what exactly section 20 is attempting to do.  Subsection (5) of section 20 prevents a person who has been extradited from Northern Ireland to this State for an ordinary offence from being tried here on a scheduled offence, that is one of the things done in Northern Ireland that now, for the first time under the provisions of this Bill, is an offence triable in the State. It seems to me that what subsection (5) of section 20 attempts to do is to provide that if a person is extradited from the North of Ireland to this State in respect of some ordinary crime he cannot be prosecuted here for a scheduled offence.  I should like to know from the Minister the reason for this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking this question because I see the danger of a very serious injustice being perpetrated under the provisions of the Bill.  For a moment I thought that subsection (5) may have been meant to prevent the injustice I see arising.  I do not think it will but I <Col N="1239" /> should like to have some elucidation of the situation.  It seems to me inescapable that in certain circumstances under the provisions of this Bill an individual can be placed in what American lawyers dramatically call &ldquo;double jeopardy&rdquo;.  If an individual is accused of a scheduled offence which is also an offence under the ordinary law of Northern Ireland and if he flees to this State, it is open to the Northern Ireland authorities to institute extradition proceedings for his return.  If the accused resists extradition by pleading political reasons, it will be open to the Attorney General here to initiate a prosecution under the provisions of this Bill.  That is clearly set out in paragraph 18, Chapter IV of the Report of the Law Enforcement Commission. Surely in order to resist the extradition proceedings the accused will necessarily have to completely prejudice his defence in a subsequent trial under this Bill?  This may be obviated by the provisions of section 20, in particular subsection (5), but I cannot see that it is.  This is a matter with which the Minister should deal.  If it is not prevented by section 20, is it not the situation that there will develop a standard practice of initiating extradition proceedings, followed then by an open and shut case under the provisions of this Bill, the accused's entire defence having been vitiated by the necessity to resist extradition proceedings?</P>
    <P>In that context the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach has just now adverted again to his suggestion that this Bill would become a model for Europe to copy.  In his enthusiasm for the Bill he seems to have gone overboard in this regard.  On calmer reflection he could not possibly suggest that, if we are to set headlines for Europe in the matter of legislation, we should try to do so by means of repressive legislation, of which this Bill undoubtedly is an example. I would remind him again, in connection with his proposal that all Europe should have some sort of antiterrorist measures, that the French, as I recall it, in no circumstances will agree to extradite a French citizen to <Col N="1240" /> anybody for any reason.  I recall this from my own experience in putting through our own extradition Bill when I was Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has dealt with a number of objections which have been raised about different aspects of this Bill in what I must say is a cavalier manner, simply saying they are ridiculous and they should not have been made.  He does this in regard to the argument about the possible reluctance of our judges to associate with the administration of justice in the North.  He does it in regard to the difficulties of identification and the question of possible infringements of the Convention on Human Rights.  On a Bill of this fundamental importance, I do not think that sort of approach by the Minister to perfectly valid objections raised here is acceptable.  If he wishes to put forward the proposals in this Bill as desirable, appropriate and legitimate, then he must be prepared to defend them on their merits, and deal with any objections put up to them in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that there are elements in the North to whom the appearance of any republican judge clothed with any sort of authority in the North would be anathema.  Is there no danger, therefore, in that situation to be anticipated, if not for the personal safety of the judge, at least for his status and dignity?  The procedure set out in the Bill can certainly give rise to difficulties in regard to identification which would not be involved in more settled and more orthodox procedures.</P>
    <P>The Minister counters the point made about the Convention on Human Rights by the, to me, absurd statement that there is no difference between surrendering to one's bail at the court of trial and surrendering to it at any place where evidence is being taken for the purposes of that trial.  There is all the difference in the world, and it is patently absurd to suggest otherwise.  It is absurd to suggest that delivering oneself up to a court in this land of ours, which one knows about and respects, is no different from placing oneself in the <Col N="1241" /> hands of the security forces in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The argument has been strongly advocated inside and outside this House that this Bill may be unconstitutional because it interferes with an accused person's fundamental right to confront and cross-examine a witness who gives evidence against him.  The Minister's reply to that is again superficial and it is not strengthened by the fact that he found it necessary in his introductory speech to attack the motives of those who wish to put forward that valid argument.</P>
    <P>To be fair to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, he dealt with it in a much broader and more legitimate way.  The Minister's answer was that the accused can travel to the North to cross-examine witnesses.  The accused, of course, will have to do so in custody.  The Minister states he will be guaranteed immunity from illtreatment or questioning.  His answer, first of all, completely ignores the fact that quite a number of accused persons in these circumstances will have a very understandable fear of this whole process, a fear which will not be mitigated by any guarantees.  To those who question the value of the guarantees, the Minister's reply is simply that they should not dare to do so, that there is no reason to doubt that the Northern authorities will adhere honourably to the proper procedure.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Minister can regard that as an adequate reply on this fundamental issue.  After all that has happened, it is perfectly justifiable to doubt the validity of such guarantees, if not in their intent, certainly in regard to their practical operation. It seems to me in this regard, at any rate, it is the Minister who is seeking refuge in sweeping and unjustified assertions, and not those who are putting forward these arguments.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach exposed inadvertently the weakness which, to use his own phrase, is at the heart of this Bill in this connection. He stated that if there were problems in regard to witnesses coming down here, if they were prosecution witnesses, the authorities here would be <Col N="1242" /> in the clear.  They would be able to stand up and say: &ldquo;We have done our best.  These prosecution witnesses are afraid to come down here and there is nothing we can do about it&rdquo;.  That, in itself, is an admission that the machinery set out is fraught with the possibility of ineffectiveness.</P>
    <P>He was on much weaker ground when I put to him the question of the reluctance of a defence witness to come down here.  It is quite possible to visualise circumstances where a witness from the North of Ireland who could completely exonerate an accused before the courts here would not be prepared to come here because he was afraid of reprisals in the North.  Surely that, again, shows that, in many ways and in many circumstances, this Bill cannot be relied upon to be effective or efficient.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not on any firmer ground when he asks Deputies to withdraw their objections to the whole procedure of taking evidence on commission because it will be available to the defence as well.  That seems to me to be an argument which just will not stand up.  Surely the whole point is that if this doubtful procedure of taking evidence on commission were not provided for in this Bill, there would be no need for any defence and, therefore, no need for the defence to rely on the procedure itself.</P>
    <P>The way in which the Minister dealt with the valid criticism that this Bill will have the effect of institutionalising the Special Criminal Court seems to me to border on an attempt to deceive this House.  The Bill, if it becomes law, will certainly contribute to making the Special Criminal Court more permanent and less likely to be disestablished, because it builds the Special Criminal Court firmly into this bi-national reciprocal arrangement. The Minister claimed there is no substance in this argument because, should the Special Criminal Court be disestablished, the ordinary courts would continue to have the capacity to try these extraterritorial offences.  They would, but he deliberately avoids drawing attention in <Col N="1243" /> that context to the fact that the power to take evidence on commission, without which the provisions of this Bill would be largely inoperative, would not be available to the ordinary courts if the Special Criminal Court were stood down.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the plain fact is&mdash;and I suggest it is incontrovertible&mdash;that if the Government wish the machinery of this Bill to continue indefinitely into the future, as they clearly do, then they must continue the Special Criminal Court indefinitely into the future too and the argument that this Bill institutionalises the Special Criminal Court just cannot be gainsaid. The Minister's general attitude to these arguments is just not good enough.  They are all matters of serious genuine concern to a wide number of ordinary men and women who value their legal system.  They do not want to have it abused and they do want to have their doubts and anxieties about this legislation fully explored and dealt with.  They do not want to see our legal system interfered with or used for any prejudicial purpose, and the Minister must not try to ride roughshod over these genuine feelings and doubts.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and his colleagues were to take an honest approach to these issues that would serve them much better.  It would serve the Minister much better were he to say, in effect, that he acknowledges that these things are unsavoury and may well prove to be difficult to operate in practice, that they may give rise to some injustices, but the overall purposes of the Bill are valid and legitimate and the Bill will achieve its objectives and, therefore, these lesser evils must be tolerated for that overall purpose.  That, at least, would be an understandable argument.  But I believe it is indefensible and inexcusable for the Minister to try to brush them aside, as he has done in his opening speech, as being either mischievous, malicious or of no significance whatever.  They are valid, legitimate propositions put forward both inside and outside this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister and some of his colleagues have attempted to stifle open <Col N="1244" /> debate on this important measure and, in my view, attempted to stifle proper Parliamentary democratic debate by the dishonest tactic of inferring that anyone who opposes this legislation places himself or herself on the side of terrorism.  The Minister himself gave open expression to that attempt at intimidating the Opposition when he said in his introductory speech:</P>
    <P>I would go so far as to say that those who criticise the Bill and condemn it run a serious risk of placing themselves on the side of the terrorists.</P>
    <P>Ludicrous! If I were to oppose legislation to restore capital punishment does that place me on the side of the murderer?</P>
    <P>It is very significant how often the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach in examining, as honestly as he can do, different propositions has to fall back, as he had to do just now, on saying: &ldquo;If that happens I will not want anything more to do with the Bill and the Bill will become inoperative.&rdquo; A great deal can, I think, be read into these admissions by the Parliamentary Secretary, and it is obvious that in many aspects he does not see these provisions working either efficiently or satisfactorily.  Let me say again that, if the proposals in this Bill cannot be defended on their merits, it will not avail the Minister anything to resort to these dishonest tactics of condemning our motives in opposing this Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to look at the possible results that will flow from the enactment of this legislation.  I shall say nothing about the constitutionality of the measure or the legitimacy of the extraterritorial principle.  If the Government succeed in pushing this Bill through its constitutionality will be decided certainly sooner or later by the Supreme Court.  That is inevitable. But there is another principle involved here, a principle of greater importance than the constitutionality of these provisions.  The State in the eyes of its own citizens should not appear to be derogating its rights and powers to any outside authority except in the case of free association or <Col N="1245" /> adherence to a community.  I do not think anyone seriously suggests that offenders from this State are going to take refuge in Northern Ireland or in the United Kingdom.  Whatever may be the theory the net result will be entirely one-sided.  Persons and authorities and agencies from outside will be demanding action from our courts and from the administration of justice here and we will ask them for nothing and get nothing in return.  The impression must be created in these circumstances that the institutions of this State are being used for purposes decided elsewhere.  Any such impression, I suggest in all seriousness, is an exceedingly dangerous one from the point of view of this State, particularly where the institutions of justice are concerned.</P>
    <P>The bringing forward of this legislation by the Government must also have serious repercussions in that the Bill will give a degree of credence and support to something which has always been an important, even though a totally misleading, contention of Northern Ireland Loyalists and, to a lesser extent, British propaganda. It has always been the objective of that propaganda to propagate the theory that the trouble in the North in some way emanates from the South and that, if the North were left alone and free from Southern intervention the people there would live in peace and harmony.  The former Northern Premier, Mr. Brian Faulkner, in particular worked consistently to convey that impression and he never missed an opportunity of seeking to promote it.  That it was a quite ludicrous and untenable proposition in no way deterred him in his efforts.  I suppose that was because it represented a convenient, face-saving formula for those who did not want to face the reality of the Northern situation.</P>
    <P>I believe it should always be our aim to counter that falsehood with the truth, to demonstrate that the problem is essentially a Northern one, that the trouble begins and is nurtured in the North, that violence and terror and bloodshed are the products of Northern conditions, of political, religious, social and economic conditions <Col N="1246" /> there and that Northern Ireland is today, regrettably, reaping the bitter harvest of a crop that was sown the very day that State was created.  The statements and attitudes of some Government Ministers have, I suggest, also been detrimental in this regard because this misrepresentation for propaganda purposes seeks to deflect attention from the real sources of the trouble by suggesting that in some undefined way it has its origins in the South.  How can we ever get to a solution if the real origins of the conflict are not identified and acknowledged and if these attempts to divert attention from the real deep-rooted causes are not resisted by us?  This Bill, unfortunately, has this regrettable aspect in that it contributes to the fallacy that violence, which is endemic to the North, can in some way be traced to Southern origins.</P>

      <P>We have a solemn obligation to examine carefully the possible implications of this legislation on the preservation of peace in this part of Ireland.  I do not think it in any way derogates from the principle of Irish unity for me to state that the first duty of an Irish Government is to maintain peace and security in its own immediate jurisdiction.  The Government are not entitled to undertake any course of action which would in itself contribute to endangering the degree of stability and the level of law and order that prevail in this part of the country.  Neither can this be regarded as mere selfishness on our part.  We cannot help the situation in the North in any way by inciting violence here. The very opposite is the truth.  In so far as the long-term situation is concerned, from every point of view it is important that we try to preserve peace and good order in the South if for no other reason than to demonstrate by contrast the sheer futility of violence and confrontation.  It can be regarded as irresponsible for the Government, in pursuance of the very doubtful advantage that can be won by passing this <Col N="1247" /> legislation, to run the risk of provoking disorder and violence in the South.</P>
      <P>I hope the Government have thought of that.  They have no mandate to take any course of action that would endanger our people.  I believe there is a grave risk that they will provoke and incite the same sort of reaction in this part of the country which has resulted in a total breakdown of law and order in the North.  The maintenance of peace through the impartial administration of justice has widespread overwhelming support in this part of the country.  The reputation of impartiality in our police force and courts is one of the vital elements that ensures that spirit.  That must be safeguarded, and anything that might tend to threaten it must be avoided.</P>
      <P>There is a very real risk, as I have said, that the operation of this legislation could inflict fundamental damage in that situation by bringing our judicial process into a doubtful area. This process may be firmly enough established to surmount the dangers and emerge unscathed in public respect. I do not deny that may be, but I do not think it is a risk we should have to take.  The State's final sanction is the loyalty citizens bear to its institutions, but particularly those concerned with the law and its enforcement, and if there develops here an impression that through this legislation our courts will pursue a political line, that loyalty of our citizens can be impaired with the gravest consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone listening last Sunday to the description of internment given on the radio by the chaplain who was a frequent visitor to Long Kesh, to the frightening chilling outline of the psychological terror and physical torture that were practised there, must surely have instinctively felt compelled to turn away in revulsion from this legislation.  It was difficult to credit, listening to that man, that he was describing Ireland today and not some far off place under the heel of a tyrannical military dictator.  His description could not leave us in any doubt about the circumstances in which we will be attempting to <Col N="1248" /> operate this Bill.  They are totally different from the sort of conditions in which it was expected to operate when the Bill was first conceived.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows what sort of regime will emerge in Northern Ireland, but it will be a regime to whose dictates our legal procedures will have to conform if this Bill becomes law.  We do not know the type of regime with whom our police and our courts will have to co-operate and whose words they will have to accept in regard to the practice of the most brutalising torture.  There might have been something to say for the basic principle of this legislation if the constitutional future of Northern Ireland had been settled in some way of which we could approve, whether along the lines of the Sunningdale formula or not, but surely it is not anything short of madness to persist with these proposals when a great cloud of uncertainty hangs over the future of the North and when no one can guarantee that a return to Stormont policy and attitudes is not an immediate possibility, when some new form of regime whose principal objective is a return to one-party dominance may be hurriedly established and hurriedly blessed by Westminster.</P>
    <P>Nor should the Government blind themselves to the tragic implications involved in this Bill being looked upon by a large proportion of the people of Northern Ireland as their final abandonment by the Government and the people of the South.  If an entirely innocent person&mdash;and the chaplain I have mentioned had no doubt there were such in Long Kesh &mdash;knowing that there is no way in which he can avoid unjust brutalising imprisonment, seeks genuine political asylum in this State, and having done so is prosecuted and imprisoned here for doing no more than that, can we expect the community from which he comes to view this process with anything but anger and hostility?</P>
    <P>Is it difficult to foresee disillusionment spreading among people who see us involving ourselves in this major effort to deal with something which to them is of minor or peripheral <Col N="1249" /> significance when in their own circumstances countless well documented cases of deaths and illtreatment have not involved the arrest or punishment of a single soldier or policeman involved?  Let us take into account also the fact that the elected representatives of this section of the people of the North will not support or endorse the activities of the Northern security forces.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill asks us to do precisely that where the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals are concerned. Have the Government thought of all these things?  If so, do they not foresee a great alienation of this important section of the Northern people, springing rightly or wrongly from feelings of broken trust and confidence, with dire consequences of very serious long-term political implications for the country as a whole?</P>
    <P>Let us look also at the other side of the situation.  Is it not inevitable that many or at least a number of prosecutions brought under this Bill will be found by our courts to have been initiated on wrong or on insufficient grounds?</P>
    <P>If our courts find, as surely they will often have to find, that charges have not been proved or should not have been brought, what is to be the effect on certain other sections of Northern opinion of their rejection or dismissal? The reality is that we are very likely to get the worst of both worlds.  We will succeed only in alienating those whom we seek to placate and at the same time appear guilty of administering partisan and one-sided justice to many whose resentment will be long and bitter.</P>
    <P>There is a grave and solemn obligation on the Government to protect the integrity of our courts and to preserve them from these dangers.  They are an integral part of our State machinery and the final guardians of our liberties. The consequences of the operation of this Bill could thus be very grave and could impinge on the whole future of Irish society.</P>
    <P>There is one question which, I suggest, the Taoiseach must deal with in connection with this debate.  The Taoiseach speaks frequently about the institutions <Col N="1250" /> of State and the need to defend and protect them.  He has elevated that principle into a kind of private personal devotion.  Is he not putting one of our most important institutions, our courts and their standing and prestige, at serious risk by proposing this legislation? Is he not endangering them by using them for a political purpose?  The object of this Bill is political; political in a very real sense.  The Taoiseach must realise that he is inserting our courts into a political equation.  What he is doing is using them as political capital.  He is risking the traditional respect in which they are held by the people in order to reap whatever political advantage this Bill can hope to provide in relation to the situation in the North.</P>
    <P>I hope I have shown that any such political gain will at best be minimal and, much more likely, totally negative. What then does the Taoiseach mean when he speaks of defending the institutions of the State?  Is it just a mere political slogan transferred from one speech to the next or does it reflect on the part of the Taoiseach a deep and abiding commitment to protecting the permanent and lasting values enshrined in those institutions? If it is the latter, and I have no reason to believe that it is not, then he will not proceed with this legislation and all the dangers to our institutions it involves.</P>
    <P>If I were convinced that anything proposed in this House could contribute to the establishment of peace and justice in Northern Ireland, I would not hesitate to support it.  Because I have far deeper personal reasons for desiring an end to violence and terror in the North; I have far stronger ties of kinship and friendship with our northern land than most of my traducers, I would wish, as earnestly as any Member, to do anything I can, to pass any legislation, undertake any course of action that might succeed in bringing its suffering finally to an end.  But I can not accept that this legislation would help in any way or that it will contribute anything worthwhile.  On the contrary, it is my firm and sincere conviction that its outcome may well <Col N="1251" /> be disastrous North and South and for that reason Dáil Éireann should reject it.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal with some of the legal aspects of the Bill.  I do not propose to cover the full spectrum in its political context as has been done fully and ably and in terms with which I totally agree by Deputy Haughey.  I do not think it is necessary for me to speak on the same lines.  I should like to make some references to the legal aspects, particularly some of the views expressed by the Attorney General when he spoke on 26th November, as reported in Volume 286, columns 248 to 259 of the Official Report.  I read as carefully as I could what the Attorney General had to say on that occasion and I take issue with several aspects of what he said.</P>
      <P>The first point he made was in relation to the power of this, or any other State, to exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction in the sense of making laws which to one extent or another affect Acts created outside their territorial jurisdiction.  The Attorney General quoted from two works on international law, O'Connell and Schwarzenberger.  I should like to take up part of his quotation from the latter work as reported at column 250 of the Official Report which was to the effect:</P>
      <P>... This even implies that the legislation of a State or judgments of its courts may extend to persons, acts or property outside the State's own jurisdiction.  So long as the actual exercise of jurisdiction in concrete instances takes place within the territory of the State concerned such activities are lawful....</P>
      <P>There is a lot more in that quotation than the Attorney General might have led the House to believe.  The important part in my view is the proviso that so long as the actual exercise of jurisdiction in concrete instances takes place within the territory of the State concerned such activities are lawful.  In other words, such efforts to create extra-territorial law are in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I submit that in this Bill <Col N="1252" /> the exercise of jurisdiction in concrete instances does not take place within the territory of the State concerned. That is the whole point of this Bill. That is why the proposals in it in regard to extra-territoriality are so fundamentally different to anything we have had up to now.  At column 251 of the Official Report the Attorney General gave a number of examples of legislation, section 3 of the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962; section 38 of the Extradition Act, 1965 and section 11 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1973, as examples of extra-territoriality but he failed to point out to the House that in each and every such case the proceedings that could be taken on foot of such section will be heard in this jurisdiction and totally within this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in any of those sections or Acts, or in any other extra-territorial legislation of which I am aware, that part, or as will happen in this case, most of the proceedings will take place outside our jurisdiction.  Let us for a moment endeavour to postulate the sort of case which is most likely to occur as a result of the passage of this Bill.  I want to refer to a case that would arise under the provisions for the taking of evidence on commission under section 11 because that section is the nub of the Bill and not simply the section which creates the extra-territorial offences.  If somebody is arrested within our jurisdiction for a crime which he is alleged to have committed in Northern Ireland and the witnesses to the alleged crime are members of the security forces of Northern Ireland it is assumed, by the insertion of section 11, that those security forces will be unwilling, for one reason or another, to travel to the Republic of Ireland for the purpose of giving evidence. Under section 11 this commission has to be established to take evidence under that section.  The only here in relation to that alleged offence evidence that will be given to the court is evidence of arrest by a member of the Garda Síochána.  If this Bill is passed nobody else in most cases will be able to give any evidence relevant to the commission of the alleged offence.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is fair to say that <Col N="1253" /> 95 per cent of the case will be heard outside our jurisdiction.  That whole circumstance is totally different to the kind of examples which the Attorney General gave.  The Attorney General did not tell the House that in each of the cases he cited the entirety of the proceedings will take place in the Republic of Ireland.  In the example I have given of the sort of case that is likely to arise under this Bill, 95 per cent of the proceedings will take place outside our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Virtually all the evidence other than formal evidence of arrest will have to be given in Northern Ireland to a judge of the Northern Ireland High Court, and how that can be equated with proceedings under these three Acts that are cited is beyond me.  In fact, if the Attorney General had gone on to deal somewhat further with section 3 of the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962, he would have seen that the proposals he referred to cover what are described as grave breaches of the scheduled Conventions and are designed to enable the arrest and trial of people such as Nazis who carried out appalling acts of genocide and similar acts during the second world war, but if he looks at subsection (4) of that section, it specifically states:</P>
    <P>A person charged with an offence under this section shall be tried by the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The Central Criminal Court sits in Dublin within this jurisdiction.  It sits with a jury.  It hears all its evidence in Dublin or elsewhere within the jurisdiction and there is no provision that evidence can be taken by it outside the jurisdiction and, in particular, there is no provision that 95 per cent of the evidence can be taken outside the jurisdiction, as would be the proposal in the Bill we have under discussion now.  If any attempt were to be made to take evidence outside the jurisdiction it would presumably be necessary to move the jury outside the jurisdiction to hear it because they are entitled to hear the witnesses. The thing is patently impossible and therefore was never contemplated <Col N="1254" /> and could never be contemplated.</P>
    <P>I would also like to suggest to the Attorney General that although the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962, has been law for 30 years, so far as I am aware nobody has been convicted under section 3 and one wonders if anybody will ever be convicted under section 3.  The same remarks apply to the other two Acts which are referred to.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the Government seeking to create extra-territorial jurisdiction in relation to certain types of offences if that is felt to be necessary provided that the total exercise of that jurisdiction is carried on within our own jurisdiction. In that connection it is as well to refer to the fact that the basic approach of international law to the question of extra-territoriality is based on the fact that a State can legislate for all acts by whomsoever committed within its own jurisdiction and can legislate for acts committed outside its jurisdiction by its own citizens or its own subjects.  That is a fair statement of a generally accepted basic tenet of international law, but we are going a great deal further here or we are attempting to go a great deal further here, and I would suggest to the Minister for Justice that he will have to think again about this proposal and, particularly, that he will have to think again about it in the light of the recent judgment of Mr. Justice McMahon delivered on 28th November, 1975, in the matter of an application for an order of <i>certiorari</i> by Brendan Devine and John Magee. The case may be referred to briefly as the Foyle Fisheries case because regulations made under the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, as amended, were called in question by the prosecutors there, and successfully so.  Some of the reasons given by Mr. Justice McMahon in arriving at his decision in that case are to my mind very relevant to the sort of problem that we are facing in discussing this Bill at this time.</P>
    <P>This arises under two different headings.  One of them is a consideration by Mr. Justice McMahon of the power of the Oireachtas to make <Col N="1255" /> extra-territorial legislation and the second, towards the end of his judgment, relates to certain changes in function in Northern Ireland which in his opinion invalidated the regulations which were made under that Act because they were done without the authority of Oireachtas Éireann.  I take the two points concerned in the order in which they appear in his judgment and go briefly through the matter.</P>
    <P>The first point that should be noted is that the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952&mdash;and I quote Mr. Justice McMahon&mdash;</P>
    <P>is expressed to have extra-territorial operation in respect of acts done by persons resident in the State in that part of the Foyle area which lies outside the State.  It was submitted on behalf of the prosecutors that Article 3 of the Constitution limited the powers of the Oireachtas to enact laws having extra-territorial effect and that the Act of 1952 was in excess of such powers.</P>
    <P>He quotes Article 3 and goes on to say:</P>
    <P>It was not contended that a law expressed to have extra-territorial effect was inconsistent with the comity of Nations or the established rules of international law.</P>
    <P>He then goes on to deal with the power of Saorstát Éireann to make law which had extra-territorial effect, and this is a matter of great importance here because the power of this Oireachtas to enact extra-territorial legislation is no greater than the powers of Saorstát Éireann to do so prior to the passage of the 1937 Constitution and therefore the powers of Oireachtas Éireann today in this regard are very much bound up with what were the powers of Saorstát Éireann prior to 1937.  I am quoting from what is described as an unapproved copy of the judgment supplied to me.  Mr. Justice McMahon goes on to cite the following cases:</P>
    <P>In Keegan v. Dawson (1934 I.R. 232) Fitzgibbon J. at p. 249 cited with approval a passage from <Col N="1256" /> the judgment of Doctor Lushington in The Zollverein (2 Jur. N.S. 429):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The power of this country is to legislate for its own subjects all over the world and as to foreigners within its jurisdiction but no further.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Fitzgibbon J. went on to state:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no doubt in my mind that not only the British legislature but the legislature of each of the self-governing dominions including that of the Free State has power to legislate for its own subjects all over the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The power of a dominion parliament to legislate with extra-territorial effect prior to the Statute of Westminster, 1931, was denied in the judment of the Privy Council in British Coal Corporation and Others v.  The King (1935 A.C. p. 500).  The Statute of Westminster, 1931, by section 2 (3) provided that it was</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Declared and enacted that the Parliament of a dominion has full power to make laws having extra-territorial operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The prosecutors contended that the reference in Article 3 to &ldquo;the laws of Saorstát Éireann&rdquo; meant the laws in force in Saorstát Éireann at the time of the enactment of the Constitution and since there was then no legislation of Saorstát Éireann corresponding to the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, that it was not competent for the Oireachtas to give the Act an extra territorial effect.  It would be a strange anomaly if the sovereign, independent State constituted in 1937 did not have as ample power of making laws as was vested in Saorstát Éireann more than 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>In my opinion Article 3 cannot be construed in this manner.  No reason has been suggested for limiting the power of the State by reference to the extent to which Saorstát Éireann had exercised the power to make laws having extra-territorial effect.  In my opinion <Col N="1257" /> Article 3 of the Constitution in providing that the laws enacted by Parliament shall have the like extra-territorial effect as the laws of Saorstát Éireann means the like extra-territorial effect as the laws of Saorstát Éireann were capable of having.  Under Article 3 laws having a purely domestic import do not extend to Northern Ireland, but laws expressed to operate extra-territorially can bind those who are subjects of the State in regard to their conduct in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is the end of the quotation from Mr. Justice McMahon on that point.</P>
    <P>These points are very important.  Of course, the particularly significant piece is the last sentence I quoted and which I think should be examined in some detail.  It is only fair to say that the Attorney General, when speaking in this House on the 26th of November, did not have the advantage of the judgment subsequently delivered by Mr. Justice McMahon on the 28th of November.  Let us examine in some detail the last sentence and its import&mdash;I shall repeat it for that purpose:</P>
    <P>Under Article 3 laws having a purely domestic import do not extend to Northern Ireland, but laws expressed to operate extra-territorially can bind those who are subjects of the State in regard to their conduct in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice McMahon used the words &ldquo;subjects of the State&rdquo;.  Other authorities use the words &ldquo;citizens of the State&rdquo;.  I think they mean the same thing.  I take the words &ldquo;subjects of the State&rdquo;, as expressed by Mr. Justice McMahon, to mean the same thing as the various authorities mean when they say &ldquo;citizens of the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is the position that the extra-territorial aspect of this Bill can affect people in Northern Ireland doing certain acts in Northern Ireland only if they are subjects of the State or citizens of the State.  Therefore, we must ask ourselves : what is the position regarding citizenship of persons in Northern Ireland?  The position is <Col N="1258" /> set out in sections 6 and 7 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1956.  Subsection (1) of section 7 of that Act reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Pending the reintegration of the national territory, subsection (1) of section 6 shall not apply to a person, not otherwise an Irish citizen, born in Northern Ireland on or after the 6th of December, 1922, unless, in the prescribed manner, that person, if of full age, declares himself to be an Irish citizen or, if he is not of full age, his parent or guardian declares him to be an Irish citizen.  In any such case, the subsection shall be deemed to apply to him from birth.</P>
    <P>This raises a great many problems in relation to the efforts of the Oireachtas to legislate for people who are not citizens of Ireland and whose alleged offences took place outside the jurisdiction of this Parilament.  It is a fair and accurate summary of sections 6 and 7 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1956 to say that people who were born in Northern Ireland subsequent to the 6th of December, 1922, are not Irish citizens unless their parents were born in Ireland before that date or they make a declaration declaring themselves to be Irish citizens.  In fact that is the way the position works, for example, in regard to the issue of passports. Therefore, we have the situation that, under the normal rules of international law, extra-territoriality of the kind proposed here can apply to acts done outside of our jurisdiction only by Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to consider the large number of people who live in Northern Ireland, who were born subsequent to the 6th of December, 1922, who are not otherwise Irish citizens and who have not made a declaration of the kind referred to in subsection (1) of section 7 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1956.  As a result of this, it is very questionable whether such persons can in fact be brought within the effect or jurisdiction of this Bill, assuming it is passed.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that has not been argued here before; it has not been <Col N="1259" /> dealt with; it goes to the very root of the Bill and is of fundamental importance. The view which was expressed in the Foyle Fisheries case as recently as the 28th of November by Mr. Justice McMahon would seem to bear out the view of most international jurists that the jurisdiction of a State in respect of extra-territorial crimes extends only to its citizens.  If it is expressed to extend, as it is in the Geneva Conventions Act, to more than its citizens alone, the entirety of the proceedings must take place within the jurisdiction, which, of course, is not proposed under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General, speaking in this House on the 26th of November, said:</P>
    <P>No one has suggested that Saorstát Éireann had not power to legislate with extra-territorial effect.  Its right to do so was beyond question.</P>
    <P>I beg leave to respectfully disagree with the Attorney General on that point. The series of judgments cited by Mr. Justice McMahon make it perfectly clear that, for a very long time, Saorstát Éireann had not power to legislate with extra-territorial effect.  In so far as it ever had power, that power was conferred, not by the Constitution of the Irish Free State, by any Act of Saorstát Éireann, or of the Parliament of Saorstát Éireann but, strangely enough, by the Stature of Westminster of 1931, section 2, subsection (3).  It is an extraordinary thing that apparently we, at that time, as a nation, were so subservient and lacking in independence that it was only when a statute of the Westminster Parliament was passed in 1931 we acquired the right to enact extra-territorial legislation. Therefore, the Attorney General is quite wrong in thinking that Saorstát Éireann always had the fullest powers in this regard.  It did not.  Of course, it is arguable that, notwithstanding the Statute of Westminster of 1931, that power was not a complete power.  It is arguable that the jurisdiction of the Westminster Parliament at that time would not extend to creating or taking away rights in relation to a matter such as this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> I do not want to attempt to preempt the argument of anybody who might wish to go before the High or Supreme Court in relation to this point.  But, if one had time to do sufficient research into these various cases cited by Mr. Justice McMahon, one might well find the situation that it was very questionable whether Saorstát Éireann, at the time of the expiration of the Free State Constitution, had in fact the powers that the Attorney General takes it for granted they had. It may well be quite possible to show that in fact they had not and it is possible to show that, if they had them, they had them only by virtue of section 2 of the Statute of Westminster of 1931.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General continued to say and I quote:</P>
    <P>An examination of the Bill establishes quite clearly that no attempt is being made to enforce the laws of the State outside its jurisdiction. Section 2 will make it an offence for a person to do in Northern Ireland an act which if done in the State would constitute one of the offences specified in the Schedule and such person can be proceeded against in respect of such offences only in the State.  Section 4 will make it an offence for an Irish citizen anywhere outside the State unlawfully and maliciously to cause an explosion as specified in the section.</P>
    <P>It has never been explained in a satisfactory manner to this House why this distinction arises, why in relation to explosives offences in Britain, Irish citizens only are amenable, but in relation to a wider category of offences in Northern Ireland, as it is put here, &ldquo;any person is amenable&rdquo;.  It is my suggestion that under international law any person cannot be made amenable and that offences which are created by sections 2 and 3 will have to be treated in the same way as the offences created by section 4 in relation to explosives in Britain.  If the Minister has some reason for making this distinction I would be glad to hear it in his reply.  On the face of it, there does not appear to be any valid reason for confining the liability for conviction in respect of British offences to Irish citizens but in <Col N="1261" /> attempting to extend the liabilities for Northern Ireland offences to any person.  The Minister should consider the implications of sections 6 and 7, particularly subsection (1) of section 7 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act when considering these matters.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make is completely different, but nonetheless is relevant to this Bill.  It was provided by the 1952 Foyle Fisheries Act that certain regulations which would be made under it should have the concurrence of our Department, of our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and the concurrence or approval of the Ministry for Commerce for Northern Ireland.  Subsequent to 1952 the powers of the Ministry of Commerce in Northern Ireland in relation to this particular matter were transferred by some form of statutory order to the Ministry for Agriculture in Northern Ireland.  No reference was made in any legislation of the Oireachtas to the fact of that transfer.  Mr. Justice McMahon's judgment in the Foyle Fisheries case said at page 11 of the typed copy of the judgment:</P>
    <P>In my opinion that transfer of functions does not render the approval of the Ministry for Agriculture for Northern Ireland sufficient to validate the regulations. That would require a statutory transfer of the power of approval from the Ministry for Commerce to the Ministry for Agriculture by an Act of the Oireachtas.  In my opinion a statutory requirement of our law cannot be altered or dispensed with by a law having effect in Northern Ireland only and can be altered only by legislation having the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the House, and in particular to the Minister, that there is a considerable danger that the problem which arose under the Foyle Fisheries Act and which resulted in those regulations being declared invalid and the convictions being quashed, can potentially arise in relation to this Bill because most of the cases in which the Bill will be used&mdash;<Col N="1262" /> 95 per cent of the proceedings&mdash;will take place in Northern Ireland.  By implication if the Oireachtas passes this Bill, they will be stating that the procedure at present in force in Northern Ireland in relation to the taking of evidence, the summoning of witnesses, and all the other things that will be relevant to the sitting of a Commission in Northern Ireland, is recognised by the Oireachtas for that purpose.  If that law in Northern Ireland is changed, it is done without reference to the Oireachtas, as the regulations under the Foyle Fisheries Act were changed.  Unless the Oireachtas approve of such changes, it is strongly arguable that such changes could not have statutory effect from our point of view.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers in a number of places&mdash;it is mentioned several times in section 20&mdash;to an offence under the law of Northern Ireland and subsection (7) refers to acts done in Northern Ireland, the absence of any licence or other authority requisite under the law of Northern Ireland relating to firearms, or a breach of a condition attached to any such licence.  The law in Northern Ireland dealing with firearms may be very unsatisfactory but it is now a stated fixed thing.  This Bill makes reference to the law of Northern Ireland, that is, as of the day this Bill is passed into law.  If the law of Northern Ireland in relation to firearms or any of the various other matters relevant to this Bill is subsequently changed, that change is made without the authority of the Oireachtas and, on the basis of Mr. Justice McMahon's decision in the Foyle Fisheries case, any subsequent change could not detrimentally affect an accused person who is being tried under the jurisdiction of our courts and any subsequent change would be <i>ultra vires</i> the powers created by this Bill.</P>
    <P>These matters should be considered in some depth.  They are indicative of the major problems this Bill is creating and of a few of the many ways in which this Bill will be a legal morass which will scarcely be workable in any fashion.  As soon as proceedings are taken under the Bill, as Deputy Lynch <Col N="1263" /> pointed out, the people charged under it and affected by it will go to the High Court and the Supreme Court.  It may be that parts of this Bill will be found unconstitutional or to be invalid on other grounds, but much of this Bill will be found impossible of enforcement.</P>
    <P>I want to take another small example of the rather hopeful provisions, on the part of the draftsman, in this Bill.  Section 19 (1) gives power of arrest without warrant.  It states:</P>
    <P>Any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be in the act of committing an offence under section 2 (1).</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) provides that:</P>
    <P>Where a person does in Northern Ireland an act that, if done in the State, would constitute an offence ... he would have been liable if he had done the act in the State.</P>
    <P>This applies only to acts of a criminal nature done in Northern Ireland.  Still section 19 (1) purports to give any person the power to arrest without warrant anyone who is in the act of committing an offence under section 2. Could there be an example of a more futile legislature than an tOireachtas giving power of arrest to any person which can only be exercised outside the jurisdiction of this Parliament?</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum makes some reference to this and says it is not likely to arise very often.  It cannot arise at all.  It is totally futile for this Parliament to seek to give a power of arrest outside its own jurisdiction.  The Bill, I am afraid, is riddled with anomalies and foolish provisions of this kind.  It goes on in subsection (2) of section 19 to give a similar power of arrest in relation to sections 2 (1) or 3 after the offence has been committed. There is some vague possibility that if somebody escaped from Northern Ireland and came down here it might be some use to give a power of arrest without warrant to any citizen.  It is really, again, basically, a futile provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill is full of provisions of this kind that I am afraid are futile.  Many <Col N="1264" /> people would regard the enormous powers of arrest without warrant that are given under section 19 as highly undesirable.  They are the kind of powers one would not expect to find being pushed nowadays.  If powers of arrest without warrant are to be given anew they should only be given to members of the Garda Síochána.  This very extensive power of arrest is being given to any citizen as well as being given subsequently to members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>In relation to what I said earlier on the question of a person's nationality I see there is a provision in section 20 (3) which states:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the said sections 2 or 3 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1883 a person shall be guilty of an offence under sections 2 or 3 whatever his nationality.</P>
    <P>Can that stand up?  It is a statement but it seems to conflict with international law and it seems to be unenforceable. It seems to be as futile a proposal as many of the other proposals which are contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately confined myself to talking about a few of the numerous legal problems that will arise if and when this Bill is passed and put into operation.  I have only dealt in some detail with a small number of them.  It seems to me that the Bill is fraught with enormous difficulties, more so than any I have ever seen in a Bill in the House during my time here.  I can see the first 12 months of the operation of this Bill being entirely suspended because of the large number of cases that will be pending at any given time in the High Court and the Supreme Court in order to have various aspects of this Bill clarified and a decision given as to whether or not they are valid provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill might be termed important in one sense.  It is important in the very limited sense that, as the Minister admitted in the course of a discussion here with Deputy Colley during Deputy Colley's speech last week, there is no precedent in this country <Col N="1265" /> or, so far as we know, elsewhere for what is being proposed in this Bill. The Bill is unimportant in the sense that it represents the totality, it would appear, of the Government's policy in relation to the enormous problem of Northern Ireland.  In my view the Bill will do nothing viable or constructive. Nobody in the House would more willingly support any Bill that would reduce violence or lessen tension than I.  I brought into the House and got passed through it after enormous difficulties the only modern legislation which is effective in regard to this matter.  Therefore, I would be the first person in Ireland to come out and welcome this Bill if I thought it was of any value.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that in my opinion this Bill is not of any value.  It has been heralded by the Government, and particularly in the British Press and the Unionist Press of Northern Ireland, as something of importance. No doubt they believe it is.  They believe it will achieve results of various kinds but, as has been pointed out in this debate already by more than one speaker, we had a statutory instrument made by the Government in December, 1973 in relation to the extra-territorial effect of the crime of murder under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  That was supposed to be a major contribution towards lessening terror and tension in Northern Ireland.  At the time it was heralded with great enthusiasm by members of the Government and some of their supporters.  Then our spokesman on justice was Deputy Andrews.  He said he thought it was a piece of window-dressing, that he did not envisage there was a likelihood of anyone actually being convicted under it.  Not alone was he right&mdash;this is two years later&mdash;that nobody was convicted under it but nobody, to the best of my knowledge, has been charged under it.  It is, fundamentally, a similar type of provision to this Bill except that this Bill contains section 11 which makes it different from anything else that has ever gone before.</P>
    <P>I lived for three years with the kind of situation the present Minister for <Col N="1266" /> Justice is living under.  I am well aware of the difficulties, and I venture to say that at the time I had to deal with those problems they were in many ways perhaps greater than they are now because the legislation, which is there now, was not there to deal with them.  It was only during my last few months as Minister for Justice that I had the sort of legislation which enables one to deal with the matter in a more effective fashion. I am at least as well aware as anyone else in the country and certainly in this House of what the problems involved in this whole field are.  I say to my successor that the greatest asset he has in dealing with any possible fugitive offenders from Northern Ireland is section 3 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972.  I have a question down on today's Order Paper.  I hoped I would not have to speak until afterwards so that I could have taken up a written reply.  The question I have down is:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Justice the number of applications for extradition received by the Garda Síochána from Northern Ireland and Britain in respect of terrorist type offences in each of the years 1969 to 1975 inclusive.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the answer is; I cannot get it until 4 o'clock but my guess, from my general observation, is that the number of warrants being sent is comparatively small because the number of so-called fugitive offenders is very small.  The reason is that if somebody commits a serious crime of the kind set out in the Schedule to this Bill in Northern Ireland and decides that he is in some danger of apprehension there, he will not, if he is the kind of person the Minister is dealing with here which will in practice generally be a member or an associate of the IRA, come to the Republic, certainly other than very briefly, because he is liable to be picked up here by the police and charged with membership of an illegal organisation&mdash;assuming he is a member, and a high proportion of the sort of people who presumably would be affected by this Bill are members of an illegal organisation.</P>
    <P>It cannot be suggested that members <Col N="1267" /> of loyalist paramilitary organisations are likely to want to come down here after committing crimes in Northern Ireland.  In practice, what is happening both in relation to people who commit certain types of crime down here and people who commit certain types of crime in most of Northern Ireland is that they are going into that part of Northern Ireland where nobody's writ runs and, if necessary, staying there for quite lengthy periods, that is the part of South Armagh close to the Monaghan border where there has been no policing by the Northern authorities for several years past other than occasional forays through the area in armoured cars or tanks and where there is no genuine policing and no proper exercise of civil jurisdiction over the area.  The number of so-called fugitive offenders coming down here after committing serious crimes in Northern Ireland in recent years subsequent to the passing of the Offences Against the State Act, 1972 is at least comparatively small and, in my opinion, probably very small.  I shall not be able to ascertain the actual figure until 4 o'clock when I get a written reply from the Minister to a question I have down, but I venture to think the figure might be as low as 20 or 30 a year and that many of those in respect of whom there are warrants are now in Portlaoise prison having been convicted of membership of an illegal organisation.  The virtual certainty on the part of many of those people that they will be convicted if they come down here is by far the most effective deterrent against their coming here.</P>
    <P>I wonder why in those circumstances it is necessary to introduce legislation that will have some extraordinary effects and put this State in the position that its own judiciary, who are very highly thought of in this country, will be forced to decide cases on evidence given by members of a force or forces that have been unquestionably guilty of serious breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>There was a newspaper report in the last week or 10 days to the effect that the European Commission which <Col N="1268" /> has been hearing the case brought by the Government of which I was a member against the British Government in respect of these matters has unanimously decided that Britain is guilty of the offences, the breaches of the Convention which we alleged, and that the matter is now about to be referred to the court for a final ruling. I do not know if the report is correct, but from one's knowledge of the facts there must be a high degree of likelihood that it is correct.  Whether it is or not, it is not seriously disputed by anybody, least of all by the British, that serious torture on a widespread scale took place on the part of the RUC and the British Army of people who were in their custody and who, generally speaking if not always, were not convicted at the time the torture took place.  Under this Bill our judges are supposed to act on the word of members of those forces which have been so discredited in the eyes of the world.  Is that fair to our judges as individuals and to our judiciary as an institution which has built up for itself as a body tremendous respect over the past 50 years for being impartial and fair and for giving the defendant, no matter what the circumstances, a fair trial at all times?</P>
    <P>We in this part of the country are inclined to assume that a police force is a fair body of men that need not be feared because we have here what is possibly the finest police force in the world&mdash;perhaps not in the sense of their having all the latest technical equipment and electronic devices that more sophisticated police forces may have, but certainly the finest in the sense that the respect in which they are held by the community at large cannot be equalled anywhere else.  We have in the other part of our country a police force which is totally discredited and which has shown itself to have strong sectarian affiliations and to investigate crimes committed by members of one part of the community there with great vigour&mdash; to such an extent that they have been brought before the European Commission on Human Rights in relation to it&mdash;but at the same time the same force totally refuses to make any investigation <Col N="1269" /> into equally horrendous crimes committed by another section of the community in Northern Ireland. These are the people that our judiciary are now expected to work with.</P>
    <P>Our judiciary will have no supervision over them.  If a member of our judiciary in hearing a criminal trial in this country feels that a member of the Garda Síochána acted improperly he has very definite jurisdiction.  He can order an inquiry to be held by the commissioner, the Attorney General or the DPP.  Our judges sitting in Northern Ireland, not as judges but listening to a commissioner taking evidence there, might well be revolted by much of what they hear from a police force but they are not in a position to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>We also have the position that has been adverted to by several speakers but, to the best of my knowledge, has not been answered by any Government speaker, that three of our judges will be expected to go to Northern Ireland, perhaps for several days at a time, to listen to a High Court judge of Northern Ireland taking evidence on commission.  Does the Minister realise the apprehension with which our judges must inevitably view any such exercise? Does the Minister realise, as I know the judges here realise, that three judges have been shot dead in Northern Ireland over the past 18 months or two years, that attempts have been made on the lives of other judges in Northern Ireland which happily did not succeed? Is there not at least as high a degree of likelihood that similar attempts would be made to shoot dead judges from this part of the country who would go up there to listen to evidence to be taken on commission?</P>
    <P>Are the RUC in a position to guarantee absolutely the safety of our judges who go up there?  I suggest they are not because of the whole lawless situation in Northern Ireland and the fact that policing in the accepted sense extends only to certain parts of that territory.  I do not know whether the judges have been consulted about this and their agreement obtained, but one would doubt very seriously that such consultation has taken place because <Col N="1270" /> if they were consulted I expect that the majority of them would not agree to the kind of situation they would find themselves in under section 11 of this highly unsatisfactory Bill.</P>
    <P>If it happens that for these reasons and others, section 11 proves to be of little use, the entire Bill will be of little use except in so far as the entirety of a trial can take place in the Twenty-six Counties.  I see no objection in principle to sections 2 and 3 subject to certain amendments which I might suggest for Committee Stage and provided the provision was confined to Irish citizens for acts committed outside our jurisdiction and was in accordance with the tenets of international law and provided, too, that the entirety of the trial took place in the Republic.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would suggest to the Northern Ireland Secretary that if the British and Northern Ireland authorities are so keen to have tried here the alleged fugitives from these two other areas, that they direct their own employees&mdash;the members of the RUC and the British Army who, normally, would be the only witnesses in matters of this kind&mdash;to come to Dublin and give evidence.  There is nothing to prevent the British authorities doing that.  Section 11 will not work but will create tremendous trouble.  Indeed, the Government should say that they have no wish to work it, that they want to drop it but that they are prepared to have fugitive offenders tried in the Republic, the only requirement being that the British and Northern Ireland authorities send witnesses down here.  In the case of civilians this may not be possible, but the majority of witnesses in these cases would be members of the RUC and the British Army.</P>
    <P>We are all anxious to ensure that any fugitive offenders are brought to trial, but let us try them in the way I suggest, thereby ensuring that no injustice is done to anyone, that judges will not be put in danger and that we will have a workable system. This does not seem to have occurred to the Minister or to the Government. The idea that this party have put forward consistently is for an all-Ireland <Col N="1271" /> court, but the Government have not made any effort in this regard.  The commission that sat subsequent to Sunningdale found this a very attractive idea but ruled against it on the ground that there would be a delay of several months in getting passed an amendment to the Irish Constitution. It is now two years after Sunningdale so the delay factor is no longer of any account.  Even if we were not to get an all-Ireland court over night could we not at least have a situation in which the obnoxious provision of section 11 would be removed?  It is my belief that there is only a mere handful of fugitive offenders within this jurisdiction: perhaps there are none, but if there are any they will probably go to South Armagh where they would appear to be as safe as they could be anywhere in the world, where they would be beyond the control of this Government and of the Northern Ireland authorities.  Why not try them here without this ridiculous requirement of a commission?  If, for legal or other purposes, the Government do not wish to establish an all-Ireland court there is nothing to stop them establishing extra-territorial jurisdiction subject to the reservations I have expressed.</P>
    <P>The Government must have agreed with some outside agency as to the provisions of this Bill, and their attitude is that no matter how clearly it has been demonstrated that it will not work they intend seeing it through.  If that is the position our best procedure as a political party would be to say: &ldquo;Fair enough, let it go through.  It is wrong in principle but it will not do any great harm since it will not work.&rdquo; Basically, that is my attitude to the Bill.  Apparently, we cannot prevent it going through because two Members who sit on the other side have said that notwithstanding their certainty that the Bill is wrong and obnoxious in every way they propose to vote for it because, otherwise, they would be thrown out of the Labour Party.  It is regrettable that people would approach any legislation in that way, but at least it has the redeeming feature that they have made clear their reason for voting for the Bill.  We have had many <Col N="1272" /> examples of people voting against their conscience but not admitting so.</P>
    <P>There is every reason to be apprehensive about the Bill, to believe that it is creating a very bad precedent, that some extraordinary injustices are likely to occur as a result of it.  However, since it cannot be workable, since I anticipate that various provisions of it will be challenged at an early date and possibly found invalid and, since, because of the passage of the 1972 Act, there is no significant number of fugitive offenders in the Republic, I am less concerned about the Bill than I would be if I thought it would have a serious effect.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the Bill and I will certainly vote against it, but neither I nor any one in my party is going to seek over a lengthy period to try in any way to obstruct its passage if the Government Whip is now in a position to get it through.  He has whipped into line various people in his own party who know that the Bill is totally wrong and obnoxious and who have said this. This may not be the best sort of approach to legislation.  It may be said that it is the duty of a Deputy, particularly a Deputy in Opposition, when he knows something is wrong and is going to be passed to try at all costs within the rules of order to prevent it being passed.  Because I believe that ultimately the Bill is futile and will be of little value and importance in the long term, I am not going to try to delay it any further.</P>
    <P>It has not been noted as widely as it might that as well as provisions for the type of trials and offences we have been talking about, for some reason that the Minister has not explained satisfactorily there are significant substantive changes in the ordinary criminal law contained in this Bill, interspersed here and there among other more controversial provisions.  Some of these substantive changes in the ordinary law are of importance.  There seems to be an extraordinary series of provisions to redefine a number of common crimes.  I am not sure why they need to be redefined; it may be an attempt to bring them into line with the Theft Act in England or there may be some other <Col N="1273" /> reason, but in most cases the penalties, which are already severe, seem to have increased considerably.  There are matters included in the Schedule to this Bill, for example burglary, that I do not think are appropriate there.  I cannot see the point of their being put in. It seems to me that the Schedule to this Bill is not on all fours with the list of offences scheduled under the order made in May, 1972, establishing the Special Criminal Court under Part V of the 1939 Act.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General in his speech here, to which I have referred already, stated that the operation of this Bill was not confined to the Special Criminal Court; in other words, it is open to a judge and jury or a district justice to hear some of the charges scheduled under this Bill.  However, as I have pointed out, section 11 which is the real nub of the Bill is confined to the Special Criminal Court and cannot be operated by a judge and jury or a district justice trying charges summarily.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Haughey has rightly pointed out, the effect of section 11 and the confining of it to the Special Criminal Court will be to institutionalise that court and to render more difficult the ending of the proclamation under Part V of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  There is a specific inducement to this and to any government in power at the time to continue that proclamation in force as long as possible because if they do not do it section 11 of this Bill becomes ineffective and inoperative.  Therefore, this Bill as a whole is of little value. It is wrong to put the temptation there to the Government to continue the proclamation under Part V in force for any longer than is necessary.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister saw fit to confine section 11 to the Special Criminal Court.  I can well foresee the difficulty of bringing a jury to Northern Ireland&mdash;it simply would not be feasible&mdash;but in relation to summary charges where only one judge would have to go, why did section 11 not apply?  It makes one suspicious that section 11 seems to be totally tied up with the Special Criminal Court and will not operate separately from it.</P>
    <P>I have not made any attempt to <Col N="1274" /> deal with the specific sections relating to some fairly significant changes in the criminal law which partially relate to crimes that are not subversive in character.  I hope to have the opportunity of dealing with them on Committee Stage.  In common with a huge number of people throughout the country, I am very apprehensive about the Bill and the precedent it creates.  The only reason that perhaps I worry less about it than I might in other circumstances is that I regard the Bill as unlikely to work and as unlikely to be operated very significantly. In particular, I am of the opinion that the number of fugitive offenders who might be affected by it at present in the Republic of Ireland is very small and is not likely to grow. The reason that figure is not likely to grow is because of the existence of section 3 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister, as he so frequently reminded me in 1971 and 1972, that during those years and up to the time of the passing of that Bill one of the major problems I and the Government had was the fact that certain types of people who were well known to be associated with the IRA, either in the North or in this State, could flaunt themselves around this city and in various parts of the country because there was insufficient evidence as the law then stood to charge them.  There was nothing that could be done.  We have not had that situation since December, 1972, and for the very same reason that we have not those people flaunting themselves around nowadays, equally we do not have fugitive offenders flaunting themselves around.</P>
    <P>It was always part of British propaganda during the entire time I was Minister for Justice and subsequently to suggest that in some way the Northern Ireland troubles had a huge Southern Irish content.  As Minister I was at pains on many occasions to point out how untrue that was, and my successor has had to do the same on several occasions.  There were several thousand people interned in Northern Ireland in the four years and four months that internment lasted, and less than 1 per cent of <Col N="1275" /> those interned came from the Republic or were directly connected with it.  In itself that is the greatest admission that the British and Northern Ireland authorities could make in relation to the untruth of the propaganda they have tried to create.</P>

      <P>I have nothing further to say on this Bill except that I regret to see it being pushed through the House.  I genuinely and sincerely believe this Bill is a mistake and could do a great deal of damage.  Because of the nature of it I think its effectiveness so far as its major sections are concerned will be very limited.  On the Committee Stage I would like to examine in detail the individual sections, particularly those relating to crimes which are not necessarily subversive and, if the Second Stage is passed, at least the Bill might be made less bad than it is by a great number of amendments being made to it.  I would hope the Minister would be at one with us in seeking to improve various aspects of the Bill though it is our belief that there are certain aspects of it beyond improvement.  I do not think certain sections will work, and no matter what way they were amended they would still be undesirable. In fact, they should never be there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So much has been said on the legal aspect of this Bill that I shall not deal to any great extent with the objections from that point of view, though I may refer to them.  I shall direct myself to the overall impact.  The one thing that puzzles me and a great many other people is why, apart altogether from the objectionable features of the Bill, when we were discussing some time ago the much lauded Sunningdale Agreement Members on the Government benches exhorted us to look at that agreement as a package because it was all or nothing. Since then it has become obvious that it was nothing because the whole thing blew up and just did not work, as some <Col N="1276" /> of us pointed out very forcibly; we pointed out that it never had a hope and was nothing more than a lot of codswallop.  It is amazing now to find this Government coming along with one objectionable remnant of that particular agreement and pushing it through this House against the wishes of some of their own party members who will ultimately support it in the Division Lobby.  The Minister must on behalf of the Government tell us why this small part of the Sunningdale Agreement has now been resurrected, taken out of the package, the package we were warned must be taken <i>in toto</i> and not piecemeal.  Overall the argument was that the objectionable had to become palatable and had to be taken with the entire package.  That was emphasised until we were sick of it. May we have an explanation as to why the departure now from &ldquo;the package&rdquo;? We are entitled to this.  The country is entitled to this.</P>
      <P>This Bill, as has been stated by other speakers, is objectionable on many grounds, not least of which are constitutional grounds.  It is in contravention of international conventions.  No one will dispute that because it is a fact.  It is also contrary to established law and practice and to what we regard as natural justice.  That, too, cannot be refuted.  The idea of evidence on commission just cannot be sold.  The credibility of the judiciary in the Six Counties is, to say the least of it, very doubtful.  By their own records that judiciary is not a credible outfit and it is one with which we should not have any dealings whatsoever.</P>
      <P>This Bill, if it becomes law, will be discriminatory in that it will apply practically without exception to only one section and, God knows, that section have had enough discrimination visited on them over the years without our adding to it by treating these people as if they were scapegoats. There is one important aspect of which the Government may not have taken cognisance.  This Bill could be the door through which trouble of the nature the Six Counties has endured over the last six years would reach this side of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are really doing in effect in <Col N="1277" /> this Bill is denying the right of political asylum and refusing to acknowledge the existence of the accepted concept of political offences.  We are a party to international agreements on extradition. In this Bill we are proposing to uphold these in theory but not in spirit by adopting certain backdoor methods. We are, in fact, proposing to ignore that which internationally we have become a party to over the years.  This is something out of which the Government cannot talk their way.  I may not be representing a general view but I believe if this is to be done it should be done openly rather than by the back door.  If it is our belief that political offences, and extradition in relation to them, is to change then I would prefer it was done honestly rather than as proposed in the Bill by back door methods.</P>
    <P>The question of the constitutionality of the Bill has been ably dealt with by many speakers but it is no harm to reiterate the belief held by many, not just lay people but by some of our legal people, that section 2 of the Bill violates Article 2 of the Constitution. That Article states:</P>
    <P>The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas.</P>
    <P>The Constitution therefore does not acknowledge what is known of as &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; to exist as a separate State.  For that reason section 2 appears to clearly violate Article 2 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>On the question of constitutionality there is the situation where provision is made in the Bill for the taking of evidence on commission.  In this regard I feel that the established law, and the practice of law and natural justice, is completely flouted and violated.  I understand that in civil cases the situation in regard to evidence and the obtaining of a conviction depends on the balance of probabilities whereas in criminal cases a prosecution to succeed must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the case being brought.  In this operation can we in any way conclude that evidence taken on commission before 6-county judiciary, 99 per <Col N="1278" /> cent of which would be tendered by members of the security forces there and transmitted down here to be used, can prove anything beyond any sort of doubt not to mention a &ldquo;reasonable doubt&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I understand that in civil cases this evidence may not be taken on commission nor has the court the power to hear evidence given on commission where one of the parties to the proceeding <i>bona fide</i> desires the production of a witness for cross-examination. It is indisputable that evidence on commission cannot be provided and that the court cannot order the hearing of that evidence where one of the parties to the proceedings genuinely desires the production of a witness for cross-examination.  However, in criminal proceedings we will have evidence taken on commission, which evidence must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of the person before the court.  We are certainly treading on very thin ice there.  Has the Minister, and the Government, satisfied themselves, apart from the objectionable nature of the Bill and leaving it out of the context in which it is framed, as to the impact it will have in regard to normal procedures in law in civil or criminal cases?  If this is going to flout the established, recognised procedures and the rules of our existing courts and judicial proceedings, how are we going to uphold such in the future?  How can we hold that rule 1 of Order 39 of the Supreme Court, 1962, will apply in future if it is being flouted in this legislation?</P>
    <P>Would it be sauce for the goose and something else for the gander? Are we seriously looking at this with no great feeling that we may be doing great damage to well-established and ordered proceedings in our courts, practised over the years and perhaps perfected as a result of that practice? Do we throw that out the window now in order to accommodate something I cannot understand?  Why are we proposing this at all?  It was part of a disreputable package and it is now only the tattered remnants of that package.  Are we getting anything in return for this?  What benefit do we hope to derive from this?  Where is <Col N="1279" /> the give and take we heard was contained in the Sunningdale Agreement? It does not seem to be in the Bill, which is all give and no take.  In the giving there is the creation of a great deal of trouble for ourselves, the creation of a situation wherein we may have more trouble than we have known in the past.</P>
    <P>Leaving the latter aside, the Bill will mean the upending of clearly well-defined and established legal practices perfected over the years and contained in rules of court.  We should be told what we will get for this offering.  The question of credibility of the witnesses who in the great majority of cases will be giving evidence on commission before 6-county judges also arises.  These witnesses will, to a great extent, be members of the RUC, the Special Branch of the Six Counties, and members of the UDR which is the remnants of the &ldquo;B Specials&rdquo; of past notoriety. It is hardly necessary for me to bring home to our citizens the type of people who are likely to come forward if they are the remnants of the &ldquo;B Specials&rdquo; now wearing UDR uniforms.  While I might appear to be harsh on our Irish people in the uniforms of the RUC, UDR and on the non-uniformed Special Branch up there, we can top that off by including among the unlikely witnesses giving evidence on commission up there members of the British Army of occupation, perhaps members of the SAS with whom we are not so familiar down here but in respect of whom we have grave suspicions that some of the violence that has occurred here could have been and likely was brought about by members of that disreputable organisation.</P>
    <P>We may well find in the future, if these proposals become law, that we will have giving evidence members of the notorious paratroop regiment who under Colonel Wilford brought about a predetermined massacre in Derry on Bloody Sunday.  It is from these organisations that the witnesses will be drawn who will produce the evidence and fulfil our role of doing for the British what the British have failed to <Col N="1280" /> do for themselves not alone in the last two years but over the centuries.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we are reacting or over reacting in a dangerous way to the criticisms that have been levelled, day in day out over six years, by people of the Loyalist groupings in the Six Counties, but more particularly by some British statemen, that we are not doing enough on this side of the Border.  I have always held that under the last Government and under this one these charges have been totally unfounded, that far from there being any truth that the Government here were not doing enough, in my estimation they were doing far more than was required of them and at a cost to our community that we can ill afford, and that the British Government, with the established forces of the Six Counties, were incapable of doing though they were on the ground much more thickly that we were capable of putting security forces on the ground here.</P>
    <P>At one stage there were upwards of 40,000 personnel between army, Special Branch, RUC, UDR and all the behind-the-scenes operators that go with such organisations in the Six Counties, and they were not able to do the job and they continuously blamed the Irish Government.  Are we overreacting to those criticisms?  Is this Bill a palliative to those critics who could not do the job themselves, despite their heavy concentration of forces, the jobs we are now proposing to do for them?</P>
    <P>If that is the situation I say to the Minister and the Government: &ldquo;Do not be codded by that sort of talk. You have done your share, far more than you should have been doing, but on the pure basis of what you have done as measured against those of your critics, you have done a lot more than they have done in the last years.  You do not owe them anything on that score&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>By attempting to operate this measure we are creating a danger that we have not so far encountered.  Do we at all these days recall some of the earlier happenings or indeed even later ones?  Can we recall the first brutality when a child called Rooney was shot in his bed in Divis Street at the outset <Col N="1281" /> of the most recent troubles?  In relation to that, do we recall the inquiry that was held and that even from that loaded inquiry it emerged that the shooting and the use of arms by the subjects of the Crown on that night were, to put it in my own words, wanton and unnecessary and uncalled for?  Do we also recall at an early stage a case about which there was quite a lot of publicity, the death of Devenny in Derry?  Do we recall the upshot of the investigation?  That man was kicked to death, to put it quite bluntly.  The inquiry thereafter glossed things over but there is not any doubt in the mind of anyone in relation to that happening that it was again the forces of so-called law and order in Derry who were totally responsible for his death.</P>
    <P>Let us look a little further on to the death of Gallagher in Armagh who was shot by B Specials.  Though that was regarded as an uncalled for action, there was never any prosecution of a member of the force that shot Gallagher on that night.  The more recent case was that of McElhone nearer to us in Derry.</P>
    <P>If there is anything this House suffers from it is the lack of knowledge of the situation that obtains today in the Six Counties and that has obtained there for many years.  We forget it exists or that it did exist. Every few months Members of this House visit the North unannounced. Some of us even pass through the Six Counties to get from one point of the South to another.  We have gathered firsthand knowledge of the intimidation that still goes on on public roadways between parts of our own 26-county territory.  This should have a salutary effect on the thinking and outlook of this House which is not, in my view, representing the true situation but has self-wished itself into a situation where there is no problem up there other than to get rid of the men of violence, who, when it comes down to its net point, are the IRA only.  This is nonsense, a complete refuting of the known facts in relation to violence in the Six Counties. Rooney, McElhone, Gallagher and the others were all citizens of the Six <Col N="1282" /> Counties, Michael Leonard, a citizen of this 26-county State, the Republic of Ireland, a resident of a Border area up beyond Pettigo, was shot down by the RUC 100 yards from the Border outside Pettigo, on the Belleek-Pettigo road and the only thing that was allegedly against young Leonard was that he had been fined for not taxing a car in the Six Counties and the fine had not been paid and the police wanted him for that.</P>
    <P>They followed and gave chase to his car on that date towards the Border and rather than let him escape this fellow who had apparently committed no greater offence than an outstanding fine for tax was shot to death.  Did we do anything about it?  Did we make any noise about this citizen of ours who was shot down in cold blood by the RUC who were chasing him towards the Border and shot him before he crossed it?  Surely, if we had any thought at all we should beware.</P>
    <P>These are only a very few incidents, and I have cited a very few unfortunates of the many unfortunates who have been done down by the forces of law and order, so-called, in the Six Counties over recent years, not to talk about the other years when there was not a great deal of noise or a great deal of publicity about the situation in the Six Counties, as there is now.</P>
    <P>Leonard was our citizen by any standard, by any examination, and we did nothing about it.  I did attempt at the time to get some information about it.  We did not have any representative present at the ultimate inquest.  Does this House realise that the car in which Leonard was shot has never been produced since then, that it has never been seen since it was taken away by the police on the Six Counties side of the Border, that it has not been possible to ascertain whether he was shot through the back of the car or through the front of the car?  We here in this Government, we here in this Parliament, we here in this truncated State were not represented at that inquest, nor do I know that any evidence or any inquiry was sought by our Government or got by our Government in regard to the death of one of our own citizens of the southern side of <Col N="1283" /> the Border who was shot down in daylight by the RUC in their jeep, and for no greater offence than that he was wanted for an unpaid fine for an untaxed car.</P>
    <P>That is not too long ago, but a more recent case that perhaps is even more striking is the case of the killing of Leo Nurney, and that case raises many questions yet unanswered.  This incident concerns not only the RUC and their role or lack of role in the after effects of this lad's death but concerns the British troops as well.  Leo Nurney was killed by British troops.  He was from Belfast and was 17 years of age. What I am asking here and what many others have asked for some months past since his death is, first, why was his body taken to Springfield Road police station when the obvious normal procedure was to have the body removed to a hospital or to a city morgue?  Secondly, no explanation has been offered for the condition of Nurney's body, but the available fact is that it was badly mutilated.  The question that arises is, was Nurney dead when he was removed to the police station?  The fact that he was removed to a police station would seem to indicate that he was not dead at the time.</P>
    <P>If he was dead at that time, why was he taken there, and in relation to there being no explanation of the condition of his body as ultimately established in fact, the question which badly requires an answer is, was that lad beaten after the shooting incident, was he not dead as a result of the shooting but was he subsequently maimed and multilated and died as a combination of these happenings?  The British Army were responsible for the shooting of him.  The RUC were responsible thereafter. If he was dead he should not and would not have been taken to a police station.  If he were shot only, how come that parts of his body were mutilated, as is a fact established after his death?</P>
    <P>Of course, that the authorities, in accordance with their laws, would establish who was responsible for the mutilation of this boy's body is something that, while we may ask for, we do not expect because we have had so <Col N="1284" /> many cases over the years of these so-called law and order keepers not doing that in an impartial way.  To expect it in this case is to expect the impossible.</P>
    <P>I could go on giving lists of incidents. I do not want to do that.  I must give some in order to jog the memory of the House, in order to jog the memory of a public that has been brainwashed so much by not only the propaganda poured out by the British Army who have a big staff doing just this and by the Six Counties' media where the loyalist point of view can be put across, but by our own media, by our own Government, by our spokesmen.  Our people have been brainwashed into a belief that if there is a problem it is not our problem, if there is a problem in the Six Counties there is only one lot responsible for it and that the matter is as simple as this: get rid of the IRA and you have got rid of all your problems, whereas, in fact, we know the situation is far from being as simple as that.</P>
    <P>It is because of the circumstances above there that we ever have had the IRA as we know them.  It is not because of the IRA's creation of violence that we have the situation in the Six Counties but it is because of the institutionalised violence of the Establishment in the Six Counties that we have violence and that we have counter-violence coming from the nationalist population whether it be through the IRA or whatever particular brand you wish to call them.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to be fair in our approach to the matter, and certainly, whether wittingly or unwittingly, over the years we have brainwashed our own population to a point where this most doubtful, this highly objectionable proposed legislation may become law and may&mdash;I say &ldquo;may&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;may be accepted by that brainwashed population.  It is only if the population have been sufficiently brainwashed by the combined efforts of all on both sides of the Border and by British spokesmen as well that it will be possible for such a law as this to be enacted, being objectionable on all the various grounds that it is objectionable, being contrary to all sorts of national justice, established <Col N="1285" /> law practice, contrary to international conventions and agreements, contrary, in the first or last analysis, to our Constitution.  It is only if they have been sufficiently brainwashed they will accept this law.  It is initially only that they will accept it because, as it will proceed and be seen in practice for what it is, with all the faults we have tried to point out, in time, not for very long, if at all, our public will not have it.  If these proposals become law in no way will I, as an individual co-operate, as a Member of this House or otherwise, in the perpetration of the injustices inherent in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would say seriously to the Government: in view of the fact that they are really dicing with death on this side of the Border by proposing to put into law this absolutely outlandishly objectionable Bill, would they not even yet, and without any loss of face, show they are as big as they have given people to understand, pause and have a rethink on this Bill?  Has it gone beyond the time when there could be a retraction, even a slowing down, saying: right, we have gone so far with it but let us take another hard look at it, this particularly in view of the fact that among the Members of the party supporting the Government who will vote this Bill through by their superior numbers in this House, when the vote comes to be taken, there is not a majority?  There is a majority of them there but there is not a majority in this House if one counts those people in those two parties who are against the principles enshrined in the Bill but who, for various reasons &mdash;party or otherwise&mdash;will vote for it.</P>
    <P>Indeed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach himself has certain misgivings about it, and I am not labouring that because he is present.  In the circumstances existing I sincerely ask the Government at this stage to call a halt to the proceedings of this Bill in order that it be re-examined because of its dangers, its unjust nature and the possibility it can do a great deal more damage than any good its wellwishers would aspire to.  I can see very little good it could possibly do <Col N="1286" /> even in the best circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis&mdash;and I am not making any political capital out of this&mdash;if there was a free vote in the House I do not believe this Bill would be carried.  If the Government's view coincides with mine in that regard&mdash; and I think probably it would on that sort of estimation; that it would not be carried by a free vote of the House, then I ask the Government to consider the postponement or withdrawal of this Bill.  Putting it through by what one might almost call, I will not say a &ldquo;contrived majority&rdquo;&mdash;that is reserved for the operations we know have gone on over the years in the Six Counties&mdash; but by an imprisoned majority, if you like, gives the outward appearance of having a majority in the House when, at heart, there is not a majority capable of carrying this if they had the freedom to vote according to their own beliefs and dictates at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Although it may be contrary to the strict terms of the order of the House, it is interesting to hear this come from a man whom I regard as not merely talking for the <Col N="1287" /> sake of talking but as one who believes in what he says.  He asks me: do I want this to be used as a haven and do I want the reverse to be used in the Six Counties for people going from here to there?  I do not want either being used as havens for anything other than for the people of this island.  I do not want this island occupied by forces that do not belong to it.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would examine the Bill even further&mdash;I am sure he has examined it very deeply&mdash;when in addition to the reservations and doubts he has already, he would probably see it is totally discriminatory law, even if there was no other objection to it, for the simple reason that we are asking our people and this House to pass a Bill that will provide for the taking up of prosecutions on behalf of the accusers from the Six Counties of people allegedly guilty of crime on that side of the Border, crimes of terrorism, violence, explosives and so on.  That is what we are asking the Dáil to pass&mdash; a law providing for that and, in order that it be put into operation, we are providing for evidence on commission to be taken before a totally discredited, partial judiciary that constitutes merely the remnants of the puppets set up by the Stormont regime when it was there and, incidentally, whose record&mdash; from their own statistics&mdash;gives us a picture of the partiality and lack of hope that any Nationalist or Catholic can hope to expect from those courts. This is the judiciary on which we here will ask our courts and our judiciary to rely under this Bill.  It will be in those courts and before the people of that judiciary up there whose record shows an anti-Catholic, anti-Nationalist bias in their jurisdiction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There will be a facade, yes.  Before I even give the figures resulting from a sample return of May and June, 1974, of a simple study carried out then, it demonstrated the following: that the average prison sentence handed out by the judges in the courts in the Six Counties for similar offences shows that the Catholic or Nationalist can expect two years for every one given to his counterpart on the Loyalist side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I read those figures and they made the same impression on me as they do on the Deputy.  All I am saying is that the Northern judges, under the section the Deputy is speaking about, will not have the job of judges but merely of commissioners sitting in the chair while evidence is taken in the presence of, if you like, three Dublin judges.  Evidence is taken by question and answer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>While it may appear contrary to the strict rules of the House I do not regard it as an interruption at all, in that I feel it is helpful to get this sort of reaction from the Parliamentary Secretary because it clearly indicates to me that the theory, as propounded in relation to the proposals in the Bill, appeals to the legal minds particularly and, by their influence, to the minds of any other group or party in this House. But the actual practice is far removed from the theory propounded in these proposals.  While the judge so mentioned may only appear to be the <Col N="1289" /> presiding officer at the taking of evidence, this in no way justifies a recognition of those puppets who were planted, put and kept there by an establishment for their own political usages.  Their record in their own jurisdiction is two years for a Catholic or Nationalist and one year for a Loyalist for the same offence.</P>

The Dangerous Substances Act can be brought into force as soon as the drafting of regulations dealing with explosives and petroleum are completed.  In addition other chemical substances which might be dangerous are being investigated.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Tháinig toscaireacht ó Acaill chugamsa tamall ó shin maidir le deacrachtaí a bhí ag an tionscal sin agus d'iarr mé ar Ghaeltarra Éireann gach dícheall a dhéanamh chun na deacrachtaí sin a shárú.</P>
      <P>Níor mhol Gaeltarra Éireann domsa go ndúnfaí an mhonarcha tamall ó shin.</P>
      <P>Bhí easpa teicneolaíochta ar an gcomhlacht agus, mar sin, níor éirigh go maith leis an gnó.  D'aontaigh Bord Ghaeltarra, ar a saor thoil fhéin, go gcuirfidh siad airgead ar fáil don chomhlacht chun an fhostaíocht a chosaint fhaid is a bhí cuardach ar siúl chun teacht ar fhoinse teicneolaíochta oiriúnach don ghnó.  I dtuairim an bhoird bhí sé riachtanach an fhoireann a choimeád le chéile toisc taithí agus eolas ar leith a bheith acu maidir le hobair proiseála quartz.  Tháinig Gaeltarra ar an gcinneadh in aineoin nach bhfuil siad freagrach as dliteannaisí an comhlachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faoin scéim seo, tá Gaeltarra ag <Col N="1296" /> chur an méid airgid is lú ar fáil don chomhlacht go dtí go mbeidh scéala cinnte ann faoi sholáthar teicneolaíochta.</P>
    <P>Tugtar le fios dom gur gearradh an soláthar leictreachais agus an guthán tamall ó shin de bhrí nár íocadh na billí in am.  De réir an scéim speisialta a chuir Gaeltarra i bhfeidhm, íocadh as na billí seo in a dhiaidh sin agus cuireadh na seirbhísí ar fáil arís.  Níor thugas aon ordú do Ghaeltarra sa gcás agus ní raibh aon ghá go dtabharfainn.</P>
    <P>Níl mórán déantúsaíochta ar siúl faoi láthair sa mhonarcha agus caithfear fanacht ar na torthaí a bheadh le comhchainteanna atá ar siúl i láthair na huaire chun teacht ar theicneolaíocht don gnó.  Táthar ag súil go mbeidh toradh fónta go luaith.</P>
    <P>Glacaim agam nár éirigh go ró-mhaith leis an tionscail seo ach, ag an bpointe seo, tá sé mar phríomh-aidhm agam a chinntiú go sárófar na deacrachtaí agus go leanfar leis an dtionscal.</P>

Sí an phríomh-aidhm atá agamsa ná an tionscal beag seo atá bunaithe ar cheann de na h-achmhainní nádúra is fearr in iarthar na hÉireann a shábháil.  Mar adúras, bhuail mé le toscaireacht mhór ó cheantar Acla.  Fuair mé achainí óna lán daoine agus na Teachtaí Dála sa dháilcheantar sin a chur san áireamh.  Ní raibh aon fhó-thoghchán i gceist i ndeireadh Mhí Iúil.  D'iarr mé ar Ghaeltarra Éireann, mar adúras san bhfreagra iomlán a thug mé, a <Col N="1297" /> ndícheall a dhéanamh chun an t-easpa teicneolaíochta a chomhlíonadh. Tuigim anois go bhfuil ag éirí go maith leis na cúrsaí agus go mbeidh toradh fónta ar fáil go luath.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he proposes to increase the size of the standard viable holding as recognised by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Under current policy the Land Commission aim to provide family farms of 40 to 45 acres of good land or the equivalent in land of mixed quality which may be 50 to 60 acres or more. Having said that, I might say too that I already told the House that the test of viability should be the amount of land which enables a farmer to make a decent living when compared with other sections of the population.  With modern farming techniques and different types of intensive farming enterprises the application of a set acreage limit may possibly tend to be less appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the farm modernisation scheme the development plan is based on the concept of the comparable <Col N="1312" /> income.  Those family size development farmers who are certified to need additional land to achieve that income can have priority from the Land Commission in land becoming available under the farm retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>A further material point is that there can be no question of acceding to excessive demands for additional land since pitching the figure too high would inevitably mean that fewer people could, in economic security, be settled on the land.  It is against that set of considerations that any adjustment of the concept of a viable holding has to be tested and the consideration also that the technology available for efficient production is constantly improved. However, I am keeping the matter under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider 45 adjusted acres a viable holding?  Would it not depend on where the farm was situated and the type of farming carried on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Land Commission's policy at the moment is to provide up to 45 adjusted acres.  As the Deputy knows, that might be 60 or 70 acres in one part of the country and it would be dead-on 45 acres in another part of the country.  In modern times probably the best test of what is a viable farm is the type of farming in which the farmer is engaged.  I accept that but I do not accept that, even with that consideration, it is possible to give an unlimited amount of land or to increase the policy size of Land Commission farms away up because to do so would reduce the number of people who could be settled on the land and that is against national policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the standard of acceptability, especially of younger farmers, is rising also and that it will be necessary in the future to contemplate the raising of this notional figure of 45 adjusted acres and, if I may anticipate a question which will not be reached today, could the Minister give any indication of whether there will be a change in the Land Commission's <Col N="1313" /> approach in the context of a leasing arrangement that may be made in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I would prefer to deal with one question at a time, otherwise there will be confusion.  I accept that the acceptable standard of a viable farm is increasing but the Deputy will also agree that the volume of production on farms is going up and that a farm that could carry, say, 25 or 30 cows 40 years ago is now carrying far more.  I accept that a higher standard is required but what I am saying is that the same quantity of land if properly farmed and worked can produce a better standard of living than the same farm would have produced years ago.  I do not accept that we can go on and on increasing the acreage from 45 to 50 and so on because to do so would be to eliminate the small moderate size farms and to reduce the number of people who could be settled on the land and I do not think that that would be in the national interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned I was dealing with the credibility or otherwise of the Judiciary in the Six Counties.  I held then and I hold now that they are not a credible, reputable or impartial Judiciary. Their record over the years, particularly in recent times, shows on the statistics available that they are neither fair nor impartial in the administration of their own laws.  Therefore the participation of any member of the Six Counties Judiciary in the taking of evidence on commission for the purpose of prosecuting a person held by our courts here accused of some crime in the Six Counties is something we cannot countenance. The presence of such a member, far from lending credibility to the proceedings, must create in the minds of all that this is but a further part of the already loaded situation, the unfair and unjust situation created on a selective basis, and I emphasise &ldquo;selective&rdquo;.  That selection and selectivity, in the practical application of what is proposed here if this Bill becomes law, means that only Catholics and Nationalists will in fact be before our courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are options available and a person taken in the Six Counties may opt to be tried in the Six <Col N="1323" /> Counties.  In the light of the records to date a person of the Loyalist persuasion taken here, which is really a rather unlikely happening, will opt to go back to the courts where partiality is well established and where he can hope on the statistics of sentences handed out there to get only half the penalty in the Six Counties that he would get if he were prosecuted here, only half the sentence, in fact, that a Catholic or a Nationalist would get were he to opt to return to the Six Counties for trial.  It is pretty obvious that the only people who will opt for trial in the Six Counties, taken down here for an offence allegedly committed in the Six Counties, will be those of the Loyalist group.  They will go back knowing the courts will be partial and they will get light sentences. The Nationalist or the Catholic taken on this side on a charge, whether genuine or trumped up, if he opts to go back will be likely to get the hammer, whether justified or otherwise, and his sentence will be double what it would be if he were a Loyalist.</P>
    <P>However much I may take issue with the lack of impartiality on the part of members of the Judiciary in the Six Counties, this is not at all as important as the source at which evidence will be taken in chambers or in court presided over by a member of the Judiciary.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach interjected: &ldquo;Really the judge from up there would not be doing much.  He would only be presiding.&rdquo; I agree he will preside and his role will be that of chairman more than anything else, but that does not take away from the overall objection fair-minded people must have when they consider the source at which evidence will be taken, transcribed no doubt, carted down here and put in evidence before our courts.  That evidence will be taken in 90 per cent of cases&mdash;and that is being conservative&mdash;from personnel of the RUC, and UDR, the Special Branch, the British Army, SAS, paid informers and other well <Col N="1324" /> wishers.  There will be no disinclination to come forward with either true or false evidence to get at those who do not politically agree with them.  That has been clearly demonstrated over the years.</P>
    <P>This is the sad situation we can contemplate.  Our courts will be abused.  We will provide this sort of trial here against all the established practice in our courts over the years and we will do it on the basis that it can only be applied selectively to Nationalists or Catholics accused by the 6-county authorities. But the Loyalist will opt to go back to where he knows he will get a soft deal.  The Nationlist or the Catholic will not be able to go back even to hear the evidence against him taken on commission. He will not go back because, no matter what guarantees are given, he will fear going back into the custody of the RUC who, in the first instance, will in all probability have been responsible for handing him across the Border, possibly on trumped up charges or untrue charges.</P>
    <P>Remember, we are dealing here with people who helped in the internment round-up operation on 9th August, 1971, who allied themselves with the British troops, who had no legal authority at all to intervene but were never challenged, and who subsequently participated in the torture procedures of which the Government are well aware and in respect of which the Government have been pursuing the British Government in international courts, without so far arriving at any conclusion.  The Government are far better aware than are the members of the public or I or anybody else in the House, in particular the Minister for Justice is fully aware, of the type of tortures, the inhuman treatment, the brutality that was used by the RUC in some of their interrogation centres together with and connived at by some of their high officers and in conjunction with the British Army.</P>
    <P>These are the people who we are saying will give evidence before a discredited judicial functionary presiding <Col N="1325" /> in chambers or in court in the Six Counties.  These are the people who will give the evidence that will be taken down from those proceedings and used in our courts without the basic, elementary and essential right to which every accused person is entitled on demand, namely, to be confronted by his accusers in open court at his trial and thus given the opportunity to refute their accusations should he wish to do so.  That right is being totally ignored.  While in certain circumstances it might conceivably be excused, it is a travesty of justice in every sense of the word that in the case of accused persons who we suspect will come before our courts under this Bill if it becomes law their accusers will, in fact, be the persons who will be giving the evidence and their accusers and those giving the evidence will be the same forces as perpetrated the tortures and the inhuman treatment and the brutalities that followed on the operation of internment some years ago.</P>
    <P>I cannot credit that any government in this part of the country should attempt to do such a thing, even if they had extraordinarily good reasons for doing it and even if the end that they contemplated could in some way be accepted as justifying the means.  In the case of this extraordinary departure from the normal procedures of justice, not only in this country but in most countries, no justification is advanced as to why extraordinary exceptions should be made in regard to the basic elementary right of an accused person to be confronted by his accusers and given the opportunity to cross-examine.</P>
    <P>Can we get from the Government good and cogent reasons as to why an attempt should be made to deny accused persons in our courts this absolutely fundamental right which is long established and accepted as the right of an accused person?  Can we get from the Government or their spokesmen any indication that there is clear evidence of a change in so far as the RUC, the UDA, the ex-B Specials, which they mainly are, Special Branch, British Army, or that they are different from what they <Col N="1326" /> were a year or five years ago?  I am not aware of any change, and I would have as good an opportunity of recognising a change as most people in this House.</P>
    <P>I would make this observation to the Minister and the Government as to the operations of the British Army as of now in regard to intimidation in the everyday movements of our people: there is one route from Dublin through the Six Counties that comes in for special treatment, that has been given special intimidatory treatment over the years and given it persistently at the present time.  It is not the route to Belfast, as one might expect.  It is the route that must be traversed by the people of the outpost of the Twenty-six Counties, my own county people and, of course, the people of Derry.  It is through Moy Bridge and either Craigavon Bridge, if you live on the nationalist side of Derry city or Strabane Bridge if you live in Donegal.  Why, I ask, has nothing been done about this?  Why is it not obvious to the Government that there is discrimination and that this hold-up, this continuous, regular searching and delay being caused to our people from Derry and Donegal is a deliberate thing which is not applied to the people going back to Belfast but which is applied on that particular route because the people there are likely to be of a particular persuasion?  This goes to show, if anything further were necessary, that the leopard has not changed its spots.  We still have the institutional violence, and violence this is.</P>
    <P>I would invite any member of this House to go unannounced and without special arrangements being made for his expeditious and safe passage through the Six Counties, to go there, particularly on a Friday evening or on a Sunday on which there is a big sports event south of the Border and he will see the queues right back to the other side of the Border and will experience the totally unnecessary delays that are occasioned, delays of up to two-and-a-half hours, never less than half an hour and on average up to an hour.  Why is there special treatment on that route?  Why are there the outposts built in concrete?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> Why have special ramps been put down recently?  Why is there all this paraphernalia provided by people to whom by what we are proposing in this Bill we will lend our aid to try on this side of the Border people whom they accuse of crimes on the Six Counties side of the Border?</P>
    <P>In the prosecution the evidence will be given by members of the British occupation forces and the RUC, the paid informers and all the rest. Surely, we should be saying to these people: &ldquo;Stop your discrimination. Stop harassing the people of Donegal which belongs to this 26-county Republic of Ireland.  Stop trying to make those of us who live in Donegal, with all its attendant difficulties as a result of Partition, travel round by Sligo.&rdquo;  That is why there is this concentrated, sustained, persistent effort at intimidating our people travelling through and, of course, to harass the people from Derry and indeed to intimidate them from coming South at all.  This goes on today, did yesterday and will next week and next month.  Still we are leaning over backwards to give to these occupation forces, to the Establishment in the Six Counties, something to which they are not entitled, which in fact is unfair and discriminatory in itself and will be selective in its application by virtue of the circumstances in which it has been framed.  Far from getting any <i>quid pro quo,</i> we are having our noses rubbed in the dirt day-in-day-out by those same forces in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>As we know, of course, they are not averse to crossing the Border. Then we hear the usual old story that they did not know where the Border was.  If they do not know where it is, it is time they were not there. There must be a rare lot of fools in the occupation forces based on the Border&mdash;with all their maps and equipment&mdash;that they can so frequently forget where the Border is and have safaris into the southern side of it.  We make weak sounds of protest occasionally but not by any means always.  I suppose we are given some sort of assurances that it was a <Col N="1328" /> mistake and will not happen again but, of course, it happens again and again.  It is no mistake&mdash;it is made nine times out of ten&mdash;these deliberate crossings, whether with the purpose of provocation or otherwise is difficult to ascertain.  But certainly the treatment at check-points on the route to Derry and Donegal is intimidatory, provocative and cannot in any way be set in the atmosphere this Government would appear to think exists in making this offer to the Establishment, to the British Government, or to both&mdash;it is hard to know these days who is who and where they operate.</P>
    <P>We should not forget that we are dealing with a situation that has not arisen from any wrong acts on the part of the Nationalist people of the Six Counties but rather from the imposition on that same Nationalist population over many years of violence of all descriptions, not only institutional violence, as we are inclined to describe the operations and harassment by police and security forces, but physical violence also with no hope of redress. This has not occurred merely since 1969.  It went on long before that.  We look at the end product now and say that the men of violence in one section of the population are the root cause of it all and, if we can eradicate them, we shall eradicate the problem.  That would be funny were it not so tragic. We could not be further from the truth in proposing to adopt that sort of attitude. We must go back and find out why such people came into being and why they must have the support of the minority of the Six Counties in order to carry on.</P>
    <P>Why do we appear, in what we are proposing here, to be more British than the British themselves?  Why do we wish, by our recognition of the institutions set up by a puppet Government in the Six Counties&mdash;through the operations of this Parliament&mdash;to give our seal in an official manner to the partition of our land never accepted by our people as an ultimate, lasting or just operation?  Whether or not we like it, that is what we are doing.  One may say the Treaty of 1922 did that. It provided for the Boundary Commission <Col N="1329" /> which ultimately outlined the actual delineation of the Border on a basis that contrived a majority for the future in order to keep the Loyalists in Government; they, in turn, taking their cue from that, by intimidation of every description, through violence of every type, including the denial of job opportunities, houses and so on, maintained their position of ascendancy. The Treaty was implemented.  At least we can say, of those who signed it and supported it in this House, that they did it under circumstances in which they believed the alternative was a bloody war being imposed on them by the forces of the then much mightier empire than it is today.</P>
    <P>Whether one agrees or disagrees with the creation of the situation in which we have got partition, at least it can be said of those people at that time they had that very large reason for doing so and for agreeing to it, even though it brought tragic consequences immediately after.  We can say also, in extenuation of the acceptance of the Boundary Commission Report of 1925 &mdash;even though it was behind closed doors&mdash;that it was merely in the nature of a follow-on to acceptance of the Treaty by the Dáil in 1922.</P>
    <P>But there is, and cannot be, any like excuse for a Parliament, established all those years, purporting to represent&mdash;and I deliberately say purporting to represent&mdash;the opinion of our people on this island as a whole. For them there is no excuse in this clear, final sell-out, and sell-out it can only be because we now propose in this Bill&mdash;even though some people in this House who will vote for it will not agree with it&mdash;to copper-fasten, recognise and accept that which our people have never done heretofore. Under the most extreme circumstances never before has there been an attempt, on behalf of the Irish people as a whole, to recognise that the Border is a proper or just thing. If one quibbles and says: &ldquo;We are not recognising it in this Bill,&rdquo; I say that if we recognise, as we propose to recognise the courts of the Six Counties, the so-called peace-keeping forces of the Six Counties, then we must, without doubt, be recognising <Col N="1330" /> the sources from which they sprang. Willingly or otherwise, we are selling out as we have never sold out before.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the majority of people of this country, regardless of their politics and of what we do here would not accept this.  I do not believe that the majority of people of all of this island would condone this by their votes if it was put to them in the form of a referendum were that capable of being done.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately and tragically it is all for nothing, meaningless, hopeless, and can only bring in its train further trouble and violence.  It can have no other outcome.  Why, then, do it? Why give credence to a discredited RUC that even now the minority will not recognise after all their suffering and hardship?  They still do not see that police force as their police force, as an impartial police force, much less recognise the British Army or any branch of it as being impartial.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the man who was in charge of the regiment in Derry the day the massacre took place, Bloody Sunday, was not disciplined. On the contrary, he was decorated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We must bear this sort of thing in mind.  We should try to drive home to the Government and to those who will support them by their votes if this measure is to go through, that we are not only dealing with people who have erred in the past by murdering the people in Derry and elsewhere but that those in charge that day, far from being disciplined, were decorated for their service to their country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to the RUC. Members of that body who were present and were known locally to have participated in some of the atrocities I mentioned earlier have not been disciplined but are still in the force and have even been promoted. In face of this, how can we say that we will make our laws conform with those in the North?  Those people have been found capable of violence and brutality to our fellow <Col N="1331" /> Irishmen in the Six Counties.  Now we will pursue, catch and jail people down here who could not be caught in the North.  We will sentence these people and lock them away on charges which may not have any basis whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Does anybody suggest that the hundreds of people who were interned in the Six Counties on the 9th August were guilty of crimes of violence or of membership of an illegal organisation?  We all know they were not.  The explosion into violence after internment had taken place clearly demonstrated that far from locking up the people they considered were causing violence, they must have locked up very few of those people but had interned a great number of people who were not guilty of any such offence.  If this is so, why do we make this extraordinary effort to lean over backwards to accommodate the occupiers of our country who used brutality and violence against our people, who failed to conform with the unnatural and unjust situation which has existed since the establishment of partition and the Border more than 50 years ago?  Why do that?  What is the pay-off?  What is the benefit? We have heard a great deal of generalisation about putting down violence, but with clear determination this Bill can only apply to a very restricted part of one section of the community and will do nothing to be fair and impartial in prosecuting, bringing to justice or giving what would appear to be the just deserts to those in the Loyalists' organisations.  That cannot be done under this proposal, and on that ground alone, since it cannot apply impartially across the board, it must make bad law.  It cannot be just in its application if it can only be applied in a selective way.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister or a member of the Government tell us before the conclusion of this Stage, what has been the outcome of their efforts to bring the British Government before the International Court on torture charges?  In spite of the numerous delays we should have some result by now.  This is so important that it should be fully aired before this Bill <Col N="1332" /> is passed through the House.  It will have a bearing on the contents of this Bill if the charges made by our Government against the British Government are true.  Will we have the result before we pass this Bill?  We are entitled to that information.  Perhaps the Government spokesman will reassure us and we and the general public will be told the outcome in detail of these proceedings.</P>
    <P>If the people concerned are found guilty of brutal assaults and tortures and SD operations&mdash;known to the psychiatrists and psychologists as sensory deprivation, and that covers a multitude, as some of those who underwent such operations will tell us&mdash;that too must be taken into account.  If we fully understood what is meant by those two words&mdash;sensory deprivation&mdash;we would throw out this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will not attempt to get across in this House what is known about this type of torture.  I will just say that is is beyond our conception. I do not know who thought it up, the RUC or the British Army, but it was applied by both.  I hope this Government will be unrelenting in their pursuit of those charges against the British Government so that the world will know and recognise the type of people which our Irish citizens in the Six Counties have had to tolerate since this country was so unnaturally divided by partition.</P>
    <P>It is a small tribute to the suffering of these people over the years, indeed the reverse, to find the Government and the House, as it will be so read if this Bill is passed, putting into law something to aid those very people who carried out those tortures and violence on the people in the name of law and order.  Instead of being sentenced they were rewarded for it by promotions, some decorations or other, clapped on the back and told what fine people they were.  We are condoning this.  We are giving them a recognition they never enjoyed before and we are doing it in the name of the Irish people, including those they have trampled down and intimidated for a life time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> I cannot credit that this is happening yet it is happening in this House.  I do not want to draw this out and I do not want to go into the whole litany of what has happened. I mentioned a few tragedies and unaccounted for deaths caused by members of the peace-keeping forces in the Six Counties during recent years.  I do this with a certain amount of revulsion.  I hope nobody will say that I have given very little account of what has happened and what about the others?  I believe the point is made.  I mentioned four or five instances that clearly were in the public view at the time and clearly were the responsibility of one of the arms of the law in the Six Counties and in respect of which no action was taken to find out the perpetrators of the murders in question.  In all these cases the victims were Nationalists, Catholics.</P>
    <P>I believe I have gone far enough, although I could give a lot more detail.  I do not believe it is really necessary.  It is there, if wanted, to show how the courts have been leaning over blatantly towards the Loyalists when they are brought before them for prosecution.  I merely sum it up by indicating that for similar offences the ratio of Nationalists jailed as against Loyalists was two to one.</P>
    <P>This should indicate that we should be very careful, even if there was never any other reason, about associating our courts with those who preside over courts that have behaved in that manner over the years.  We should also ask ourselves if we are not being double faced in proposing this Bill and our obligations under international agreements we have reached on extradition. We are providing a means to get around extradition for one particular class only.  We should ask ourselves if we must do this would we not be better doing it in the open, doing it honestly, renouncing our international agreements and saying we are not abiding by them.  It appears to me that we are getting around extradition by the proposals contained in this Bill. We are not being honest with our <Col N="1334" /> neighbours throughout the world who have joined with us in international agreements on extradition in so far as the non-operation of it is concerned for political offences.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves how the Government feel in proposing a measure such as this, with all its shortcomings. Some Members of this combined Coalition have expressed misgivings about parts of this Bill and others have expressed total condemnation of the Bill?  How do the Government feel about putting through such a controversial matter, not knowing its ultimate bad effects, and putting it through on the basis of an imprisoned majority, some of whom do not agree with the Bill?  If those people who disagree with the Bill acted according to their consciences and voted against it, the Bill would be defeated.  They will vote for it because of their loyalty to their parties.  Surely this should give the Government some food for thought and give them reason to pause and think again before putting through such a controversial measure on that sort of support?</P>
    <P>It is held that the majority in this Parliament represents the majority outside it.  If a true majority for this Bill does not exist in the House, we can take it that, conversely, there is no majority for it outside.  The Minister and other members of the Government should surely agree that in a matter so controversial, that strikes so very deeply at the roots of the beliefs of a great number of people in the country, it is wrong to carry it through, even though it is legitimate, to use the majority of the Government side if that majority is not a true one in the sense of believing in what they are voting for.  Therefore, it does not represent the majority of our people, which should be the basis of our democratic Parliament.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government again, as I did earlier this afternoon, most sincerely to take their time about putting this through.  There was a big rush first, then a delay, a sudden spurt again and then more delay.  I hope we do not have it pushed through at this stage because I believe that if they stop, think again and <Col N="1335" /> seek out the feedback from their people throughout the country they will find that when the Irish people recognise it for what it is&mdash;a recognition of the Partition of our country and the occupation of it by an outside power&mdash;they will not want that. I am quite sure that the Government, having an eye to the political future of their parties, will not run in the face of what could well turn out to be a very substantial majority against what is now proposed to be done.</P>
    <P>I do not wish the Government any particular good nor do I wish them any evil but I would ask them, for their own good, to take that into consideration in further considering the Bill before galloping ahead with further stages of it here.  I would also ask them in their consideration of the effects of the Bill to take into account the very grave danger that it will bring trouble to this side of the Border.  I say this bluntly here: for the past five years, despite the terrific violence, turbulence, upset, bloodshed, shooting, maiming and bombing in the Six Counties the very people the Government are setting out to trap here particularly, time without number, to the knowledge of the public, the House and the Minister have been taken although armed by unarmed gardaí of our force, of which we can be very proud.  But there is good reason behind this.  I put it to the Minister and the Government that that will not continue under this Bill and that there is grave danger that any armed&mdash;or unarmed&mdash;men in future approached to be apprehended on this side of the Border will not recognise the difference in the uniform from that from which they have run on the other side of the Border.  For that reason, and not by any means by way of threat, I say to the Minister as advice that we are providing in my opinion a recipe for violence that we have not known up to now on this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Clever people with legal minds will take up what I have now said and twist it out of recognition.  I am not a legal man but I know a little about what goes on and I see the future with <Col N="1336" /> very great fear if this Bill becomes law as a future on this side of the Border no less appalling in its violence than that on the Six County side at present. I ask the Government to consider this as well as all the other factors I have mentioned and even in a selfish way to ask: will this cause violence and trouble here of the type that so far we have miraculously, generally speaking, escaped?</P>
    <P>Would the Government in that connection ask themselves who bombed Dublin a few years ago?  Who killed our people in Belturbet?  Who caused the explosions in Monaghan?  Who caused them in the airport a week or more ago?  What are we doing about those who would have caused those explosions, death and destruction on this side of the Border, who earlier tried to blow up a power station at Ballyshannon?  Is there a connection between them all?  Do we know?  Are we accusing the IRA of these?  Are we accusing the Nationalist extremists from the Six Counties or from the Twenty-six Counties?  If we are not, and if the probabilities are that it was not from that source these things came, what are we doing under this proposed law or any existing law to apprehend those who brought these things about or to visit on their heads retribution at least equal to that which we give to others who might be caught in the same acts?</P>
    <P>Do we have any organisation other than the IRA proscribed on this side of the Border?  I am genuinely seeking an answer to that question because for quite a while I know that was the only organisation.  It should not be the only organisation; there are other organisations which even Mr. Rees has found in the Six Counties and saw fit to proscribe there.  Have we likewise proscribed them and.  if so, for how long have we done so?  Under that proscription have we, through our special courts, prosecuted anybody for membership of these other organisation? Do not tell me they do not exist; there is evidence that they do, very tragic evidence on this side of the Border, and that they come amongst us and may even belong to the midst of our people.  Why should there be <Col N="1337" /> this apparent obsession in one direction and not equally in all directions?  That is inherent in the Bill before us, this matter of selectivity, not necessarily contrived; I think the circumstances compel it to be so.  If we go through with this measure it will be applied on a selective basis; it cannot be applied any other way.  Yet, we propose to go through with it despite the selectivity in the application of it by virtue of the circumstances which makes it unjust and lacking in impartiality.  Are we satisfied to ignore all these things and go ahead with it?  I do not think we should; it is another reason why the Government should pause and have another very hard look at what they are doing.</P>
    <P>I am no constitutional lawyer but it seems&mdash;I think it is open to argument the other way and I am open to conviction on it&mdash;that the Bill is unconstitutional on the basis I have already mentioned.  How can we recognise the legal system and its functionaries, including the alleged peace-keeping forces and its judiciary when, in fact, under our Constitution we deny that the State in question exists in a constitutional sense?  How then can we recognise and provide for the recognition of the judges, of the courts, of the RUC and others who are merely functionaries of the State which we deny exists in a constitutional sense? How can that law be constitutional?</P>
    <P>Finally, I would put some further matters by way of question.  How can we propose to accept the discredited RUC and the British Army and all that goes with it?  I shall not go into any further detail here.  How can we propose to pass a law that in its application of necessity can only be selective? How can we recognise and give recognition to the Six Counties as another State which is merely there in the existing situation because of the force of the occupation group that is capable of being kept there by the British Government?  How can we accept with apparent equanimity the violence of the Establishment in the Six Counties?  Whether it be Stormont or Britain or whatever it is does not matter; it is still the Establishment <Col N="1338" /> so far as the Six Counties are concerned.</P>
    <P>How can we accept the violence of the Establishment, which has continued down through the years and which will undoubtedly continue in the future while at the same time create a great furore about the violence that has been resorted to by those who could not take any more of what was being meted out to them?  The Government may say that there have been many changes, but in trying to end the violence they must endeavour to find a solution which will eradicate the reasons for the violence.  Can we ignore a line west of the Bann that has been deprived since the establishment of Partition?  The problem has existed for so long that we tend to forget that the violence, in terms of deprivation and so on, inflicted on the Nationalist population was violence of a most acute and cruel nature. A system which ensured that job opportunities and housing would be denied the Catholic population can surely be regarded as a form of violence which, because of its continuous oppressive and discriminatory nature, goes beyond the violence of the outrages that have occurred since 1969. I shall not attempt to indicate that I comprehend such a situation but I am aware that this system was designed deliberately and has been pursued for a long time.  The violence of that system has been perpetrated with determination and perseverance on successive generations.  Close as I was reared to the area in which that system operated, I cannot comprehend fully the horrific effects it has had on the people for whom it was intended.</P>
    <P>In putting through this legislation are we not accepting and condoing that type of violence on the part of the Establishment in the North of Ireland?  In these days when international opinion is so important we should realise the picture we are presenting to the world.  This Establishment violence has been the root cause of the problems that have beset that part of the country during the past six years.  This legislation will indicate to the world that the Irish Parliament <Col N="1339" /> recognises the &ldquo;puppets on a string&rdquo; set-up of the discredited regime that was Stormont and which is now continued by the British direct-rule procedure.  In this way we appear to be condoning the judicial and police operations of that regime.  In these circumstances the question of the non-acceptance of any right on the part of Britain to occupy any part of this country will have little impact.  However, regardless of our recognition of the situation, the occupation of the north-eastern part of this country will continue to be criticised and ridiculed.</P>
    <P>If the Government have regard to our claim that all of the island of Ireland is Irish perhaps they will have second thoughts on this measure.  One would hope that if time were given for further consideration of the proposals, there might be no attempt ultimately to enact them.  Both from a constitutional and a legal practice point of view this legislation is wrong.  It is wrong, too, in terms of natural justice and it is in contravention, in spirit if not in practice, of our international agreements on extradition for political offences.  It is wrong, too, that laws be enacted which would not apply equally even to the occupants of the territory towards which it is directed. Above all, it is wrong that we should so besmirch the judicial functionaries on this side of the Border by associating them with the judicial personnel on the other side of the Border who were put there for a purpose which they and their predecessors have served well.  It is wrong to put our Garda and, perhaps our Army, into the position of collaborating fully with the occupiers and the usurpers of the Six Counties. It is wrong to ask our unarmed Garda force to indulge in such activities as part of their enforcement of the law.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Garda or the Army have advised the Minister and the Government as to the possible repercussions this Bill may have on <Col N="1340" /> their morale in the future.  Although in uniform these people are no different from the rest of us and, consequently, there may be mixed opinions among them.  It would be well to find out whether there is not likely to be a great revulsion among the majority of both forces against the sort of operations we are proposing to institute.  If the Minister has not acertained their views already he should do so without delay, because it is important that the information be obtained while there is time left to drop this measure. This is a Bill for which there is no justification.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the faults in the Bill there is no justification for it and it can do immense harm.  The Minister and others have been meticulous in pointing out that it takes only a little harm caused here to create a great deal of harm on the other side of the Border.  In this case it will be harm caused by us, but its effects will be felt much more on the other side of the Border.  I would ask the Minister to consider the possible dangers and the damage that may be caused, the trouble it may stir up, and to measure that against what I can only regard as negative results.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with what I have said, the Government should recognise that it will be unwise, politically and otherwise, to go through with something that will yield no gain but will mean a substantial loss in many ways.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and the Government and those who back them to take a hard second look at this matter before they proceed further.  It is wrong under so many headings, but it is vital that the Government should examine the more important aspects.  If they do that perhaps they will realise it will not be worth the candle and the legislation can be scrubbed.  I feel very strongly about this matter and I have tried as best I can to give some of the reasons I consider the Bill should not be passed.  Naturally, I will vote against it.  As the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs remarked recently, I am saying the things that others are thinking. <Col N="1341" /> That may be, but which of us in this House is not saying, or thinks he is saying, what others are thinking?  As Members of this House it is our function to say what others are thinking.</P>

However, all of us understand that it will be accepted and I would ask the Government to please have another look at it. I am quite serious when I say it will do a great deal of harm and it may cause much trouble that we have not had so far.  I am not imputing any wrong intentions to the Government or the Minister.  However, they are seeing things the wrong way round and they will be very sorry if they go through with this legislation.  I earnestly ask them to have another look at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>One's first reaction to this Bill might be vehement, but the matter is so serious that I address myself to the Minister in a spirit of earnestness having regard to our common history on both sides of the House, a history we have experienced since the State was founded.  It is with thoughts like that that I plead with the Minister to reconsider the provisions he has before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of section 2 of this Bill, particularly when coupled with section 14, will turn this State and particularly the agencies of the State, the security forces and the courts, into an agency for another sovereignty over which we have no control.  That <Col N="1343" /> is what these two sections and the Bill generally propose to do.</P>
    <P>One must, therefore, question the wisdom, quite apart from the justification of doing such a thing.  It is easy enough to understand, in part, the origins of this but may I remind the Minister, as one lawyer to another, that hard cases make bad law.  I am afraid we are going to make very bad law here.  As far as the average person is concerned, and remember it is the common view, in the end, that determines the action of a democracy, this Bill is simply the remnant of Sunningdale and it is completely one-sided.  The Sunningdale Agreement would appear to be its immediate origin.  That agreement was, as it was described on an earlier occasion, a brave effort to meet a very difficult problem.  It provided, as all solutions of problems provide, give and take.  There were certain objections to it, approached from any point of view, but, by and large, in view of the almost insoluble nature of the problem of partition which confronted not only this country but also the British it seemed to offer an approach that could lead to some kind of an equitable and workable solution. These hopes were unfounded.</P>
    <P>It would be digressing a little to analyse the real reasons for the failure of Sunningdale.  To do that we would have to go back to the reasons that led to it, and that would lead to an interminable debate.  Therefore, I will confine myself to saying that when it came to trying to work out the provisions of that agreement and to implement it it very quickly became evident that the Irish Government were expected to give all along the line, that the Irish Government were expected to acquiesce in any demand made either by the people who have been in control in the North or by the British Government.  Bit by bit, every single clause of that agreement that was advantageous or contained something of benefit to the people of the South and the Irish Government was removed or eroded.  In the final crisis, the whole thing was destroyed, or so it seemed.  But not quite destroyed, it would appear, because <Col N="1344" /> here we have an Irish Government presenting to an Irish House of Parliament the one remnant of an agreement that they made and that remnant is utterly inimical to their own interests and to the interests of their people.  That is how this Bill appears.  When all the polemics and all the partisanship have been swept aside what the people are asking is: &ldquo;Why bring in this legislation now? Why does the Irish Government want to make itself the policeman for an outside power at this moment, particularly when the Bill is all that is left of an agreement that had some advantages which have all been taken away?&rdquo; The answers to those questions should be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I do not approach this in any spirit of antagonism.  I should be happy to plead for a consideration of the case that has been put before the Minister if I felt that pleading would be of any use, but I fear the commitment is already there and that pleas may be too late.  Nevertheless they should be made.  We must recognise the basis of this legislation.  In the short-term it was as I have said.  In the longer term it was something broader.  Historical implications would at this stage be perhaps outside the confines of the Bill.  Let us, therefore, try to see where we might find agreement between us, even at this late stage, or what common ground could we find on which to approach this Bill.  We all recognise that the problem of partition, a partition which is unnatural in political origins and geographically and from the point of view of community groupings, is the result of a certain strain in history.  We are all agreed that partition has been a thorn in our sides.  We are all agreed that as it developed over the past 50 years, or so it became a genuine problem for three separate parties and though one of these parties could have done more than the other two none of them could have solved the problem completely on its own initiative.  The parties involved were the divided people of this country, the people in the North belonging to the Unionist tradition who had been built up into an artificial enclave and put in a particular position because of a quirk of <Col N="1345" /> history at the beginning of this century, or even before it&mdash;I am talking politically now about political evolution&mdash;and the people of the South who suffered for what happened and the British who, in the last analysis, were responsible for it.  There were three parties involved in this problem&mdash;the British who caused the problem, the Unionist local majority and Nationalist minority who were built into separate enclaves in the North, and the Nationalists suffered for it and are still suffering for it just as the people of the rest of Ireland suffered, the third party.  That is historical fact.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister is back I should like to repeat something I said earlier.  The problem was a problem for all three parties and the solution was not completely in the hands of any one party, although the major power of action lay in the hands of the British.  The events leading up to Derry and the violence stemmed from the civil rights and other constitutional movements of that nature.  That artificial and impossible situation was bound to erupt in some relief of existing pressures and tensions, and that is exactly what happened and, as a result of the catastrophies which followed, we are now in two parts of this island and in Britain confronted with a diabolical problem of uncontrolled violence.</P>
    <P>If what I have said are adequate premises on which to base this debate then one must ask what is one to do. It is very easy to misrepresent someone approaching a measure of this nature, as we are approaching it, as having sympathy with violence or lacking the desire to curb violence.</P>
    <P>While it is important for people to support order, particularly democratic order in a democratic State, it is equally important for those responsible to ensure that the actions they take are really designed to minimise disorder and violence and will not aggravate it.  It is from that point of view I am most disturbed about this Bill.  When I say that I do not, of course, want to minimise in any way the other objections to the Bill, and I personally do not propose to go back on the legal or social aspects of it <Col N="1346" /> which have been thoroughly debated by my colleagues and others.</P>
    <P>On the question of what the Bill will achieve, I would remind the Minister that we have been opposed over the whole period of this State's history but, in that opposition, we have acquired mutual experience and, whether we admit it or not, we have acquired mutually a great deal of understanding of one another and one another's point of view.  In return for trying to understand the Minister's point of view here I would ask the Minister to try to understand mine. If we are agreed that there is a problem for the three parties involved and the two Governments, the British Government and the Irish Government, and the problem is the basic cause of the murder and violence rampant in the last five years, then can we not ask ourselves what is to be the solution.</P>
    <P>Again without going back into greater generalities that concern this Bill, as far back as 18 months ago&mdash; 26th June, 1974, or somewhere like that&mdash;I myself pointed out in the House that until the British had organised the integration of this country&mdash;if unity is not an acceptable word&mdash;the suitable integration and co-operation of the parts of this country on an equitable basis, and directly withdrew in the implementation of that commitment, it would be futile to look for a lasting solution. I am still of that view, more than ever when one sees the impact it is having on Britain herself.  We cannot get away from the fact, and this is vital in this Bill, that we are being asked in section 2 of the Bill in effect to give active police aid and assistance to the British Government. Whether you like it or not, that is what this Bill is doing.  This Bill is asking this House to become the policing agent for the British Government and its institutions.  Have no doubt about that.  The British Government and the British institutions are directly responsible for affairs in the North of Ireland, and if section 2 and section 14 of this Bill are enacted it is a simple logical conclusion to say that our Government have <Col N="1347" /> undertaken to be the policing agent for that foreign government.</P>
    <P>If that is so, I think I am entitled to ask, is that wise?  One of the great difficulties in this problem, of course, has been the one-sided support of the British Government for the Northern situation, economically, financially, at very considerable cost to the British themselves.  I think the British themselves are beginning to realise the cost and the incubus that they have in the North of Ireland.  The British people are beginning to realise what it is costing them in money, in resources and in the maintenance of security forces, to say nothing of the disruption and disorder that in consequence of this unnatural situation is being foisted upon themselves.  To say that is not to condone in any way what is happening. What is happening can only be described as diabolical, but the diabolical things that are happening should be traced back to their causes, and the cause is where it has been appreciated unanimously by this House, by the Minister's party no less than by this party to have been&mdash;in 1948.</P>
    <P>When talking about this back in 1974, in an attempted dispassionate and clinical examination of the problem I pointed out the impossibility of dealing adequately with the Northern situation until that disbalance was removed, until the British were as ready to co-operate with us and with the Irish of the South as they are with their favourites in the North, until they are as ready to co-operate with us as they are with one element&mdash;and they are not even completely representative of even the Unionist element in the North&mdash;one small political element in the North.  Until that situation is remedied, it appears to me to be futile to seek for a solution of the Northern problem, but in the context of this Bill that fact in all probability will make the provisions which the Minister is proposing nugatory in effect for the purposes which he wishes to achieve and, indeed, which we would all like to see achieved&mdash; the eradication of and the end to the violence that I have been talking <Col N="1348" /> about.  Not only will it fail to do that but it may bring other consequences of a lamentable and disastrous nature for us.  Many of these have been discussed and commented on by the Members of the House in the course of this debate.  There does not seem much purpose in repeating a lot.  It is on the record and I trust the Minister will pay the House the courtesy of studying what has been said.  It is his responsibility to do so and in any event he will have to be held responsible at the bar of history for having done so.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect which to anybody who has been in any way close to the events of the last 50 years in this country must be greatly disturbing and it is this: That provision will command the support and approval of some people and well-meaning people in the South, but it will also command the suspicion and the hostility of another considerable group of the ordinary people of this country.  This Bill is a sign of contradiction which might well have been avoided.  Is it necessary, I would ask the Minister at this stage, to bring in a Bill that is going to polarise opinion on a matter of this nature, as this Bill will do, among the people of our own community, for no effective purpose because I believe the purpose will not be effected?</P>
    <P>Is that a wise thing to do?  Will anyone deny, from the speeches in this House and from what has been said outside, that this will be the result? If, then, one finds people hostile to a Bill of this nature, that old emotions spring up&mdash;even if old emotions are to be condemned; and I am not trying for the purposes of my argument to say yes or no to that&mdash;is not the inevitable result to undermine the universal confidence of our own security forces and courts?</P>
    <P>The Minister and all under him have my very sincere sympathy.  It is extremely difficult to discharge the Minister's duties and those of the forces of law and order, in the administration of law and order, in this modern age.  One of the things that has stood to us in this State has been that, from the beginning, our <Col N="1349" /> Garda and courts&mdash;here I will give credit to the Minister and his side of the House, historically and otherwise; taking credit here also for recognising it and continuing it; but, whatever the credit goes, it is a very laudable fact that our institutions of law and order, were and are held in high esteem by the community, amply trusted.  As far as any agencies of law and order will get active co-operation from citizens in this modern world, the Minister may congratulate himself in that, in his area, he can command that co-operation from the bulk of the community and that the people under him can do so also.</P>
    <P>I fear we are putting that at risk. I will say quite frankly that the difficulty in pursuing this line of thought is the feeling that one might appear to be inciting.  That is the very last thing I would wish to do.  For that reason I would prefer to leave it to the Minister to develop the line of thought I have indicated to him.  My fear in regard to this Bill is that it will not achieve or make any significant contribution to the solution of the problem of violence in the North, in the South or in England; that it will, on the other hand, import elements into our situation that will aggravate our problems in regard to security and law and order.  If it does that, that will inevitably be coupled with partisanship and with a diminution of the universal acceptance and regard for our own judicial and security institutions in the South.  That is the plea I make most earnestly to the Minister here.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should conclude on that point because it is one of fundamental importance.  Other points of importance have been made in the debate also.  I should like to bring home, with a sense of personal historic experience, the dangers I feel in this Bill and to ask the Minister to reconsider it.  Can he trust those other agencies?  The Minister and his Government&mdash;for all their desire to be co-operative and reasonable with the other parties in this, and with the British in particular&mdash;have had the humiliating experience of seeing the <Col N="1350" /> deal they got from the British media when they stepped out of line.  From their experience of Sunningdale&mdash; where every point they had gained in their favour was filched away and abrogated while, at the same time, they were battered about the head for not giving this, that or the other thing&mdash;from contraception back to major items if it was not Articles of the Constitution always the Irish Government were asked to give, give, give.  But what did they get?  We have had too much experience of that in Irish history, far too much of it, particularly now when the British themselves are realising their problem, when they themselves are reckoning the cost, when they themselves are approaching what could very easily be a very reasonable and rational approach to the problems of the day. Why, for the sake of a traditional idea, of a minority idea, a political Tory idea of the last century should an Irish Government now become the policing agency for the British Government and, even if they did, could they trust them on the Sunningdale experience to take the last example? Can you trust them?  Where are all the things that were in the Sunningdale Agreement?  Even when they were gone it was sought to be registered, if you please, in order that our admission would be on the record.</P>
    <P>I am saying this to the Minister in the friendliest spirit, knowing his problems and difficulties.  In the past the Minister and his party were the victims, perhaps, of their own trust and their own honesty.  There is an old saying : fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. We sympathise with the Minister. Generally speaking a fairly good job has been done by our police and army and our security arrangements have functioned very well.  I see this Bill putting all that into jeopardy. Therefore, on that basis, if on no other, I ask the Minister to reconsider the Bill.  No matter what the logic of the moment is, history has a peculiar way of working out something different.  The feelings of communities, the feelings of our people, are a reality in the situation.  They <Col N="1351" /> may be illogical but they are still a reality.  It is the reactions of those feelings to all the factors of the situation that can well up in the undesirable consequences I have only touched upon but that, as I said, could make a section which will not work anyway, not to our benefit, and would turn it into a national disaster.</P>

      <P>Last evening I was speaking about the people who were led astray in the hope that existing ground rents would be abolished without any responsibility for compensation. Many people have planted this seed in the minds of associations and others.  The Opposition are not blameless in this respect because they have been going around saying that if they were in Government this and that would be done. This is hypocrisy because in 1964 the commission brought out a report which stated that further ground rents should cease but the Government took no action.  In 1967 a Bill was brought before the House dealing with ground rents but no action was taken.  Today we heard the pious platitudes of Fianna Fáil about new ground rentes which are being created and the great hardship they are causing.  Fianna Fáil in Government had the opportunity to do something about this but they <Col N="1352" /> failed miserably.  They now come here with a motion deploring the inaction of the Minister because he did not bring a Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the Minister indicated that a Bill would be brought before the House to deal with this complex problem.  He did not run away from it as the Opposition did when they were advised to take a certain course of action.  The Minister tackled the problem and is bringing a Bill to deal with the cessation of new ground rents before the House and to make it easier to purchase existing ground rents. Ground rents are reasonably easy to purchase now but what made them hard and awkward before was the cost of conveyance.  The Minister said in his brief yesterday that his Bill will make it much easier.</P>
      <P>This is very important.  We should stop this time wasting.  The Opposition have three hours a week for private members' time.  It is a complete waste of time to bring in this motion when the Minister has announced that he will bring in the Bill as quickly as he can.  As I said, when Fianna Fáil were in Government they did nothing about this and if they were in Government today they still would not do anything about it.  Of course it is their own time they are wasting.  If they looked at their record they would be very slow to deplore what is being done by this Government.  They could say &ldquo;We accept the Minister's good faith and will await the Bill he proposes to bring into the House&rdquo; but no, we have to go through the rigmarole of a vote at 7.30.  They talk a lot about the jamming legislation coming through the House but this was the result of their filibustering tactics during the summer, and now we are getting a three-hour debate on ground rents.</P>

      <P>Anything Fianna Fáil do would surprise me because their record is not good.  Deputy Andrews made a great issue of rates. In 1972, a White Paper was issued which said it would cost a further 12½p <Col N="1353" /> on tax to eradicate rates.  The Opposition again ran away from this and said it could not be done.  In our 14-point plan we brought out the concrete suggestion to ease the rates burden.  We are doing this.  Fianna Fáil then made a death bed confession on rates a few days before the election, and they have been beating that drum ever since. Never once have they put forward constructive arguments and costs for this plan.  As far as I am concerned, their statement on rates is like their attitude on the ground rents over the years. They had the opportunity when they were in power and the commission spelt out clearly what could be done, but they took no action.  Regrettably they now come in here deploring the efforts of this Minister.</P>
      <P>If they want to do that that is their business.  If they want to waste time they are entitled to do that.  Ground rents have been a problem over the years and have exercised the minds of many people who felt it was contrary to social justice that people should be subject to this extraction of money once a year.</P>
      <P>The Government are not in power three years but they are now eradicating the future creation of ground rents. They are also making it easier to purchase existing ground rents.  There was a rumour going around that all ground rents would be done away with.  An Opposition spokesman last night admitted that this could not be done. People have constitutional rights and we have to honour them.  We can be quite clear that the action the Government are taking is the only action that can be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one considers the activities of the Department of Justice over the last three years and the pressure the Minister has been under, the legislation he has brought out and the legislation we are looking forward to, one realises the great work he has done.  I was on the committee on family law.  This is an excellent piece of legislation and there is more to follow.  We have the Criminal Justice Bill, which is being opposed by the Opposition.  The Minister must be complimented on his performance.  I certainly could not let this occasion <Col N="1354" /> go without complimenting him on his achievements over the last three years.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Brien said that Fianna Fáil were wasting the time of the House by putting down this motion deploring the Government's inaction in relation to ground rents.  I am quite prepared to leave it to the voters in Deputy O'Brien's constituency to say if there was any action by the Government on ground rents and to let the people decide if Fianna Fáil, in consultation with many people in Deputy O'Brien's area, were wasting the time of the House.</P>
      <P>Ground rents are a problem, have been over the years and, in view of the Government's inaction, will be a problem for some considerable time. What are ground rents?  The Oxford Dictionary describes them as the rent paid to the owner of land which is let for building upon.  These words illustrate the root of the problem and the agitation for its removal.  Most people in the country, especially young people, when buying a house, which is probably the largest single transaction in their lives, feel that in paying such a large sum for their houses, the least they are entitled to is the piece of land on which their houses stand.  They save for years for a deposit on their houses.  Those who are lucky enough to be at work in the present situation find this a very difficult thing to do.  When they have secured their deposit and placed it on the house of their choice they commit themselves to the burden of a mortgage, which must be repaid, over 25 or 30 years.  Even then those people still find they are paying a rent on the land on which the house is built for the rest of their days to somebody they never see.  There is no greater classic example of barren taxation than the ground rent system. It involves paying for something for which there is no return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was something similar to this which caused the Boston tea party.  I am not suggesting that we are in for a situation like that, but with the feeling of revulsion that is building up <Col N="1355" /> among the people against this system I do not know exactly what the future holds.</P>
    <P>What is the solution?  When discussing ground rents one discusses them under two headings, future and existing. Fianna Fáil have been pushing the Government for some action on this question but without result.  It was after various unfulfilled promises, various motions and questions in the House, at local authority level and other levels and after the local elections of 1974, when Fianna Fáil came out with their Local Government policy statement, &ldquo;A policy for adjustment, advancement and reform on all fronts in the local community&rdquo;&mdash;in this document we quoted our proposal with regard to future and existing ground rents&mdash;we decided to put the motion which we are debating tonight, before the House.  It reads:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's inaction in relation to ground rents.</P>
    <P>At this time every Tuesday when Fianna Fáil put down a Private Members' motion about some particular section of Government business the Government table a meaningless amendment.  We had it a few weeks ago in relation to Verolme dockyard and they did the same last night.  The Government's amendment reads:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;approves the Government's decision to prevent the creation of further ground rents&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a meaningless amendment.  The Government are asking us to approve their own inaction.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the record of the Government on their decision.  As I understand the parliamentary system in the country a Government decision is in black and white when legislation is produced on a particular subject. We have seen no Bill on ground rents. We have had many headlines and many statements but we have seen no proposals to take firm action.  As is <Col N="1356" /> typical of all Departments in this regime there are many press conferences announcing proposals but we very rarely see them in black and white except the type of legislation which was being discussed prior to this motion.</P>
    <P>During the Minister's contribution last night he informed us that it would be relatively easy to draft a Bill banning future ground rents but the delay is because he wants to include in it extensive landlord and tenant legislation amendments to it.  I ask for a simple Bill to ban future ground rents.  I do not want the Minister to get involved in the detailed sphere of landlord and tenant legislation at the moment.  Let us consider the specifics of future ground rents.  The Government promised over 12 months ago that they would bring in this legislation on future ground rents.  The Minister for Local Government has told us that approximately 25,000 houses were built in the country but I am not convinced of these 25,000 houses.  It would be a rash man who would admit such a number of houses were built when one sees the unemployment figures in the building trade, the decrease in the hardware and the builders' providers employment. Even allowing for all those things and going on the Government's figure of 25,000 houses built over the last 12 months and assuming that about 8,000 of these were local authority houses, we are left with 17,000. Assuming that 25 per cent&mdash;and that is a large percentage&mdash;of those were not subject to ground rent it means that while the Government delay over the introduction of this simple Bill banning the creation of future ground rents, in the past 12-month period, using Government figures, over 12,750 new ground rents were created, an appalling figure.  I heard the previous speaker lauding the Minister for Justice on his efforts in regard to legislation and his promise regarding future ground rents, but while the Government wait and promise what happens the unfortunate young couples buying homes?  The Government are nearly three years in office and in the last 12 months alone nearly 13,000 new ground rents were created. <Col N="1357" /> How can the Government, without blushing, table the amendment before us, never mind vote for it as they probably will later on?</P>
    <P>Speaking yesterday the Minister gave no date for the introduction of the proposed legislation, which means that the figure of nearly 13,000 that I have given is increasing every day.  At the same time Government backbenchers compliment the Minister on his action.  What action? An empty promise on which we have seen no performance.  Meanwhile, anybody buying a house in a housing scheme&mdash;and most of them are subject to ground rents&mdash;is being committed to £20, £25, £30 or more annual ground rent for the rest of his days.</P>
    <P>Delay in introduction of this legislation has had a secondary and equally unsatisfactory effect in that many decent people in expectation that the legislation would include relief of existing ground rent payers have been withholding payment of ground rent and have been brought before the courts.  I am talking of people who in normal circumstances would never come in contact with the procedures of law other than as, perhaps, jurors or as witnesses on behalf of the State.  It is appalling that because of Government inaction and a feeling of uncertainty due to being left in mid-air by the Government they should find themselves in this situation.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister's statement yesterday that as a matter of policy he was not in favour of the abolition of existing ground rents, but at least it has clarified for many people their position in regard to existing ground rents which they have been withholding and thereby coming into confrontation with the law.  Final clarification of the question of the Government's intentions regarding existing ground rents can only come when this long-promised legislation is introduced.  The Minister emphasised yesterday that he could not give a date for the introduction of the new legislation, but I appeal to him and to the Government for the sake of the people to introduce the legislation, let <Col N="1358" /> us see what is in it and let the people know where they will stand for the future.</P>
    <P>In 1967 Fianna Fáil in Government introduced legislation which was intended to allow ground rents to be easily purchased.  In practice, as is often the case with legislation, it was found to have certain defects in regard to the legal costs involved in the purchase of ground rents.  I hope the new legislation will include a section which will drastically reduce this problem. We found that the legal costs have been greater in many cases than the accumulated value of the ground rent no matter what the number of years was and whether it was an individual or a group scheme promoted by a residents' association.  It was never intended in the original legislation that legal costs should be so disastrously high but it turned out this way, and I hope the new legislation, whenever introduced, will include a section to reduce drastically the legal fees involved. It seems ridiculous to have to suffer perhaps £150 in legal fees to buy out a £20 ground rent.  That is not unusual, but rather a regular occurrence.</P>
    <P>The legal profession tell us that buying out a ground rent involves nearly as much work as buying out a house. I cannot understand that but, being a layman, I am not party to the work of the legal profession.  I appeal to the Government to ensure that something will be included in the new legislation to reduce drastically the legal fees involved in the purchase of ground rents. Even if that were done you still do not grasp the nettle, the abolition of existing ground rents.  That will remain until some Government decide to abolish them by some method and until then you will have legitimate agitation and bad feeling about the payment of this barren tax.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the constitutional difficulties involved; they have been argued on both sides of the House.  I am prepared to take the legal advice we get that to remove them at the stroke of a pen would go against the property rights written into the Constitution. Our great safeguard is our written Constitution.  Unlike the British <Col N="1359" /> with their unwritten Constitution we have a document which guarantees and protects the rights of all citizens.  You may not like ground rents but they are a property and the Constitution says that we cannot deprive an individual of property.  Consequently, we must protect that right within the Constitution. But some Government must produce a solution to the constitutional difficulty.  This Government have a responsibility to use all the legal expertise available to them in the civil service and courts to devise a scheme that will get around this constitutional difficulty. With the combined brainpower of the civil servants in the Department of Justice and in the Attorney General's Office and other legal minds I have no doubt that such a scheme could be devised.  It could be done in many ways, and one way we have suggested is by the setting up of a board similar to the Land Commission.  I would ask the Minister to consider this suggestion because such a board could resell the ground rents over a three or four year period with minimal legal costs to the tenant.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have not held up any legislation relating to the reform of the ground rents system although such an accusation was levelled at us earlier by Deputy O'Brien.  On the contrary, we urge the Government to bring in the legislation necessary without further delay.  All that is required is a simple Bill to prevent the creation of future ground rents. The Minister has admitted that there would be no drafting difficulties involved in such a Bill.  It would prevent the present position of ground rents being created every day.  This would be a first step, and if it is introduced together with the amendments to the 1967 Act that we have been promised, we shall give them careful consideration and a speedy passage through the House because we are very conscious of the burden that is being placed on property owners by the present system.  Together with the savage rates the ground rents are imposing a big burden on people.</P>
    <P>Prior to the last general election one of the promises of the Coalition <Col N="1360" /> parties was the abolition of ground rents and they told us, too, that rates would be reduced dramatically by reason of the transfer of health and housing subsidies to central funds. These promises, like the others, have been unfulfilled.  In my country at the time of the general election the rate was about £5 but in the three years since then it has increased to almost £10.</P>
    <P>Despite what Deputy O'Brien says Fianna Fáil were not wasting the time of the House in putting down this motion.  If our action in this regard results in the speedy introduction of the necessary legislation by even one day, the exercise will have been worthwhile.  Is it not hollow, to say the least, for a Government Deputy to compliment the Minister on his inactivity in this sphere and then to accuse Fianna Fáil of wasting the time of the House?  Is it not hollow, too, for the Government to table an amendment to the Fianna Fáil motion to the effect that they approve the Government's decision to prevent the creation of further ground rents while having allowed the creation of at least an extra 13,000 ground rents during the past twelve months?  I call on the Government to withdraw their amendment, to allow the Fianna Fáil motion to stand and to let us have the promised legislation before any more damage is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from any financial consideration of this question of ground rents there is the consideration that inherent in every Irish person is the wish to own the plot of ground on which his house stands. While this may be a trait that can be traced to mediaeval times it is still prevalent.  The people are clamouring for an end to the system of ground rents so that no more of those can be created and that opportunity be given for the purchase of existing ones.  This is a laudable ambition. The matter is not one on which to score political points because the people are united on this question. Therefore, I urge the Government not to delay any further in bringing forward the necessary legislation.  For <Col N="1361" /> our part we will give any such legislation a speedy passage if, on examination of it, we are satisfied with it.</P>
      <P>Some Members on the Government benches have accused us of doing nothing in relation to this issue while in government.  That is not true.  We introduced legislation although this has proved not to have been the ideal legislation.  It is easy to be wise in hindsight, but the Government should be able to benefit from our experience and to bring in suitable and adequate legislation to deal with the situation. The desire to own the small plot of ground on which one's house stands does not mark one as a capitalist. Some of those people on the other side of the House who speak so often about socialism are as anxious as we are for the abolition of the ground rents system.</P>
      <P>The present system is iniquitous. It is galling to read in the daily newspaper notices of sales of ground rent. In these cases it will be found that the householder is not in a position to purchase his ground rent because he could not afford to buy the ground rents of a whole block.  On a personal level I recall receiving a letter informing me that such a person was my new ground landlord and that in future the rent would be paid to him. I had been paying my ground rent until then to a very old firm of solicitors. I regarded the system as being a remnant of the past.  These people may have been antiquated in relation to the decor of their premises but they had some very forward ideas on how to make money quickly.  I presume the person who bought my ground rent paid them quite a sum of money. I have to pay him until such time as the Government bring in new legislation. The ground rent is not very much but I object to it on principle. The person makes money out of the fact that I cannot escape payment and if I refuse to pay I will be taken to court and the person will obtain a decree.  Many families have withheld their ground rents and now they are facing court proceedings.  I appreciate their feelings but I wonder if withholding the rent is the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government are aware of <Col N="1362" /> their duty to those who are aggrieved, is it not better for them to bring in legislation to remove the burden of ground rents?  If the Government are convinced, as they must be, that an injustice is being done to thousands of families it is their duty to remove that injustice.  I know that many people, even some widows, are living on the income they receive from ground rents and I have no desire to punish them but we must have equity in our legislation.  It is unjust to force a person to pay ground rent simply in order to make up the income of someone else.  However, if a widow has only that income on which to rear her family and if the Government decide to end ground rents, it is the duty of the State to ensure that that widow and her children are not left penniless. In any legislation on this matter there must be a provision that will ensure that hardship is not transferred from one party to another.  Like peace, justice is indivisible and there is no point in introducing penal legislation that removes the burden from one person and puts it on another.</P>
    <P>The Government have plenty of advisers to help them in this matter and if they wish we will give them the benefit of our experience.  With the benefit of hindsight they can see the faults in our legislation and they can introduce a new charter to abolish ground rents.  In some countries all the land is freehold and this should be our aim.  I do not think it will cause the parliamentary draftsman much trouble to devise some enlightened legislation.</P>
    <P>Some people say that ground rents are not legally payable and others say it is a matter of prescriptive rights that have grown up in the last five hundred years.  Some of the largest ground landlords in the city can trace their ancestors back to the Norman invasion.  Anyone whose family has owned land since 1169 has done well out of it and it is time for a change.</P>
    <P>There have been instances where people have bought land and built houses on it, who have claimed that in order to reduce the price of the houses a ground rent is charged.  The purchaser of such a house may take <Col N="1363" /> out a mortgage for 35 years with a building society, an insurance company or with the local authority, and after that period they have paid for their house.  However, a ground rent must be paid forever, and this is where the iniquity comes in.  When the lease expires the ground landlord can redraft the lease and increase the rent.</P>
    <P>In this House we boast that we are the supreme legislature apart from the Supreme Court but I regard ground landlords as the real planning authority. Some time ago Dublin Corporation had to sell ground rents in a choice part of the city and they were sold for a nominal amount.  The person who bought the ground rents could dictate what would be built on the land.  If it was proposed to build a cultural centre the landlord might say that there was no money in culture. He might insist on an office block of 300,000 square feet where he could impose a ground rent that would give him and his family an income for the rest of their lives.  A ground rent for one person may be as low as £2 a year, but there is a principle involved.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the large speculator who owns many acres of land.  Up to a few years ago there was a rather peculiar situation in Dublin with regard to land reclaimed from the sea.  The ground landlord owned land as far out as the tide and the more the local authority reclaimed land the more was given to the landlord.  The ground landlord I am thinking of in this matter can boast that his ancestors go back as far as 1169.</P>
    <P>There is every case for the abolition of ground rents.  Fianna Fáil did not put down the motion merely to embarrass the Government or to make public heroes of ourselves.  We did it because we consider there is a real social problem here, and this feeling is shared by many Deputies on the Government side.  It is shared by the Irish people in general.  Therefore, what are we waiting for?  We on this side of the House did bring in legislation when we had the power to do <Col N="1364" /> so.  Because of a fortuitous happening we are not in power any longer.  I hope the Government will accede to the wishes of the people and will not hesitate further in regard to introducing the necessary legislation.  The longer the Government delay the more ground rents are being created and the more difficult it will be to abolish them.  I hope that in the present session or in the next session of this Parliament the Government will introduce legislation for which they will receive the benediction not just of the Fianna Fáil Party but of the Irish people in general.  Apart from the monetary consideration, there has been an ancient battle in this country that people should own the plot of ground on which their house is built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy G. Collins' motion has been explained in great detail by him.  There are some public representatives in this city and throughout the country who are attempting to organise people and bring them into conflict with the law.  They are playing politics with people.  This is not true of the Fianna Fáil Party.  This motion was put forward after much consideration. We are aware of the social evils that exist in this city and country arising from developments such as ground rents.  There is no question of our playing politics, such as are being played by many local public representatives at present and one or two in particular in this city.  I will not mention their names because I will not give them further publicity. Perhaps that is what they would like. They have brought into conflict with the courts a number of responsible people who are now at risk in many ways because of the orders that have been obtained against them.  It is our desire to ensure that the end product is a satisfactory one.  If it is achieved it will meet the wishes of the people who have been drawn into conflict with the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a way other than conflict with the law.  It is the sensible way.  It has been fully explained by <Col N="1365" /> Deputy Collins and other speakers. Right minded people will take the solid and responsible approach.  The Minister for Justice over a period, in common with many other Ministers, has made statements to attract the attention of the people.  The subject of ground rents was no exception.  We heard from the Minister and other members of the Government of their efforts to deal with this very pressing problem. There has been no contribution from the loud-mouthed individuals who, for the purpose of cheap politics, have endeavoured from time to time to project the idea that they are the people who are working in this regard.  One would have hoped that backbenchers and supporters of the present Government would have come forward and supported this motion.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made quite a number of noises to attract public attention but lip service is no answer to this problem.  Active service by way of a Bill that will ensure the changes necessary to meet the wishes of the great bulk of people is what is necessary.  There are of course constitutional and financial difficulties.  The first step must be taken and taken at a very early stage to simplify the legal procedure in relation to the purchasing of ground rents.  One would have hoped that the Government would have come forward with a Bill to prohibit the creation of new ground rents.  When we have extensive building programmes and high housing targets the number of new ground rents being created must also be very high.  I am sure it is the desire of this Government, as it was of the Fianna Fáil Government and will be of the next Fianna Fáil Government, to step up housing development.  The Minister for Local Government speaks about 25,000 houses per year. I hope the target is met and exceeded, but in the provision of those houses there are new ground rents being created.  The time is ripe to make an effort to ensure that new ground rents will not be created. Deputy Moore dealt with the <Col N="1366" /> development of and the income from office blocks.</P>
    <P>The Minister must give a clear indication that this legislation will be introduced at an early date.  We have listened to promises for too long: we must have action to test the sincerity of the Government, and the Minister, on this issue.  If legislation is not introduced in the near future we will know that the Government were playing politics with this issue just as they have played politics with prices, health, equal pay and other matters.</P>
    <P>The Government must produce the goods if what is termed as a social evil is to be terminated in relation to new dwellings.  A simplification of the procedure in relation to old dwellings, and the problem of legal costs, must also be dealt with.  This must be carried out now.  We have had many promises in this regard also.  In relation to Deputy Collins' motion the Government adopted their usual gimmick in relation to Private Members' Business by putting down an amendment to distract attention and to endeavour to colour the situation in another way. The Government should not have had any hesitation in accepting this motion in its entirety.  However, the flak went up in the form of the amendment to take from Deputy Collins the credit that was rightly due to him for asking the Minister to get on with the job of preventing the creation of ground rents on new houses.</P>
    <P>The arguments put forward in favour of the retention of ground rents are many and varied&mdash;good estate management and the maintaining of amenities.  However, we all know that in most cases the residents or the local authority maintain the amenities.  Why should residents have to pay a ground rent?  It is not enough for a ground landlord to put a coat of paint on a gate and say that he has fulfilled his obligation.  It is not enough for a ground landlord to cut the grass on one side of a road and say he has fulfilled his responsibility. I have seen bad estates and bad houses subject to ground rent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> I should like to see the question of the maintaining of amenities more clearly defined.  To some landlords amenities means very little.  While they are sunbathing in Spain or at some of the continental resorts the residents on their estates are in great difficulty over the amenities they are obliged to maintain.  These people are receiving money under false pretences and many of them have been guilty of inaction in relation to amenities.  We should be told more about estate management and the maintaining of amenities, because in many parts of the city amenities are non-existent and good estate management is a joke.</P>
    <P>Some ground landlords are only too happy to see houses in decay.  Deputy Moore has indicated the type of people I am talking about and the methods they use in relation to property which is deteriorating.  Once property is classified as a dangerous building it has to be demolished but the land becomes a very valuable commodity.  Landlords who are also ground landlords have deliberately allowed housing to deteriorate to the point where demolition takes place so that the value of the land increases.  They do this because it is possible to obtain planning permission for flat development, garage development, hotel development or the erection of office blocks. If one drives around the city one can see the vacant sites, the old houses and the houses in bad condition.  When a local authority moves into an area vast development takes place at great cost to the ratepayers and taxpayers, but an individual derives the benefits from that development in the form of ground rents.  If this money were paid to the local authorities some justice would be done, but when it goes into the pockets of people who are in the Bahamas or some other resort or on a Mediterranean cruise, it is a different matter.</P>
    <P>I understand the legal and constitutional problems, but with the vast amount of legal talent we have in the House, some kind of suitable legislation could be devised.  We have Special Committees sitting at the moment and there is no reason why <Col N="1368" /> some such collective efforts should not be brought to bear on this.  Deputy Collins said that every person who buys a house has a right to own the land on which it is built.  It is wrong that some people by this device are able to accumulate substantial fortunes and have done so in the past.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I am sorry the Government saw fit to put down an amendment.  It is an effort to divert attention from the real problem.  The motion, like others, was put down in good faith to project a social evil and I hope the Minister will take some definite action in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very short in the three minutes I have.  All in the House are of the view that the creation of ground rents in future should not be allowed, that persons who are owners of houses should be owners of the land.  I should like to express a view on this.</P>
      <P>Loose words have been used that ground rents created in the past have been immoral.  I do not subscribe to that.  It is very wrong that the view should go from this House, that the statement should be glibly accepted. I strongly dissent from it.  Basically, the creation of a ground rent has been a right to property by the owner, and in the past the ground rent was usually let to somebody who carried out development.  That is the distinction between a ground rent and a profit rent and it has been confused by some of the contributors to the debate.  Whenever we get into the realm of property in this country there are always great difficulties in effecting reforms.  We have had it in many fields and it will continue in regard to property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of a lot of people, and the House, I want to highlight one fact.  Basically, the reason for the creation of ground rents very often arises as a result of legal advice given to builders by their lawyers, and it is in the nature of a convenant attaching to a leasehold interest. If you retain a rent on property you can impose both a negative and a positive covenant which will protect fellow owners, other householders <Col N="1369" /> on the estate.  You can bind people by a positive covenant to do something for the betterment of the estate, but if you give absolute ownership of land on which the house stands, sometimes you are giving the freehold estate of the land and you cannot have a positive covenant attached to that except just to last the lifetime of the first owner.  It cannot continue down along the line to successors, whereas a negative covenant prohibits a person from doing something, and that can continue.  That is the reason why this has been used in most development schemes in urban and semi-urban areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express very grave disappointment at the Minister's approach to the motion. With regard to the amendment, I regard it as a very cheap effort in the political sense.  It is unworthy of the situation where there are many thousands of people involved and it must be understood for what it is, a political act, to use a phrase used by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, of trick-of-the-loopery to prevent a vote on the motion on the Order Paper in my name.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister is not here to hear me saying that his approach and the approach of the other two members of the Government side who spoke&mdash;one for three minutes this evening and the other for 11 minutes yesterday&mdash;holds no hope that I can see for the immediate introduction of legislation to prevent the creation of new ground rents, no hope for the many thousands who make a case for the abolition of ground rents in existence. The Minister and his party&mdash;Labour offered no speaker in this debate&mdash;by their contributions have given frustration, anxiety, dissatisfaction, disenchantment&mdash;a Bible-full of adjectives could be used&mdash;to the thousands of people affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will soon avail himself of the opportunity to make an important announcement on this problem.  He went to great <Col N="1370" /> pains to excuse himself on a personal basis and to say he never gave the impression to anybody that it was Fianna Fáil who were delaying the introduction of this legislation.  So well he should.  We never did. What we are doing is urging the Minister to bring the legislation to the House where we will give him an almost free run with it so that the Bill could be enacted in the shortest possible time.  He is being assured of the full co-operation of the Opposition in this chamber.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister went to great pains in his statement to dissociate himself from members of his party and indeed from his Government colleagues.  One member of his party and one of the other two who spoke, indirectly stated on a few occasions&mdash;I know I am not allowed to quote the unrevised record of what was said here yesterday evening&mdash; and gave the impression that if this back-up was not there, then this legislation could be brought in and dealt with.  Again I want categorically to deny that that is the situation.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party members who participated in the debate showed no awareness of the many cases of hardship which are in existence.  There is one case of which I have heard.  I understand that I should not give the name or address.  This gentleman purchased a leasehold interest in a premises from the former owner in 1953.  The premises were in a very bad state of repair and the person who purchased them spent a considerable amount of money after the purchase and over the years in putting and keeping this old house in a habitable condition.  The ground landlord at the time was the Vernon Estate.  After the purchase the purchaser was promised a reversionary lease by the landlord's solicitor, a promise which was never carried into effect, and no good reason was given for the failure to carry it out.  The ground and ground rent, in effect, the premises, were later sold over the person's head to another landlord without any notice to him, much less an offer from the estate to sell the premises to him as in all conscience <Col N="1371" /> should have been done.  He bought the leasehold interest, spent large sums of money on substantial repairs and improvements, and even the Vernon Estate must admit that he was a model lessee.</P>
    <P>The person was written to by his solicitor to the effect that he was treated extremely unfairly and unjustly. The few minutes left to me would not allow my quoting the solicitor's letter, but the gist of it is as I have just said.</P>
    <P>This person has been engaged in litigation to defend his legal rights, to retain possession of his home, and his expenses up to the present time are in the region of £600.  If the Minister had any sensitivity, any sense of urgency or, indeed, a sense of justice these legal expenses and unnecessary worry and hardship could have been avoided.</P>
    <P>There is another problem that I should like to deal with briefly.  It is what is known as the pyramid of interest type of case which causes extreme problems.  People who try to buy out their lease find that the person who collects the rent has to pay it to somebody else and that somebody else has to pay it to somebody else and so on.  I understand from people involved in such cases that because of the magnitude of the expenses and legal work involved they simply have to throw in the towel.  There is a considerable number of such cases in existence.  Here again the necessity for amending legislation is demonstrable.</P>
    <P>A major step in facilitating the purchase of ground rent by householders was the 1967 Act introduced by my party when we were in office.  Experience has shown that a major defect in the legislation is the question of legal costs.  As the Minister is aware, the legal costs far outweigh the actual costs of purchase of ground rents and the question of title add enormously to the cost.  The attitude of the individual landlords in relation to purchase also adds to the cost.  In these cases the Minister must accept that means must be devised to reduce and even eliminate the burden of legal costs on individual householders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> During the past 12 months many landlords have attempted to dispose of their ground rents.  Such a course of action is preferable in their view to attempting to collect rents from a public increasingly aware of the injustice that the ground rent system entails.  Offers recently made include an offer to sell at five times the annual rent of £20, arrears to be paid in full and the costs included free.  To substantiate what I am saying there is another example where the price was four times the annual rent of £18 payable over four years, arrears to be halved and the costs to be extra.  In another case the price was 5.6 times the annual rent of £18, all arrears to be written off and costs fixed at £21.50 per house.</P>
    <P>Following the issue of the recent National Loan at 14.6 per cent, the maximum legal limit for the purchase of ground rents covered by the 1960 Act is somewhat less than seven years purchase&mdash;6¾ per cent.  It is now a buyer's market, and as a speculator will not invest in ground rents the leaseholders represent the only available outlet to a landlord who wishes to dispose of ground rents.  As a result there was an offer made recently to sell ground rents at 4½ years' purchase free of legal costs to one residents' association in South County Dublin. Despite the inaction of the Minister and the Government parties are endeavouring to resolve their difficulties without encouragement or assistance from the Minister or the Government. This is laudable, but it would be better for all parties concerned if the Minister got down off the fence and positively encouraged such development.</P>
    <P>These offers represent a piecemeal solution and can resolve only the more straightforward cases.  They do not apply to old leases not covered by the 1967 Act or to cases where there is a pyramid of interest or a difficulty in relation to title.  These cases must be covered by amending legislation. The failure to introduce such legislation over the last two-and-a-half years, despite many promises that the legislation was on the way, is the cause of much unnecessary hardship and expense to many householders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> I would like to propose that this House request the Minister for Justice to introduce immediately legislation prohibiting the creation of ground rents.  I would also propose that serious consideration should be given to the setting up of a State agency with wide powers to supervise, implement and co-ordinate the extension of ground rents on premises occupied as a residence or as a combined residence and business.  I would not object if this agency were the Land Commission with extended and appropriate powers.  The agency could be funded by fees levied on the landlord and on the tenant or shared by them. It would be open to the landlord and tenant to negotiate the terms of sale between them.  This is happening on a wide scale at present.  The State agency would be used only in a minority of cases where the parties were unable to reach agreement.  The agency should include in its membership one member who would have the background that would enable him to represent the specific interests and problems of the ordinary householder. The agency would have power to arbitrate and decide on all questions of title, costs, conditions and to register agreements.  The protection of the Landlord and Tenant Acts of 1958, 1967 and 1971 should apply to all long leases irrespective of whether the lease is a building lease or otherwise.  The time limit of 25 years within which ground rents can be purchased should be abolished.</P>
    <P>Whereas the Minister held out no hope whatsoever for the many people involved in a movement for the abolition of ground rents, I should <Col N="1374" /> like to say to the Minister that the question of compensation should not prevent him from providing a solution to the problem and helping them with the legal costs involved.  Many of the thousands who are at present agitating with the owners of ground rents would be only too delighted to be able to pay the moneys required of them, whether they have to buy out at four-and-a-half, five-and-a-half or six years the annual costs they are expected to pay.  If the Minister and the Government do something constructive and worthwhile to help these people they would prevent unscrupulous individuals or extremists from encouraging them to take the law into their own hands and encouraging them to defy the courts.</P>
    <P>Those who urge that type of action are doing those interested in ground rents a serious injustice.  There are many reasonable and fair people involved in the ground rents association and not all of them are extremists. These people should be listened to. There is a very favourable climate of opinion whereby the Minister if he wishes can introduce the necessary legislation and, so far as this side of the House is concerned, he can expect the maximum co-operation to ensure the speedy passage of this Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that because of a political trick-o'-the-loop that he is preventing us voting on the motion over my name in the Order Paper today.</P>

      <P>The first thing I should say is that this has been an interesting debate not so much for what was said but for the points of view put forward on both sides of the House.  Having regard to the amount of discussion that has been had on this Bill in this House, outside the House and in the other House it was not surprising that the views put forward have all been adumbrated at one time or another. What was interesting about this debate was the different approach by the Opposition to it.  It was so vastly different from the stridency, indeed the near hysteria, with which they approached this Bill when the motion to discharge it was before the House earlier this year and the same type of approach which characterised the debate in the Seanad, a violent stridency which has been completely absent on this occasion.  This is something we must be glad for.</P>
      <P>There were very unfortunate things said in the Seanad.  If they do not represent a majority view of Fianna Fáil it is good to know that.  We have heard all the other arguments before but nevertheless I propose to deal with them and answer them as best I can and in as much detail as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might start by referring to the changes in the substantive criminal law which are being made in this Bill. There are quite significant changes being made in it, changes which in my opinion improve the criminal law in <Col N="1378" /> those regards.  It has been suggested that this is not the proper vehicle for making those changes, that they would be better introduced in a separate Bill.  However, I was glad of the opportunity in this criminal law measure to introduce these changes because I believe they are desirable in themselves.  In addition they are desirable in the context of this Bill. It is providing for extra-territoriality, not simple extra-territoriality but in the context of a reciprocal measure passed through the British Parliament. It is important, when there is reciprocity such as this, that the criminal codes should, as far as possible, march on all fours.  That is another advantage in making these substantive changes in the criminal law.</P>
    <P>The changes have been criticised on the ground that they are unduly harsh and that they are increasing in a draconian fashion the penalties for certain crimes.  The query has been raised: &ldquo;What is the need for this?&rdquo; I hope to explain that the changes that are being made are not draconian; indeed they are not harsh, and I hope to show that there is good need for them.</P>
    <P>Taking the first substantive change, that relating to the law of robbery contained in section 5 of the Bill.  At present simple robbery is punishable with 14 years' imprisonment but, if the offender is armed with an offensive weapon or is in the company of one or more persons or if he uses personal violence, the offence is punishable with imprisonment for life.  This is provided by section 23 of the Larceny Act, 1916.  What the new section does is to make robbery punishable with imprisonment for life in all cases. The first reason I would advance as to why this is a good change is that the present distinctions are anomalous. A person who commits robbery when accompanied by another person is liable to life imprisonment; a person who robs a victim by threatening to kill him on the spot is liable to 14 years' imprisonment.  These, of course, are the maximum sentences and it is for the court to decide what is the proper level at which a person <Col N="1379" /> will be punished in a particular case. Nevertheless, when the Legislature indicates a severe maximum it is an indication to the courts that the Legislature is of opinion that the offence is serious and deserves serious punishment.</P>
    <P>That is the first reason for the change in the law of robbery, that the present distinctions are anomalous and the anomaly is that the person who commits robbery when accompanied by another person is liable to life imprisonment but if he is by himself and commits robbery with a threat to kill he gets only 14 years' imprisonment at maximum.  Also, there is the fact that little robbery is committed nowadays that is not aggravated in one or other of the ways I have mentioned, that there is another person present or that personal violence is used or that the offender is armed with an offensive weapon.  There is little robbery that is not accompanied by one of those conditions and, if it is, it becomes aggravated robbery and therefore punishable by life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Also, under the 1916 Act assault with intent to rob is punishable with life imprisonment in those cases where robbery itself is so punishable and in other cases it is punishable with five years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill we propose to change this law to make assault with intent to rob punishable in the same way as robbery, that is with a maximum of life imprisonment.  This is in accordance with the general principle of these changes which is to simplify the law in the areas in which the changes are being made and because, of course, assault with intent to rob ordinarily amounts to attempted robbery which is punishable as for a successful robbery. So, in the case of the offence.  I am sure the changes are designed to remove anomalies and to take account of the seriousness of the offence.  I am sure every Deputy will agree that robbery should be marked with an indication of our concern that it be regarded by the courts as a most serious offence.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 of the Bill deal with the offences of burglary and aggravated burglary.  It is difficult to make an exact comparison between the maximum <Col N="1380" /> penalties in the present law because the Bill completely changes the substantive law as to the offences.  The present offences are contained in sections 24 to 27 of the Larceny Act, 1916. These provisions make elaborate distinctions between the offences and the penalties differ considerably.  This is explained in some detail in paragraph 18 of the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill.  For example, breaking and entering a church at any time and committing a felony in it is punishable with life imprisonment. That is technically known as the offence of sacrilege.  Breaking and entering a dwelling house at night with certain other specified kinds of building at any time and committing a felony in it is punishable with 14 years' imprisonment.  Immediately, one sees a rather anomalous distinction that if the offence is committed at night-time it could attract a maximum of life imprisonment but if in the day-time the maximum is 14 years' imprisonment. That is clearly anomalous.  Entering a dwelling-house at night without breaking, or entering a dwelling-house or other specified building at any time, with intent to commit a felony in it is punishable with seven years' imprisonment. Again, that is anomalous and to a person hearing it for the first time it sounds a rather odd way to phrase the offence.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill&mdash;again I am synopsising what the Bill says&mdash;burglary will consist of entering any kind of building as a trespasser with intent to steal or commit any of certain other offences in it and will be punishable with 14 years' imprisonment.  If the offender has a firearm with him or a weapon of any sort, the offence will amount to aggravated burglary and will be punishable with life imprisonment.  As a result of the changes that we are making in this area of the law some offences will attract a heavier maximum punishment than at present while others will attract a lighter maximum. I am satisfied that the changes which this Bill proposes in the substantive <Col N="1381" /> criminal law of the State are good ones, and that they are right in policy, because the law should be clear and as simple as possible and should get rid of unnecessary complications and because a reciprocal measure to this Bill has been passed by the other jurisdiction. The changes will put the offences on all fours to a great extent.</P>
    <P>As regards firearms offences&mdash;and in the context of Ireland today I think no one can deny that firearms offences are extremely serious&mdash;the penalties for these offences at present are provided by the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1971 and the maximum penalty for the offence of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property is 20 years under the 1925 Act.  It becomes 14 years under the present Bill.  The maximum penalty for the offence under section 26 of the 1964 Act of possessing a firearm while taking a vehicle is increased from five years to seven years and the limit of £500 on the amount of the fine is removed.  The maximum penalty for the offence under section 27 of the Firearms Act, 1964, of using a firearm to resist arrest or aid escape is increased from 5 years' to 14 years' imprisonment and the limit on the amount of fine is also removed.</P>
    <P>Again, one of the reasons for the changes here, apart from marking the seriousness of the offences in the context of present-day Ireland, is to ensure that there will be reciprocity between the two jurisdictions in regard to these offences because they are offences which are scheduled under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thornley dealt with this question and he put some questions to me about the maximum penalties proposed by the Bill for burglary, housebreaking and attempted robbery. Apparently, he thought that the Bill proposed to make large increases but I think he has misunderstood the Bill. I think he prefaced some of his remarks by saying that possibly he was misunderstanding it.  In fact, he did so.  As reported in column 858 of the Official Report for 3rd December he said that burglary becomes a felony punishable with imprisonment for life, which penalty, he said, would be ridiculous. In fact, burglary in the correct sense <Col N="1382" /> of the term, that is to say, breaking and entering a dwelling-house at night with intent to steal, is punishable with imprisonment for life under the present law and under the Bill this will be punishable with only 14 years' imprisonment. This is an example of the mistaken impression that has gone abroad in regard to what this Bill is doing.  It is only when the burglar is armed or has an explosive with him that the offence will be punishable with life imprisonment.  I think it is proper that we should mark our opposition to serious crimes of violence by ensuring that legislation passed in that area will provide severe maximum penalties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thornley said that housebreaking and committing a felony is punishable at present with seven years' imprisonment.  The maximum is 14 years.  He said also that the maximum penalty for attempted robbery is five years, but this is not so.  The attempt is punishable in theory by unlimited imprisonment but in practice it has the same maximum as for the completed offence.  Therefore, the present law is complicated both as regards the components of the offences and the various punishments provided for them.  It is not surprising that Deputy Thornley and other commentators outside the House misunderstood the present legal position regarding these offences.  I have demonstrated to the House that the changes are not draconian but are reasonable because, first, they tidy up the present legal position and, secondly, they introduce maximum penalties which are of sufficient gravity so as to signal to the courts that the legislators of this land regard these as extremely serious offences, thereby allowing the courts to act accordingly having regard to the circumstances of each case.  Of course, we cannot direct the courts on what punishments to apply.  That is their constitutional prerogative.  These explanations may seem technical but it is important that the misunderstandings that are abroad with regard to the changes in our substantive criminal law be removed.  The changes are severe but the offences are extremely serious, involving firearms, <Col N="1383" /> robbery and all these other heinous crimes.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked me to clarify a point in relation to section 8. When he was speaking in this debate he suggested, as reported at column 796/7 of the Official Report for 3rd December, that the effect of the section would be that persons accused of offences under that section of possessing firearms or ammunition in suspicious circumstances would be guilty until proved innocent.  This is a misconception and is not what the section says.  The section reads:</P>
    <P>A person who has a firearm or ammunition in his possession or under his control in such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable inference that he has not got it in his possession or under his control for a lawful purpose shall, unless he has it in his possession or under his control for a lawful purpose, be guilty of an offence...</P>
    <P>This does not mean, as the Deputy thought, that an accused is guilty until he proves his innocence.  The Deputy quoted two sentences from paragraph 20 of the explanatory memorandum as purporting to show in his view that the Bill would have this effect.  These read:</P>
    <P>The essence of the offence will thus be the suspicious circumstances in which the person in question has the firearm or ammunition. Where the defence is that the accused's purpose was lawful, the new section casts an evidential burden on the accused of proving this.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately Deputy O'Connell did not read the next few sentences which explain what an evidential burden of proof means.  It is a technical matter relating to the law of evidence and I quote:</P>
    <P>That is to say, if the prosecution proves the possession or control and the suspicious circumstances, and the accused's defence is that his purpose was lawful, it will be for him to give, adduce or elicit sufficient evidence to raise an issue <Col N="1384" /> fit for consideration as to the lawfulness of his purpose.  If he fails to do so, he will be guilty of the offence.  If he succeeds in doing so, the prosecution will have the usual burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that his purpose was not a lawful one.</P>
    <P>Under the section the prosecution has the normal duty of proving the possession and control of the firearm in question and also proving that it was in the possession in such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable inference that it was not in his possession for a lawful purpose.  That is the burden the prosecution must discharge and it is a serious burden. If they discharge it there is an evidential burden on the accused, not to prove himself innocent but to provide some ground to show that the possession which the prosecution has proved was not in fact unlawful. Deputy O'Connell has confused evidential and persuasive burdens of proof, but this does not surprise me since it is a rather intricate legal concept which causes confusion even among lawyers.  A persuasive burden of proof means that the accused must prove the matter in question on a balance of probabilities.  Section 8 is similar to the many enactments which provide that a person is guilty of an offence if he does something without reasonable excuse or without the leave of some authority.  Such types of offences are common in our criminal law code.  These enactments put an evidential burden on the defence but not a persuasive one.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest that the wording of the offence in question relating to the possession of firearms in unlawful or suspicious circumstances shifts the burden of proof. For the reasons I have stated it does not do so.</P>
    <P>The other line of opposition to the Bill relates to a number of aspects&mdash; its constitutionality, the procedure for taking evidence on commission, the effect it will have on our police and their role, the effect it will have on our judiciary, the taking of prosecutions and the allegations that it contravenes the European Convention <Col N="1385" /> on Human Rights.  I propose to deal with all of these contentions, not necessarily in that order.</P>
    <P>First let me draw the attention of the House to the amendment which was moved asking Dáil Éireann to decline to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the grounds that it contains no provision for an all-Ireland court, is unworkable, is inconsistent with Ireland's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and is repugnant to the Constitution in that it contravenes Articles 3 and 38.  Presumably that is the essence of the Opposition's case against the Bill.  To take first their claim that the Bill is repugnant to the Constitution, this was an argument that was advanced against the Bill from the time it was published.  This argument was pursued in the Seanad and has been pursued in this House but there have been significant and serious differences in the details advanced by the Opposition in support of that argument.  They began by arguing that it was inconsistent with Article 3 for the State to take powers to legislate extra-territorially, that this sovereign Parliament was not entitled to create extra-territorial offences and that pending the reintegration of the national territory this Parliament was confined to legislating for this territory only.  At this stage it is now common case between both sides of the House that this Parliament is entitled to legislate extra-territorially. There has been a misunderstanding of the nature of extra-territoriality.  This concept does not claim jurisdiction over other territory but it claims the right to legislate for actions in other territories of nationals and non-nationals and it does so on foot of a well-settled principle of international law.  A sovereign state is entitled to do this in accordance with a number of principles, the best known of which is the protective principle for the protection of its own territory, citizens or interests.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Opposition's argument falls.  Speaking in this House on December 3rd and as reported at column 876 of the Official Report Deputy Colley said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> Of course there is precedent for deeming an offence committed outside the jurisdiction to be an offence committed inside the jurisdiction and for its being treated accordingly.  We could not dispute that nor would we attempt to do so.</P>
    <P>That concedes clearly that extra-territoriality is feasible under our Constitution.  It does not infringe it in any way.  There was confusion on the part of the Opposition regarding the nature of extra-territoriality.  Deputy Lynch sought to rely on the wording of Article 3, on a simplistic reading of the Article in which it refers to the fact that pending the reintegration of the national territory the area of jurisdiction of the Parliament extended only to the area of Saorstát Éireann.  That is an incorrect statement of the law.  It was conclusively demonstrated by the Attorney General in his reply and is now accepted by Deputy Colley.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to a recent judgement of the High Court <i>in the matter of an application for an order of certiorari by Brendan Devine and in the matter of the Courts of Justice Acts</i>, 1924-71, <i>and in the matter of the Constitution and other matters.</i> He sought not to deny the principle of extra-territoriality or the right of the State to pass legislation having extra-territorial effect but rather to rely on this case as saying that the State could only pass such legislation in regard to its own subjects and he equated its own subjects with its own citizens.  He sought to rely on the judgement to support that contention.  I have read the judgment and I cannot see it as supporting that contention.  In the course of his judgement, the judge quite specifically said that the submission that a district justice had no jurisdiction because the alleged offences consisted of acts committed in a foreign jurisdiction failed.  The prosecution further argued that the peace commissioner who issued the summonses on which they were convicted had no jurisdiction to do so when the alleged offences were committed outside the jurisdiction.  He said there was no substance in this contention since it was admitted that the prosecutors resided <Col N="1387" /> within the area of the jurisdiction of the peace commissioner and this fact was sufficient to give jurisdiction to the commissioner to issue the summonses under the District Court Rules, 1948.</P>
    <P>In the course of his judgement, the judge, Mr. Justice McMahon said:</P>
    <P>In my opinion Article 3 cannot be construed in this manner.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that was to suggest that it prevented the Legislature from passing extra-territorial legislation.  He further stated:</P>
    <P>No reason has been suggested for limiting the powers of the State by reference to the extent to which Saorstát Éireann had exercised power to make laws having extra-territorial effect.</P>
    <P>In my opinion Article 3 of the Constitution in providing that the laws enacted by Parliament shall have the like extra-territorial effect as the laws of Saorstát Éireann means the like extra-territorial effect as the laws of Saorstát Éireann were capable of having.  Under Article 3 laws having a purely domestic import do not extend to Northern Ireland, but laws expressed to operate extra-territorially can bind those who are subjects of the State in regard to their conduct in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Clearly that shows that the court was of the opinion that the Legislature can legislate extra-territorially for Northern Ireland.  Deputy O'Malley sought to rely on the use of the words &ldquo;can bind those who are subjects of the State in regard to their conduct in Northern Ireland&rdquo; as limiting extra-territorial legislation to take effect only on the subjects or citizens of the jurisdiction passing that legislation.  It is wrong to interpret the judgment in that way and in my opinion that was not the intention of the judge.  It is quite clear that the judge did not hold that there was no power to affect the acts of non-nationals, his reference to subjects being a phrase used in a judgment he had quoted earlier.</P>
    <P>It is well settled in international law that sovereign nations have power when legislating extra-territorially to deal with acts not merely of <Col N="1388" /> their own citizens or subjects but with the acts of any person.  I mention that to clear up that point.  Deputy O'Malley raised this as an argument against the constitutionality of the Bill because the extra-territorial powers taken in the Bill apply to offences committed by any person, not just citizens of the State.  Significantly, he put forward that gloss to support his argument, a gloss as to the status of the person affected by the extra-territorial legislation.  He did not put forward the argument that was originally advanced in the Seanad and by his own leader that there was no power by virtue of the Constitution to pass extra-territorial legislation. It is now common case between all sides that there is such power and the argument in relation to the constitutionality of the Bill must go by the board.</P>
    <P>It was further argued that the Bill is unconstitutional in that it seeks to institutionalise the Special Criminal Court in that it give that court jurisdiction over extra-territorial offences.  Of course it does not institutionalise that court because the Act has a life of its own independent of the existence of the special court. Although the commission procedure provided for in section 11 can only apply when a trial is before the Special Criminal Court, should the happy day come when that court can be disestablished the Act will continue to have a life of its own.</P>
    <P>The other leg of the argument relating to the Special Criminal Court is based on the wording of Article 38 of the Constitution which set up the court.  It said:</P>
    <P>Special courts may be established by law for the trial of offences in cases where it may be determined in accordance with such law that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order.</P>
    <P>It was argued by the Leader of the Opposition at column 1721 of the Official Report dated 20th November that:</P>
    <P>Our Constitution never contemplated <Col N="1389" /> that while Ireland remained partitioned special criminal courts would be established in the south to secure the effective administration of justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Of course this again shows a misunderstanding of the legal position relative to Article 38 and relative to this Bill.  Article 38 provides that special courts can come into being when the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice.  In the context of this Bill the effective administration of justice must mean the effective administration of the law as proposed by this Bill albeit as regards extra-territorial offences and it does not take from the powers at all that the justice which is being administered involves the punishing of an offence committed extra-territorially.  There is no inconsistency there and the special court clearly has power to deal with such offences.</P>
    <P>The other criterion for the setting up of the court is the preservation of public peace and order.  It can hardly be argued that that criterion is in any way breached by providing for extra-territorial offences or the punishment of people whose offences have inhibited the preservation of public peace and order.  The argument that the special court cannot deal with extra-territorial offences because the trial of such offences would not be the effective administration of justice falls down.  Once the Legislature is entitled to create an extra-territorial offence that is an offence against the laws of this State and, therefore, triable in the courts of this State including the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>So the constitutional arguments, in my opinion, have been rebutted and I would refer again to the intervention of the Attorney General.  They have been rebutted, in my opinion, conclusively but, of course, that is not to say that a person who might be arraigned under this Act is going to agree with my view or the view of anybody in this House on the constitutionality of the Bill and it is very likely the Bill will be attacked again on constitutional grounds and that its constitutionality will have to be decided. <Col N="1390" /> It may have to wait until it is decided in that way or, as was mentioned in the course of the debate, the President may exercise his prerogative after consultation with the Council of State and have the Bill adjudicated on in advance.  That is the President's prerogative and it would be impertinent for anybody in this House to intervene and advise as to whether that prerogative should be exercised or not but I would say that it would clear the air once and for all conclusively on this question of constitutionality if a reference were to be made and it would possibly obviate the delays that would ensue if the reference to the Supreme Court came after the Bill was in operation and the reference was as a result of the party to a trial pursuing the matter in the High Court and the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill, the section which provides for the taking of evidence on commission, was strongly attacked by many Deputies opposite and on a number of grounds.  It is an unusual procedure, indeed in the criminal code in this jurisdication it is a unique procedure, but it is not necessarily a wrong or invalid or indeed a bad procedure because it is unique.  We have to look at it in the context of the time we live in and in the context of what this Bill seeks to do.  It is no harm to recall what this Bill seeks to do because it is my experience of this debate and of the debate in the Seanad that the net object of the Bill was inclined to be overlooked and forgotten.  We have the scandal in this island of people coming into our jurisdiction accused of the most serious crimes in another part of the island and escaping the consequences of their crimes, escaping being tried even for their crimes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, I think almost every speaker from this side of the House, or the vast majority of them, said they supported what this Bill hoped to achieve so I think the Minister is over-stating it a little when he says the net object of the Bill was over looked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1391" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly my mind would be coloured by this day's speakers.  They were Deputy Haughey who omitted to endorse his colleague's acceptance of the objectives of the Bill, Deputy Blaney who likewise omitted to endorse the acceptance on that side of the House, by and large, of the objectives of the Bill and Deputy de Valera, although I think it was an oversight on Deputy de Valera's part.  I would say that because of the general tone of his remarks.  I think it is no harm again to state here that it is very largely common case&mdash; although there are exceptions&mdash;on both sides of this House that it is a scandal that the problem of the fugitive offender should remain with us. This is what the Bill is endeavouring to deal with.  It is making the offences in respect of which those people have been fleeing crimes against our criminal law, triable in our courts and punishable, if conviction follows, in our prisons, triable in accordance with our legal code and customs and practices, before our judges and in accordance with our rules and, if this Bill passes, in accordance with this Act of this Oireachtas.  That is what it sets out to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again it would be flying in the face of the reality on this island if one were not to admit that the giving of evidence in respect of extra-territorial offences is going to present difficulties. It is more likely that these offences are going to be tried in courts of the Republic and it is probable that the vast bulk of the evidence will be available from witnesses from Northern Ireland.  They may be civilians, they may be military, they may be police. We do not know yet what conventions will grow up with regard to the giving of such evidence, whether people will be prepared to travel to the courts in the south or whether they will be apprehensive of travelling to courts in the south.  Some will, some will not, but we have to provide for the eventuality that some will not be willing to travel to the south.  They may be apprehensive for their safety.  If this Bill is to be effective and if these prosecutions are to be mounted and brought to a successful conclusion, it <Col N="1392" /> will be necessary that all persons with evidence pertinent to the case will be afforded an opportunity to make that evidence available to the courts.  Consequently it may be necessary to provide for the taking of that evidence in Northern Ireland and section 11 provides the machinery to do this.  It has generally been assumed by speakers on the other side, who are critical of section 11 and the machinery for taking evidence in Northern Ireland, that no witnesses will come down to the south to give evidence in the courts here and that, in effect, the only evidence that will be adduced in the Special Criminal Court in this jurisdiction will be the evidence of arrest by the Garda.  That is an assumption, and possibly it is a valid assumption, but I do not think it can be taken as a strong or likely assumption. I see no reasons why members of the police especially in Northern Ireland would not come down to this jurisdiction to give evidence especially as they do so now in extradition applications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>I am making the point that some witnesses will come south and that some will not.  On the assumption that some witnesses will not come south section 11 is in the Bill and we are agreed on that.  I am going further to deal with an assumption that was <Col N="1393" /> consistently made by Opposition speakers, that no witnesses at all would come south.  It was on the basis of that assumption that much of the criticism was mounted.  Generally, the criticism was that the whole trial would take place in the North.  Deputy O'Kennedy was not here for the entire debate.  I was present and this argument was put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to defeat the wrong argument. He will not face the substantial argument which is for the witnesses who do not come south.  That is why it is here and that is our case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going on to talk about that.  The point I am making is that the Opposition were exaggerating their own case by assuming that no witnesses at all would come south.  In my opinion many witnesses will come south.  Members of the RUC have come south to give evidence in our courts in extradition cases and I see no reason why they would not come south to give evidence in the prosecution of scheduled offences under this Bill.  If they do not come south section 11 provides machinery for the taking of their evidence on commission.</P>
      <P>This procedure has been criticised on a number of grounds.  It has been criticised from the point of view of the judiciary from the south who will be going north to attend at the commission; on the grounds that the accused, if he goes there, will have to go in custody; on the grounds that in effect the trial will be taking place in the North and that it will be generally unsatisfactory. The section has also been criticised on the grounds that by reason of this the rights provided by the European Convention will be adversely affected or will be diminished.  The rights provided by the European Convention are included in Articles 5 and 6.  Notwithstanding the fact that this formed a substantial part of the Opposition motion very few speakers dealt with these Articles in any detail.  The only speakers to deal with them from the Opposition side was Deputy Andrews and Deputy O'Connell from this side also dealt with them.  Article 6 (3) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights...:</P>
    <P>(c)  to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;</P>
    <P>(d)  to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him...</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this Bill in some way infringes those rights and this objection has been made in the context of section 11.  Section 11 specifically provides for the accused to be represented by his counsel and solicitor from this jurisdiction.  This right is reciprocated in the other legislation. The accused is entitled to defend himself in person or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  There is nothing in section 11 which diminishes those rights.  At the hearing of evidence on commission an accused is entitled to be present and to defend himself in person if he so wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitled to be present in the custody of the police. The Minister should quote all of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  The right that is guaranteed is to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing.  He is entitled to legal aid if the interests of justice so require. His rights in person or through his councel to examine and cross-examine are preserved in the Bill and his right to have evidence called is also preserved. I cannot see that there is any interference or diminution of the rights given by that Article by the provisions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy makes the point that the fact he has to travel in custody is cutting down of those rights and that that in some way inhibits the right to defend himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1395" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the fact that he has to travel to be able to exercise those rights.  To exercise those rights he has to surrender himself into the custody of the police in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, the exercising of the rights can only follow his voluntary surrender into the custody of the police in Northern Ireland.  That would seem to be a major qualification on the exercising of rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy permits me I will deal with all the points raised during the debate.  We are debating this Bill in the context of December, 1975; in the context where we are trying to deal with serious crimes committed in Northern Ireland and it must be remembered that serious crimes are committed by serious criminals.  These people have come south looking for refuge.  They have been arrested here and charged before our courts for offences committed in Northern Ireland.  Before our courts can convict these people our courts have to have evidence on which they can act.  The Bill pays attention to the reality in this island by making provision for the taking of that evidence in the other jurisdiction because if that provision was not in the Bill it would be of no effect; it would be a useless measure.  This provision must be in the Bill so that our courts can be presented with all the evidence relevant to the crime being tried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the evidence has to be obtained in Northern Ireland and the question then arises of the accused being afforded his right to be present at the taking of this evidence.  This right is provided for; he is entitled to be present at the taking of the evidence.  The question then arises of <Col N="1396" /> the actual physical bringing of the accused before the court in Northern Ireland.  In the interest of justice, and in his interests, the accused should be present.  Can anybody realistically say that to allow an accused to go to the North with a guarantee of immunity without being in custody does not mean that he is going immediately to abscond?  Common sense demands that the accused leave this jurisdiction where he is on trial and go to the other jurisdiction where he has allegedly committed an offence in custody.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any objection to an accused being in custody in the course of his trial or in the course of the taking of evidence on commission, which strictly speaking is not part of the trial though it is connected with it.  I submit that that is analogous to an accused coming in custody in a court in this jurisdiction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kernel of the Opposition objection&mdash;that the accused is being transferred into the custody of the police force of another jurisdiction.  If he is to go in custody to hear evidence in another jurisdiction, the writ of our Garda does not run in that jurisdiction.  The accused might try to escape or abscond, which would be undesirable until the trial would be completed and the man found guilty or innocent as the case might be: it would be important that the trial would be concluded, and there would be no sanction if he were to be in the custody of the Garda in Northern Ireland because their writ does not extend to that jurisdiction. So the custody of this person will be in the hands of the police in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objection has been raised that this is undesirable because there will be no control over how those police will deal with the person in their <Col N="1397" /> custody, that their activities in that regard will be unsupervised.  This is to ignore what is in the Bill, which very clearly and specifically sets out that an accused person in that situation will have immunity from all proceedings, civil or criminal.  There is a total immunity guaranteed to an accused person in the custody of the police in the other jurisdiction.  I cannot see, when that immunity is given and guaranteed, why there should be any apprehension or any worry about overseeing the activities of the police.</P>
    <P>Should it happen that the police abuse their powers or exceed their powers, or that that immunity is not honoured in the spirit as well as in the letter of the law, then the remedy is available.  It is in the hands of this Government, of the Executive of this State, who will no longer work this reciprocal measure because it is not being worked properly in accordance with the agreement set out in the two pieces of legislation.  That is a sanction that will ensure that when a person is in custody for the purpose of going north for the taking of evidence on commission, the immunity he is given will be guaranteed and will be effective both in the spirit and in the letter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>Yes, and the courts here will have exactly the same rights.  Should there be an abuse by the police in the other jurisdiction of <Col N="1398" /> a person attending for the taking of evidence on commission, or should there be any breach of the immunity which is guaranteed by the legislation, we have our remedy.  The remedy is that we will no longer operate this procedure.  That is an effective remedy because it is in the interests of the other jurisdiction to see that this legislation will work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  The position is clearly as I have stated it. Immunity is given and guaranteed and there is a sanction behind it to ensure that it will be honoured in the spirit and the letter.  I submit that once that provision is there Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights is honoured both in the letter and the spirit and that there is no breach of the rights given by that convention to an accused person to defend himself and to examine and have examined witnesses on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The other article brought into the debate as being impugned in this legislation is Article 5 which deals with the right of the person to be brought for trial speedily or to be released on bail.  I will quote paragraph 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone arrested or detained in <Col N="1399" /> accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial.  Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the arguments in regard to section 11 unless it is that the person has to surrender to bail. That is analogous in regard to bail in the case of attending a trial, and in my opinion there is clearly no breach of that article of the convention. It is honoured, and to suggest that it is not is wrong.  I do not think the Opposition's heart was in that objection because of all the speakers put up to deal with the Bill, and a fair number of lawyers among them, the only speaker who dealt with this point was Deputy Andrews.</P>
    <P>The other question raised in regard to section 11 had to do with the standing of our judges going to the North, that this would in some way denigrate their judicial standing, that in some way it would interfere with their autonomy and that they would not want to go.  Indeed, one Deputy went so far as to suggest that they would be afraid to go.  I must reject all those arguments as being unjust, unfair and inaccurate in regard to any member of our Bench.  The whole tradition of our Judiciary is one of dedicated, loyal, impartial service, and I cannot imagine that their standing would be in any way demanded or diminished by their going north for the purpose of hearing evidence on commission, for the purpose of ensuring that justice will be done.  They will be the people who will have seisin of the case, who will have to weigh the evidence and ensure that a just verdict is arrived at.</P>

I think it is an unworthy point.  Our judges will be present in a judicial capacity and by reason of their right to have questions put, by reason of their being present to hear the examination and the cross-examination and observe the demeanour of the witnesses they will be in a special position to assess the evidence that will be given in the other jurisdiction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been criticised&mdash;Deputy de Valera made this criticism&mdash;on the grounds that the State would be, in effect, acting as an agent for another State in the prosecution of its offences.  That, again, is a misconception of the nature of extra-territoriality. This Bill is creating offences against our law and when our courts are trying those offences they are trying them on behalf of this sovereign State and not as an agent for any other State.  Again, the fact that that <Col N="1402" /> argument was put forward shows a misconception and misunderstanding of the nature of extra-territoriality.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that section 11 will work and I am satisfied that section 11 will ensure that justice will be done and will be seen to be done.  I am satisfied that the immunities guaranted to an accused person going north will be honoured and that we can ensure that they will be honoured. I am satisfied that the position of the Judiciary in regard to this procedure is being safeguarded and that their status will not be in any way impeached or impaired.</P>

      <P>As to the alternative that is being proposed by the Opposition, they have all, with some notable exceptions, the exceptions being Deputies Blaney and Haughey and possibly Deputy de Valera&mdash;they have all, with those exceptions, indicated that they want to see the problem of <Col N="1403" /> the fugitive offender tackled but they have rejected this Bill on the grounds that it is not the way to tackle it and they have suggested that the way to tackle it is <i>via</i> an all-Ireland court, that if we had a court with judges on it from north and south and if we had a situation where the police would be amenable to some sort of all-Ireland institution and that there would be a common law enforcement area, one legal code, in effect, throughout the island&mdash;that this would be an ideal way to tackle this problem. I have already said that I agree that that would be an ideal way to tackle the problem but I have equally said that I cannot see such a way coming about and that those who advocate it were under an obligation to indicate how they thought it could come about and when it was likely to come about.  Of course, it is completely pie-in-the-sky.</P>
      <P>The Sunningdale Agreement which provided for the power sharing arrangement also provided for a Council of Ireland, a harmless institution, with no executive function and no powers but even that all-Ireland institution, that harmless all-Ireland institution, was so unacceptable to the majority in the North that they brought down the power sharing executive and that was one of the main causes for the bringing down of that power sharing executive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

If that institution, which I considered to be a harmless but a desirable one, was such that it caused the majority in the North to, in effect, rebel, what hope is there of obtaining a court of the type mentioned by Deputy O'Kennedy and other speakers?  What hope is there of obtaining an all-Ireland court that would have a high political dimension? I cannot see any hope whatever and it is unrealistic to suggest it.</P>

      <P>Let me read Deputy Lynch's reference to the all-Ireland court&mdash;Volume 285, column 1718 of the Official Report of the 20th November, 1975:</P>
      <P>I realise and accept the difficulties involved in establishing an all-Ireland court and making it acceptable to all the people who live on this island.  Before I conclude I hope to give an indication of how the institution might be made more acceptable.  I do not think I need answer the Minister's challenge that those who support an all-Ireland court should spell out how it could be justified....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Lynch and every other speaker on that side of the House who advocated an all-Ireland court had a duty to answer my challenge to spell out how an all-Ireland court could be constructed, how it could be brought into operation.  It is fatuous in the extreme to think that an arrangement could be made with the other part of this island that would provide for an all-Ireland institution with such wide powers as to enforce the criminal law north and south and would have police under one jurisdiction. For goodness sake, as far as the <Col N="1405" /> people in the North would be concerned, it would be unity by another method.  They have made their position clear.  They do not want that and we cannot force them to have it.</P>

      <P>There are silly questions one can ask but I cannot conceive a sillier or more pointless question to ask the people in the North than: &ldquo;Will you join us in an all-Ireland court?&rdquo; Even if the magic wand could be waved and an all-Ireland court could be produced in the morning, there would be serious practical difficulties of moving it from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, of hearing witnesses who did not want to come into the jurisdiction where it was sitting.  Would it be an itinerant court moving up and down as the witness decided that he or she would not go north or south as the case might be?  It would also have to make up its mind on the evidence adduced to it by the police and/or the British Army in the North, the same evidence that was traduced here as being so totally unacceptable in principle that our court should not even have to listen to it.  I do not know what evidence could be adduced to an all-Ireland court, if not that&mdash;it is the same type of evidence.  If it is valid for an all-Ireland court to hear and act on it, I do not see why it would not be valid for our courts to hear and act on it.</P>

      <P>I trust the common sense of our judges and in spite of Deputy O'Kennedy I have confidence in the skill of the advocates at our Bar to ensure that any evidence adduced will be carefully examined and cross-examined and I trust the expertise and skill of our judges to be able to assess it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much play has been made of the unacceptability of the police force in Northern Ireland.  I would respectfully suggest that this unacceptability is somewhat grey&mdash;not white or <Col N="1406" /> black.  I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of the 9th December, where the Deputy Leader of the SDLP is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>We will support the police as agents of the responsible authority in impartially seeking out any criminal and we would expect the whole community to do likewise ... What we will not do and cannot do is to give unequivocal and blanket support to security forces for which we have no responsibility.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, there is an encouragement to the people to support the police in the investigation of crime. It follows from that that people should support the police investigating crimes and seeking out criminals and that the police do so with the support of the minority&mdash; because Mr. Hume speaks for the minority&mdash;and that the evidence produced as a result of their investigations should be listened to very carefully. I submit that this is a grey area and to suggest that the all-Ireland court is a feasible proposition is to ask for pie-in-the-sky.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey alleged that the Bill was to placate the unionists.  That is something I reject.  I am sure his colleagues in Fianna Fáil would reject it too.  We are all agreed that the object of the Bill is to deal with the fugitive offender, although the people on the other side do not like the method.  We are all agreed that the object of the Bill it not to placate the Unionists but to deal with the fugitive offender who comes down here having committed terrible acts against the people of Northern Ireland.  I do not propose to distinguish whether the victims live on the Falls Road or the Shankill Road.  So far as I am concerned they are fellow-Irishmen and are entitled to any support and help we in the South can give them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey also suggested that the Bill could lead to vindictive prosecutions and that the evidence would be gathered by a hostile police force who would come down here in a biased way and that it would not be quite proper and we would have to act on their <Col N="1407" /> evidence.  Again, this is a misconception of the nature of the Bill.  This Bill is creating offences against our law which will be prosecuted and tried in our courts by our personnel and in accordance with our procedures.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is charged with bringing prosecutions before the courts.  This independent public official would have the duty of assessing the evidence in any particular case coming before him as to whether a prosecution should be mounted or not.  It is wrong to suggest that if a whimsical case was invented and papers sent down a prosecution would automatically follow.  The case will be considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the normal way he would consider any file coming before him for decision on whether a prosecution should be effected or not.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy O'Malley made a lot of play on the adaptation order made in relation to the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  For the benefit of the House the 1861 Act provides for murder as an extra-territorial offence but it was not adapted as part of our legislation following the setting up of the State.  That was cured when an adaptation order was made in 1973 and murder was thereby made an extra-territorial offence under our law in the same way that this Bill is creating extra-territorial offences, including murder.  A lot of play was made by Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy O'Malley that this adaptation order was announced in 1973 as something major and dramatic and that it was going to cure the problem.  One of the speakers, I think it was Deputy O'Kennedy, said that the Order has been a failure because it has not prevented murders being committed in the North nor has it led to any person being arrested down here.</P>

      <P>In fact, since that time not one single person has been charged under that order.  Was that window-dressing then?  Did we believe it then?  Is this window-dressing now? Do we believe it now?  Window-dressing is not enough, particularly if those who look in the window do not like what they see there.  You do not just make it a little more attractive for them.  You may have to reconstruct the entire shop premises and ask them to take a different view of the whole business.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy said: &ldquo;... was introduced here almost two years ago we were told that it was a matter of great urgency, a matter of great need and that it was important for a number of reasons.  In fact, since that time not one single person has been charged under that order&rdquo;.  It is still an important matter that murder would be an extra-territorial offence.  The fact that no charges have been made under it and the fact that murder still continues to be committed in the North does not invalidate the making of that order.  There are many Acts on our Statute book creating offences in respect of which prosecutions have not been taken because the crimes have not been committed.  We recently passed a Genocide Act.  If it were to be argued that the 1861 order was ineffective because no arrests had been made it would be equally valid to say that the Genocide Act should not be passed because genocidal acts are still taking place but nobody is being prosecuted.  If a law is necessary in its own right it does not invalidate it because no prosecution has been taken on foot of it.  Much play was made by the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have given the Opposition that example.  For goodness sake, there is no need for them to be defensive.  Let us remember that this Bill, which hopefully will be an Act shortly, is brought in to end a scandal in this land.  It is a scandal for two reasons.  It is permitting people to take refuge here from the consequences of serious crimes.  It is a scandal in its own right that people should not be made amenable to the courts of justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In this jurisdiction.  I do not mean this House.  It enables people to take refuge in this jurisdiction from the consequences of their crimes committed in Northern Ireland. <Col N="1411" /> I say that is a scandal in its own right because persons guilty of serious crime should be made amenable to justice.  In addition, it is a serious scandal because it is allowing criminal elements to come into our society.  It is bad for our society that that should be.  We do not want these people in our society.  They are rotten apples in the barrel.</P>
      <P>It is also a scandal because, unwittingly, and through no fault of ours, for serious legal and constitutional reasons, we can be seen by some people in the North as collaborating with these criminals, as providing a place of refuge for them.  We owe it to the people in the North, who have suffered so much at the hands of these people, to ensure that these criminals are brought to justice.  That is what this Bill seeks to do.</P>
      <P>It bears repeating again what the offences are that this Bill is dealing with.  They are murder, manslaughter, the common law offence of arson, kidnapping, false imprisonment, offences under the Malicious Damages Act, offences under the Offences against the Person Act, offences under the Explosive Substances Act, causing explosions likely to endanger life, robbery and burglary, possession of firearms and the unlawful seizure of aircraft and vehicles.  Terrorist offences are the offences which this Bill sets out to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the House that the Bill is constitutional.  None of the arguments adduced have stood up.  In fact, some of them have been significantly changed.  I have no doubt that the Bill is constitutional and when it comes to be tested, whether that be soon or later, I am confident it will stand up.  I am confident that the Bill is not in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  I am confident, too, that this Bill will be workable.  It is devising new, novel procedures.  It is devising some procedures which are unique but that is not to say that they will be unworkable because we have not experienced them before.  I have no doubt they can be made to work because they are devised by man and it is up to man to make them work.  If in the course of the operation of this Bill <Col N="1412" /> snags become apparent and difficulties come to the surface, these can be attended to and these can be removed. To say that because the Bill is unworkable or that there is a pie-in-the-sky alternative we should not proceed to deal with this problem is unfair and unjust to the people in the North, whom we have a duty to help, assist and save from the excesses of the criminals that this Bill seeks to bring before the courts and convict for their crimes.</P>
    <P>It is right to say that the consequence of this principle of extra-territoriality is that, having tried the people in our courts, if they are convicted they will have to serve their terms of imprisonment in our jails. There is no question of this being a backdoor extradition method by which these people will be handed over to the other jurisdiction.  We will have this burden of keeping them in custody here.</P>
    <P>No argument has been put forward to sustain the opposition to this Bill on logical or reasonable grounds.  It is constitutional, it does not breach the European Convention on Human Rights and I am firmly of opinion that it is workable.  Should there be operational difficulties, we will deal with those when they arise.  At least let us get it into operation; let us see it work.  The alternative of an all-Ireland court is quite unrealistic because the problem that we have here and now demands a solution here and now.  We have waited long enough.  If we were to wait for an all-Ireland court it might mean 50 or 60 years, whereas the problem is immediate and urgent.  We have the opportunity in this Bill of giving an earnest to the people in the North that we want to see violence ended and that anything we can do we are prepared to do.</P>
    <P>I reject the suggestion that this is in some way a sell-out.  This was the phrase of Deputy de Valera when this matter was brought before the House earlier this year.  I reject any suggestion of a sell-out or that there is something wrong or distasteful or something about the mechanics proposed by this Bill that is in some way traitorous to the minority in the <Col N="1413" /> North.  This Bill is in ease of the minority in the North; it attacks criminals and nobody else.  To criticise the Bill because it is attacking criminals puts one on the side of the criminals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish.  I said that this Bill is in ease of the minority and is designed to attack criminals. Some people would say that the Bill is treacherous.  The Opposition do not say the Bill is treacherous.  They just say it is unworkable.  Some people say that the Bill represents a treachery or a sell-out.  I say it does not.  It is not a sell-out or a betrayal of the minority.  It is designed to attack criminals and I am sure it is common case between all sides in this House that criminals must be attacked and made answerable for their crimes.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Bill should be passed and become law at the earliest opportunity.  I accept the Opposition's statement, with the omissions I have already mentioned, that they agree with the objective of the Bill.  Some of the statements made in the Seanad would cause one to have doubts as to whether acceptance by the Opposition of the objectives of the Bill is total among their ranks because wild speeches were made in the Seanad by people who are members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be allowed to raise some points of clarification? These were raised in the course of my contribution to the debate.  First, has the Minister given any thought to the problem of identification of an accused who will not be present? Secondly, has he given any thought to the arrangement for bringing defence witnesses to give evidence on behalf of the accused?  These and many other matters were raised and the Minister did not refer to them in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of identification will depend on the circumstances of each case.  As the Deputy knows, there are various ways of proving identity of an accused.  It may be proved through a description, through fingerprints, through an admission or through visual identification. What the Deputy has in mind is that there might be a situation where an accused will refuse to go North and that evidence of identity could not therefore be offered.  In such a case the prosecution case would obviously fail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a matter for the judge hearing the case to decide if the prosecution fails to identify the defendant.  I can conceive of cases where it has not been possible to identify defendants.  It happens from time to time particularly in motoring cases where the defendant is not proved to have been the driver. It is not a common feature but it is not infrequent in our criminal courts. There could be a situation where identity would not be proved to the satisfaction of the trial judges and the prosecution would fail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on the debate last week I was discussing the role the EEC will play in the industrial development of this nation.  I should like to refer to the European Regional Development Fund.  The sum allocated for the first three years is £541.665 million which is a very substantial amount for industrial development but the disappointing aspect is the very small allocation Ireland will receive.  We will get 6 per cent of the fund in each year and this is very bad not only from our point of view but with regard to the attitude adopted in the EEC concerning the application of the fund.  I should have thought that Europe would have taken a more liberal view of the underdeveloped countries in the Community, particularly Ireland, but also southern Italy and parts of England and France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of allocation leaves much to be desired.  It is fair to say that the amount of money allocated to Ireland will not be of any real help to <Col N="1419" /> the industrial development of the nation and the small sum we will get during the three years will only be a drop in the ocean when compared with the amount the Government are allocating to industrial development.  Our views on this matter should be made known quite strongly within the EEC. I know speeches have been made and I am sure there have been representations at Government level but perhaps we should take a stronger line on this matter.</P>
    <P>Governments of member states administer the scheme in their own countries and this is fair enough.  The fund is designed to act as an incentive to increase investment in respect of economic activity and infrastructure. If the fund increases in the next few years, as we hope it will, the question of allocation between economic activity and infrastructure will assume an even greater importance.  I should like to hear the Minister on this aspect of the fund.  There is great need for the development of infrastructure in certain areas and there is also need for greater economic activity on the part of the Government through their agencies in parts of the country such as my constituency in Waterford.  Quite properly, the Government have taken a decision to allocate most of the money from the fund to the western part of the country.  That is a fair decision although the EEC ruled that all of Ireland is an underdeveloped region. There may be a question of a fair allocation between the whole of Ireland rather than on a narrow regional basis.  This question will assume greater importance and will be debated more widely when the fund is increased.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of EEC policy which will affect industrial development here is the competition policy. It is important that we maintain a competitive structure within the various industries.  I would not like to see a situation occurring whereby we would have a development of monopolies.  I do not think it would serve the best interests of our country to allow such a development.  Where possible we should have competitive <Col N="1420" /> firms within an industry.  There has been a tendency here, through shell companies, and take-overs on the part of big companies, towards a monopoly situation.  To get the benefit of European markets one must specialise and have a flexible attitude towards development.  However, it is in our interests to ensure that we do not have monopolies.</P>
    <P>There is a danger of turning a blind eye to this development.  We should encourage small industries here.  In recent times I have noticed an attitude on the part of the IDA not to grant aid to small firms within certain industries.  At least two such firms approached me recently concerning a refusal by the IDA to give grants on the basis that the industry was suffering from an over capacity or that there was not a need for further expansion within the industry.  I do not like that trend.  It is a wrong attitude on the part of the IDA.  The firms that approached me have a long tradition in their respective industries. They are hard working and have technical knowledge of the industry. The IDA should be encouraging a modernisation and an expansion of such small family firms and should revise their attitude in this regard. Competition is good for industry and it keeps the big concerns on their toes. These small firms are quite flexible and capable of competing with the larger concerns.</P>
    <P>Industrial life here has been affected by the Herrema kidnapping and the bombings in England.  I cannot see foreign concerns sending technical experts or investing money in concerns here if they cannot guarantee safety for their employees or their investments.  The damage done by those responsible for the kidnapping and the planting of the bombs was great and those who perpetrated those crimes should be condemned by all citizens.  The amount of damage done to our economy will not become apparent for a number of years.  I hope there will not be a repetition of such acts which are nothing but an insult to the Irish people.  I was abroad during the Herrema kidnapping and I know of the reaction in Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> I should like to refer to the need for industrial expansion in Waterford.  Like the rest of the country we are suffering from the effects of the recession.  The number unemployed has doubled over the year; higher than the national average.  As a growth centre we need the establishment of at least two major industries to take up the slack that exists.  I am pleased that the IDA purchased 50 acres along the river Suir and designated that area for industrial development of marine associated industries. That is a wise move in view of the potential development of oil resources.  The industrial estate there survived well during the last year and the future of that estate is secure.</P>
    <P>It needs to be recognised by the Department and the Government and the IDA that Waterford is a priority area for industry.  We have suffered more than the national average in this respect and I hope this will be recognised in the coming years.  I cited old established industries like Denny's bacon factory and Goodbodys' as well as other old firms which went to the wall.  They need to be replaced.  I am hoping that an industry will be located in Goodbodys' factory which is still owned by Goodbodys', who I understand are privately negotiating in this matter.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill in so far as it proposes to increase to £400 million the amount of money that may be advanced to the IDA, who down the years have done a lot for industrial development.  As I said, I hope they will look on Waterford as a priority area in need of substantial investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes without saying that the House must welcome any proposal in respect of the creation of new jobs, any effort to be made to sustain existing industries, any effort one can anticipate to help the country out of its economic blizzard.  Having said that, one might be inclined to query the wisdom of giving to the IDA such big powers as are envisaged here. I share the reservations of Deputy Collins.  There is a theory that work expands in accordance with the time you have for doing it.  The Minister might apply his scientific expertise to <Col N="1422" /> this and possibly one could prove a similar theory in respect of one's demands increasing in accordance with what one can get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>I agree with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Here perhaps we should be somewhat cautious.  Money is very scarce and I am frightened when I see the IDA now looking for permission to spend another £200 million.  Where is this money to be got? It is not because this House agrees to it that <i>ipso facto</i> this money appears. The money must be raised and paid for, and having regard to the scarcity of that commodity we should look very cautiously at the moneys that have been released through the agency of the IDA.  I will not refer to specific cases but the House is aware that in the past there was evidence of generosity and magnanimity on the part of the IDA towards certain industries and subsequently it was not shown that that good faith and confidence in those industries had been properly backed by research.</P>
      <P>We must accept the inevitability of the odd failure and all sides of the House admit that we do not want to inhibit industry.  We will not back a winner all the time but what we refer to here is the extent of the moneys we are talking about, guarantees in respect of a single industry of up to £1 million, the question of advancing or guaranteeing up to £850,000.  In such an atmosphere we should be a little more careful than we have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to choose between the words &ldquo;reprimand&rdquo;, &ldquo;castigate&rdquo; or &ldquo;criticise&rdquo;, but I should like to speak to the Minister on one small point.  On 2nd July last the Minister introduced an IDA Bill and in the course of his introductory speech he guaranteed there would be an opportunity for a comprehensive debate on IDA matters arising from a Bill which he would introduce later that month or early in this session.  The words he used are identical with his statement introducing this Bill&mdash;that the same opportunity would be given for a comprehensive debate.  I do not use that as a major criticism but if we are <Col N="1423" /> discussing the use of money and hoping for a certain efficiency all round, there is an obligation on the Department and the Minister to give good example in the matter of efficiency.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to refer to another matter which I suppose is the real motivation with me in respect of this Bill.  It is an extension of a point made earlier about what I would look upon as a type of industrial intoxication. When money is so scarce one cannot get £10 or £100 on one hand, and here we are like many unfortunate business people who are in the same fix and who instead of accepting the position take refuge in making a show, in pretending that times are not as bad as they know they are.  I am asking that if and when moneys become available the case of the small man will not be overlooked.  I ask also that the IDA might use some of the money at their disposal to educate Irish agencies as to the merits of goods manufactured at home.  I came across a case recently of a small Irish firm established four or five years ago in the business of the manufacture of lifts for office blocks, hospitals, business premises or wherever a lift might be required.  Even though that firm had a worthwhile record in respect of contracts which they had satisfied their tender was rejected by the engineers in charge because the firm had not proven themselves sufficiently and the contract went to an English firm.</P>
    <P>The IDA should use some of their money&mdash;I do not think a great deal of money would be involved&mdash;to educate heating consultants, architects and other professional men involved in the placing of contracts as to the merit of home industry and home products.  They should be asked to shed the inferiority complex which some of them seem to have in respect of the home product, as indicated in the giving of a contract to an English firm for the installation of a lift in the Industrial Credit Company's office&mdash;strangely enough&mdash;although a satisfactory tender had been submitted by an Irish company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> I thank you for having given me the opportunity to refer to that matter and to make the other smaller points which I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Tunney I would be critical of the Minister for not having taken this opportunity to give the House a broad outline of his plans for industrial development.  The Minister did say that this Bill and other Bills that will be introduced will give an opportunity to the House to have periodic debates on industrial development.  The Minister has not taken this opportunity to spell out in detail his plans and his programme.  I am very disappointed that not one of the Government Ministers has taken the trouble to come into the House and to tell us what the plans are for tackling the very serious crisis in relation to industry and commerce now facing the country.  According to published figures there are 108,000 persons out of employment and unemployment is rising at the rate of approximately 1,000 a week.  In those circumstances the Minister has failed to give a broad outline in relation to the money involved in this Bill as to his proposals, as to how the money will be used or what the priorities are in relation to the expenditure of the money.  The Minister will get an opportunity when replying to the debate to tell the House what developments he foresees in this area over the next year or so.  However, I am disappointed that not one of his Cabinet colleagues could take five minutes to tell the House what they envisage should be done at this critical time for industry and commence. I am anxious to hear from the Government what their plans are for tackling this serious problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough. There are some points that I should like to make.  One is in relation to expenditure on industrial development.  I should like to know what the plans of the Minister and the Government are in relation to regional development. There seems to be a trend since we joined the EEC to shuffle off all our responsibility on to the EEC and to expect that decisions will be arrived at and money will be voted there for industrial and regional development here and to sidestep our own very real responsibility in this regard to bring forward a proper regional development plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is relevant to the Bill and to the industrial development programme, especially having regard to regional imbalances. The Minister and the Government should take measures to solve this problem rather than shuffle it off on to the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get away from this then.  Having regard to the regional imbalances that exist I would assume that part of the money we are voting here would be devoted to projects which would ease the difficulties experienced by companies in underdeveloped and remote areas such as the area I represent, in trying to compete and to survive in these difficult times.  I would ask the Minister to keep in mind companies in the far western areas who have to overcome serious handicaps.  I would suggest that part of the money being expended by the IDA should be used to encourage and help companies who have transportation problems. They should be given subsidies towards interest charges and transportation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to quarrel with the Chair on this or any other matter but the Deputy appears to me to be talking about industry.  On a Bill to give more money to the IDA I would think that any aspect of industry and commerce can be debated in the House.  I would refer the Chair to my own speech on this Bill last week when I spoke for over an hour on a great many different aspects of industry, somewhat on the lines Deputy Daly has been talking about tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to make a contribution to the debate if I am ruled out of order.  From my limited experience here I understand that I can deal with matters related to the Industrial Development Acts and to this Bill.  If I cannot do that I would have to seek advice on the position.  I have been looking over the contributions made on other Bills of this nature, in particular, the 1969 Bill and the 1972 Bill.  I found that Deputies were allowed when debating those Bills, without objection from the Chair or anybody else, to make broad statements on industrial development. I find it extremely difficult to carry on when the Chair is raising these points with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had serious difficulties in regard to industrial development over the past few years and there have been serious cases where foreign <Col N="1427" /> industrialists fleeced the country out of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money that was voted by this House. Recently in my own constituency there was a case that I raised here on the Adjournment, where a company came in here and got a grant of £200,000 from the Industrial Development Authority to establish an industry. I believe the total investment by that foreign company, which was established in Kilrush, was something like $50.  In granting sums of money of this magnitude, and money is very scarce at this time, a serious look should be taken at these companies so that this situation could not arise.</P>
    <P>This puts doubts in my mind as to whether we should continue such a system.  I believe the Minister should review the whole procedure if this type of thing can happen.  I admit it may be happening in isolated cases and that the percentage is very small, but nevertheless because it has happened some system should be devised whereby the Government can come back to the IDA and recoup the money if it has not been used for the purpose for which it was intended.</P>
    <P>The promotion of industry goes hand in hand with the promotion of infrastructural development, such as telecommunications, road works and water schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

      <P>At the end of the Minister's speech he said that he would provide periodic opportunities for Members of the House to discuss the industrial development programme. Do we have that or not?  Could the Minister tell us if the IDA have prepared their plans for 1975-79?  They promised these plans which will deal with industrial development, in their last annual report.  What is the present position of this industrial programme? Have any decisions been taken?  Do they intend to let us see these plans so that we can have an idea of what is proposed for the next five years?</P>
      <P>Recession has caused redundancies in many industries and it is necessary to have firm guidelines from the IDA about their plans and how they intend to find employment for the thousands of people who have been put out of work.  In my own region there was a loss of 700 jobs in 1974.  This is a desperate situation in the mid-western region where we have serious unemployment problems and we cannot keep all our people in employment. The IDA will have to have another look at the policies they have been following for the past few years to see if they need to be changed.  When they are preparing these plans for 1975-79, they should keep this area in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of pressure on Irish companies.  I was surprised to <Col N="1429" /> find in a supermarket in my town that Irish-produced goods could not compete with British imported goods.  I find it strange that biscuits can be imported from Britain and sold cheaper than Irish biscuits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign which this Government introduced and which has been a complete failure.  A very large number of jobs are in jeopardy because British produced goods can be sold cheaper on the Irish market than Irish-produced goods.  This causes people to switch to the cheaper items and this affects the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.</P>
      <P>Because of the continuous interruptions I have had from the Chair, I find it very difficult to concentrate on the Bill and the points I wanted to make.  If I cannot do this there is no point in the Minister saying that opportunities for periodic debate will be afforded to Deputies if, when these periodic opportunities are afforded to us, we cannot deal with the broad industrial development programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the last speaker, I thought we would have an opportunity of discussing where this money will be spent.  The Minister is giving more money to the IDA for the development of industry.  For people in the west particularly, the development of industry is very important, because so many people are unfortunately leaving the land.  The only place they can find employment is in industry.  Therefore, we are very <Col N="1430" /> interested in this industrial development, and how the money will be spent.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that the Minister's brief on such an important matter was so short.  I would now like to discuss the spending of so much money on foreign industries which, when anything goes wrong, just pack up and go.  The Minister should try to get the IDA to take a chance on small Irish industries if they have any development programme because in that way we would be keeping our people at home.  I am not against bringing in foreign industries but they should be screened very carefully.</P>
      <P>Deputy Daly spoke about what happened in Clare but it also happened all over the country.  Huge amounts of the taxpayers' money were invested in foreign industries and at the first sign of difficulty the foreign industrialists packed up and went home. Something should be done about this. If the IDA supported small Irish industries more people would be employed. This should be taken into account because, as Deputy Daly said, there are 108,000 unemployed at the moment.</P>

      <P>Whether an offence is of a terrorist-type cannot be established by any objective criterion.  Accordingly official records cannot be used to provide an answer to the question.  If the Deputy cares to put down a question asking for the number of warrants received in respect of any specific category of <Col N="1316" /> offence I shall have the figures compiled. It may, however, be of interest that in the period mentioned a total of 404 persons were returned to Britain and 52 to Northern Ireland on foot of warrants issued in those jurisdictions.</P>

      <P>I assume that this question relates to the amended scheme of unemployment assistance for smallholders introduced in 1966 whereby in specified areas of congestion means derived from the use of land is, generally speaking, assessed on the notional basis of £20 per £1 of land valuation. So far the information requested at (a) is concerned the answer is that the scheme applies in all counties of Connacht, together with the counties of Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Kerry, Longford, Monaghan and parts of west Cork and west Limerick.</P>
      <P>As to (b) I am not too clear what exactly the Deputy has in mind.  There are in fact no statutory qualification limits regarding valuation or family size for participation in the scheme. However, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement showing for each year since 1966 the limits of valuation in respect of certain typical categories of smallholders at which, in practice, they would not be eligible to participate in the scheme.</P>
      <P>With regard to (c) the answer is that the information sought is not available on a county basis.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

      <P>A claim for unemployment benefit made by the person concerned on 20th October, 1975, was disallowed by a deciding officer on the ground that she did not satisfy the statutory condition for entitlement to benefit which requires a claimant to be available for employment.  She has appealed against the deciding officer's decision and an appeal hearing, at which it will be open to her to attend and give evidence on her own behalf, will be arranged as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>A claim for unemployment benefit made by the person concerned on 12th August, 1975, was disallowed by a deciding officer with effect from that date on the ground that she did not satisfy the statutory condition for entitlement to benefit which requires a claimant to be available for employment. The claimant appealed against this decision and after an oral hearing of the appeal, at which she attended and gave evidence, the appeals officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer.  An appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
