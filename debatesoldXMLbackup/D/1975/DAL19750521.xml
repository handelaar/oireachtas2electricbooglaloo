      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>An extraordinary omission from the Minister's speech was the complete absence of any reference to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  It is quite incomprehensible to me that the Minister would not make some reference to the work of that board and its achievements and I want to inquire from the Minister if there is any particular significance in this omission on his part. In my view this is one of the most successful institutions ever established. It is making a really worthwhile contribution to our health services.  Its affairs are conducted with efficiency and, at the same time, the board's approach is sympathetic and flexible. It certainly demonstrates the value of the insurance approach in health matters. I wonder if that is the reason why the Minister has not adverted to the work of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we extend and develop our health services we must, I believe, make the fullest possible use of the voluntary health insurance principle wherever that is appropriate.  I believe it would be tragic and disastrous if the Minister were to permit any doctrinaire approach on his part to militate against the maximum possible development of a system of voluntary health insurance.  One of the lessons we can learn from the experience in other countries, countries which have tried different approaches to health matters, is that no matter what system is adopted a system of insurance can make a useful contribution in any overall situation. I would hope the Minister will be able to reassure us, when he <Col N="165" /> comes to reply on this matter, that there is nothing of great significance or importance in his omitting any reference in his opening statement to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>
    <P>On the administration of the health services in general we should always keep in our minds the fact that any service is only as good as those who provide it make it.  It is essential that everybody in the administration of the health services be encouraged to give of his or her best.  That places a premium on good staff relationships and on the creation of a good atmosphere, an atmosphere of co-operation. The Minister should take positive and definite action to promote the best possible relations he can between himself and all those engaged in the administration of the health services, whether they be professional bodies, trade unions or unorganised groups.  It is very easy in the administration of a public service in modern times to let things deteriorate into sterile, antagonistic attitudes.  It is essential that that sort of situation be avoided because, if it is not, everything will suffer.  No matter what moneys we provide and no matter what mechanisms we make available, if the atmosphere and the spirit of co-operation is lacking, then to a large extent our efforts will be nullified.  The real role of a Minister for Health is, perhaps, in providing inspiration to all those engaged in the provision of health services.  Perhaps that is the best contribution a Minister can make.</P>
    <P>Arising out of that, I should like now to comment on a criticism the Minister made of this Party in regard to our Private Members' motion.  In his opening statement the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Consequently before any major increase in the percentage of the population covered is brought about I must have discussions with the professions concerned and reach agreement with them.</P>
    <P>This would be normal industrial relations practice, apart from anything else.  I do not think the Opposition <Col N="166" /> took sufficient account of these two major constraints, when they put forward the motion in this House recently to increase the percentage of the population covered by medical cards from 35 per cent to about 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>First of all, I want to rebut that criticism because naturally, in putting forward the motion, we assured, if the Minister were to adopt this proposal and put it into operation, we would have the consultations to which he refers.  His apparent adherence to the principle of having discussions with the professions concerned and reaching agreement with them before making some substantial change in the health services is at complete variance with what he did in the case of the extension of the hospital consultancy services.</P>
    <P>In that case, for some party political reasons of his own, he announced unilaterally an extension of these services without any prior consultation.  Of course, the results are to be seen in the fact that all he can say in his Estimate speech on this occasion, in regard to the extension of those services, is that he still hopes some time something will be done about them.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied about the situation in regard to registration in the country. I understand some people have very considerable doubts about the effectiveness of our registration system.  This may seem a technical and administrative matter of very little significance but it has an importance in relation to our planning and deciding on objectives.  I recently asked the Minister a question about hypothermia and the number of deaths which occurred from it.  He gave me figures of one in one year, two in another year, one in another year and so on.  They were very minor figures which would indicate that the number of deaths from this ailment were negligible.</P>
    <P>A medical practitioner of my acquaintance, when he saw the Minister's answer, told me it must be completely erroneous, that in the practice of his own profession he had personally come across three or four cases whereas the Minister gave me <Col N="167" /> figures for one, two or three as being the total for the whole country in particular years.  He might look into that aspect of the administration of his Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister supplied us with a very comprehensive supplementary brief.  I want to express my appreciation of his doing that, but I also want to indicate that at this stage it is of no use to me in helping me to make a useful contribution to this debate.  If that brief, which the Minister's department obviously took a great deal of trouble to prepare, is to be of use it should be published with the Book of Estimates or as near as possible to its publication.  It certainly should be issued to Deputies at least a week in advance of the inauguration of the debate in the House.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Department of Health, as published in the Book of Estimates, does not give us any scope really for debating health policy and health administration because the bulk of the expenditures are incurred by the health boards.  It is the accounts and reports of the health boards that are of importance in relation to this debate. Therefore, we should have the information brief well in advance of the discussion on the Estimate.  I merely mentioned that as something the Minister might keep in mind on future occasions if he occupies the position of Minister for Health much longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke yesterday at some length, and the Minister also adverted to it in his Estimate speech, about the need to improve our services for the mentally handicapped and our psychiatric services generally. There is need for a major comprehensive development of our services in these areas.  I would like the Minister <Col N="168" /> to take an immediate interest in the provision of a psychiatric service in our prisons.  It is abundantly clear to all of us that there is something radically wrong with the situation which prevails in our prisons in regard to the provision of psychiatric services and perhaps of health services generally.  I would like the Minister to interest himself in that situation.  People do not cease to be citizens because they are sent to jail.  The Minister has responsibility for the health of the inmates of our prisons just the same as he has responsibility for the health of any other citizens.  I hope he will immediately, because I think it is an urgent problem, do something about this.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a comprehensive geriatric service in every area of the country must be pressed ahead.  I believe the Minister accepts that and I want to avail of the debate on the Estimate to emphasise to him that, as far as the Opposition are concerned, we afford a very high priority to the provision of that particular service. There is fairly unanimous agreement about the approach which should be adopted in relation to this service. The elderly, as far as possible, must be provided for socially and medically in their own homes.  If it is not possible to provide for them fully and adequately there then they should be provided for medically and socially in circumstances as closely resembling their own homes as possible in their own local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first step in relation to this is the appointment of a geriatrician with an appropriate team.  That is the basic requirement.  There is no doubt that a community based geriatric service availing to the greatest possible extent of the wonderful abundance of voluntary effort which is available in our communities can make a significant contribution to the Minister's hospital accommodation problem.  I believe it is generally recognised that if we had a comprehensive geriatric community service the problem which exists at the moment of valuable hospital medical beds being occupied by old people, who could be otherwise provided for, would be solved.  This in itself would make a significant contribution to our <Col N="169" /> hospital accommodation problem. Once the basic structure&mdash;the geriatric leader and his team&mdash;and the basic service had been provided, further support services could be grafted on&mdash;social centres, chiropody treatment, outings and holidays, a home accident prevention service and so on.</P>
    <P>All these things could, in the course of time, be grafted on to the basic service in the local community.  In that way we would ultimately arrive at a situation where we could have easy consciences about the way in which we treat the elderly members of our community.  In that way also quite a percentage of hospital beds would be freed for other purposes.  I want to emphasise that that would have to be done gradually and without any sudden disruptions.  It is very important that the old people would not be caused any anxiety or be given any impression that they were going to be callously uprooted from their present surroundings.  This is something which would have to take place over a period.  The exclusion of geriatric patients from our general medical hospitals should be effected over a period in a humane fashion and should only be undertaken as adequate facilities are provided for their treatment and attention elsewhere. There is an important job of co-ordination also to be done in correlating the services which are provided for older people in the community with the medical services in the hospitals which must be available to them as and when required.  There is quite a job of fairly sophisticated co-ordination necessary in that regard.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear a report that at the seminar in Waterford the pharmacists offered to be of any possible assistance in this regard.  I understand they were anxious to make a contribution to the community care of the aged and offered to make their premises available as information centres or in any other way they could be helpful.  I am sure that offer by the pharmacists' profession will not be ignored by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that on the health estimate we are dealing with <Col N="170" /> something that fundamentally affects people's lives, something which will decide whether many of these lives will be spent pleasantly and happily or in misery and discomfort.  There are very few other ways in which we as legislators, can make such a significant contribution to the physical and mental well-being of our citizens as we can through providing them with a good, reliable, easily accessible structure of health services.  The resources at our disposal to do this are limited and always will be limited unfortunately.</P>
    <P>That means that we must use such resources as are available to us wisely, judiciously and cleverly to see that we get the best possible return from them in terms of human happiness and wellbeing. We believe that the broad lines along which this objective of getting the best possible return from the resources available to us should be pursued are reasonably clearly defined. They are, a much greater concentration on preventive medicine, a building up of the general medical service, the provision of the highest possible level of services in the local community with a corresponding reduction in the need for institutional care, the development to the greatest extent possible, of the voluntary insurance system and, perhaps the most important of all, the promotion of a satisfactory working atmosphere throughout the whole administration of the health services.</P>
    <P>In preventive medicine we would urge on the Minister immediate and positive action in a number of areas but in particular in regard to alcoholism. It is manifestly clear to all of us that there is a need for educational and rehabilitation measures.  These we see as urgent and imperative.  I become more and more convinced that none of us fully appreciate the damage, material damage and emotional damage, for which alcoholism is responsible throughout our community.  I believe most of us think of it superficially as a social evil but the more one delves into this area the more one becomes convinced of the deep-rooted, far-reaching results that it has in terms of human misery, unhappiness, frustration and despair.</P>
    <P>There is fairly widespread disappointment <Col N="171" /> with the Minister in his failure to get on with the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  I would urge the Minister to get that piece of legislation enacted and brought into operation as soon as possible.  Again, it is something that deals with a very important and very humanitarian area of administration. Whatever the parliamentary pressures are, there is no excuse for not getting that piece of legislation on to the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>We also urge the Minister to accept as an urgent priority the extension of the general medical service to a much wider section of our community.  We urge him to press on with the provision of a comprehensive range of home care and community medical services.  We urge him to announce the hospital development programme as soon as possible and get it under way, to take immediate positive steps to restore morale and a spirit of enthusiasm and co-operation throughout the health services, to get everybody involved in the administration of those services dedicated to achieving the objective which the Minister and this House lays down.</P>
    <P>There is more devotion, zeal and dedicated selflessness in our health services and in our health institutions than in any other section of the community. There is an abundance of that spirit of dedication throughout the health services.  Let the Minister provide the buildings and the facilities but, above all else, let him create an atmosphere in which this dedication can flourish.  I attribute more importance to that than to anything else.  If he does that and if he provides the guiding leadership, then, no matter what the financial limitations on us are, we can provide for ourselves here an adequate, satisfactory health service which will be as good as that of any country in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the previous speaker and must compliment him on the eloquence with which he dealt with the health services.  The reference to laboratory health was of great interest to me because <Col N="172" /> some time ago I felt that instead of an extension of the medical card service there should be an extension of the voluntary health insurance scheme. The Minister is providing us here with a very excellent, comprehensive, complete service in so far as it represents the wishes of himself and his Department but I can remember the debate on an Estimate for Education where nothing whatsoever was mentioned about physical education, either by the Minister or the spokesmen for the Opposition.  So, things can be overlooked and I admit that I would be the first to overlook things.</P>
      <P>Instead of an extension of the general medical services, it would be far more practical and more popular if we were to consider an extension of the voluntary health insurance scheme down to the general practitioner.  This is what people want.  In addition, they want a less bureaucratic system of obtaining a refund of money they have spent on medicines, as distinct from GP fees.  I would ask the Minister to consider that matter.</P>
      <P>It does seem strange that people can demand from a doctor a prescription for a bottle of Dettol that costs the State 100p in a fee to the doctor, plus 40p in a fee to the chemist&mdash;twice the cost of the bottle of Dettol.  We want the health services and the money spent on them to benefit those who need them.  This is what other speakers have referred to.  Why should a bottle of Dettol be an item that must be prescribed by a medical practitioner?  Why should a person have to spend eight or ten years in a university in order to prescribe bottles of Dettol?  The line must be drawn somewhere.  Why should a medical practitioner have to prescribe hair shampoo?  When I was on those benches opposite I asked the Minister <i>ad nauseam</i> what dispensary doctors were for.  Why should a doctor have to write a prescription for hand cream, for Dettol, for hair shampoo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall criticise the Minister very severely on this: he was premature when he told general practitioners to cut down their visits by 25 per cent. Admittedly, the media misinterpreted to an extent what the Minister was saying.  It looked bad because the implication <Col N="173" /> was that the doctors were over-visiting by 25 per cent.  I would ask the Minister, how can doctors in Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Dublin stop patients from coming in? We must have assistance from the health board in the form of somebody who will be responsible for saying that a particular person is not sick and does not need medical attention.  Anyone here can suddenly become ill.</P>
    <P>The health boards as set up by the previous Government are an absolute disaster.  They are chaotic; they are not capable of being administered; they are bureaucratic; they are the most expensive things that this State ever set up. We warned the previous Minister that that might happen.  It has happened to such a degree that it is frightening. They are so impersonal, it is unbelievable. The biggest health board in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom is the Eastern Health Board. Any of us in the Dublin area knows how difficult it is to get attention, despite the very sincere efforts of the employees.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to give urgent attention to the question of the emergency card.  Under the old dispensary system a doctor was obliged and entitled to treat a patient who had not got a medical card and who had not any money.  Under the fee per item, choice of doctor, service there is no way in which a general practitioner can do this.  Consider the case of a person who is waiting for a medical card to be produced.  There is no way in which a general practitioner can prescribe medicine for a patient whose medical card has not gone through or whom he sees on a Saturday or Sunday or in the evening time when the health board offices are closed.</P>
    <P>I have said that I would like the Minister, when the money is available, to give priority to cases of serious illnesses of a chronic nature that require special treatment, such as rheumatism, asthma, bronchitis and heart disease.  There are instances where people who have heart disease or who have suffered heart attacks and who have bought the necessary tablets are not familar with the system of obtaining a refund.  I have expressed <Col N="174" /> the view on previous occasions that it takes some time for people to become accustomed to the refund method.</P>
    <P>I should like to praise the Epileptic Society of Ireland.  I would hope that the Minister would approve a grant to that society.  Perhaps with a little bit of foresight they may be able to set up a register of people who suffer from epilepsy and diabetes and it might not be over-imaginative to suggest that we might have a register of drug addicts. One simple case is the case of hip joint replacement which is carried out in Cappagh hospital.  It is estimated by one of the medical experts that over 50,000 people need this treatment.  It would be no harm if the Department, apart from administering the health services, took the initiative now and then.</P>
    <P>I agree with the previous speaker with regard to the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  This could be speeded up.  We have had many hair-raising and very frightening problems.  Recently we have had even worse problems.  Even before they reach their teens children are taking drugs.  We knew this would happen.  We saw examples of it in other countries and we knew it would happen here.  Why should we be any different here?  What ethnic qualities have we got which divorce us from other societies?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bring this Bill forward and put it through the House to give the Drug Squad teeth and to give the psychiatrists in Dundrum teeth.  I happen to know some of them personally.  We must help them to help the addicts, the abusers.  We must give the Garda teeth to deal with the drug pushers.  If action had been taken in the past the situation might not be what it is now.  People sat and did nothing.  They even went so far as to say there was no drug problem in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder could anything be done about the amplification. It is very difficult to hear Deputy Byrne.  I am serious about this. Strangely enough I am interested in what he is saying and I find it very difficult to hear him.  Perhaps he could <Col N="175" /> address his remarks more directly into the microphone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Haughey for drawing my attention to the fact that I was not projecting my remarks through the microphone.  I should like to refer to something which happened recently in an area with which I am very familiar, an area which the previous speaker also has the privilege of representing.  We have had an influx of hippies from Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock, Booterstown and from the gate lodges of big houses which have been knocked down.  They come into centrally heated units of accommodation and squat and bring with them this dreadful disease which has been called contagious and which is known as drug addiction.  We have had deaths from drugs in an area which used to be one of the best areas in the city.  There must be greater co-operation between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Local Government to get these people out. For some reason they are inclined to percolate into the Achilles tendon of our society.  We must take steps to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer now to community and home care.  This is an excellent idea and I should like to see as much attention given to it as is possible.  We must do what we can in the area of prophylactic medicine.  I know steps have been taken in that direction and a lot of money has been spent.</P>
      <P>Where is the vast majority of the money covered by this Estimate?  It is with the health boards.  We do not discuss them here.  The previous Minister for Health made them as autonomous as they could be.  A Deputy could ask a question about a health board but it would not be answered under the previous Administration.  If you ask a question about all the health boards you get a reply.  I should like the Minister to take a serious hard look at the health boards to see if something can be done.  This was the most bureaucratic autocratic action ever taken in the medical field since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> The ambulance service in the large urban areas is an excellent service.  A qualified medical doctor should travel in an ambulance going to deal with a casualty.  I know the cardiac ambulance carries a doctor.  I should like to see casualty ambulances carrying a doctor towards the scene of an accident. Anti-shock therapy could be initiated immediately before complications set in.  I know there is a problem about insurance and that doctors are not insured to work outside the perimeter of the hospital.  The Minister should take a practical look at this question.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a look could also be taken at the stations where the ambulances are sited.  It might be no harm to allow a few ambulances to work from the major casualty hospitals.  There again there is the problem of the ambulances being the responsibility of the Department of Local Government and the hospitals being the responsibility of the Department of Health.  In the middle there is the massive morass of the health boards.</P>
    <P>I called before on the Minister, and I do so again, to set up a health commission to investigate ill health associated with high rise centrally heated flats.  There are eight pieces of research which have come back from the United Kingdom and the Continent which show a 33? per cent minimum increase in ill health, due to living in high rise centrally heated flats.  My contention is that it may even be higher where one has a higher percentage of the population as children and also where the central heating is compulsory and there is no control.  Since 1969 I have asked for this and if we are talking about community care in a sincere way we should be in a position to instruct the families as to how best to avoid the types of ill health which apparently are associated with high rise centrally heated flats and perhaps houses with no other forms of heating but hot air or gas.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the health centres in certain areas which have a population large enough to support them be given diagnostic facilities and X-ray units, blood test facilities and technicians and a more excellent type of <Col N="177" /> para-medical workers so that instead of sending people to hospital in taxis, paid for by the health board, to have a blood test taken and ending up with a bill of perhaps £20 for the one blood test, it will be done on the spot.  Bring health out to the people rather than bring people in to the hospital.  We all know the astronomical cost of hospitalisation at present and it would be my one message to the Minister today to encourage the care of people at home by general practitioners and nurses, because we are a race who are getting older and older with regard to the breakdown of a section of the population. Whereas 100 years ago man in these islands lived to the age of 40 he is now living to the age of 72.</P>
    <P>We must pay great attention to the fact that not only are the elders of our society increasing in percentage of population but those being born into it regarding handicap and illness are also increasing.  There are children now surviving who 30 years ago would not have survived the first week of life.  All the illnesses with which children were born that were fatal can be treated successfully now.  In so far as a child can be kept alive, or increasing the section of our population that needs help and medical care, these are two factors which must be taken into account in any extension of the health services in a long-term programme. They are the two vital factors in our health services in relation to long-term planning&mdash;the two ends of the scale.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister if he could increase the amount of time and money being devoted to the educational section of the health services on diseases, in the schools and possibly some seminars in relation to the dangers of alcoholism and drugs.  It is also very important that a lot of co-operation exist between his Department and others regarding the rehabilitation of people following accidents&mdash;the psychic rehabilitation by which they will get the ability within themselves to go back to work in the confidence that they need.  It is vitally important that the Minister should take a cold, hard look at some of the laws of this land, laws whereby you may have a patient who the moment the members of the <Col N="178" /> legal profession get their hands on him and take him to court can be ruined and can come back as a vegetable.</P>
    <P>Now that the Law Reform Commission has been set up I think the Minister should make representations in this regard.  The amount of humiliation, stress and strain that young people in this city are being put under by members of the legal profession&mdash; legal luminaries, and perhaps some of them are here in this House&mdash;is nothing short of scandalous.  It is scandalous going on tranquilisers and sedatives before going into court.  It is a dreadful thing.  I see it in my own area where I practice as a general practitioner.  I see the best of people being taken in under this free legal aid and &ldquo;don't do this and don't do that&rdquo;, where the State is paying for the legal men, the barristers and solicitors and coming back wrecks.  They probably should never have been in court in the first place and with a little push over the hill might have been in a place where they might have been able to carry on their own affairs. This is shocking and scandalous, and I want to say to the Minister that he make firm representations, through the Attorney General, to the Law Reform Commission that this aspect of both criminal and civil law be looked at severely with a view to humanitarianising the treatment meted out to the poor souls brought in for the purpose of administering justice.</P>
    <P>With regard to that, I want to speak about the health services in the prisons.  This is a very sensitive subject at the moment, but I do not think the Minister for Health should, in so far as he can, accept a certain amount of responsibility in what would primarily be a function of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>The recent tragedies could possibly have been prevented and I should like the Minister for Health to have consultation with the Minister for Justice regarding the health services in the prisons.  It is important that this should be done immediately.  It is easy to do certain things in the medical field but it is very difficult to save four lives, and the loss of four lives in our <Col N="179" /> prisons could possibly have been prevented.</P>
    <P>Another important matter I should like to raise is the danger of certain substances produced by manufacturers. Paraquat is one.  The Minister should give serious consideration to this matter.  I will send him a detailed and well-researched private memo regarding the feasibility of the retailer breaking the seal on certain toxic substances and putting in identification additives.  Under present law there is difficulty in regard to this because it would be interfering with the product.  It may be possible, as was done with regard to the free school meals, to put an addendum to the Misuse of Drugs Bill to see that a fully qualified chemist can put in an identification substance into certain poisons he is retaining.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the officials of the Minister's Department for the excellent job they did with Dundrum Mental Hospital.  There was a time when only elderly people worked there but now there is an interested young staff who are doing excellent work.  They have a very difficult task.  I should also like to pay tribute to Irish Hospitals Trust Limited for the great job they have done since the 1930s.  Brilliant men initiated the programme of fund raising for the voluntary hospitals at a time when there was no money and when the Administration was going in a direction which turned out to be most impracticable in the hospital services.  Everybody connected with Irish Hospitals Trust Limited deserves the appreciation of the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The nursing profession carry out excellent work on our behalf.  I should like to record our appreciation of their dedication.  I give the Minister the optimum credit for what was done for the thalidomide children.  I should also like to express the appreciation of the ratepayers of the fact that the Minister has not increased the health charges on the rates.  We all hope that in the future the health charges will drop a little more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this to be <Col N="180" /> one of the most important estimates because it concerns everybody.  I should like to pay tribute to the doctors and nurses in our hospitals. These dedicated people look after the patients in our hospitals very well. Like Deputy Haughey I was disappointed that the Minister did not tell us of his hospital development plan. I am interested in a particular hospital which I know will be sanctioned by the Minister as a general hospital, but what worries me about the health services is that the Minister set his sights very high and he has not the money; it is not possible to take blood out of a turnip.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago the Minister told me there was no scarcity of money for homehelp, but if one goes to any of the health boards one will find that there is a scarcity.  We have to cut our cloth according to our measure at present.  For this reason the Minister should have accepted the suggestions contained in the motion introduced by our spokesman on health, Deputy Haughey.  We would all like to see everybody being included in the free health service but our first concern must be for the less privileged people.  The suggestion by Deputy Haughey that the income limit for qualification for medical cards should be increased to take in more of the middle income group was good and was a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the present economic situation we must concentrate our energies on providing a good service for people in the lower and middle income groups.  We should also look into the question of voluntary health insurance for the higher income group. In general, hospitals are over-crowded and when this matter is mentioned we hear a lot of talk about community care and home care.  This interests me because I face the problem daily.  The real care should take place in the home but at present a relative of an aged or sick person is discriminated against.  Under existing regulations any stranger who makes a cup of tea for a person who is indisposed qualifies for the home care allowance but a relative who looks after that person does not qualify unless the indisposed <Col N="181" /> person is bed-ridden.  I know of a person who gave up employment in order to care for her mother but the fact that her brother was visiting the house twice weekly meant that she was disqualified.  She did not meet the condition that there should be nobody else in the house except the old person and the person caring for that person. This is discrimination.</P>
    <P>If some stranger walked in and made a cup of tea for that old person, that person could receive it, but the prescribed relative could not receive it.  I have heard now that the prescribed relative allowance is to be abolished altogether; that there will be nothing in future except home assistance. If we want hospital beds held for those in need of them I would ask the Minister to seriously consider that aspect.  The place to tackle that problem is in the homes.  Let me take the example of a son who marries; his wife comes into the house&mdash;probably they have five or six children&mdash;and she has to care for an old person.  Unless that old person is bedridden the son and his wife receive nothing. When that old person gets a cold and the doctor is called, the obvious thing for that woman to do is to say to the doctor: Listen, doctor, I have five children here; will you please get this woman into a hospital.  Then that old person is put into a hospital bed which should be kept for more needy people.  We are living in a materialistic age; we have to be practical; I believe that were that young woman receiving a reasonable amount of money with which to look after that old person, we could keep at home an awful lot of people at present taking up hospital beds.  I am all for community care but I feel it would help if the person looking after the old relative at home received a reasonable amount of money for so doing.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously what it is costing this State in hospital beds, keeping those type of people in them rather than having them looked after at home.  The Minister should seriously investigate how much per day it costs to keep such people in hospitals, county homes and so on.  I feel it would pay the State very well to give a reasonable contribution <Col N="182" /> to the relative at home.  I can assure the Minister that were such relatives receiving a contribution, in addition to the old age pension to which the aged relative is entitled, every effort would be made to keep the person at home.</P>
    <P>Money talks all kinds of languages and those are the facts whether or not we like to admit them.  If such payments were made to relatives of aged people in an endeavour to have them kept at home, I believe the Minister would make money out of such an exercise.  I put that proposition seriously to the Minister, particularly when one considers the cost of keeping these people in hospitals and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am astonished to learn that the prescribed relative allowance is to be discontinued and that in the future there will be only a home assistance allowance.  Therefore, people will qualify for home assistance or nothing. We have had a dispute in that area which has continued over the past few months.  I have been travelling backwards and forwards to the Western Health Board in Galway, making applications for prescribed relative allowances.  I do not know whether or not this dispute has been resolved but certainly it delayed decisions being made with regard to prescribed relative allowances.</P>
    <P>I could not over-emphasise the injustice of giving that allowance to non-relatives rather than relatives.  I should qualify that by saying that the relative can receive it if the old person is bed-ridden. I put it to the Minister that it is more difficult for a woman to take care of an aged person who is not bedridden, who might be not as alert mentally as formerly, who is moving about subject to all types of dangers&mdash; such as falling into the fire.  At least the younger woman can get out if the patient is bedridden but, otherwise, she must watch him or her constantly.  I would strongly urge the Minister to consider that aspect of home care and to grant some allowance to relatives of older people, in addition to the old age pension.  I hear of such hardship cases all over my constituency.</P>
    <P>I come now to the medical card <Col N="183" /> aspect with which Deputy Haughey dealt with very effectively.  In this respect we have not kept in line with inflation at all with regard to the guidelines for health.  The advisory committees and the health boards work very well together.  I am now on the Western Health Board&mdash;I was formerly a member of the advisory committee&mdash;and I must say that any time we did press for a revision of the guidelines, we were somewhat successful. At one time it was £15 only for a man and his wife.  We had that raised to £17, £20 and, as far as I know, it is now £24, that is for a man and his wife, with so much for each child over and above that.  I think there was mention of a figure of £40 a week.  In this day and age a man and his wife with £40 a week should be entitled to free medical services.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister also with regard to the middle income group, which should be moved up as well.  Farmers' valuations should be raised to £100.  I feel we should move up the lower income group into the health card system and bring more people also into the middle income group.  Naturally, we would all like to have everybody included but we have not got the money to do so.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to bring to the Minister's attention from practical experience.  I am sure the Minister knows, from his long practical experience, that there will be faults to be found in any system.  For example, a person receiving social welfare benefit who becomes ill is far worse off financially.  I heard of the most astonishing case in my area of a farmer who had been drawing social welfare.  Taking his children into account he was entitled to £12.50.  That farmer had a heart attack and, when he left hospital, he went to sign on again.  Of course, one of the conditions of eligibility for social welfare is that one must be available for work.  But that man was told he could not sign on until he got a doctor's certificate.</P>
    <P>Of course, the doctor told him he could not certify him as being fit for work; the only course open to him was to apply for disability benefit, <Col N="184" /> which he did immediately to the health board.  As the Minister is aware, the maximum disability allowance at present is something over £8. That particular farmer had to manage on that amount, losing £4.  I want to further illustrate the hardship involved in that case.  Last year that man was drawing small farm social welfare; he was able to look after his stock, sow his little crop; was available for work and, therefore, received £12.50.  Then he had the heart attack; he is unable to work at all now&mdash;he has to pay for everything&mdash;and is £4 less well off because he happened to fall ill.  When I checked with the health board I was told that disability benefit is geared at the applicant himself, with no account being taken of any dependants, whereas in social welfare the dependants are taken into account.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister also to seriously consider the question of disability allowance and ensure that no person, through no fault of their own &mdash;because of falling ill&mdash;will lose benefit.  No man wants to become ill. People might chance anything else but I think any man would value his health above anything else.  But if a man falls ill, he will find that he is less well off receiving disability benefit from his health board than when he was receiving social welfare benefit from the Department.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to make with regard to the question of medical cards.  I feel it is a shame that social welfare should be taken into account as income for eligibility for medical cards.  I read in the papers the other day that the all-over average farm income is £1,500. As everybody knows very few farmers will qualify as development farmers. That is not relevant to this Estimate but is to the question of medical cards. Practically every one of those farmers would be well below the income were they married, were it not for social welfare.  That is what is disqualifying a lot of small farmers from eligibility for medical cards&mdash;the fact that their social welfare benefit is taken into account as income.</P>
    <P>I have always held&mdash;and I have been <Col N="185" /> arguing this about cottage rents and so on&mdash;that if a person has to get social welfare it means the State is giving money to somebody who has not a reasonable income in order to bring him up to a standard at which he can live.  Therefore it is most unfair to take social welfare into account in deciding the income for a medical card.  If a man has off-farm employment and if the income from both the farm and the other employment brings him above the guideline, then by all means take it into account, but if it is income from social welfare that is responsible for making him ineligible, I would ask the Minister to consider that.  I would like to see the Minister taking into consideration this whole question of the issue of medical cards, the allowances for people who are ill and who would be better off well and drawing social welfare benefits. The prescribed relative allowance is another matter the Minister should take into account.</P>
    <P>As regards the hospital development plan, I come from the town of Ballinasloe where there is an excellent private hospital, Portiuncula.  It has a bed complement of 204; the average daily occupancy is 168; percentage of occupancy 82.5; the number of patients treated, 5,178; average duration of stay, 11 to 12 days.  This hospital has a nurses' training school.  It is the most modern equipped hospital in the country.  I know that eventually this hospital will have the status of a general hospital but what I am concerned about is the delay.  It needs only two major appointments to make it a full general hospital.  I do not know whether it is possible or not, but I would ask the Minister to consider&mdash; this is in the eastern part of the Western Health Board&mdash;sanctioning this hospital as a general hospital without waiting for the final decision as to what the new hospital organisation programme will be.  We thought 12 months ago a decision would have been made.  The Minister may have good reason&mdash;and I do not intend to press him in that regard&mdash;for not having it in this year's Estimate, but in view of the present economic position, I hope he will consider raising this <Col N="186" /> excellently equipped hospital to the status of a general hospital.</P>
    <P>I was never in favour of the regional health boards, but I always like to be fair and I will say that the staff and the members of the health boards are very co-operative with public representatives. We have not got much authority.  I think it is wrong to take authority from local representatives because there is no one who knows the problems of the ordinary people better than the representatives who live with them.  The people who talk down to them do not know their problems. The public representative tries to get across to the powers that be, whether they be regional health boards or anything else, the problems he sees and the discrimination that occurs without the authority being fully aware of it in its administration.  The advisory committees to the health boards are doing great work.</P>
    <P>As regards the one I am on, there are very few recommendations put forward&mdash;and I want to compliment the Western Health Board on this&mdash; by our advisory group, which comes from the grass roots, which were not adopted by the board.  This is an indication that some thought is given to the proposals put up by these advisory committees.  Public representatives would be very slow to propose something that would not be practical or economically possible.  What we are trying to do is not to condemn the regional health boards or other such institutions but to point out what we see wrong and suggest improvements.</P>
    <P>I am greatly disappointed that there is not one word about the reorganisation of the whole hospital services. This is a very fine brief from the Minister, and it gives a very full account of what is happening within the services, but, as Deputy Haughey says, it refers only to what is already there.  The Minister is doing his best with the limited resources at his disposal, but we are disappointed that there is no indication as to the future of the health services.</P>
    <P>They are the few points I wanted to make on the Estimate.  I have dealt <Col N="187" /> with community care, home help and the prescribed relative's allowance.  There are just a few other points I would bring to the Minister's attention before I finish.  They relate to the drugs and alcoholic problems.  Before I come to them, however, I should like again to emphasise the need to keep people out of hospitals.</P>
    <P>In my area recently there was no bed in Portiuncula Hospital and a man had to be sent to St. Brendan's psychiatric hospital although he had not the slightest psychiatric symptoms. That man should have been treated at home.  The trouble is there is no money to provide a proper scheme of home care.  Apparently strangers can get paid to look after old people in their homes but relatives cannot.  If a girl marries into a house her mother-in-law is a stranger to her&mdash;her loyalty is to her husband.  However, from the home care point of view she is treated as a relative and cannot get money.  If this service were properly financed valuable space would be available in hospitals for people who need it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will soon introduce improved legislation to deal with drug addicts and alcoholics.  I have many friends who are on the verge of alcoholism.  Some people can take a good deal of drink and not have this problem but others simply cannot take drink.  Some of the latter have the best brains in the country, the best ideas on how the country should be run.  I appreciate that there has been a lot of publicity on the subject of alcoholism but the service provided is not within reach of the people who need it most.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the situation in regard to my local hospital.  I will not go into detail on it again because there is a cut and dried case for it and I hope the Minister's decision will be favourable.</P>
    <P>There is one more point I should like to re-emphasise and that is in regard to the £1,400 income qualification for a medical card.  As well as his estimated income from his farm and his possible outside earnings, a small <Col N="188" /> farmer also has his social welfare benefits taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>A man and his wife are allowed only £24.50 per week and then there is some allowance for each child.  I urge the Minister when he is reviewing the position in January to increase that figure by at least £5 a week to take account of wage inflation and the higher cost of living.  I know the Minister is anxious to provide the best service possible and, having regard to the economic situation, he is doing as much as he can in the circumstances. Some of the suggestions I have made will save money, particularly the suggestion that people should be cared for in their homes as far as possible.  This could be done if financial assistance were provided for those who would care for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister but, at the same time, more imagination could have been shown in the area of the health services.  Unfortunately I was not able to be present in Waterford at the recent seminar on community services but I am told it was very successful and that many excellent suggestions were made in the group sessions.  However, I wonder how many people left the seminar feeling somewhat disappointed, despite all the discussion that took place on the health services and on community care.  The Minister had a golden opportunity to encourage the development of community services.  I realise the economic situation prevents any dramatic changes but the Minister should know by now what kind of health structure he has in mind, which can be implemented when the economy improves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> I was somewhat surprised that the Minister did not mention the blind to any great degree.  I am asking him to give very serious consideration to the establishment of a national training centre for mobility and the rehabilitation of the blind who number more than 7,000 persons and thus release many from being prisoners in their own homes.</P>
    <P>The greatest help to a blind person is independence and mobility, either with the help of a dog, with a stick or some of the other modern aids being used.  There is need for a national institution for this kind of training and I would ask the Minister to consider it seriously.  I am from Cork and we have heard much talk recently about Fota Island.  There is a wonderful house there and a considerable green area.  It would be an ideal place for a national institution for the blind. I attended a conference of the blind in Cork recently and I was most impressed by and appreciative of the tremendous work being done.  It was wonderful to see the joy of the blind people who could move about with the aid of dogs.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to clarify one matter relating to the National Social Services Council.  I had the honour of being a member of that council for a number of years when it was established by the Minister's predecessor, the late Erskine Childers, and I know of the wonderful work being done by them.  However, I should like clarification of one of the council's functions.  In his statement the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The council is now acting as a central agency to encourage the setting up of information centres, to set standards for registration and to provide information, training and financial support to local staffs.</P>
    <P>From my experience of the council unless I am misinterpreting the Minister&mdash;there is a danger here.  The council were established to encourage and develop voluntary involvement in community work.  If a function which the Minister has suggested is given to the national council, they will fall foul of community associations throughout <Col N="190" /> the country.  We always avoided that kind of practice and we never singled out any one association above another. We considered it important to maintain the national council in an advisory capacity, to encourage and make available all relevant information needed for the setting up of community associations, for meals on wheels and other services.  The day the national council make a decision to finance one association or community development above another I will be worried about their functions thereafter.</P>
    <P>The national council have done excellent work.  They have compiled tremendous documentation which is a great help to community development associations.  Let us not endanger this by giving the national council power to recommend the payment of grants or moneys.  The council were not established for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister put such emphasis on community services. More emphasis could have been and should have been placed on voluntary involvement.  The Minister should review the whole structure of health services and he should bear in mind in particular the services administered by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan made an appeal to keep people out of hospital.  Over the years we have been spending millions on institutions when we should have been spending millions on keeping people out of institutions.  Consider the cost of keeping an old person in a hospital or institution.  I am sure it would be anything up to £35 a week. We offer a relative who is prepared to look after an old person at home the meagre sum of £7 a week.  This is an aspect deserving serious consideration. That meagre payment of £7 per week saves the health board almost £30 a week.  The policy should be to keep old people out of institutions.  In order to achieve that aim we will need massive support services&mdash;the public nurse, the social worker, meals on wheels and so on.  Most old people would like to die in their own homes. They ask little at the end of their days.  I cannot speak too highly of the relatives who devote their lives to <Col N="191" /> keeping the aged in their own homes, with little or no compensation.  When the Minister is looking at the whole structure of health he should have a serious look at these services which come within the scope of the Department of Social Welfare.  I would ask the Minister&mdash;this is really relevant to social welfare but it has a bearing on the Department of Health&mdash;to continue the free fuel scheme the whole year through for the aged.  I doubt if it would cost the State a great deal to do that.  The aged need heat.</P>
    <P>Community care is so broad that it is bound to impinge on other Departments. I believe it covers health, education, housing and so on.  I am particularly interested in the education of the physically handicapped. This is an area for which the Minister should be responsible.  These people are often deprived of education because of long periods of hospitalisation. Later on they spend their lives sitting in wheelchairs unable to read or write.  Surely it is not beyond the capacity of the Government or the Minister to establish courses of education for these people.  The voluntary associations could help because they have buildings from which they provide services.  These voluntary associations should be encouraged in this direction and they should be properly financed.  If the Minister adopts that suggestion he will be doing a tremendous amount of good for the less fortunate.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister said that young offenders will come under his Department.  I understand there is talk about day centres.  These are good but they do not go far enough.  There is need for residential care services. Money should be provided for residential centres for both boys and girls. These young people do a great deal of damage roving around the place and ratepayers have to pay thousands of pounds to make good the vandalism. Justices are powerless because there is nowhere in which to put these young people.  These young boys and girls are in need of care and that care can only be given in residential centres.  If this is not done we shall <Col N="192" /> find ourselves faced with a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the preschool facilities under health boards.  There are people setting up preschool nurseries and there is no advertence to hazards.  This service should be operated only under licence in order to safeguard the children.  I mentioned this recently at a health board meeting and I think there was a recommendation to the Minister asking for careful consideration of this kind of service.  It could be a wonderful service because it would relieve frustration in the home, but all safeguards must be taken in the interests of the children.  Special attention should be paid to health and fire hazards.  This will have to be seriously considered without delay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this amendment and of the cognate amendments is to have capital gains tax assessed on the basis of the gain made by the taxpayer without reference to the consideration of whatever the transaction is.  I pointed out to the Minister that I consider this is a much more logical way to approach the matter.  I also understand it is the way in which it is approached in Great Britain and that it gives a greater degree of control as to exemptions proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out, in addition, that I am concerned here with the principle involved. If the Minister were to accept the principle involved in this amendment <Col N="193" /> it would of course be necessary to re-assess the various thresholds of exemptions proposed in section 17 and other sections.  As I pointed out, I do not have the information available. Probably only the Revenue Commissioners have the necessary information to assess what the thresholds should be.  However, it is important that the principle should be accepted, not only because a capital gains tax should be a tax on a gain but also because anomalies arise if one does not accept this principle.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out that one anomaly which can arise under a later section, if this principle is not accepted, is that a person could buy a farm for, say, £10,000 and sell it for £45,000. He would make a gain of £35,000 but he would not be liable to any capital gains tax.  On the other hand, if a person were to buy a farm for £45,000 and sell it for £55,000, therefore having a gain of £10,000, he would be liable for capital gains tax on the £10,000.  This does not seem to me to be a logical approach to capital gains tax.  It seems to me that by assessing the tax on the actual gain one is doing what the tax purports to do and one is also in a position to control the extent of any exemption given.</P>
    <P>This principle is, in fact, accepted in section 16 where it is provided that in any one year a gain not exceeding £500 is exempt from tax.  In that case reference is to the gain.  That is irrespective of the amount of the consideration. It could be that one would have a gain of £450 on a transaction in which the consideration was very small or on a transaction in which the consideration was very large.  I think the approach in section 16 is a correct one because it is getting at the gain made by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The more one thinks about it the more one sees that the question of the consideration involved in a particular transaction is totally irrelevant.  The amount of the gain is relevant.  The Minister was inclined to argue that there was an administrative advantage in referring to the consideration rather than the gain and that there would be additional work involved if one had <Col N="194" /> to refer to the gain.  I believe this is a mistaken view because of any transaction on which capital gains tax is assessed it is necessary to know the price at which the asset was acquired and the price at which it was disposed of, even if one adopts the approach in the Bill.  Once one knows that, one knows the amount of the gain. Therefore, administratively, there does not appear to be any advantage whatever in the approach adopted in the Bill and in particular in section 17.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, for all of these reasons, to accept this amendment in principle.  I recognise the fact that, if he does accept it, it will be necessary to alter the thresholds set out in different sections.  I am not in a position to suggest what those should be because the necessary information is not available to me.  But I do not think the Minister would have undue difficulty in arriving at new thresholds if he were to accept the principle involved here, which I suggest is more logical, avoids anomalies and does not create any greater administrative burden on the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I have given very careful consideration to what Deputy Colley said on the last day.  I think he has made no new point today.  On the general point which he makes that it is gains which should be exempt, it is the gains that will be exempted in all these cases.  This is being done by exempting the transaction.  Of course, gain is involved in every transaction and I think the Deputy will agree gains might vary in different cases. The relief will be given on the whole gain for transactions up to the limits mentioned.  There will also be a cut off point, which is equitable, as it will benefit those most in need of it and confer no benefit on those who are better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister elaborate a little on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The form of the reliefs will make the tax fair and equitable and place the burden where it should be&mdash;on those who can bear it. <Col N="195" /> The tax is concerned with gains but in the first instance it is a transaction for disposal which is involved.  The value of that transaction is the first thing which strikes the ordinary person or business man.  If the transaction, by reason of its size, is exempt, then any gain is exempt.  This is a very acceptable principle and is one which is easily understood.  It avoids the complication of working out gains, keeping records or engaging professional advisers.  The principle of exempting the transaction makes things easier for the taxpayer in so far as he can readily understand what is involved and also he is not asked by the tax authorities to give any further information.</P>
      <P>It is a much simpler taxation for the private citizen and the tax authorities and it will avoid the making of computations or the pursuit of people involved in transactions below these particular ceilings.  There was at an earlier stage a great deal of argument about the reliefs linked with money values. Giving relief by reference to considerations is clearly so linked as the cost remains unchanged while the value of the consisderation is likely to rise.  For example, A buys an asset for £1,000. If the value of the article increases up to £2,000 and if he sells it at any stage up to that point, the gain would be exempted from the tax.  If it were to be contended that all the gain is an inflationary gain, then all the so-called inflationary gain is relieved.  If it is not all an inflationary gain, then to the extent that there is an inflationary gain it is relieved as well as the balance of the gain.</P>
      <P>The same reasoning applies to sections 26 and 27.  All this is of special importance in relation to what some people would claim were inflationary gains when it is remembered that the threshold will be subject to regular review.  When the threshold is reviewed the amount of the gain relieved is similarly reviewed.  The basis of using consideration of these reliefs, therefore, seems on all grounds to be fair and equitable.  This was the scheme of relief which was set out in the White Paper and as far as I am aware it appears to have been generally accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> It might be contended that the reliefs are, if anything, excessive, that very big gains could be relieved.  For gains to be very large within the limit set in each section it would generally require retention of an asset over a fairly long period.  I am providing a reasonable benefit to people who retain the asset for a long time, who are not speculators and for whom the gain accrues only once in a lifetime.  Relief from tax could be considerable in such a case, and deservedly so.  It does not seem reasonable to expect that relief should be given to very wealthy people.  This is what would be done if an amount of gain, say, £5,000, £10,000 or £20,000 were to be exempted.  Everyone would get it.  If a flat amount of gain were free those who made only small gains would be relieved only to the extent of their small gains and those who made big gains over £10,000 and £20,000 for example, would be relieved to the extent of the flat amount even if total gains were £100,000, £500,000 or more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that it would be exempted with £500,000 but it would be exempted in respect of the element which was below the flat exemption so the person might have a tremendous gain but nonetheless receive the relief on part of the very substantial gain.  To deal with this there must be a limit introduced to restrict the reliefs where the total gains exceed a certain amount. This would bring us back to something very like what is now being criticised.  The case of a man buying a house for £45,000 and selling it for £55,000 was quoted by Deputy Colley. It seems to me he is dealing with the case of a short-term gain, as speculative gain.  Suppose we take another example, a property purchased for £200,000 and sold quickly for £250,000.  Why should any portion of the proceeds be relieved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be, of course, if the Minister had accepted our original amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that. <Col N="197" /> Even in the carefully selected example of Deputy Colley there is a small amount of marginal relief.  The people for whom sections 26 and 27 were intended will look at the total money they have received and they will want to know if on a sale for a certain amount the proceeds will be tax-free. They will want to know if they can keep all the money or surrender some of it to the Revenue Commissioners. They will be concerned to know what to do with the proceeds of sale, either to buy an annuity or make some other financial arrangements.  Those who are in the wealthier brackets will have ample resources to make suitable financial arrangements with sums like £200,000 and more, after paying their capital gains tax.  Again it cannot be too strongly emphasised that for the people who sell a farm or family business after a long time in it their real concern is the amount they get on the sale.  Such people should be relieved within the limits we set out in the White Paper and which are now embodied in the Bill no matter how much the gain is.  The cases of &ldquo;quick in and out&rdquo; even where there is a smaller gain are not ones which were intended for the relief.  The reliefs under these sections do not stand alone.  There are those relating to wasting assets in section 18, the £500 exemption in section 16 and the private dwelling exemption in section 25. In all a very large package of redemptions and reliefs is being provided which is very generous by comparison with international standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the relief under section 17, that is chattels up to a value of £2,000, the rationale behind this relief should be clear.  It avoids unnecessary work of administration for both the private and public sector in tracing transactions and seeking details from individuals and from taxprayer and in making unproductive computations.  It applies to each transaction involving chattels and there is no question of aggregation.  If the test of exemption were to be the gain, every small transaction would have to be examined by the tax administration and accounted for by the taxpayers for comparison with the gain limit for the exemption. This would cause frustration and <Col N="198" /> annoyance among taxpayers and would not be welcomed by them.  Exemption by reference to the amount of consideration is simpler and readily understood.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley has mentioned the British practice.  I understand that the British practice was one which caused an undue amount of administrative trouble.  This is a case where we can learn by other people's mistakes.  The British now have a provision which relates to consideration and the consideration is £1,000, only half of ours. The relief we are giving should be of great benefit to taxpayers in tax terms as well as saving them trouble.  As each chattel is a separate item a person disposing of chattels could be relieved on, say, five transactions for gains of £3,000 to £5,000 or more.  In section 26&mdash;the £50,000 case&mdash;relief will cover all relatively small farms and family businesses.  As indicated on Second Stage, the amount will be reviewed as time goes on and the real value, in terms of gains, of the £50,000 exemption will therefore be maintained.  To give a flat rate of relief in terms of gains would benefit people in relatively good circumstances and would not be equitable.  Freedom from tax on a transaction of £50,000 would mean that most people realising this sum would retain all the proceeds of sale and could purchase a sizeable annuity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the effects of the legislation.  In terms of gains a sale of £50,000 could mean exempting gains of very substantial amounts running into four or five figures depending on the amount paid for the property and how long it was owned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case coming under section 27, the £150,000 case, the relief is very generous by any standards.  At a modest estimate the gain would be £20,000.  For farms and small businesses held for a lifetime it could of course be much more.  The reliefs will cover the large bulk of the farms in Ireland and very many moderately sized businesses.  The relief is designed <Col N="199" /> to preserve this kind of farm and business and to prevent inflicting on them the confiscation that was formerly applied to them under the death duties code.  The relief will in most cases in this country be better than any form of relief restricted to an amount of gain of £10,000, £20,000, £30,000 over a lifetime.  The threshold will be subject to review, so the real value of the benefit will be preserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to get what we are talking about clear and not be at cross purposes I had better say, as I have already said a few times, that what I am concerned with here is the principle involved, not with the threshold of relief which would, if the principle involved in this amendment were accepted, of course require amendment.</P>
      <P>I have also made it clear that the Minister is the only person who has available to him sufficient information to assess what the thresholds should be if this principle were accepted so that it is just a waste of time and effort for us to be pursuing the questions of what would happen if this amendment were accepted and the threshhold were not altered.  It is an unreal situation which is not proposed from this side and certainly would not be accepted from the Minister's side.  Let us get that part of it out of the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that if he were to fix thresholds of relief in the different kind of circumstances envisaged in this Bill based on the gain, in other words, a flat figure of gain in different circumstances, as is done in section 16 where the figure is fixed at £500 per annum gain without reference to consideration at all&mdash;it is done in that case but not in the others&mdash;I want to suggest that that would benefit the less well off man, contrary to what the Minister says.  If we take the example where this principle is accepted in section 16, where £500 per annum gain is exempted, clearly a gain of £500 is far more valuable to a person who is not very well off than to a millionaire to whom it means nothing?  Therefore, fixing a flat rate of gain which is exempted is, in fact, contrary to what the Minister argued, to the benefit of people who <Col N="200" /> are less well off than to the very wealthy.  I would, therefore, dispute a good deal of the Minister's argument which was based, as far as I could understand it, on the argument that flat rates of gain were to the benefit of the well off.  On the contrary, I would argue that they are to the benefit of the less well off.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in and do not understand the Minister's argument in regard to administrative convenience. The Minister did say that to accept the principle of gain rather than consideration, as suggested in this amendment, would create administrative difficulty. I do not understand how he arrives at that conclusion and, in particular, if that argument of the Minister's is correct why does he base the exemption in section 16 on gain rather than consideration?</P>
    <P>If his argument is correct, then section 16 must create a great many administrative problems, but I do not think that that is so.  I would like the Minister to elaborate a little further as to why administrative difficulties of this kind are envisaged because, as I have said, on the Bill as it stands it is necessary to determine the cost of acquisition of an asset and the cost of disposal in order to assess liability for tax, in order to know the consideration; but once one has that information then one has the gain.  So, where does the additional administrative work come in and, as I have said, if it does create additional administrative work why has he in section 16 adopted the approach that we are urging in the amendment?  The two do not seem to hang together.  The argument the Minister makes seems to fall down in the light of section 16 or, alternatively, he should change section 16.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal, adequtely at any rate, with the anomalies that I have indicated.  There are other anomalies which could be indicated. Just to confine them to the example I have given, in that example one finds that a person who makes a gain of £35,000 is totally exempt from capital gains tax but a person who makes a gain of £10,000 is liable.  Surely that is not, on the face of it, an acceptable <Col N="201" /> position?  Is it not much more easy to control the extent of exemptions if one operates on the basis of gain and if one says, as is done in section 16, in the case of all taxpayers a gain not exceeding £500 in any one year will be exempt and if one says that in the case of somebody retiring from business, subject to the criteria laid down, a gain of £X is exempt, and in the different categories that are involved? In this way one can control the amount of gain which is exempt and can, as I have indicated, ensure that the person who is not so well off will benefit to a greater extent than the person who is very wealthy.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand exactly what the objection is to this proposal.  The alleged administrative difficulties may be an important element in the Minister's attitude to this amendment because if it could be shown that there are no greater administrative difficulties involved the logic of the amendment is inescapable.  I would therefore like to ask the Minister, as I have said, if he could elaborate a little further on how exactly the administrative difficulties are envisaged having regard to the fact that as the Bill stands it is necessary to obtain the information which is needed to accept this amendment. In other words, there is not as far as I can see additional work involved and also having regard to the terms of section 16, which accepts the principle proposed in this amendment, how does the Minister envisage the administration of section 16 if the acceptance of that principle creates administrative difficulties?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing in section 17 with chattels, with tangible movable property the ownership of which can pass by simple delivery from one person to another.  But in section 16 we are dealing with property other than tangible movable property and chattels.  We are dealing with property which comes under notice in any event, like land and items of that nature, items which can be more easily recorded, traced, located.  Tangible movable property of its very nature is something that can so easily and quickly pass that it is appropriate that such items, up <Col N="202" /> to a reasonable level, should be exempt from capital gains tax.  Otherwise there would be an obligation to prevent the sale of any tangible movable property to ensure that capital gains tax was paid.  The multiplicity of difficulties that would arise from the obviously very large number of transactions which occur in these fields show that it would be unthinkable to operate a tax in that way.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister envisage in the case of a transaction involving movable chattels that no returns would be required except in cases where the consideration exceeded £2,000 and, if so, how is it proposed to administer that?  Does the same thing not apply?  You are relying on the taxpayer, in effect, to make a return when the consideration is over £2,000.  If your limit was on gains, for argument's sake, of £500 against movable chattels, would not you be in the same position, depending on the taxpayer to make a return where the gain was over £500, with spot checks here and there?  Is not the administration the same?</P>

      <P>There is, of course, an obligation on the taxpayer to furnish information.  The same obligation applies to taxpayers in relation to their incomes.  Some may be in receipt of incomes which are not brought to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners as a matter of routine but nevertheless there is an obligation to furnish the information.  The larger the number of people on whom the obligation lies, of course, the more unworkable the tax should be.  We have to have regard to the workability of any system.</P>

      <P>It is in keeping with that thinking which is in the interests of the taxpayer as well as public administration&mdash;which the taxpayer has to pay in any case&mdash;that these reliefs are being provided. One would think we were imposing tax in this section. We are not.  We are providing relief and doing so in the most sensible way possible, which is by looking only at the consideration and not requiring, in <Col N="203" /> relation to any transaction in respect of a movable chattel, that accounts be furnished by the vendor in regard to the cost and sale prices.  If we want to have a workable system we must keep the number of returns down to the minimum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so and if what is envisaged is that no returns would be required in the case of transactions involving moveable chattels where the consideration was under £2,000, would not the same thing apply if what were substituted for the £2,000 consideration were, say, £500 gains&mdash;in other words no returns would be required where the gain was under £500, if that were the figure?

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordinary taxpayer's return form will have a section to be completed by the taxpayer giving details of the property transferred and if the detail given indicates that a chattel has been disposed of for a consideration not in excess of £2,000 such an item would be exempt and no further exploration would be needed.  But if the Deputy's suggestion were to be applied one would have to look at every transaction in order to measure whether the gain was above or below whatever threshold might be fixed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But in order to assess it, surely one would want to know about all transactions.  That is not, obviously, what is envisaged; it would not be workable.  It is not clear to me why the Minister thinks there would be a great deal more administrative work in applying the concept of gains in regard to this section on moveable chattels and subsequent sections as it is applied in section 16.  In effect does not the same problem arise for the Revenue Commissioners in regard to section 16 as would arise if this amendment and the principle of it were accepted?  How does the Minister distinguish between the work that would be involved in administering section 16 and in administering section 17 and the subsequent sections which also give reliefs?</P>

      <P>Section 16 applies to all property; section 17 removes from further consideration all tangible moveable assets.  That relieves the burden of work on both taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners which arises under section 16.  There is still a burden of work in section 16 but it will not arise where the transactions are small.  If we did not have section 17 they would have to look at every transfer of a chattel to see if it created a tax liability.  In section 16 we are dealing with all assets; section 17 removes a certain number of them from further consideration.  In relation to the others, these would include many assets which would come under the notice of the State in any event through the Stamp Office, the furnishing of IVB particulars and so on and will be on record.  Section 17 relieves the burden of work on section 16.</P>

      <P>This is the point.  One <Col N="206" /> does not want to multiply the number of instances where this has to be calculated, so you provide a floor below which you will not look.  Otherwise, you could easily get into a position where your pursuit of the gain might cost more than the tax you would collect by taxing the gain when ultimately ascertained.  It is important to remember also that we are concerned not merely with gains in all these transactions but also with losses.  If we are writing off one we are writing off the others, and we are avoiding an immense amount of administrative problems which could arise and which would be excessively costly in relation to any return.</P>

      <P>May I come in here on the Minister's last remark?  I want the Minister to accept that what I am saying is in the spirit of an inquiry and an anxiety to be helpful because I realise that, in whatever form the Bill is passed, the Revenue Commissioners will have the problem of administration and it will not be easy in any sense.</P>
      <P>My first question with regard to the taxpayer assessing himself was not meant to be exaggerated.  Neither was it meant to be a debating point nor an argument against what is being done. In the same spirit I should like to deal with the question of losses.  It seems to me that possibly the Minister has now touched on the strongest argument he has.  If you assess on a gain is it not possible equally to establish a loss as a negative gain and proceed on that basis?  What is the objection to that? That is the first question.  While I take the Minister's point about complicating procedures if the sale is not clear-cut, as it would be in this case, I would go a long way with the Minister, but it is a tangible movable property.  In other words it is a movable chattel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's explanatory memorandum he gives an indication of his intention when he refers to paintings, jewellery, silverware, and so on.  Surely the gain is as equally ascertainable as the value of the consideration for the disposal.  The £2,000 is gone now.  The consideration for the disposal will be known.  I think we could concede that the only trouble is the base line.  I am <Col N="207" /> not very clear on that&mdash;the base from which it is starting.</P>
    <P>Unlike some of his colleagues the Minister has been courteous enough to try to explain this to us and he has gone to considerable trouble to explain it.  I should like to reciprocate.  The second question is : is there a complication in regard to the base?  The consideration is clear; the chattel is clear; the sale price is clear.  It should be a simple sum to change the gain.  Has the Minister any basic points which support his own argument?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nowadays you can get an enormous price for an antique which might have been thrown out 20 or 30 years ago as a piece of useless family furniture.  We all know the wooden and cast iron mangles which used to stand in the backyard of many a Dublin house.  Take the cost of the acquisition of that at one stage and its disposal later on.  In many cases it might have been passed down from one family to another.  Yet, such works of art, as they are called nowadays, are fetching tremendous prices.  You would obviously have difficulty in trying to determine what was the cost of acquisition of such an article.</P>
      <P>There are many other cases such as cups and saucers, china and so on. Many items of household usage or personal usage are acquired by people through ordinary passing on from one generation to another.  It is very difficult to determine the value at the time of acquisition of assets of that kind.  Unless we have this exemption section putting a limit on the value of the property, we could run into a great number of difficulties with people claiming they had suffered a capital loss because some of the Sunday china had been broken and this should be set off against other assets which had to be bought to replace them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A multitude of daily regular transactions are carried on by people which obviously it is unthinkable should come within the consideration of the Revenue Commissioners.  It would be unthinkable also to impose upon the individuals engaged in these transactions the obligation of making a <Col N="208" /> return to the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners could not operate a system which required them to keep detailed accounts of the intake and output of people in relation to their accumulation of chattels.  That is what we are really avoiding in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I suggest that the problem of losses is not insuperable? If, for argument sake, the exemption limit in regard to gains on movable chattels or movable property were £500, would it not be possible to provide that losses in the case of movable chattels of less than £500 would not be allowed?  That is one way of approaching it.</P>
      <P>As the Chair has pointed out, with this amendment we are discussing cognate amendments which I put down to sections 26 and 27 dealing respectively with the disposal of a business or farm on retirement and the disposal within the family of a business or farm.  Since we are discussing those amendments in conjunction with this amendment I want to put it to the Minister that the arguments he has made about movable chattels do not apply in the case of the amendments proposed to sections 26 and 27.  The nature of the property involved in those cases is similar to that in section 15 where he accepts the principle of the amendment and feels it can be administered without undue difficulty. If we leave aside section 17 for the moment and the movable property, could I ask the Minister what is his argument against applying the principle involved in the amendment to sections 26 and 27?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I dealt with that in my earlier statement.  I made it clear that we were anxious to avoid imposing on ordinary citizens anxiety in relation to liability to tax, anxiety which would be multiplied by uncertainty. If a person at the time of disposing of an asset knows its consideration, as a person will because it is easily recognisable, the person immediately knows whether or not liability to tax arises.  If there is a question of calculation of gain there may be uncertainty as to the value of the property <Col N="209" /> at the date on which the gain began to accrue.</P>

      <P>There are several elements which have to be taken into account in calculating loss and gain. There could be losses incurred, there could be expenses involved in maintaining and improving the assets and so forth.  Where you are dealing with matters of this kind taxation is much better related to a consideration which allows finality to be quickly reached. If property is being disposed of, and after all we are dealing here with very substantial disposals, it is highly desirable that finality be reached as quickly as possible.  One of the great difficulties in relation to death duties has been the long delays in making assessments, although they were only concerned with consideration or value at the moment of death.  If you were now, in addition to determining value at the moment of disposal, determining value at the time of acquisition and the losses or gains made in between, you would simply be multiplying the administrative difficulties for both the individuals concerned and the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not believe it would be warranted by any additional revenue which might arise by applying the nicety of gain at the base rather than consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister and his advisers have the benefit of investigation into what is being done elsewhere in this type of taxation.  I take it that he is having regard to elements of that nature in this, and could he give us any information on that?  I may be taking a longer view on this, and it is not that I am in any way in disagreement with my colleagues.  I am a member of the Opposition and I have my duty in that regard, but I am anxious, and I am sure my colleagues are too, to probe this from the point of view of the effect of everything we are doing here <Col N="210" /> on the organisation that will have to make these Bills effective.  What I notice and what Deputy Colley has obviously fixed on in this is that when you take the spirit of section 16, and the rest of the Bill, there seems to be a change of philosophy, if you like to call it that, and we naturally make the case &ldquo;Why not be consistent in the approach?&rdquo; and particularly as between section 16 and section 17.</P>
      <P>I would like to put the question this way: Supposing there is a chattel&mdash;the Minister mentioned an antique&mdash;quite obviously on the gain on the thing, the actual sales price, the price of disposal can be invoked as an argument for either the amendment or for the Minister.  In other words, it is a certain figure which can be equally interpreted as a value threshold if one wants to do it as the Minister is doing it but, as Deputy Colley said, as one element anyway it is a certain figure on which gain can be calculated, so that it really does not matter, if I have something in my attic and it is worth nothing today, and in five years' time because of a flash of fashion, it is worth a lot, because the actual consideration price is a determined thing and would have to be got for gain purposes anyway. Even as the Minister has the section, if the consideration is over £2,000, it has to be caught anyway, so on that basis I come down in favour of Deputy Colley's amendment on the basis of logicality and consistency with section 16 and find no advantage or disadvantage on the calculation up to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what you calculate as the gain in a case like this, surely it is in relation to a value at a date. The argument so far when you come to that specific point may be in the Minister's favour and he may say &ldquo;If there is any question about this, how are we going to get the base value?&rdquo;&mdash;what I call a base value.  It is much simpler to have the consideration in and how are you going to get the base value?  As far as assets up to £2,000 are concerned, the argument is all in the Minister's favour, but where gains are payable, are we not bang up against the same <Col N="211" /> problem, because in relation to the type of article I am talking about&mdash; I see the difficulty in this; there is no difficulty about disposal price&mdash;the difficulty arises about the price or the value at the base date?  If we are only dealing with chattels up to £2,000 in value and giving an exemption, fine&mdash; I think I would have to put my hands up and capitulate to the Minister's point of view straight away, but supposing there is a chattel&mdash;and these are mentioned in the explanatory memorandum&mdash;worth £5,000, then you have a capital gain and you must relate to a base, and so where are you?</P>
    <P>I may be, to the experts and to the Minister, displaying an ignorance for which I apologise if I am, but it is difficult enough to appreciate some of this legislation.  The point is this, that if you have a chattel of £5,000 disposal value, how do you assess the gain on that?  It is not a tax on the value of disposal; it is a tax on the gain.  So if I have this article in my attic, once you go over the threshold limit, you have that problem which completely nullifies my capitulation to the Minister when the value is up to £2,000, and I am back to square one where I say with Deputy Colley that it is just as simple and as straightforward to calculate on the basis of gain instead of value, and the argument of consistency is there, as I say.</P>
    <P>I have not quite followed this question of how the loss is more complicated, and perhaps I will leave the argument on that leg for the moment.  I do not know if the Minister feels that I have completely misunderstood the situation but if I have I would be glad if he would refute me as definitely as he can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle the Deputy is right when he says that problems arise.  In practice they would arise much less often in dealing with chattels above £2,000 in value than in chattels which are below that value for the reason that there are fewer over £2,000 in value than there are below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as simple as that. On the element of gain as against consideration one would have to pursue every transaction if one were relating exemption to gain to ascertain whether or not the gain involved in that transatcion was above or below exempted level.  This would call for an appalling amount of surveillance which would be certain to cause irritation to the taxpayer. It would result in most appalling costs on the public side which the taxpayer would have to pay if we had to have a vast administrative machine to examine the multiplicity of transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow the Minister in the spirit in which he answered me which I appreciate. I take the Minister's point, but will the surveillance to see that the threshold involves £2,000 not involve the same surveillance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the fallacy in the Minister's argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it will require the same surveillance to see that somebody does not dispose of something for £5,000 and blandly return it at £2,000.  The Minister can put the point to me that the buck will stop there and that it will be enough to determine the price; it will not be necessary to go back and determine the value at base.  When all is said and done is that argument serious?  Supposing I have a piece of jewellery and I dispose of it for £5,000.  I get a receipt for that&mdash;obviously receipts will be important because one never knows when the Revenue Commissioners will trace that sale and put the onus on me&mdash;but if that transaction is to be supervised to the extent that will be necessary to ensure that I have not manoeuvred to produce a receipt showing £2,000 instead of £5,000 the Revenue Commissioners will have to go further than accepting the receipt.  If the Minister goes behind that there is the question of identity.  It will be as simple to calculate a gain as it will be to go on the market value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether the gain or the market value exempts an article there will be a large number of transactions on which the Revenue Commissioners will have <Col N="213" /> to take a chance.  There will be a certain number of cases in which people will get away, as always.  One of the greatest difficulties about modern taxation in all countries is that the tax collecting agencies are being driven more and more to hit or miss procedures and when the Revenue Commissioners hit they hit hard.  It is like the old days when we did not have enough police the courts had to act on a somewhat similar principle. Obviously, the Revenue Commissioners cannot investigate every case and there will be a certain amount of evasion. The question is, how best can we facilitate them in their job if we are giving thresholds?</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that there is any advantage in the Minister's point of view from that expressed in Deputy Colley's amendment and this brings me back to the consistency argument.  In effect, there will be as close a supervision as possible.  The Revenue Commissioners will try to make certain regulations that honest people will observe.  That happens in regard to certain customs matters already and reputable people are careful not to give bogus receipts.  This will have to be the base here also.  There will be a reliance on the basic honesty of the majority and getting their co-operation.  I am glad to say that by and large this can be expected but there must be the other element to deal with those who are not honest.  When we come to the case that is being pursued it is as simple to deal with it on the basis of gain as it is to deal with it on the basis of market price.  If somebody is caught he is caught on his own assessment and it is only fair that people who are dishonest should be caught for interest.  In cases where there has been a genuine mistake they must be left to the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners who have not, in genuine cases, been unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear more on the question of losses.  I cannot see why the Minister wants to stick on market value.  The interpretation of the Bill and the distinction between different values I do not like.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I support Deputy Colley's <Col N="214" /> amendment because I believe that, if at all possible, we must aim for simplicity in these Bills.  Any of us in the business world knows only too well how complicated is our income tax code today.  It is obvious that, when these Bills come into operation, very few lay people will be able to understand or, indeed, submit forms to comply with the requirements of the Revenue Commissioners.  We should make every effort to simplify the code before this Bill is passed.  It is obvious that the Revenue Commissioners themselves will have many problems on their hands.</P>
      <P>When we consider this section alone, any man selling property&mdash;here it is movable chattels&mdash;is concerned about the profit he has made on it; what he paid for it, what he spent during the time he held it and what is his profit on its sale.  As the Minister says, it is quite obvious we will have to ascertain what is this value; it will have to be ascertained how much was paid on its purchase and what its maintenance cost.  Let us take the example of some antiques, jewellery or furniture, as the case may be.  A person may buy such a piece of jewellery or furniture for a certain figure and sell it perhaps five years later for another, perhaps three times what he had paid originally.  In the intervening period he may have paid very expensive insurance on it which, in my opinion, should be an allowable expense.  He may have had to carry out expensive repairs, be it jewellery or property, if it is of a very valuable nature.  All of those things will have to be deducted from the profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about deducting such expenses from the &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; it can be very confusing.  The proper way to look at that is that that item was bought for a certain figure, sold for a certain figure and expenses are deductible from the profit derived.  It is on that basis we should impose this tax and not complicate it by reference to a &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; here.  The same procedure is followed when one forwards any set of accounts to an income tax accountant or the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;one gives one's turnover, gross profit and expenses and, when <Col N="215" /> everything is broken down, there is left a nett profit.  That is what we talk about in income tax.  We should apply the same principle here and we would know where we were going.  But the introduction of the word &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; confuses the issue.  We will have to deduct from such &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; any expenses that accrued.  All of those things, after proper deduction, would leave us with a gain and it is that about which we should be concerned in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister should re-examine this aspect in an endeavour to simplify it for the average person.  If the Minister wants these Bills to be successful, as time progresses, if he wants co-operation from people generally, they must know exactly what is happening. It is all right for a tax consultant to tell one: This is what you owe and this is how it works.  There are a lot of people in this country who cannot employ tax consultants.  If the Minister can in any way simplify this procedure I am convinced he would be doing a good day's work; many people would be very thankful to him and undoubtedly he would receive more co-operation, so that the Bill would operate more efficiently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time I intervened I omitted to make an important part of the argument I was advancing&mdash;when it would come to the checking; when the Revenue Commissioners, or their agents, would intervene, the determination of the base vale would be an almost automatic outcome of their investigation and, therefore, important.  It nullifies part of the Minister's argument and reinforces the fact that I said that if one is above the £2,000 figure that had to be got at anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the point Deputy Fitzpatrick was making, let us take an analogy with another thing about which the Minister is very much concerned&mdash;or which his predecessors introduced. We have had certain taxation experimentation here already; we went from wholesale tax to turnover tax to value-added tax.  In the end the important thing with regard to VAT <Col N="216" /> was, and is, uniformity of procedure, simplicity and uniformity, and certain clear-cut rules.  PAYE is another area where the same kind of principle matters.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, in effect, made the point&mdash;why not try and achieve simplicity by adhering to the one principle?  This is important.  It is confusing if there are different principles applied whereas, no matter how cumbersome the actual arithmetic can be sometimes, if it is one procedure applied straight down the line it is preferable to having a lot of arithmetically simple procedures leaving doubt as to which of them is applicable.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am referring to our experience in the areas I have mentioned. There is a little of this to be considered with regard to this section. It merely reinforces the point we are making for consistency with section 16.</P>

    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the <Col N="217" /> importance of easing the anxiety of taxpayers, that they should know precisely where they stand.

      <P>The purpose of the capital gains tax is to collect tax on a capital gain in respect of fairly substantial transfers of property.  It is not intended to relieve all items which would come under the description of a tangible, movable asset.  If it were, we would not be introducing this Bill. I make no apology for catching the larger fish; it is intended to catch the larger fish.  But we do not want to have to measure the length of every pinkeen simply because we are going to levy a tax on the sharks.</P>
      <P>Sections 16, 17 and others, taken together, avoid the obligation of having to assess the gain on all smaller transactions.  I want to emphasise that one must also, when considering the calculation of gains in this area, consider the problem of calculation of costs and the setting off of one against the other.  There is an exemption in respect of the capital gain in section 16 on items which come under notice without much difficulty.  In section 17 we are exempting those of a certain category, below a certain level, which do not normally come under notice, and which it would be very costly and very irritating to police in order to get perfection in operation.  It is normal practice in tax law to have a blend of perfect principle and pragmatic operation.  The principle may have to be qualified in the interests of what is practical of achievement, and these two sections taken together operate in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said he assumed that insurance and repair costs would be allowable as losses.  I should like to disabuse him of any notion of that kind.  They would not be allowable, for they would not be capital investment. But any expenditure which <Col N="218" /> would improve an asset, which would enhance its value, which would be adding to its capital nature or substance, could be taken into account. Ordinary maintenance, insurance and so on are not capital items and would not be available to set off for capital purposes.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> If I bought an article for £4,000 four years ago I had to get it insured.  If I did nothing with that article but held it for four years it would appreciate.  Five years later it makes £6,000 by virtue of the fact that I have held my property and spent money protecting it by insurance. I should be allowed for it.</P>

      <P>Whether you insured the property or not would not be reflected in the price which a stranger would pay you for the asset when you would be disposing of it, and that is the only basis on which you can calculate the gain.  The only way you can calculate the consideration is to look at the price received for the asset.  The fact that these problems are thrown up helps to strengthen our argument for looking at the consideration simply and cleanly.  Deputy de Valera said he assumed we had examined the experience in other administrations. Indeed we have, but it is interesting that the British were forced into a consideration exemption <Col N="219" /> because of the tremendous cost and difficulty of operating a gains exemption. I think we would be wise to be guided by their experience, and if we were not to be so guided, we have again and again gone into the kind of problems that Deputy Fitzpatrick, in good faith, has offered as issues which he thought should be taken into account as loss items or cost items. The fact is that they could not be, and in no administrations that I know of are they taken into consideration for the purpose of calculating the capital value of an asset.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we can pursue that.  However, I do not want to suggest to the Minister that we are now discussing amendments to sections 17, 26 and 27.  The Minister accepts that the principle we are advocating is, in fact, proposed to be operated by him in section 16, but he says in order to operate it in these other sections it could produce the situation in which there had to be, in effect, an army employed by the Revenue Commissioners to police it and would create grave difficulties for the taxpayer.  I <Col N="220" /> think that is the substance of his argument.</P>
      <P>I want to put it to the Minister that that argument cannot be true in relation to sections 26 and 27, because what is involved there is property in respect of which details have to be furnished anyway, as he pointed out in regard to section 16&mdash;the submission of documents for stamping and so on.  Such details have to be furnished in relation to the property envisaged in sections 26 and 27. Therefore, the Minister's arguments have relevance only in relation to section 17.  This is the kernel of the whole thing that I tried to get at at the beginning, and I am afraid that, despite the length of time we have spent on it, we have not got to the kernel.</P>
      <P>What the Minister is saying in relation to section 17 and in relation to movable property, as I understand it, is this: by operating on the basis of a consideration of £2,000, the Revenue Commissioners merely have to look at the consideration and if it is under £2,000 they do not have to look any further.  If it is over £2,000, then they have to go into the details of the transaction; and because, as the Minister said, most items are worth less than £2,000, a great many transactions would be excluded.</P>
      <P>If that were so, there would be no answer to the Minister's argument, but I think he is mistaken in what he says.  In fact the way it will work is this: when transactions are referred to and returned by a taxpayer as showing a consideration less than £2,000 in respect of movable property, in the normal way the Revenue Commissioners will say: &ldquo;We do not have to concern ourselves with that.&rdquo; That is true, but in order to avoid wide-scale abuse, they must at least do some spot checks on these transactions and, in cases like that, look for more than, as Deputy de Valera said, merely a receipt; otherwise the whole thing would be wide open to abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to suggest is that precisely the same thing would be done by the Revenue Commissioners if what they had to concern themselves with was that a gain not exceeding, <Col N="221" /> say, £500 on movable property would not be liable to tax.  Where they got a return from a taxpayer showing such a transaction with a gain of less than £500, they would, in the vast majority of cases, ignore it, but they would have to do a spot check on some of these in order to ensure it was not being abused.  This is the kernel of the thing as far as I am concerned in relation to section 17.  If the Minister can explain why there is a difference in procedure in those two cases I will be much happier with the situation as the Minister has argued it.  The Minister has said more than once that if one went on the base consideration the Revenue Commissioners would have to go into every transaction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I say &ldquo;consideration&rdquo;? I meant &ldquo;gain&rdquo;.  On that basis, I do not think that what the Minister has said is correct.  I should like to know why the Minister thinks that the procedure to be followed by the commissioners will be different in the case of where, on the one hand, they have to consider whether the consideration is above or below £2,000, and the procedure to be followed if the gain is above or below £500.  What is the precise difference in the procedure involved for the Revenue Commissioners?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very practical difference, and I think that is a sufficient answer.  You have far fewer cases if you have &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; clearly stated than if you take this threshold of gain of £500.  There are two factors to be looked at in all such cases, the cost of disposal and the cost of acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in cases above £500.  Supposing a taxpayer shows a return of gain of £450, is it not true the commissioners in most cases will <Col N="222" /> not concern themselves with details of the transaction?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about moveable property from the point of view of section 17.  If you are relying on consideration, the Revenue Commissioners are in the position that the taxpayer says the consideration is below £2,000.  The same doubt can arise in the minds of the commissioners in relation to that as if it were in relation to gain.  To put it in the vernacular, it is just as easy to fiddle it.  They will have to do certain spot checks, but in so far as they will rely on what the taxpayer says, what is the difference between &ldquo;gain&rdquo; and &ldquo;consideration&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>A gain cannot be spoken of in isolation.  You could have an article sold for £5 and the taxpayer claiming there was a loss in relation to that transaction.  In relation to nearly every transaction you would have to look at it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The only element of uncertainty is the face value.  The face value must be looked into.  The point I am making is that the assessment is a gain and the exemption is a market price level, but when the commissioners intervene the only thing they can be concerned with is gain. They can ask a simple question to satisfy themselves whether the transaction is at the market level, the Minister's level, of £2,000.  I would go so far with the Minister as to say that if the commissioners are satisfied that if the market price did not exceed £2,000, that is the end of it, but if they are not satisfied then they will not assess on a market price.  What they will have to assess is the gain&mdash; they will have to determine the basic point.  They will have to assess the gain and then attach interest.  This is the whole point I have been trying to adumbrate.  When it comes to brass tacks I cannot see that there will be any greater simplicity for the commissioners in any case they go at because in satisfying themselves that the market price was down they would automatically find it necessary to get <Col N="224" /> additional information unless they were blindly to accept receipts.  Otherwise it will be on a spot check basis, with the commissioners using their experience, their intelligence and everything else.  I do not want to be harrassing the Minister on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to create that kind of a problem, but in regard to the section 17 type of case, movable property, for the reasons I have outlined there is practically no real difference for the commissioners whether they work on consideration or gain.  However, in relation to sections 26 and 27, where the details are known or, as the Minister said, will be furnished to the commissioners anyway quite irrespective of this Bill. surely the principle he has accepted in section 16 is applicable in those cases where the details will be known to the Revenue Commissioners?  The argument in favour of going on the basis of consideration seems to be quite compelling.  There is no argument of administrative convenience involved.  The argument the Minister put forward was certainly for the taxpayer but if that is valid&mdash;it has a certain validity in theory although not in practice&mdash;why not apply it in section 16?  Why not operate section 16 on the basis of a certain level of consideration?</P>
      <P>I assume the section is drafted on the basis that it is meant to exclude small transactions because it would be impossible for the Revenue Commissioners if they were involved in all such transactions.  That principle is acceptable all round but why do it on the basis of gain rather than of consideration in section 16?  If there is validity in the argument of the Minister in relation to sections 26 and 27, section 16 should relate not to a gain of £500 per annum but to a particular level of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to sections 26 and 27 and having regard to the availability of information to the Revenue Commissioners, I would ask the Minister why not operate on the basis of gain where the control that can be exercised with regard to exemption is much more precise?  As I have indicated, in these <Col N="225" /> cases people will be liable in some circumstances to a capital gains tax on a gain of £10,000 and will be exempt on a gain of £35,000.  Surely that kind of anomaly should make the Minister think again whether it is justifiable in the case of sections 26 and 27 to work on the basis of consideration rather than gain.  By operating on the basis of gain in those sections he can eliminate all these anomalies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16 is not exempting small transactions as such. It is granting relief to people who make a small profit from a small number of transactions.  The exemption is not related to any specific transaction but it exempts all gains below £500 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice the Minister will agree that it has the effect of excluding from consideration by the Revenue Commissioners many small transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Section 17 relates only to chattels, to movable property.  It does not relate to stocks and shares and items which could be exempt under section 16 so long as the total profits do not exceed £500 a year.  Sections 26 and 27 have the effect of providing relief to particular categories of people whom we believe should be helped.  For instance, a person getting out of a business or a farm will not have to pay on a threshold of £50,000 under section 26 and £150,000 under section 27.  If the gain were looked at rather than the consideration then much more work would be involved but by clearly stating figures of £50,000 and £150,000 the matter is clear and beyond dispute and no further work is involved for the citizen or for the administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is provided the figures are accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In a straightforward case the price is agreed between both parties and that is the end of it.  If we had a situation where we had to look to the gain, it would <Col N="226" /> be necessary to investigate all transactions to ascertain whether a gain had been made and, if so, how much it was.  According to an argument advanced by the Opposition, it could also operate in a way where it might be inappropriate to tax people where they had property for a long time and where, as a consequence, a considerable gain was involved.  The exemptions we have given take account of the fact that people may have property that has been increased in value which they are passing to their family or which they are giving up on reaching retirement age.  In sections 26 and 27 the circumstances are clearly identifiable. What matters is the value, rather than whether a gain has been made by the person.  There is concern to give relief for family property situations and the relief given will relate to the circumstances.  It is inappropriate to look into the gain in a case where a person is disposing of a farm or a business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably under section 27 the Revenue Commissioners will have to get involved in valuations in order to ascertain the consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They may or may not, but valuing an asset with regard to its market value on a given date and a current date is much easier than endeavouring to get a valuation of property on an historic basis.  Generally I am satisfied the sections do what they are intended to do, namely, give relief in the best possible way to people who might otherwise be called to pay capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the question of giving relief in these cases is affected in any way by these amendments because the relief can be given in relation to the gain.  In effect, that is ultimately what the Minister is trying to do.  However, for what he thinks is administrative convenience he is giving particular reliefs on a basis which relates to the consideration, whereas he is giving relief in section 16 on a basis related to the gain.  Does the Minister think there is any validity in any of the points put forward from this side of <Col N="227" /> the House that would be worth further examination?</P>

      <P>In regard to sub-section (2) (a) the paragraph appears to be setting an amount of tax against an amount of consideration:</P>
      <P>The amount of capital gains tax chargeable in respect of a gain accruing on a disposal falling within subsection (1) for a consideration the amount or value of which exceeds £2,000 shall not exceed half the difference between the amount of that consideration and £2,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a subsection which gives marginal relief where the consideration exceeds £2,000.  By providing that the amount of capital gains tax is not to exceed one-half of the difference between the amount of the consideration and £2,000, the tax with which the amount so calculated is to be compared is the tax which would not have been payable but for the particular gain; that is the difference in the amount between the capital gains tax which would be chargeable on all gains for the year, including that gain, and on all gains for the year, excluding that gain.</P>

There is therefore a charge on £500 at 26 per cent of £130.  The tax is to be limited to half the difference between £2,200 and £2,100 and that would be £100, which is what the tax would be.</P>

      <P>We will see how this works out.  A gain on chattel, £400, other gains, £200, gains on other items in that year, £600.  We will deduct £500 under section 16, which would leave a tax liability on £100 gain. That, taxable at 26 per cent, would create a tax liability of £26.  If the top gain of £400, that is the gain on the chattel, were not included, there would be no tax liability because there would only be £200.  Therefore, £26 is the tax attributable to the transaction. The £26 is attributable to the £400 chattel transaction under section 17.  It is a concession to the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) reads:</P>
      <P>Subsections (1) and (2) shall not affect the amount of an allowable loss accruing on the disposal of an asset,</P>
      <P>but it seems to me that the rest of sub-section (3) goes on to make it quite clear that they do affect an allowable loss because it says:</P>
      <P>but for the purposes of computing under this Act the amount of a loss accruing on the disposal by an individual of tangible movable property the consideration for the disposal shall, if less than £2,000, be deemed to be £2,000 and the losses which are allowable losses shall be restricted accordingly.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I am misreading this but if subsections (1) and (2) do not affect the allowable loss certainly the rest of the subsection does.  Suppose subsections (1) and (2) were to affect the amount of an allowable loss what would be the effect of that?  In other words, what is achieved by saying: &ldquo;subsections (1) and (2) shall not affect the amount of an allowable loss&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of sub-section (3) is to make a corresponding restriction in respect of loss relief as we have in subsection (2) by deeming the consideration on the disposal to be £2,000 if it is in fact less than that amount.  Thus if an individual bought a chattel for £2,500 and sold it for £1,800 he would be allowed a loss of £500 and not £700.  It is an obvious, indisputable principle that you cannot set off losses on articles or transactions if gains on those transactions or articles are not themselves liable to tax.  In subsection (1) the gain in the case of a sale below £2,000 is not to be a chargeable gain.  If this were not qualified there would be no allowable loss in the case of a sale below £2,000 on the principle in section 12 (2) that where a disposal does not involve a chargeable gain it could not involve an allowable loss.  The opening words of the subsection, therefore, safeguard the right of a taxpayer to a loss, when the sale realises only £2,000 or less, and the rest of the subsection (3) restricts the loss in the way I have indicated.</P>

      <P>In other words, where one sells at a loss and the actual selling consideration happens to be under £2,000 the Minister wants to ensure that the principle of section 16 should apply.  Is that right?  I am talking of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we are dealing here more with the provision in section 12 which is the principle that one cannot set off a loss in a circumstance where such gain is not itself taxable. We are providing here that if the price realised is below £2,000 one will deduct from the calculated loss that portion which is below the £2,000.  The case I illustrated was of the sale of an article which realised only £1,800 or £200 below the asset which originally cost £2,500.  There is a market loss of £700 but for tax purposes the loss is deemed to be only £500.</P>

      <P>On subsection (4) line 42 reads:</P>
      <P>whether on the same or on different occasions,</P>
      <P>Is it envisaged that there will be any time limit as between the two occasions or could it be that one transaction might take place now and another transaction in, say, another 20 or 30 years and that they would then be different occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Each case would have to be considered on its own merits.  It is very difficult to say with certainty what would be the appropriate time span which would not be taken into account by the Revenue Commissioners as part and parcel of the one transaction.  For example, there might be the disposal of a stamp collection piecemeal.  It could be a genuine disposal over a number of years and quite a number of people would be acquiring and disposing of such an article.  The problem there would be to determine whether or not there is a sensible disposal of a significant amount which creates a tax liability or whether each transaction is so separate from the others as to constitute separate transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clearly beyond the capacity of the legislature to spell out the precise <Col N="236" /> circumstances in which separate transactions, on the face of it, might constitute one transaction, and it will have to be left to the ordinary practices of the market place and the common sense of the Revenue Commissioners to work out what the situation really is.  The subsection is necessary to prevent abuse of the section by the disposal of an asset in separate parts to persons who work in association with one another so that the amount of consideration for each part is below £2,000 while the total realised on the set of articles is above the figure.</P>
    <P>The subsection enables different transactions to be treated as a single transaction even where the disposals occur on different occasions.  Any apportionment of relief under sub-section (2) or reduced loss under sub-section (3) is to be made to the different years of disposal by reference to the sale proceeds applicable to each year.</P>
    <P>The subsection is to apply to disposals made between the date of issue of the White Paper and before 6th April, 1974, to counter the possibility that the announcement that a capital gains tax would be introduced with effect from 6th April, 1974, might have induced some persons to sell off collections of valuable articles and other sets of valuables before that date.</P>
    <P>This measure does not however impose liability on transactions concluded before 6th April, 1974.  It merely restricts relief from tax on parts of collections or sets of articles disposed of on or after 6th April, 1974, by bringing into account in applying the £2,000 limit the value of assets disposed of between 28th February, 1974, and 6th April, 1974.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the problem that arises in trying to provide for a series of transactions which are in effect one transaction, but would the Minister agree that the wording &ldquo;on different occasions&rdquo; leaves it open to have no time limit between the transactions in question in certain circumstances&mdash;that that interpretation is possible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

Then he wants to dispose of the second one of the series to B but, instead, he disposes of it without gain or loss to C, who in turn disposes of it to B, by arrangement of course with A.

      <P>If I may read a couple of lines of subsection (4), there is a query that I want to put to the Minister in regard to that portion which reads:</P>
      <P>. . . whether on the same or different occasions the two or more transactions shall be treated as a single transaction disposing of a single asset but with any necessary apportionments of the reduction in tax . . .</P>
      <P>It is that part that I am concerned with at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>with any necessary apportionments of the reduction in tax. . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know if the effect of that is that if, say, two transactions took place but were deemed to have been one transaction, in that case if the <Col N="238" /> consideration did not exceed £4,000 there would be no tax payable and, if it did exceed £4,000, it would get the benefit of the graduated provisions of subsection (2) limiting it to half the difference between the consideration and £4,000, or am I misreading it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Two thousand pounds is the ceiling of exemption under section 17.  The Deputy's question is whether or not if the two transactions constitute one with a value of £4,000 it is to be deemed only to be £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;with any necessary apportionments of the reduction in tax&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be marginal reliefs which are set out in sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This is what I am coming at.  As far as I can see, the marginal reliefs in subsection (2) refer back to subsection (1).  Subsection (1) refers to tangible movable property where the value of the consideration does not exceed £2,000.  Subsection (2) says &ldquo;the amount of capital gains tax chargeable in respect of a gain accruing on a disposal falling within subsection (1) for a consideration that amount or value of which exceeds £2,000. . .&rdquo;.  What kind of transaction is envisaged there?  Presumably, it is the sale of tangible movable property where the consideration exceeds £2,000 that we are talking about in subsection (2).  We then apply the relief involved where two transactions are, in fact, deemed to be one transaction under subsection (4).  Is the effect of that phrase, &ldquo;with any necessary apportionments of reduction in tax&rdquo;, that the marginal relief for a transaction involving the sale of movable property above £2,000 provided for in subsection (2) would be applied to this transaction being deemed to be one transaction? Is that what is intended?</P>

      <P>There could be circumstances in which the apportionment could arise in one year but if it does not arise then the particular sentence is irrelevant to the circumstances but if, on the other hand, the different parts of the transaction occurred in different years then the apportionment would be relevant and these particular words would apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my address to the confederation, I indicated the difficulties facing us which, while serious, do not provide evidence of &ldquo;accelerating economic decline&rdquo;; and I indicated the Government's intention of taking whatever action was necessary to keep the economy on course.  Decisions to this end will be announced as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I may also mention that the working party, arising out of the meetings between members of the Government and economic organisations, will be meeting very soon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree. In fact, the budget was designed to stimulate the economy because of the recession both outside and inside the country.  I should say that the volume of industrial investment shows an increase in each of the past years and I can quote figures to indicate this. There was £135 million worth of work approved by the IDA in 1972-73, £303 <Col N="241" /> million worth in 1973-74, and £510 million worth in 1974.  For the same period the value of exports was up 29 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the increase in the volume of money generated by the IDA was as a result of measures taken before this Government took office when the economy was on a sound basis?  Will he further indicate why he denies that the decline in the economy is accelerating when all the evidence is pointing to that fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate why it was necessary to invite representatives of different organisations such as farmers, employers, trade unions and others to meetings when there was already in existence the National Economic and Social Council on which all these bodies were already represented?  Will he say what expertise the new committees or groups have that the NESC does not have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy appreciates that the NESC is a very large body and large bodies generally take time to come to conclusions. It was felt that because of the continuing rate of inflation it was necessary to take action more quickly. It was for that reason that an invitation was extended to the bodies concerned and the suggestion made that smaller representation from the different interests might result in more speedy action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that there is already within the NESC a number of committees and more specifically an economic committee? If it were a question of the NESC as a whole being too unwieldy, would not the economic committee of the NESC have been adequate for the purpose which the Taoiseach has in mind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are all members of the NESC, why was it necessary to set up a new body?  Was it not just a charade to try to indicate that the Government were doing something at last having been goaded and pilloried into taking some action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, the suggestion of a smaller working group came originally from one of the ICTU representatives as being the most effective way.  The Government are anxious to co-operate in any ideas which these organisations put forward as constructive approaches to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the necessity which the Government saw for setting up this new group and these working committees, is it now admitted that the concept of a national partnership which was put forward by the Government in a White Paper last year has failed or is no longer effective? In view of the statement recently by the Minister for Labour urging restraint in wage claims, does that in any way prejudice adherence to the national wage agreement on the part of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  So far as the national partnership is concerned, this is a follow-up to the suggestion contained in the White Paper when it was published but, in the meantime, as the Deputy knows, discussions had been proceeding on the national wage agreement and it was felt that intervention by the Government would possibly be regarded as interferences with those discussions.  Now that the discussions on wages have ended it was decided to reconvene the meetings between the different organisations.  So far as the statement by the Minister for Labour was concerned, I think he correctly represented the situation.  One of the problems involved in inflation is the high level of the percentage changes involved in the implementation of the national wage agreement.</P>

Various other specialist courses are, of course, already provided for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The needs of the force in regard to specialised courses are primarily a matter for assessment by the Commissioner. I am informed by him that, at present, these needs are being met, as far as specialised full-time university courses are concerned, by sending three members on such courses.  One of these members is studying for a law degree.  The members concerned were selected following the issue of circulars to the force inviting applications for these training opportunities. The matter will be reviewed in the light of experience.</P>
      <P>I think it right, however, to draw attention to the fact that any question of affording special facilities to any particular members to pursue courses of their own choice raises serious questions of equity as between these members and other members whose duty arrangements may be affected as a result, and who, in addition, may later find themselves at a disadvantage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that a number of hoteliers and guest-house owners who obtained hotel licences under an Act passed in 1902 are now threatened with losing their licences due to standards being demanded by Bord Fáilte (details supplied); and if he will take steps to protect the interests of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I think I should explain, for the record, that the detail supplied by the Deputy in relation to this question was a reference to section 20 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That section provides that where, after the passing of the Act, a licence is obtained (i.e. obtained for the first time) in respect of a premises on the basis that it is a hotel within the meaning of the Licensing Acts, the <Col N="262" /> licence may not be renewed (at the annual licensing session) unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court that the premises is registered in the register of hotels kept by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Since I have no function in regard to the standards prescribed by Bord Fáilte, I assume that what the Deputy wishes me to do is to introduce legislation to amend or repeal the section of the 1960 Act to which he has referred. I indicated to-day in reply to a parliamentary question that various proposals for the amendment of the Acts have been made, that I am examining them but that no decision has yet been taken to introduce amending legislation. The most I can say at this stage in relation to section 20 of the 1960 Act is that it was introduced following a recommendation of an Intoxicating Liquor Commission and that it has obviously much to commend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of people got licences under the 1902 Act; that at that time there was no statutory provision as to what was a hotel and that subsequent Acts have changed the situation, meaning that people who have been doing business over a long number of years find now they are no longer entitled to a licence?  In view of this would the Minister reconsider the whole position in relation to this matter?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> With great respect, I think the Deputy is incorrect.  People who got licences, as hotel licences, under the 1902 Act are in no way affected by the register of hotels kept by Bord Fáilte; they continue to hold their licences.  This provision applies only to people who got licences, as hotel licences, after the passage of the 1960 Act.  Those people who got licences under the 1960 Act got them in respect of premises that were hotels and were registered by Bord Fáilte.  It is only if the hotels have been downgraded by Bord Fáilte and removed from the register of hotels that they lose the licence.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am telling the Deputy those five people must have obtained their publican's licence for the first time subsequent to the passing of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960.  If that is not so and when the matter is looked into the Deputy will receive a communication from the Department of Justice and the matter will be put right.  I am convinced what I have said is correct.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In replying on 16th May, 1974, to a similar question, I pointed out that the introduction of legislation by a Minister requires the specific approval of the Government and has to compete for its place in the parliamentary timetable, and that when the Government have approved in principle of new legislation, even an apparently simple Bill frequently gives rise to complex legal difficulties so that any attempt to set specific or even approximate dates for the introduction <Col N="264" /> of a series of Bills during the coming 12 months would be wholly unrealistic.</P>
      <P>I am not, accordingly, prepared to say more than that I hope to introduce several Bills during the coming year on a variety of subjects, which will include one or more Bills on aspects of family law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> During the past year, 12 prisoners incurred <Col N="267" /> dietary restriction with close confinement&mdash;ten for three days, one for two days and one for one day. In six of these instances the punishment was imposed for assaults involving violence to prison officers or to other prisoners.  In another three instances the punishment was imposed for a concerted attempt to wreck a section of the prison.  In the remaining three instances the punishment was imposed for open defiance of the prison staff.</P>
      <P>During the year two prisoners were punished with close confinement without dietary punishment.  In each case the confinement was for three days. One of these was punished for assualt and one for persisting with disorderly conduct.</P>
      <P>The restricted diet is prescribed in regulations under the statutory rules and consists of a total of 12 ounces of bread, eight ounces of potatoes and water per day.</P>
      <P>In order to complete the picture and because some people appear to have erroneous impressions about segregation in Mountjoy Prison, I think I might mention that, while it is often necessary to keep a small number of prisoners segregated in the case of a wing there, the accommodation in the base is comparable to accommodation anywhere else in the prison and the windows are above ground level, with full access to daylight.  The number in the base varies from time to time but it is usually between 12 and 15.  At the present time five prisoners are in the base because they have good reasons for wanting to be segregated from the rest of the prisoners.  A further nine are segregated there in the interests of safe custody and good order.  Ordinarily the prisoners segregated there work and associate to the same extent as they would if they were elsewhere in the prison.  There are, however, two prisoners who are particularly difficult to control and it is regrettably necessary to have them confined to their cells save when they are on outdoor exercise.</P>

      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question by the Deputy on 16th May, 1974, I indicated that it would be necessary to make a minor amendment of the Moneylenders Act, 1933&mdash;relating to a citizenship provision&mdash;to comply with our EEC obligations and, in that context, any other amendment that seemed desirable could be introduced.  I asked that any interested organisation should send in their views, preferably in writing, within six weeks or so.</P>
      <P>Since I answered that question certain judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Communities have determined that the relevant provisions of the EEC Treaty are directly applicable.  The resulting situation may affect a number of enactments and accordingly the Attorney General is considering what may be necessary by way of revision of the Moneylenders Act, 1933 and certain other enactments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to, which is the opinion of an individual orthopaedic surgeon.  My Department are not aware of any statistical evidence <Col N="271" /> to support this estimate of 50,000 people needing hip replacement operations.  Recent enquiries made by my Department indicate that the total waiting list for all classes of joint replacement operations, including hip replacement is approximately 1,000.</P>
      <P>Much of this waiting list is due, I am advised, to the dramatic recent improvement in technique of joint replacement which offers the capability of relief for many cases which would not have benefited from earlier techniques. Once this backlog of these has been dealt with, the annual recurring demand should settle at a lower figure.</P>
      <P>I am, however, keeping this position under review and will consider if further steps may be needed to cope with the situation.  It does not appear that the major need at present is for extra beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if the original estimate was very much exaggerated, would the Minister not consider a waiting list of 1,000 to be excessive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears excessive but I am informed that there are 1,400 beds for such cases.  As I have said there is a rush for this sort of operation.  I expect that many Deputies have been approached by their constituents with a view to getting beds for them in the various hospitals so that they could undergo this operation. The reason why so many people have applied for the operation is that a new technique is being employed. It is proposed to advertise for the type of consultant involved in the hope that the employing of more consultants will result in the backlog being reduced.  I expect that when the backlog has been cleared, demand will even off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The extent to which subscribers to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board's hospital scheme take out insurance cover is entirely a matter between individual subscribers and the board.  I understand, however, that it is the normal practice of the board to warn subscribers of the danger of allowing themselves to become under-insured.  The board in recent times, because of escalating costs of hospital services, have been recommending to subscribers at appropriate intervals the minimum number of maintenance and treatment units which ought to be taken out, distinguishing between subscribers who have Health Act entitlement and those who have not.</P>

There was no fall whatever in the number for March-April, 1974.

What Deputy Calleary has said with regard to the removal of finished and unfinished material and some machinery is correct but, despite that position, the matter now appears to have been clarified and I am hopeful work will resume.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 17, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is an illustration. In January, 1976 A buys a silver teaset for £1,600.  In January, 1980 he sells part of that teaset for £1,000 and six months later he sells the rest to the same person for £1,400.  The total chargeable gain is £800, even though neither sale has produced £2,000.  The overriding limit on the tax chargeable is £200, that is the £2,400, the global sum received, and the £2,000 limit under section 17. The amount chargeable is allocated, and assuming by 1981 we have not yet changed the tax year, to the separate years of assessment by reference to the proportion of the total sale receipts applicable to each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sale in January, 1980 would be attributable to the year 1980-81 and the gain would be five-twelfths of £800, that is £334.  The following tax year, 1981-82, it would be seven-twelfths of £800, £466.  When you add those two sums together, £334 and £466 you get the total figure of £800.  If the tax chargeable on the two assessments taken together exceeds the overriding limit of £200, <Col N="282" /> which I have already mentioned, the appropriate reduction in the tax would be made in the same proportions. The tax payable in the year 1980-81, assuming the alternative charge which would be applicable, would be £92.  In the following year, 1981-82, the tax chargeable would be 26 per cent of £466 or £121, total tax liability of £213.  The overriding limit is £200, half of the difference between £2,400 and £2,000 so we deduct that £200 from £213 which gives a figure of £13.  The appropriate allocation of tax would be for the year 1880-81, £5 approximately, and for the following year, £8 approximately.  Did I say the tax chargeable?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used words something like that but I think I know what he meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say the appropriate reduction applicable is £5 in the first year and £8 in the second year.  The tax chargeable would be the gross figures I mentioned earlier of £92, less the allowance of £5, leaving a net amount of £87 in the first year.  As far as the second year is concerned, 1981-82, it would be £121, less the £8 odd, that is, £113, giving a total for the two years together of £200.  If the collection of a set of articles were to be sold in the one year the same distribution would take place but it seems to me it would not have any effect on the taxpayer's net position in the same tax year.  The allocation would be a national one if it occurred in the same tax year.  It could have significant effects for a taxpayer if the collection was to be sold off in different tax years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that example.  I have just two questions as I think I may have missed something he said.  Is the fraction five-twelfths related to the value of the two items sold as a proportion of the total value?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister envisage the sale of the two items in different years, one in 1980 and the other in 1981?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="283" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I was dealing with different tax years.  January, 1980 would be in the tax year 1980-81 and June, 1980 would be in the following tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of the sale of the two items in the one tax year effectively would the same tax be payable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I cannot see any circumstance in which it would vary.  The Deputy also asks me about the dates.  Suppose we have a case in which a person bought a silver teaset in 1970 for £2,000 and on 1st March, 1974, the day after the publication of the Capital Gains Tax White Paper, the person sold part of it for £1,600 and on 1st July, 1974 he sold the rest to the same dealer for £2,000.  The part of the teaset sold separately comprised a set and even though neither part realised £2,000 the gain arises on the second stage and is chargeable under subsection (4) because the first stage was paid after the date of the publication of the White Paper on 28th February, 1974. The gain on the first part is not, however, chargeable.  Assuming the value of the part retained between the 1st March, 1974 and 1st July, 1974 to have been £1,500 as at 1st March, 1974 the computation would be as follows: sale price £2,000; part cost&mdash; that is market value at date of first sale&mdash;£1,500; gain on the second sale £500.  The charitable gain attributable to the period from 6th April, 1974 to 1st July, 1974, apportioned on a time basis, is £500, multiplied by 3 months over four months, giving us a nett figure of £375.  The taxpayer could claim valuation as of 6th April, 1974 if that was to his advantage or if it <Col N="284" /> was not and he wanted to pay the extra tax he could also claim it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case the exemption under section 16 is not available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16 will still stand on its own.  I was simply assuming that the £500 had already been enjoyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But if there had been no other gain section 16 would operate?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that explanation which I will have to study in the record but I think I have the general drift of it.  In relation to subsection (5) would the Minister give an example of how paragraph (a) would operate?  I will be asking the same in regard to (b) and (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (a) deals with two elements of consideration&mdash; the actual consideration for part of a property disposed of and the market value of what remains undisposed of. If you take a case of actual value, that is of the part disposed of, at £800 and the balance of the market value is £1,600.  That would leave a total of £2,400.  If we divide, as required by subsection (b), the actual excess of £800 by the sum mentioned, if we divide the £800 by £2,400, that equals one-third&mdash;so the ultimate figure is half the difference between £2,000 and £2,400 or £200 multiplied by the fraction or by the division 3 so that we are left with a figure of £67.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked that question myself.  A terminal market is a commodity market.  It is a place where goods are distributed on, one might say, a world basis.  The disposer has no further control over them.  One thinks of some of the great tea, wool and commodity markets of the world.  All those are terminal markets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a section which deals with commodities in the sense in which commodities are understood such as grain and minerals and raw materials.  It deals with chattels, and we are distinguishing here between the commodity market on the one hand and chattels on the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to have any real knowledge of this subject, but I would have thought that transactions in commodities of the kind the Minister has in mind would not normally be in sums of less than £2,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>I am not anxious to be awkward, in fact I would like to help the Minister, but I am a little unhappy about this phrase &ldquo;terminal market&rdquo;.  Is it legally defined anywhere?  Is it a sufficiently well-known phrase to be taken unequivocally in a court say in the case of an appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When one avoids statutory definitions one always leaves oneself open to the possibility that a court may take a view different from that intended by the legislature.  At the same time, if you give a specific statutory definition to some words you may create results which you never intended either.  The words &ldquo;terminal market&rdquo; are sufficiently well-known in the ordinary commerical world not to require statutory definition.  I am not aware that it has been statutorily defined.  If one looks at the more reputable newspapers and journals&mdash;I am not excluding any newspaper with which the Deputy might have a connection but I am talking about those which are primarily connected with business affairs.  We find the expression &ldquo;terminal market&rdquo; quite frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour the point.  The Minister being a lawyer will appreciate that in a case like this what the Minister says in perfectly correct.  If you attempt to define, as well as defining and making clear you are restricting and perhaps over-restricting.  That is the objection to too precise a definition.  On the other hand, if you leave open words, unless these open words are clearly of well-known and accepted meaning, you run great risks of interpretation when it comes to the court.  It did occur to me, while I agree completely with what the Minister has said here, that perhaps this word was not sufficiently precise in the generally accepted sense.  As far as I am concerned, <Col N="287" /> I am easy.  I merely raise it as a point that occurs when Deputy Colley asks the meaning of it.  I am not making any particular issue of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>In relation to paragraph (b), I think I am right in saying that there is a provision in one of the Schedules dealing with money as such. I think the Minister referred to this when he said that gains in these fields did not come within the ambit of capital gains.  I am trying to find out what is intended to be achieved by subparagraph (b) where there is excluded from the operation of section 17 &ldquo;a disposal of currency of any description&rdquo;. What is the thinking behind this?</P>

      <P>A coin as distinct from paper money might be considered as currency.  I think it is, in fact, currency.  The question might be whether it is still in current use or not.  That is another issue.  That is a matter for fairly easy legal determination. A coin is either currently a coin of the realm or it is not.</P>

      <P>The Minister's intention in the subsection is always the thing that matters.  I take it it will cover, for instance, a case like this: supposing I have some foreign currency, dollars, francs, kroners, in my possession and sell them for £s.  It is a question of what the value is.  If you had not a provision like that, that might be a sale in which I could play with the exchange rates.  I am being <Col N="288" /> purely theoretical, I know.  If it is not that kind of transaction that is in mind, what is the Minister's reason? Nothing is inserted in a Bill without a reason.  That can be taken as axiomatic.  If the Minister could simply state the reason for inserting paragraph (b) it would help.  I am making no issue of it, just looking for clarification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid a little more arises than that.  It seems to me there are two questions.  First of all, there is the actual use of the word &ldquo;currency of any description&rdquo;.  Judging by what the Minister has just said it would seem that he is suggesting that that does not include, say, Irish £s and coins.  On the face of it, it does.  Perhaps I will raise the other point afterwards, if we could deal with this point first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 (b) provides that all forms of property shall be assets for the purposes of this Act whether situated in the State or not, including any currency, other than Irish currency and sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I am still raising the point.  If the Minister looks at that again, the paragraph (b) with which we are dealing says &ldquo;in relation to a disposal of currency of any description&rdquo;. In section 7 we are not defining currency; we are simply saying that all forms of property shall be assets, including any currency other than Irish currency and sterling.  I am <Col N="289" /> not sure that it follows automatically that Irish currency and sterling are, therefore, included within the meaning of currency of any description.  It may but it is not entirely clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is, and if anybody has any cause to complain that this is an effort by the Revenue Commissioners to charge Irish currency the defence would be that section 7 exempts Irish currency and sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As an asset chargeable. On that reasoning one can exclude it but if I was so disposed I could make an argument the other way.  I am not so disposed.  I am merely trying to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>The other question arising on this is: if we assume that somebody has some coin of foreign denomination, certainly not of legal tender, which acquires considerable value, we will say, by reason of scarcity or some other reason, and he disposes of it and as a result has a gain, we will assume, of £1,000, as I understand it, the effect of this subsection is that he would be liable for capital gains tax on that £1,000, perhaps subject to the section 16 provision of £500.  What I want to know is, why in that case does he not get the benefit given in section 17 to somebody disposing of tangible movable property where the consideration does not exceed £2,000.  What is the thinking behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason behind it is that obviously foreign currency in many circumstances and for many people can have liquidity value just as good as the legal tender of this realm.  Its very ease of handling would provide a very convenient way of avoiding liability to tax.  It is of interest that in other countries it has been considered desirable and necessary to treat currency in this way because it is such a fluid asset that people of substance could very easily use it as a vehicle to avoid liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of subsection (6) (b) is to remove currency from the exemption of section 17.  Therefore it is chargeable unless it is exempted in some other way.  That is why I said <Col N="290" /> earlier that, as section 7 exempts Irish currency, there cannot be any question of its applying to Irish legal tender.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the intention is not to give the benefit of the relief in section 17 to dealings in currency and in foreign exchange markets.  I understand that and I go along with it.  It would seem on the face of it that in doing that the Minister is also excluding from the benefit of section 17 the sale of old coins.  As he knows there are a number of people who have this hobby and would perhaps engage in it not in a big way of business.  They would appear to be excluded from the benefit which is applied to other movable property.  I am wondering if it would not be possible to distinguish between foreign currency which is legal tender and the kind of coins I have in mind which, if they have real value, are not legal tender presumably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>This section, as is apparent, provides that no chargeable gain and hence no allowable loss is to accure on the disposal of non-business wasting chattels.  A wasting asset is one with an expected useful life not exceeding 50 years.  Assets covered by the exemption include bloodstock, private motor cars, household furniture other than antiques <Col N="291" /> and domestic appliances.  A business asset, to the extent that it has not been used in business or has not qualified for capital allowances, will be exempt and the appropriate part of any gain on the disposal of it will not be a chargeable gain and correspondingly the appropriate part of any loss will not be an allowable loss.  The section does not apply to commodities or commodity futures, to use another word from the trade journals.</P>

      <P>We are going ahead with this whole scheme of legislation and you cannot incise at one spot and make a change.  I appreciate that.  The net effect is that we are giving judicial discretion to the Revenue Commissioners.  That is what we are doing and that is what <Col N="292" /> we are prepared to do because it is necessary for them to make judgment. In the past I would have opposed a simpler Bill but now that I see the alternative and find that not only is it tying up many people but it is also tying up the Revenue Commissioners themselves, I wonder could we have a simpler approach to all this legislation at a later stage.  That is not quite relevant to the section, I know, but I am prompted to make that remark because in dealing with wasting assets and definitions of that nature, as Deputy Colleys says, there is ample scope for dispute.</P>

      <P>If under this Act an asset is not a chargeable asset then no chargeable gain or allowable loss shall accrue on its disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is relevant, although it may not appear to be, to this amendment and I would like to refer the Minister to <Col N="294" /> section 24, subsection (5) which reads:</P>
    <P>If under this section an asset is not a chargeable asset then no chargeable gain or allowable loss shall accrue on its disposal.</P>
    <P>Perhaps later on the Minister proposes to delete that but I have raised a note for myself on this amendment as to why a similar provision to this was not being included.  I see that it is included on a general basis in No. 13.  If it is, it would seem that the provision to which I was referring in section 24 (5) is superfluous, unless the Minister is subsequently proposing to delete it.  Yes, I see he is and I withdraw it.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister in relation to this amendment if he could tell us the difference between this and section 19 which he proposes to delete and further is it the position that under this amendment losses incurred in relation to the items mentioned would not be allowed and in particular losses incurred in relation to land bonds would not be allowed?</P>

      <P>Answering the Deputy's last question first, the Deputy is correct in his assumption. He will recall that there are eight related amendments which we took when we were discussing amendment No. 13 when section 7 was being amended.  This section 19 brings in a revised section and, taken together with the amendment of section 24, involves no more than a rearrangement of the sections and is designed to give a better presentation without changing their effect.  The essential provisions of section 24 which related to Government issues include saving certificates and land bonds and they are being transferred to section 19 which now covers all securities issued under the authority of the Minister for Finance.  This enables the provisions of section 19 to be expressed in a more comprehensive manner and eliminates the need for a definition of specified securities and also, indeed, the whole of Schedule No. 4 which consisted of a list of specified securities.</P>

      <P>Another Deputy received a letter in regard to this section which he passed on to me and if I may quote briefly from the letter, I think it exemplified the point raised which is of some importance.  The extract is:</P>
      <P>As may be appreciated, when arranging life insurance on two partners who have families, it was normal up to now to arrange life policies on the individual partner's lives and then cross-assign both policies. For example, Partner A might take out a £20,000 life policy on himself and assign his policy to Partner B, and <i>vice versa.</i> In the event of the death of Partner A, the experts deem that the funds are in the right hands, namely, in the hands of the surviving partner who can either buy out the deceased partner's widow or purchase an annuity for her.</P>
      <P>My question is&mdash;am I correct in reading that the partner making the disposal is not the original beneficial owner in the above arrangement and that the proceeds of the policy would be subject to capital gains tax under this Bill, even though the proceeds might be entirely for the benefit of the widow and children.</P>
      <P>In the case of policies taken out after this Bill becomes law there is no difficulty as matters can be rearranged until the law is given another twist.  But in the case of existing arrangements, if I am reading the above section properly, this tax would be absolutely vicious.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could throw some light on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Something similar was received by the Minister and I have had the matter considered by the Revenue Commissioners, and I may say that generally speaking genuine arrangements such as that which is spoken of there are not intended to be caught.  I certainly would very carefully consider the position because I would not consider it desirable that such an arrangement should be caught.  However, at this stage I would not want to <Col N="297" /> be specific as to whether it is exempted as it stands but I will certainly look at it between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <P>I do not know whether or not you appreciate this but the position is that practically everybody rich, poor and middle class who took out an insurance policy in this country over the last five years took one of these unit trusts or property module policies.  The maturity value of insurance policies is bad enough at the moment, but if this profit is going to be subject to capital gains it is going to be a serious matter for thousands of people especially people like Bord na Móna workers and building workers.  The Government may say that if they exempted this type of policy that the rich could then avoid capital gains by investing in such policies but the way out of that is the simple one, by exempting all unit trust policies and property <Col N="298" /> module policies which have been taken out to date.</P>
    <P>This is in relation to the provision of subsection (4) which states:</P>
    <P>In subsection (3) the reference to payment of the sum assured shall include a reference to the transfer of investments or other assets to the owner of the policy in accordance with the policy.</P>
    <P>My own reading of this is that the section will only apply where the rights under the policies, for instance, in property module policies, have been sold.  Therefore, the case made in the letter I quoted does not seem to be correct, but I should like to have the Minister's confirmation of that.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) is understandable because these pension schemes are all regulated under these Acts.  I have not inquired too closely as to why it is necessary to have sub-section (2) but the fact that it is there leads me to ask this question: What is the position with regard to public service pensions?  They seem to be in between.  Are they covered by sub-section (1)?  If they are not what is the position in regard to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the presence of subsection (2) is because the fund referred to in subsection (2) is not covered by any of the schemes mentioned in subsection (1).  The reason why public service pensions are not mentioned is because <Col N="299" /> there is no fund out of which public service pensions are paid.  They are paid out of the Exchequer generally and not out of a specific pension fund. There is no specific scheme, but where there are specific schemes they would be protected by these sections.  The right to public service pensions is not related to the existence of a fund.</P>

      <P>I want to be sure that the public service would not be at a disadvantage here.  A matter came up under a Finance Act many years ago which, unfortunately, resulted, through mechanics, in a disimprovement in the position of the public service pensions.  So long as the point has been adverted to and that they are not adversely affected by this Bill I am happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point in regard to the proviso to sub-section (1) which reads:</P>
      <P>Provided that where part only of a fund is approved under any of the said sections, the gains shall be exempt from being a chargeable gain to the same extent only as income derived from the assets would be exempt under the relevant section under which approval was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure whether the Minister is aware of this but my understanding is that the Revenue Commissioners have approved of a number of superannuation schemes in the private sector for the purpose of income tax allowances.  One of the conditions applied by the Revenue Commissioners to that approval in that such schemes may not provide for increasing pensions to meet inflation at a higher rate than 5 per cent per annum.  The Minister does not have to be told that such a provision is out of date and, in so far as one can arrange a scheme that would provide <Col N="300" /> for current inflation, one ought to be able to do so.  I am not raising with the Minister the question of income tax allowances in respect of such but I am raising the question of the effect of this proviso on such schemes.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the effect of the proviso is that in so far as a scheme might provide for increasing pensions in line with inflation at the rate of say 10 per cent per annum that portion of that fund would be excluded from the benefit of this section and would be liable to captial gains tax.  If I am right in that assumption I suggest to the Minister that that is not a provision we should have and it is not one that could be justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy would accept that if an amendment is required to the superannuation fund scheme in relation to the Income Tax Acts that, as he anticipated, it is not a matter for this Bill.  If an amendment is required because the rate of inflation is higher than 5 per cent it is required for income tax as well as capital gains tax purposes.  This is something I will look at, and I can assure the Deputy of that.  I will also give an assurance that it is our determination in Government to rectify the present inflationary trend which is so harmful to many aspects of life, not least to the value of pension funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of general guiding principle with reference to the section I should like to add that it is highly desirable that trends in dealing with inflation should be the same all over the community, in the private as well as the public sector. There should not be too great a discrepancy between provisions in the public sector from provisions in the private sector.  I ask the Minister to bear that in mind for a variety of reasons that I would be out of order to give now.</P>

      <P>I will not engage in any comment on what the Minister has said about the Government's efforts to combat inflation.  All I will say is that the Minister, I am certain, <Col N="301" /> will agree with me that even with the maximum and most successful efforts on the part of the Government it is extremely unlikely that inflation would be reduced to a figure of 5 per cent per annum for some time to come.  That being so, the point I raised, I believe, is of some urgency. While I appreciate that, if you like, from a technical point of view, an amendment of the regulations in regard to the Income Tax Acts would automatically cure the problem here, nevertheless, since I would not be in order in pursuing the Income Tax Act end of it, I have to pursue it on this proviso.  Therefore, I want to be quite clear on my understanding of what the Minister said.  Perhaps he would confirm that I am correct in thinking that what he said was that he would look into the question I raised; that if he finds the position is as I have indicated he would have the regulations altered in regard to the Income Tax Acts so as to allow for the current rate of inflation and that that would automatically cure the problem in regard to the proviso in subsection (1).</P>

But I will certainly examine the existing provision in the light of what the Deputy has argued here and have indicated my readiness so to do.  If and when any change is made there, it would, by virtue of section 21, apply automatically to the capital gains law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I want to raise on this is in regard to sub-section (2).  It is perhaps a rather technical point but, if possible, I should like to have it clarified.  Sub-section (2) commences:</P>
      <P>If property held on charitable trust ceases to be subject to charitable trust&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>then certain things happen.  It is in regard to the use of the word &ldquo;ceases&rdquo; that I raise this point.  It seems to me that it could happen that property could momentarily <Col N="303" /> cease to be subject to certain charitable trusts before becoming subject to new charitable trusts.  What I want to ensure is that, in such circumstances, the use of the word &ldquo;ceases&rdquo; would not operate to introduce the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) and that the property would still be treated in the same way as it had been before the first charitable trust had momentarily ceased and almost immediately afterwards been replaced by new charitable trusts.  I admit it is a purely technical point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, I think, so technical that we cannot deal with it in legislation.  If any case of hardship arose, it could be looked at on its merits.  The purpose of subsection (2) is to prevent avoidance by the use of timed charities, or charitable trusts, set up for a limited period only.  When the assets cease to be subject to the trust, they are deemed to have been sold and immediately reacquired by the trustees for a consideration equal to the market value, any resulting gain not being allowable for exemption.  Furthermore, any area of gain which had not been applied for charitable purposes would become chargeable and assessments made at any time not later than ten years after the end of the year of assessment in which the assets ceased to be subject to charitable trusts.  I am not quite certain what Deputy Colley has in mind when he visualises an existing trust which temporarily would not have any beneficiaries. Obviously, there would be a right open to some person or persons to enjoy benefit of the trust at some time.  The mere fact that they were not in current receipts of it would not mean that the trust did not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The kind of thing I had in mind was this: where property is subject to a charitable trust and the charitable objects of the trust cease to exist&mdash;an out-of-date charitable trust; it happens from time to time&mdash; the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests have certain powers in this regard to substitute <Col N="304" /> new objects or, perhaps, the courts in certain circumstances.  All I am concerned about here is to ensure that, in such circumstances, there is not at any point in time a cessation of the charitable trust because, if there is, it seems to me that the use of the word &ldquo;ceases&rdquo; can create a problem that was not intended.  It is a technical point.  I am drawing the Minister's attention to it and I do not except him to pronounce on it here but I would ask him if he would have it examined.  If there is nothing in it, well and good but, if there is, I am sure he would want to take steps to remedy it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think what is in mind here is that the trustees might still remain in possession of certain assets which had not been disposed of at market value and, if ultimately disposed of, the proceeds of which would be deemed, at that stage, not to have accrued to the charity but to the trustees themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>. . . an assessment to capital gains tax chargeable by virtue of paragraph (b) may be made at any time not more than ten years after the end of the year of assessment in which the property ceases to be subject to charitable trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate there may be a good reason but it seems a very long time during which an assessment might be made.  As the Minister will appreciate, the possibility of such an assessment arising could create a number of problems either for the sale or the purchase of property.  For instance, what would be the position of a purchaser for value after five years? <Col N="305" /> Would he be taking on a contingent liability, that the Revenue Commissioners might be going after the property, or would they be confined to the proceeds of sale as received by the trustees?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21a:</P>
      <P>In page 21, before section 23, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>23.&mdash;(1)  A gain shall not be a chargeable gain if it accrues to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a registered trade union to the extent that its income is exempt from income tax under section 336 of the Income Tax Act, 1967,</P>
      <P>(b)  an unregistered friendly society whose income is exempt from income tax under section 335 (1) of the said Act, or</P>
      <P>(c)  a registered friendly society whose income is exempt from income tax under section 335 (1) of the said Act,</P>
      <P>(d)  a local authority,</P>
      <P>(e)  the Central Bank of Ireland,</P>
      <P>(f)  a health board,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(g)  a vocational education committee established under the <Col N="306" /> Vocational Education Act, 1930, and</P>
    <P>(h)  a committee of agriculture established under the Agriculture Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 2 (2) of the Local Government Act, 1941, and includes a body established under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>During the course of this Committee Stage debate reference was made to the definition of a local authority. The definition in the Bill has been reexamined and it has been considered that it should be amended to bring it into line with what is used generally. The definition now proposed is based on that contained in the Local Government Act, 1941, which is as follows:</P>
    <P>(2)  Each of the following bodies (whether corporate or unincorporated) shall be a local authority for the purposes of this Act and the Acts which may be collectively cited with this Act, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a council of a county, a corporation of a county or other borough, a council of an urban district, a public assistance authrity, commissioners of a town, a port sanitary authority, and</P>
    <P>(b)  a committee or joint committee or board or joint board (whether corporate or unincorporated) appointed by or under statute to perform the functions or any of the functions of any of the bodies mentioned in the immediately preceding paragraph of this sub-section, and</P>
    <P>(c)  a committee or joint committee or board or joint board (whether corporate or unincorporated) other than a vocational education committee or a committee of agriculture of or appointed by one or more of the bodies mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection.</P>
    <P>That section would exclude vocational education committees and local committees <Col N="307" /> of agriculture which it was intended should be exempt from tax and, accordingly, these bodies have to be named specifically.  In like manner, the regional health authorities are specifically named because, under the Health Act, 1970 the health service ceased to be part of the function of local authorities.</P>
    <P>In making these adjustments opportunity was taken to rearrange the section and instead of saying that a particular body is exempt from capital gains tax it is provided that any gains accruing to such bodies will not be chargeable gains.  This will have the same effect as saying the bodies themselves are exempt.  The wording now proposed corresponds with that used in relation to exemptions given in other sections, for example, section 21 deals with superannuation funds, section 22 deals with charities and section 24 deals with miscellaneous exemptions for certain types of property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording is improved in the amendment because all kinds of questions were raised with the section as originally drafted.  It said a local authority should be exempt from gains tax and it listed other bodies that would also be exempt.  It stated that the Central Bank should be exempt from tax in respect of chargeable gains accruing to it.  One wondered what the Minister had in mind.  The amendment now presents the position more clearly and unambiguously.</P>
      <P>However, there are one or two points I should like the Minister to clarify.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>(a)  a registered trade union to the extent that its income is exempt from income tax under section 336 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate broadly the provisions of that section in relation to a trade union and its liability for income tax?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 336 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A registered trade union which is precluded, by statute or by its rules, from assuring to any person <Col N="308" /> a sum exceeding £600 by way of gross sum, or £250 a year by way of annuity, shall be entitled to exemption from tax under Schedules A, C, and D in respect of its interest and dividends which are applicable and applied solely for the purpose of provident benefits.</P>
    <P>In this section, &ldquo;provident benefits&rdquo; includes any payment, expressly authorised by the registered rules of the trade union, which is made to a member during sickness or incapacity from personal injury or while out of work, or to an aged member by way of superannuation, or to a member who has met with an accident, or has lost his tools by fire or theft, and includes a payment in discharge or aid of funeral expenses on the death of a member, or the wife of a member, or as provision for the children of a deceased member.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister. It would seem what is involved in the section are the activities of a trade union in so far as they relate to a form of assurance or insurance for the members under the different headings indicated by the Minister in his quotation.  Does it follow from that that income of a trade union for any other purpose is liable to income tax?  If so, how can that be applied to capital gains tax in the way it is stated here, that it is exempt from capital gains tax to the extent that its income is exempt?  I am not clear how that can be applied.  If a trade union makes a capital gain, how do you apportion it between one kind of income which is exempt from income tax and the rest of the income?</P>

Another point I should like to put to the Minister on the section is that, having regard to the various exempted bodies envisaged in this section, does the Minister think there might be a case for considering exemption in the case of a registered political party which, whatever it is in business for, is not in business for making money?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which would come up for consideration primarily in relation to the Income Tax Act and not in relation to this Capital Gains Tax Bill.  Incidentally, if I might refer to an earlier point, section 44 of the 1973 Finance Act, to which I referred <Col N="313" /> specifically, makes reference to section 335 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.

They are quite legitimate in doing real estate business or any type of business provided they apportion their funds to the particular items mentioned in the Finance Bill.

If trade unions apply their funds to achieving political purposes and not for the benefit of members or in the circumstances set out in the Act they would not be exempt from income tax and they would not be exempt from capital gains tax.</P>

      <P>The Income Tax Acts are not being changed by this.  We are simply applying the same disciplines and exemptions as applied under the income tax code for capital gains tax purposes.  The Acts are very clear and if money is applied to purposes other than those mentioned then the exemption in regard to income tax and capital <Col N="314" /> gains tax would not be enjoyed by trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of a situation which occurred within the last few years.  It does not happen very often and, in relation to my party, I do not visualise it ever happening and I doubt if it would happen in relation to the Fine Gael Party, but I think the Labour Party within the last few years found itself in the position that it had to dispose of its headquarters and acquire another premises.  I am not very familiar with the details though I did see some reference to it in the newspapers at the time and my recollection is that they made a fairly substantial capital gain.  It would seem to me wrong in those circumstances, had this Bill been in operation at the time, that the Labour Party would have been subject to capital gains tax.  Whatever the objectives of a registered political party may be they are certainly not to make money.  As I say, this does not happen very often but, if it were to happen, it would not seem to me to be right; indeed, it would be contrary to what is envisaged in the section with regard to different kinds of trade unions, registered friendly societies and so on, subject admittedly to the conditions laid down.  Would the Minister agree with me in principle on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Secondly, it is a well established practice that the financial circumstances of any particular person or group should not be discussed in public and I would not consider it appropriate to comment on the illustration Deputy Colley used any more than it would be proper for me to comment upon the desirability of liability of the Fianna Fáil Party to capital gains tax, or otherwise, on sales of shares or securities they might hold. There may be a case under the Income Tax Act and ultimately through this particular section by translation into capital gains tax for some consideration in respect of money devoted <Col N="315" /> towards the achievement of legitimate political aims but this, of course, introduces a huge area for argument as to what political aims are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt whether the qualifications of registration would necessarily be the most appropriate ones for tax exemption, but it is outside the ambit of this particular Bill. It is something that could be looked at on another occasion.  Nobody is enjoying exemption in respect of moneys devoted to political purposes under the law as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting they should.  What I am suggesting is that a registered political party which found itself in the position in which the Labour Party found itself a few years ago when it was obliged to dispose of its existing headquarters and purchase another should not be subject to capital gains tax provided the gain involved was used for the purpose of that registered political party. I would suggest this is within the scope of the Bill to the extent that consideration should be given to whether this section should have added registered political parties to the list of bodies exempt from capital gains. I am not pushing this.  It is certainly not an acute problem.  It is a problem that may not arise for a very long time for any political party but, if it should arise, it is a question whether capital gains tax should be levied in such circumstances when it is not being levied on the bodies listed in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24 (a):</P>
      <P>In page 22, to insert the following subsection after subsection (4):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5) (a) No chargeable gain shall accrue on the disposal of an interest created by or arising under a settlement (including, in <Col N="317" /> particular, an annuity or life interest, and the reversion to an annuity or life interest) by the person for whose benefit the interest was created by the terms of the settlement or by any other person except one who acquired, or derives his title from one who acquired, the interest for a consideration in money or money's worth, other than consideration consisting of another interest under the settlement.</P>
    <P>(b) Subject to paragraph (a), where a person who has acquired an interest in settled property (including in particular the reversion to an annuity or life interest) becomes, as the holder of that interest, absolutely entitled as against the trustee to any settled property, he shall be treated as disposing of the interest in consideration of obtaining that settled property (but without prejudice to any gain accruing to the trustee on the disposal of that property deemed to be effected by him under section 15 (3)).</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that there will be no charge to capital gains tax where a beneficiary under a settlement disposes of his right or interest, including an annuity, a life interest or a reversionary interest before the right or interest terminates.  It will be noted that under subsection (4) of section 24 the disposal of certain other rights will not give rise to a charge on gains.  These are rights to benefits under a superannuation fund, to an annuity or to annual payments due under a covenant. A right to benefits under a settlement is of a similar nature to these.  Without the proposed amendment the disposal of such a right would, under the general provisions of the Bill, be regarded as the disposal of an asset, the right being an asset separate and distinct from the underlying assets of the settlement.</P>
    <P>In normal circumstances the right would have been acquired free of charge so that the consideration for the disposal would have to be regarded <Col N="318" /> as all gain while in addition there would be a charge under section 15 on the trustees based on the market value of the assets on the termination of the particular interest disposed of.  The proposed amendment postpones the charge to tax until the particular interest terminates. At that time there will be a charge on the trustees if another interest is created and the assets remain in the settlement or if some person become absolutely entitled to the assets and they leave the settlement. This is in accordance with the general scheme proposed in section 15 for dealing with assets comprised in a settlement.  If the person who acquires the absolute entitlement to the assets is the person who acquired the vendor's interest in the settlement and if he acquired that interest for a consideration in money he will be treated as disposing of the interest in exchange for the assets and he will be charged to capital gains tax by reference to the difference between the market value of the assets, which he acquires, and what he paid for the right to acquire them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it the amendment is in relief of certain kinds of taxpayers but I am not entirely sure it is consistent with the rest of the provisions of the Bill.  I am not saying it is not but I am not entirely sure that it is because, as I understand it, the Minister said it was dealing with a situation which was analogous to the kind of situations dealt with in subsection (4), that it was similar to those in subsection (4) such as a right to an annuity or a capital sum out of a superannuation fund.  In some circumstances, I can see a life interest under a settlement might be similar to that but in other circumstances it might not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little surprised, quite honestly, at the fact that the Minister is proposing to give any exemption in a case of this kind because in other matters in connection with capital taxation the Minister appeared to me to treat anybody who had an interest under a settlement as somebody who was almost automatically and by <Col N="319" /> definition engaged in or with people who were trying to avoid if not evade tax.  However, I suppose we should not look a gift horse in the mouth.  I am a little surprised at what appears to me to be quite a different approach by the Minister from that which he has adopted in other provisions in regard to capital taxation relating to settlements.</P>

      <P>In plain language does this simply mean that the Minister is taking a certain advantage to promote State investment?  It says that the following shall not be chargeable assets and these are all State securities. It seems to me that subsections (1), (2) and (3) are incentives to investment in public assets rather than anything else.  Is that an unfair interpretation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the Government fully realised that the fishing industry was not in an organised position to take full advantage of the potential which was available to them and one of the first acts of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government was to make available to the body responsible for welding together the different groups&mdash;the IAOS&mdash;a sum of £15,000.  That was done specifically for the many and varied groups who, over the years, expressed different views at different times and, in fact, were not, to put it bluntly, pulling <Col N="321" /> together as well as they should be. This sum, certainly, was wisely expended. We now have reached the stage where we have a united fishermen's association called the Irish Fishermen's Organisation which speaks for all the fishermen.  It is now much easier for the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with this properly organised group.  At all times he has shown his willingness to meet with them and with others who have views also and encourage them to put forward suggestions which would be helpful to him in formulating an overall policy.</P>
      <P>It will be necessary, I suppose, as a further step, to encourage the formation of fishing co-operatives and as the years move on the fishermen will realise the vital importance of having properly organised and run co-operatives.  As individuals, we will not get the best price.  We can hope for better prices when we are in a position to market our produce in a proper way.  The Parliamentary Secretary has recommended the involvement of fishermen and it is reaping a rich harvest at this stage.  He met all of them on numerous occasions so he cannot be accused of at any time refusing to meet responsible people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must question not alone the action of fishermen at present but the action of many others who think that the best method of securing a better way of life for themselves is by organising strikes, whether those strikes are official or unofficial.  We all recognise that it is an out-growth of our modern civilisation, often described as &ldquo;a last resort&rdquo;, in order to focus public attention on a particular complaint or a particular redress of wrongs which certain people consider that they need. We have arrived at the stage now when we must balance the benefits gained against the losses.  I would think&mdash;and this does not just apply to fishermen, it applies all around&mdash;that we should balance out the amount of work hours lost against the gains, balance the disruption of business and trade, the dislocation of business, the hardships which are caused by unofficial strikes against the benefits.  It is about time to think of other ways in which to get a <Col N="322" /> redress of wrongs or proper attention given to complaints.  There is no doubt that we must have some type of early warning system.  I think the Minister for Labour has something in mind.  It would certainly be an advantage to both workers and employers if, when there is the seed of discontent growing, whether on the factory floor, among fishermen or others, there would be a line of communication between management and those who have the complaint. Rather than have an accumulation of complaints and discontent and a whole disorganisation of our society it would be much easier if we had that line of communication and disputes brought to the conference table at an early stage.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the fishermen's organisation had not the right to withdraw their labour and block the ports as in this case.  In every strike there is undoubtedly an amount of hardship created but it would be well to change our way of life in this respect and to turn our minds to better ways to secure for our people an improved standard of living.  Certainly, all people who live in this island know well the hardships which fishermen must endure.  They are conversant with the hazards which they have to face and on that account they have a certain sympathy with fishermen who are undoubtedly brave men and would like to see their lot improved in getting better prices for catches, having better boats and having an all round better standard of living.</P>
    <P>One must also consider how we can all look for improved standards of living.  We are living in a period in which we are trying to overcome a recession which has an effect on the daily lives of everybody whether he is a worker in any capacity, or an owner of property.  One must consider whether or not we should all have a waiting period until we get over our present temporary crisis.  If we do we will be able to channel much more of our energy and our money into areas such as the fishermen's co-operatives and so on, to improve their standards. Many will complain that we are now living under sections 4 and 5 which were negotiated on our entry into the <Col N="323" /> EEC and some, certainly on this side of the House, will say that we are not responsible for the terms which were negotiated at that time but we certainly might consider that a renegotiation could be helpful and, undoubtedly, will be helpful and that will take place in due course.</P>
    <P>I can never understand why in the last four years of office of the previous Government the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries returned in one year 66 per cent of the allocation for harbour development, in another year 48 per cent, in another year 40 per cent and in the fourth year 47 per cent.  When you consider the development required in small areas one finds it difficult to understand the attitudes which permitted this.  A sum of money was voted but the expenditure was less than was provided.  This will not happen now.  None of us would wish it to happen because it is vital to develop the smaller harbours.  The expenditure of about £½ million at Rossaveal will be a real encouragement to the people there.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging the necessity to provide adequate facilities for bigger boats, there must be a proper assessment of the needs of fishermen in areas like the west coast of Clare. That is why I specifically mentioned this money which was returned to the Exchequer in the last four years of the administration of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>It is very important that owners be provided with suitable boats, and Bord Iascaigh Mhara are ensuring that this is done.  I know of a few instances where progressive young men purchased boats and the grants were not approved by Bord Iascaigh Mhara on the ground that the boats were not up to the required standard. Fishermen have local knowledge. They have a good understanding of tides and currents.  In future I would prefer to see much more consultation between those who purchase boats and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  It is a wonderful help that the Department are paying 70 per cent of the interest on loans in respect of the <Col N="324" /> purchase of boats.  That is a real encouragement. Nevertheless, the purchaser needs to have a basic amount of capital.  That is where a co-operative can be most helpful.  Possibly, businessmen and others would consider investing money in fishermen's co-operatives in order to encourage them to continue in this vocation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>All the money expended on the purchase of boats should be expended in this country.  We have the techniques, the knowledge and the tradition of boat building.  Where the proper type of boat can be provided locally I would not approve of grants being paid for the purchase of boats outside the country.  I hope the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will give greater encouragement to the boat-building industry and will attempt to locate industries where this type of work can be undertaken, particularly on the west coast.  The IDA and other promoting agencies can expend quite substantial sums of money, often given to very doubtful industrialists, who in many instances have not justified the confidence which the State has shown by giving them huge sums of money. State investment in the boat building industry would provide employment opportunities for persons with the expertise.  Workers would be encouraged to train for this type of work. Generally, this native industry would show greater buoyancy.</P>
      <P>This motion has given all of us an opportunity to express our views.  It is good to encourage people to express views.  This Government have practically doubled the amount of money which was allocated in the last year of office of the previous Government. The allocation has gone from £4,150,000 to £7,940,000&mdash;an increase of £3,790,000.  We would like to be able to give more.  It cannot be argued that it is not a substantial increase, even allowing for inflation.  That money will be expended, I am sure, and none of it will be returned to the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion on fisheries may not do much to improve the lot of the people engaged in the industry.  It will help to goad the Government into some action or at least make them conscious of their lack of action in the present circumstances.  It is sometimes frightening to witness the gross misunderstanding or lack of knowledge of what is involved in the fishing industry as evidenced from the speeches that we hear from the other side of the House.  It makes one's spine shiver that one of the most important industries potentially that this country has is being completely neglected and ignored at a time when it is most essential that every possible effort should be made to develop that industry which could make the best contribution to the national economy in the existing disastrous situation.</P>
      <P>The fishing industry has had many vicissitudes down through the years. Time does not permit me to develop the evolution of the fishing industry from its earliest days when it was mainly engaged in by part-time fishermen in Ireland who went down to the sea in small craft on occasions when weather permitted and worked on their farms at other times.  The figures given for those days show a huge number of people engaged in fishing whereas, in fact, they were only part-time fishermen with a very modest, if not low, standard of living.  The amount they were able to reap from the sea in the precarious livelihood they enjoyed was barely sufficient to keep body and soul together as a supplement to their farm work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw the change rapidly taking place.  The fishing industry will not develop without getting the necessary capital support from public funds. There is no industry so sensitive and so responsive to capital investment from the Exchequer as the fishing industry.  The men who engage in fishing have not got the capital to equip themselves with the necessary expensive gear required in order to develop fishing.  It was for that reason that we first put the fishing industry in Ireland properly on its feet, and gave the fishermen the opportunity, even though they had not got the <Col N="326" /> money, to purchase the larger craft for which the demand was growing to enable them to fish in deeper waters and to pursue their livelihood under better conditions and with greater comfort.</P>
    <P>That set the basis for the fishing industry, which is essentially an overexpanding industry requiring more and more capital each year.  There are many facets of the industry which must be brought up simultaneously. When one increases the catching power, this requires greater capital investment.  This requires more boats and gives better employment in the yards.  It requires more men at sea and this requires more training and a better training programme to equip the many people who are prepared to go to sea now, if given the proper facilities to do so.</P>
    <P>In addition to increasing the catching power by providing better and expanding fleets, it increases the landings of fish and this requires more market research, better market development, restructuring of markets, the provision of processing plants ashore for the many ways fish can be processed, the provision of ice plants in order to retain supplies in times of glut so that they may be released in suitable quantities when there is a shortage.  It encourages processing in the line of smoking, of filleting, of marinating and the production of fishmeal and fish oils and many other ancillary industries which are essentially attached to a growing and expanding fishing industry.</P>
    <P>It was that expanding base we properly established and set going with an ever-growing and expanding fleet consisting each year of more boats and boats of a better type.  To hear somebody say that at the last minute the Minister threw a few extra pounds on the plate to keep this industry alive is laughable.  It shows a complete ignorance of the industry.  Indeed, in the face of a complete lack of any development programme whatever, it is appalling to see the Government sending a young, innocent Deputy like Deputy White into the House to say that the fishermen of Killybegs and Burtonport enjoyed two <Col N="327" /> great years under the present Government. If he were to make that statement on Killybegs Pier he would find himself wrapped around the propellor of a trawler.</P>
    <P>The fishermen for the first time found themselves on strike.  For the first time skippers were signing on for dole.  They have come through a disastrous period and confidence in the industry, like every other industry, has completely sagged.  Fishermen have become despondent, without any guidance, without any lead, without any hope as to what the future will hold.  These are the two most disastrous years the industry has experienced, an industry which was expanding and would require three times the capital even to keep pace with inflation in the past three years.  Inflation alone, if one compares the cost of boats, means that to provide the same number of boats this year as were provided three years ago would require three times the capital which is being put into it now.  Everybody knows that.  It is a very simple matter of arithmetic to do one's sums on that.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is an important industry.  It is unique.  It is an industry that has complete worker democracy. The workers are participants in the profits.  It is not strike-ridden.  Every man is working.  It is one for all, each sharing a profit in the best unit output. The best output per man of any industry in the world is to be found in share fishing as practised around our coasts.  It is an industry which contributes to the balance of payments. It has all the raw materials here.  It does more to absorb employment than many other industries.  It is entirely male-orientated and it is an industry particularly suited to the west.  It has an unending potential if we develop it.</P>
    <P>Apart from immediate development in a time of economic crisis&mdash;even if we never had an economic crisis as we have now&mdash;we should also be expanding the fishing industry to meet EEC requirements by 1983.  This was pointed out by Deputy Gallagher who has sponsored this motion.  Nothing whatever is seen to be done in relation <Col N="328" /> to the fishing industry in the form of an organised programme that would point the way to what the future holds.</P>
    <P>I must say that as Minister I found the various programmes for economic and social expansion most useful.  You had only to look at this book to see what was projected in relation to the Department with which you were involved. You immediately saw where the targets were set and what you could do to move towards them.  They might not always be realisable, and they may not have always been realised, but it certainly set down what was decided and agreed on a proper consensus of where an industry should lead, the direction in which money should be channelled and the things that should be done to move towards those targets.  While the targets set down in these programmes were not realised in many cases, in other cases they were surpassed, but in all cases they were a definite guide.  They were a programme and a blueprint for the economy and they helped to generate the necessary confidence which procured investment in the projected industries.  The fishing industry depends on public investment more than any other industry.</P>
    <P>The amount of money the Government put into the fishing industry will immediately create expansion that ten times the amount will yield in other industries.  As a Member of the Government in Fianna Fáil's time I was particularly critical as to the amount of money put into fisheries.  It is true economists are able to point out that the rate at which you can develop must be limited because you have to bring up your marketing with your increased catching power.  As you expand your fleet the landings increase and you must be able to market them.  We have got over all that.</P>
    <P>Many of us in this House remember the time when a few small boats fishing for herrings&mdash;which are popularly known in the economic lingo as pelagic fish&mdash;could glut the market with the least possible effort.  We have seen fish carted away as manure, fertiliser for fields, many times.  That day has <Col N="329" /> gone.  It is gone mainly because of the fishmeal plants we set up which take the fish at all times.  Then we have the smoking plants, processing plants, the deep freezing plants and the marinating plants.  These are essential for the demersal fish to ensure that a glut at no time can take place.  For that reason the market has been steady although the price at times will tend to fall.  This is where the Government must come in.  The amount of money we are prepared to use at all times in order to attract new industries is very laudable indeed.  It is commendable that we are prepared to use so much investment to entice people to invest in new industry.</P>
    <P>If a reasonable proportion of this money were invested in the fishing industry, it would respond more rapidly and give a better return than waiting to entice foreigners to start some industry we have not already got or perhaps some industry for which we have to import the entire raw material for processing here.</P>
    <P>One of these days, we will have an extended fishing limit.  We must be able to show we are capable of using it and capable of protecting it. You do not do this on the eve of its happening; you must commence doing it now.  The movement must be in that direction immediately and at a time when the unemployment figures are becoming frightening and when the old standards of living that were rising are beginning to drop again, it surely behoves the entire Government to get together behind one of the industries which can contribute most to the economy at this time and really use whatever brains that exist in the Government to ensure that this industry can be given a fillip that is so essential and will contribute so much to the economy now.  I do not see any signs of it.</P>
    <P>I remember before he became involved in politics, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs used to give us copious volumes of economic material in the different newspapers and magazines.  He gave us the macro-economic analysis and the micro-economic analysis, the projections and the baselines of all the industries <Col N="330" /> and economic development that the country could produce.  He had comments on these programmes which were mostly satisfactory and very helpful.  What is he contributing to the Government today?  He is galloping around and making a Kissinger of himself at a time when he should be tethered to some desk, using that knowledge which he had in the past to make some contribution to the economy at a time when it is shivering and ready to go under, and send some of the extroverts abroad to do the globe-trotting because anyone can do that.  It is purely an exercise for an extrovert.  His is a brain in the Government that might be used as it was being used before he indulged in politics.</P>
    <P>Surely something could be done to restore confidence and create a favourable climate for investment.  The difficulty in this industry and the lack of attention and programming really epitomises the Government's handling of every other sector of the economy as well.  Nothing is done to create a more favourable climate for investment by private enterprise and to dispel the gloom that is settling over the country, but the Taoiseach in all this morass is like a shepherd in the mist, giving no guidance or leadership whatever to what is required or necessary in the critical time in the country's economic history.  Fisheries is only one industry.</P>
    <P>I have only a few minutes left and I would like to deal with this on a broader basis.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary could he not bring the Government with him in this and get an industry going which is, at the moment, shivering in uncertainty? Could he not get the Government behind him to do something, not merely to maintain the standards they enjoyed in the past but would help to continue the expansion we were enjoying?  I know it would take a good deal of money but the Government are at present spending a lot of money on many other things that are not nearly as essential or would not be as helpful to the economy. I believe that if the Parliamentary Secretary can see, first, the importance of doing this and, <Col N="331" /> secondly, the outcome of what extra investment would mean in the industry at this time, he would be able to bring the Government with him to do something really worthwhile about it.</P>
    <P>Those of us in the west do not want doles&mdash;we want a means by which we can live.  We have the raw material.  All we want is the capital investment fully to develop it.  The men who go down to sea in boats are of the best mettle that this country can produce.  They give a better output; they are not orientated to industrial strife.  They are working in a real workers' democracy, participating in the full profits of the industry and giving a better output per person than any other industry.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, even at this late hour, to dispel the uncertainty and the gloom that has settled on this as on other industries and give it the necessary impetus by investing more money in it and dispel the lack of confidence so that private enterprise will also invest greater amounts in it.</P>
    <P>It is not right to say there is a good demand for boats.  People with smaller boats are seeking larger boats in order that they may fish in deeper waters. The number of people in the industry today is less than it was two years ago. The landings for the past two years were smaller and the income to the fishermen, in spite of the inflated prices, in spite of inflation, was less.  The fishermen have just seen two bad years and they are hoping it will be only a temporary experience and they will move in again to the expansion which was beginning to manifest itself in the past. It is an expanding industry from a well-established base.  It will require more and more capital each year to permit it to expand but it is well worth any investment that can be made in it.  It is much more responsive to capital investment than any other industry that the country enjoys.  It makes the greatest contribution to the balance of payments and gives to the workers who are now enjoying better standards and better conditions a reasonably decent livelihood.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary not to look on this motion as something put down as an exercise in propaganda but as something that is calculated to provoke him to do something for the industry and enable him to give some message of hope with regard to what the Government may do for the industry in the future.</P>

      <P>In the time at my disposal, it will not be possible for me to deal with all aspects of the industry, so I must confine myself to some and leave others to another date.  I prefer to talk about the future rather than the past, and I want to say to Deputy Brennan that I do regard this as an exercise in propaganda &mdash;to build up the forlorn fortunes of Fianna Fáil.  I would not waste time in making that comment were it not for the fact that he more or less invited me to do so.

      <P>I did not interrupt anybody during his contribution. Deputy Brennan is moving off because he cannot bear to listen to facts and to factual appraisal of the position. Deputy Gallagher had great cheek to table a motion such as this, deploring &ldquo;the failure of the Government to formulate any positive policy in relation to the continued expansion of the fishing industry&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fishermen and others are more interested in what present policy is and what future policy is to be rather than what has happened in the past, but in a discussion such as this as it has travelled, it is impossible not to make comments so far as past performance is concerned.  The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the people who are critical, the Fianna Fáil Party, were in office for about 35 years, frob 1932 to 1948, from 1951 to 1954 and from 1957 to 1973.  In the records of the Department <Col N="333" /> this is their total production in so far as any papers dealing with sea fisheries are concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to express my thanks and appreciation to Deputies White and Taylor for their contributions.  They covered some of the ground regarding the availability of moneys for harbours, the fact that this money was not expended, and the fact that this Government have almost doubled the contributions towards the fisheries since they came into office two years ago.  The Deputies' contributions, despite the adverse comment of Deputy Brennan and his colleagues, were a factual appraisal of the position. Deputy Brennan was long enough in Government to do all the things he thinks should be done but did not do them.  They are now being done by this Government.</P>
    <P>I will give a partial history of the position.  Taking into account that we had a discussion on 15th April I do not want to go over any of the ground covered then.  It is all in the records. I will deal with the position obtaining at the time we came to power in March, 1973.  We found there was little or no movement towards developing fishermen's organisations or, to use EEC terms, producers' organisations. We found that Fianna Fáil did not want such as is now shaping, a fishermen's organisation, because it was easier for them to deal with splinter groups&mdash;an organisation here and there.  They were allowing this industry to tread along in its own slow way.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil took very good care&mdash; I am not in any way reflecting on the capacity of the holders of the office down the years&mdash;to appoint Parliamentary Secretaries in charge of fisheries who were far removed from the sea.  All the nominees of Fianna Fáil who dealt with our sea fisheries were Members from inland constituencies. That was deliberate on their part because of the little concern shown by the party in relation to development of the industry.</P>
    <P>I do not think there was any interest taken by the Government in so far as the development of the industry was concerned.  It was all left to the Parliamentary <Col N="334" /> Secretary to make the best job he could of it.  The more unexpended balances he had, such as those quoted in the House by Deputy Taylor, the better.  Deputy Taylor told the House, and factually so, that 66 per cent was left over one year for harbour development.  Deputy John O'Leary from South Kerry was complaining last night about all the small harbours in Kerry and south west Cork, and Deputy Gallagher complained about the harbours in Mayo. But at a time when this money was far more powerful than it is today, it was left unexpended.  I am sure the Government then, particularly the Minister for Finance, were delighted that they had a person in charge of fisheries to whom they could vote a reasonably sizeable sum of money for fisheries in the knowledge that the money would find its way back to the Exchequer unexpended.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows what would have happened if such moneys were expended. Many of the representations made by Deputies through the years would have been dealt with.  The justifiable representations and representations from local authorities such as county councils could have been executed or implemented if the Government were doing their job as they should have been doing.  The position has completely changed.  Even though I am Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and I have delegated powers in so far as fisheries are concerned I know very well&mdash;every Member of the Government Party knows&mdash;that many Members of the Government are interested in this industry.  The position does not obtain in this Government that a Member is assigned a particular office and that he forgets all other offices.  I have ample evidence of the interest not only of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Clinton, but of other senior members of the Government who are vitally interested in this industry.  As a result of their interest they have, as stated here from the Government benches, almost doubled the money taken from taxpayers' pockets towards the development of this industry.  The amount <Col N="335" /> given, £8 million, is a sizeable amount having regard to present circumstances and it is double what Fianna Fáil put into the industry in the last year of their term of office.</P>
    <P>There was no evidence that the Fianna Fáil Party while in Government were anxious that fishermen should form themselves into an organisation. The first step I took on assuming office was to meet various representatives of fishermen's associations, discuss their problems with them and advise them on the desirability and necessity of forming national organisations.  As a result of that, within the past two years, a national producers' organisation, which is so necessary and essential having regard to our membership of the EEC, will be registered in the next few days.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the organisation position is completed.  I have expressed the view in the House through the years and on assuming office two years ago that we cannot overlook the important role played by crewmen in so far as the development of our sea fisheries are concerned. The organisation about to be registered mainly consists of skippers but I want to see the crewmen&mdash;the smaller men in the industry&mdash;organised also because I am anxious that they all get their fair slice of the loaf.  I know that in some areas they are not getting that fair slice at the moment.  Any advice the crewmen need in helping them to organise and fight and look for their rights will be given.  This should be all the easier by virtue of the type of system that obtains in so far as sea fisheries are concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the share system as being the operative one covering all the Donegal coast. It should be quite easy for the crewmen to be allowed play their part in discussions and future tactics.  The crewmen should be given the same right and entitlement to examine papers and documents by virtue of being shareholders in the boats, just as the skippers have that right and entitlement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> The State is asking the taxpayer to give us so much money in every year to provide boats to enable skippers and crewmen to take to the sea and to fish.  We want to see the substantial aid which this State gives to skippers for the purchase of their boats, spread around, not only to the skippers but to crewmen also.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat here what I said just a month ago, that there is no country in the world&mdash;and that statement has not been contradicted so far by the Opposition despite all the research in which they have engaged &mdash;that gives more aid to fisheries than we do here.  I see nothing wrong in that; we are an island country.  Naturally, we are anxious to develop our fisheries, to improve our exports as far as possible.  And it is pleasing to note that the value of exports is increasing. In 1972 the figure was £7.7 million; in 1973 it was £10.6 million and, in 1974, it was £12.5 million.  We are making progress.  Everybody knows that there was a decline in price.  I would go into that in a detailed way had I the time available.  Late last year and earlier this year the same position applied where fish is concerned as applied to cattle prices late in 1974.  Fianna Fáil seem to be gleeful, taking great delight in the fact that prices are down, that we have problem and difficulties.  That is not good policy.  That is not the type of policy advocated by the Opposition parties when Fianna Fáil were in office.  The people will not accept such policies.  In the most favourable and fertile ground that Fianna Fáil have in the country, they know how far they got with the kind of tactics they adopted.  There is no need for further comment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan mentioned expansion and an endeavour to do everything possible for sea fishermen. Deputy Brennan never mentioned our salmon fisheries.  Our salmon fisheries last year netted £2.49 million, or excluding the Foyle fisheries, netted £2.33 million.  I am sure, had Fianna Fáil not been rejected in 1973, drift-net fishing here would have been abolished completely and a sizeable part of this £2 million lost by virtue <Col N="337" /> of our change in the policy advocated by Fianna Fáil, prior to the 1973 election, and set down in no uncertain terms in a circular issued by Mr. J. Gibbons, the former Minister, on the 15th of February, 1973, during the course of the election campaign.  I know what was interesting Fianna Fáil, which was that, numerically, of course, the drift-net fishermen around the coast are a very small group. There are only 995 drift-net licences issued altogether.  We had their widespread representation from all the inland areas.  I am not saying that these representations and the motives behind them were not sincere, but what they wanted to do was to wipe out the drift-net men.  As a result, we had this Order of 1972 confining the issue of less net licences to anybody unless he derived a substantial part of his livelihood from salmon fishing in previous years.  The number of people who would measure up to the criteria laid down by Fianna Fáil would be significantly small.  This was the first step as enunciated by Mr. Gibbons in his Press Release of the 15th of February, 1973, to abolish that type of fishing by endeavouring to get support for that type of activity from people, angling clubs and so on, in inland areas.  Politically, I suppose, it was good tactics on his part because there were a small number of people involved.  On the other hand, the numbers who are supposed to be interested in angling were deemed to be approximately 180,000 or 190,000 people.</P>
    <P>Despite that, this Government analysed the position carefully, diligently and closely as soon as we assumed office.  We said it was unfair to perpetrate that kind of action; undoubtedly, there was need for conservation but we would not take the extreme measures taken by Fianna Fáil, throwing a number of people, who by virtue of their way of family life over the years, were entirely dependent on fishing away from the right of entitlement to fish for salmon.</P>
    <P>Many of those drift-net men, who fish also throughout the year for other types of fish, have got good returns and big cheques into their <Col N="338" /> pockets as a result of this Government's policies; they should be very thankful to us that that is the position.</P>
    <P>It was no harm for me to mention that fact because salmon fishing constitutes approximately 27 per cent of the total value of fish landed here. We gave them the additional incentive that Fianna Fáil had taken from them, and undoubtedly would take from them were they in office. The problems confronting us are major ones.</P>
    <P>There is a complete change; we know that.  Our membership of the EEC is going to make a major change. What the Government are endeavouring to do is to get everybody associated with the industry, crewmen, skippers, fish processors, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara&mdash;and my references to BIM were rather few because of the limitation of time but that in no way takes from the fact that I agree they are doing a reasonably good job-together. We are formulating a policy which will be somewhat bulkier than the policy which Fianna Fáil formulated in their 36 years in office and as contained within the covers of that little booklet.  There was no such thing as a policy, except what was contained in that booklet, when I came into office.  In the fisheries section of the Department, I must say, the personnel are second to none; they are good workers.  But, of course, people in a Department, or working in a section must do as the Government of the day order, and the Government of the day did not play much part in the expansion of fisheries or on harbour development.</P>
    <P>I am rushing because of limitation of time, but I might mention the question of boats.  The number of larger boats in the past two years has increased by about 47 per cent or 48 per cent.  We are building the boats. We do not regard fishing as a restricted practice.  We accept that all people who wish to adopt fishing as a career, whether they live on the seashore or inland, are entitled to have their applications considered.  We are providing the training in Greencastle <Col N="339" /> school and we are providing training facilities for BIM in other centres.</P>
    <P>The aim of Government policy in relation to the sea fishing industry can be simply stated&mdash;it is to secure the expansion of the industry with all speed.  However, the scale and direction of such development should be in the long term.  The main reason for this is that at this time a number of issues of vital importance to the future of the industry not only in this country but throughout the world are awaiting decision.  They include the extension of fishery limits in the context of the Law of the Sea Conference, future programmes for the conservation of fish stocks, EEC plans for the restructuring of fishing fleets and so on.</P>
    <P>While key issues such as these remain unresolved, it is not possible to set out anything in the nature of a blueprint for the industry covering the next five or ten years.  Add to this the complexities of our situation within the EEC and you will find that it is not so easy to sit down and produce a policy like a conjurer would pull a rabbit out of a hat.  That is not how this Government intend to do it.  We are taking careful steps and at the Law of the Sea Conference, whose decisions can be so important as far as we are concerned, the Government delegated the Attorney General, Deputy Costello, to represent us there as a man who had the capacity to put our case and to argue on behalf of the fishermen and the Irish nation.  We do not take half measures.  Not only are the members of the Government involved but we have the Attorney General's help and advice at our disposal. On behalf of the fishermen of this country, I must express my thanks and appreciation for his efforts, for the detailed statements he has submitted to the Department and also for the statements he made at the Law of the Sea Conference.  We are, of course, fortunate in having within our ranks so many people with so much capacity to represent us and to do our work faithfully and well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> When listening to Deputy Gallagher yesterday, I did not know if he was sincere when he spoke about Mayo piers.  Reading some files on Mayo piers I found that they were marked &ldquo;private and confidential&rdquo; and even representations from the chairman and secretaries of the local Fianna Fáil cumainn would not get disclosures on these matters.  The idea was that if they said that there was a recommendation for the improvement of a pier in some of these cases the Government would have to find the money to repair it and, because they were not able to find the money to repair it they marked the files &ldquo;private and confidential&rdquo;. One would think it was nuclear armaments or atomic energy or a similar subject that was being considered.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as that as far as we are concerned.  All matters relating to harbours and piers and the recommendations and reports of our engineering advisers are available to the public.  The aim of this Government is to ensure that moneys voted by this Parliament will not remain unexpended, as happened under Fianna Fáil over the years.  Every penny we get from the House and from the Exchequer will be expended on desirable harbour improvement works.  That is an assurance that I have no hesitation in giving and it will be carried out.  I do not know where Deputy Gallagher got this saying &ldquo;investment lowest, potential highest&rdquo;.  Our investment is twice that of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I did not refer to conservation which is an important item.  However, I will refer to the question of the marketing of fish.  It is an exceptionally important item and time does not allow me to deal fully with it.  I can tell Deputies that we are taking special cognisance of this very vital marketing facility.  I have been at the Dublin market occasionally.  There have been some reports in this evening's papers but so far as the Department and I are concerned, these statements are completely unfounded.  We will have reports from the National Prices Commission on the price of fish.  We want to ensure that the profits made in the <Col N="341" /> resale of fish will be reasonable and fair and that our fishermen will not be exploited.</P>
    <P>The fishermen can look forward to the future with every confidence knowing that they have a Government in power who have the will and the capacity and who have given ample evidence that they intend to develop this industry in every way possible. They can be assured that so far as our dealings with the EEC are concerned &mdash;the negotiations for entry were carried out by the former Government&mdash;we will do our best to get the best bargain possible for our fishermen. I must point out that the negotiations so far as our fishermen are concerned left much to be desired.  However, that is another day's work.  I have no doubt that Dáil Éireann will not condemn the Government for their activities so far as the development of our fisheries are concerned but rather will they applaud the Government's large injection of public funds into this industry during the two short years we have been in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking in support of this motion, let me say at the outset that I have the unique distinction of being the only Member of this House who was once a full-time professional fisherman.  I do not wish on my colleagues the doubtful pleasure of that experience but it does help me and it qualifies me to speak with some authority, practical knowledge and compassion about the unfortunate fishermen engaged in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishing industry, at all times, has been the Cinderella of the economy and has been grossly neglected by successive Governments since the foundation of the State and even before that.  As far as I know, no Government, native or otherwise, saw fit to assign a separate Department and a full-time Minister to this industry which, in my opinion, should be the second, and I mean a very, very good second, industry to agriculture. Not only have they failed in giving this major industry its rightful place and proper status in the economic hierarchy but they also damaged the industry and did a great <Col N="342" /> disservice to it by placing it under the care of the Minister for Agriculture and giving him responsibility for it.  To my mind, this was a marriage of inconvenience, a marriage which inevitably bred problems.  There was a conflict of interests inevitably between two industries which were managed by the one Minister, where there was bound to be trouble as to the making of policy, to the allocation of moneys, staff and so on.  That was a fatal mistake on the part of all the Governments.  There was an exception to this, I understand, some time in the twenties, when Fisheries was linked to, I think, Lands, and I am told that during that period there was growth and development and a certain measure of prosperity within the industry.</P>
    <P>A clash of interests and a clash of personalities is inevitable in a situation where you have the one Minister dealing with two disparate economies. In a contest like this the Goliath, agriculture, is bound to win against the David, fisheries.  This happened time and again and recently we had the meagre, visible, couple of million pounds which was doled out by the Parliamentary Secretary to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, in comparison with the massive amounts given to agriculture at all times.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries have been notoriously antipathetic where fishing is concerned. They have been unenlightened about the industry and very often they have been quite ignorant about fishery matters and especially&mdash;and I should like to stress this&mdash;about the philosophy and the outlook of fishermen and the conditions under which they lived.  Most of these Ministers were farmers or farmer-orientated and in all cases they left the onerous task of dealing with the fishery industry to their Parliamentary Secretaries who, of course, with few exceptions, were equally ill-equipped to deal with the task.  The Parliamentary Secretary who is present now demonstrated this himself quite recently.  He spoke about the concern of members of the Government and of members of the Cabinet for the fishermen and the <Col N="343" /> fishing industry.  Recently in this House, in reply to a question put down by Deputy R.P. Burke and myself requesting that fuel for fishing boats should be subsidised, he replied that this was out of the question because of the enormous profits made by fishermen during the past year or two during the regime of the present Administration.  He was pressed on this matter by myself, by Deputy Brennan and Deputy R.P. Burke, and he admitted, under pressure, that this was his own decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no pressure on me to state that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>He confessed and he had the honesty and the courage to state that he never referred this matter to the Cabinet or to any Minister. That is a sad indictment of collective Coalition open Government.  When the fishermen were marching up and down the town here the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries admitted that he himself, off his own bat, made the decision that fuel for fishing vessels should not and need not be subsidised and that is on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from being the poor relation of the Ministry of Agriculture, there are many other reasons why the fishing industry has been neglected over the years.  One, of course, is the failure of the public as well as the politicians and the civil servants, to grasp the full extent of the importance and the real potential of this industry.  In recent years and months we have had a lot of excitement and ballyhoo about gas and oil finds and mineral wealth which we have in and off this country but there was not a word about the vast and rich harvest which we have in our seas. I advisedly and emphatically use the word &ldquo;harvest&rdquo; because fish does not have to be hoed or sowed or harrowed or reaped; it has just to be caught and to be eaten.  Our fishing resources&mdash; probably the richest in the world&mdash;are well known to others.  They may not be well known to the Parliamentary Secretary or to his Department, but they are well known to others.  It is known to our neighbours in the EEC, <Col N="344" /> to the Russians, to the Spaniards and to the Portuguese, who, having denuded their own fishing grounds of fish life, find our territorial waters a happy hunting and a happy poaching ground with what appears to everybody as impunity, judging by the number of these foreign trawlers which have been captured in the past year or so.  It is a fact well known also to neighbours nearer home.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the middlemen in the industry who were referred to last night by Deputy Gallagher.  There are more middlemen in the fishing industry than in any other business or trade that I know.  These people who deal in and handle the fish from the net to the tank, have over the years coolly and incessantly exploited the unfortunate fishermen.</P>
    <P>I would like now to make some suggestions which might be helpful to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I suggest there should be a separate Ministry for Fisheries having responsibility for fisheries and for the ancillary industries which arise out of fishing, like canning, processing and so on.  There should be adequate suplies of gear, ropes, equipment, spare parts and service depots in suitable areas.  There should be bigger and better boats.  The fishermen deserve a new deal.  It is about time they got it and they should get it from this Government now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I am amazed at and appalled by the attitude adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary and the speaker from the Government side of the House in relation to this motion.  I want to say quite categorically that this motion was not put down for any propaganda on my part or on the part of the people on this side of the House.  Last night I outlined clearly the reasons for putting down this motion.  They can be summed up very briefly: one is to try to show the importance of this industry to the economy if properly exploited and, secondly, to indicate how important it is for us to ensure that by the time the Treaty of Accession comes up for renewal in 1983 we are in a position to state to the other member nations of the EEC <Col N="345" /> that we are geared to exploit our own waters.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the Parliamentary Secretary has made no study of the necessity of taking cognisance of all the things that are involved.  We had from various speakers on the other side of the House a list of trivial matters which were hardly worth referring to; for instance, Deputy White mentioned Killybegs and the expansion of Killybegs.  He stated that Killybegs was the fastest expanding town in his constituency.  This is exactly the reason we have put down this motion.</P>
      <P>We want to have more towns like Killybegs to avail of the prosperity that can be generated from this industry. One would imagine it was a shanty town that had sprung up overnight or over the last two years. Deputy White is not codding anybody when he talks like that.  If he is so satisfied with the state of the fishing industry in Burtonport and Killybegs, I hope he will go down and tell the fishermen in Burtonport and Killybegs that he is so satisfied.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Taylor to grants which were made available to the IAOS to form a secretariat for the fishermen.  This has been the position for quite a long time.  As a matter of fact, I was on the deputation to the then Minister when this thing was arranged.  I was on the board which was appointed by the IAOS to select a man for this position.  It is absolute humbug to come in here wasting the time of the House with this kind of waffle.  We are looking forward to something better than that from the Government. They should try to show some responsibility in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy White mentioned grants from Roinn na Gaeltachta for boats. The position about Roinn na Gaeltachta grants until quite recently was that, in order to qualify for a grant, Bord Iascaigh Mhara would have to accept a 5 per cent deposit from a fisherman.  If the board were satisfied that a fisherman was in a position to pay more than a 5 per cent deposit for his boat he did not qualify for a grant from Roinn na Gaeltachta <Col N="346" /> because he was in a position to put down a greater deposit.  However, the fisherman who qualified was entitled to a grant of 80 per cent of that 5 per cent.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht, the man who gets all the headlines for the wonderful things he is doing for the Gaeltacht, has put a ceiling of £4,000 on the deposit a fisherman in the Gaeltacht buying a boat may now get from his Department. Up to recently he could get 80 per cent of the 5 per cent deposit he put down on his boat.</P>
    <P>Anyone with common sense realises that there are times when it will be necessary for a Department to return moneys because of the system we operate.  Recently here I made reference to this when speaking about the fisheries situation.  Because of the setup we have at the moment, where the Board of Works carry out the work on behalf of the Department of Fisheries, we know that very often they are not able to have things ready in time.  Once money is made available for a job, trial borings have to be done, various engineering works have to be done, and surveys have to be carried out.  This can take four to five years.  We have a situation in north Mayo where Ballyglass has been on the mat for quite some time.</P>
    <P>A great deal of talk and political capital has been made out of the fact that the present Taoiseach went to Rossaveal to start works there.  We know quite well all this had been gone into; a second contractor had come on the scene at that stage because the first contractor was not in a position to take on the works for which he tendered.  There are matters of this kind which invariably mean that sums will have to be returned.  I have at present in my own constituency a case where money has been allocated for a harbour and where the Parliamentary Secretary in reply to a Dáil Question stated that the works will start by 1976 even though it has been sanctioned for quite some time.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that at a time when there are extra moneys available to the Government from the various EEC funds they would come along and say they have a programme <Col N="347" /> for fisheries and are prepared to expand the industry.  We have the FEOGA fund; we have the regional fund; we have the social fund.  These are all funds which can be used by the Government.  We understand that moneys are available if plans are prepared. It is necessary to prepare plans, very detailed plans, in order to gain the best benefit from these funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are just sitting down and doing nothing. They keep going back and telling us what Fianna Fáil did in office.  I will admit I was not satisfied with Fianna Fáil's investment in fisheries while they were in Government.  But I do think having reached, as I said last night, stage one with regard to the development of the building of boats and harbours that he must now take a look at the next stage of the industry. I believe it is necessary to have <Col N="348" /> some planning.  We cannot expect an industry, which is taken on a day-to-day basis, to make any real progress unless we have advance planning by the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary.  The industry is a very, very important one to this economy.</P>
      <P>As has been stated by Deputy Brosnan and others it should be the next industry in line to agriculture and should not be left to lag behind as it has been in the past. I would have thought that the Parliamentary Secretary, who was so critical of his predecessors&mdash;he more or less described them as land runners&mdash;being a man coming from the coast would have some breath of fresh air to bring into this House in relation to the expansion of the industry.  I fail to see how the Government can oppose a motion of this kind and I fail to see how a Government, with responsibility to such an important industry, could go into the division lobbies to oppose such a motion.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Capital Gains Tax Bill, 1974: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 24, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rightly pointed out that there are two sides to this.  He was perfectly right when he pointed out losses and I hope he will not charge me with inconsistency if I point to another aspect, having said before 6 o'clock that, perhaps, this was an encouragement to invest in State funds.  That statement must be qualified by &ldquo;in part&rdquo; and, furthermore, the Minister's drawing my attention to the fact that it cuts both ways brings me to make the following point.  This section would cover, for instance, the issue of a government loan, I take it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Heretofore it has been fairly standard practice to, say, issue a loan probably at a fair market percentage and a small discount.  The loan would very often rapidly appreciate. Say you issued a loan at 98, if the terms were favourable you might find it temporarily going up to 100 or 101.  I can see the Minister making the point that we do not want to have any gambling in this, that a person might buy in at 98 and then get out at 101.  I believe the market would regulate itself.</P>
      <P>The more serious aspect of the exclusion of such a loan as a capital asset is that in a period of rampant inflation, and inflation is very largely an international problem aggravated by a local problem&mdash;we forget the local problem&mdash;and inflation is something that is very much there, anything of fixed value and a fixed interest fund is bound to depreciate rather rapidly.  That will entail a fairly large capital loss I imagine and I wonder if it is altogether fair to exclude such funds as capital assets.  I am forced to revise, where that type of fund is concerned, the suggestion I made before the debate was adjourned that this section would be an incentive.  If the Minister cares to argue against me that it is a disincentive I might have to capitulate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been argued from opposite that property being taxed is a disincentive to investment. <Col N="351" /> If that holds good, then that disincentive would not apply in respect of Government securities by virtue of section 24.  Of course, in the market place Government securities, like any other securities, can vary in value. The most recent experience is that they have been appreciating rather than depreciating but, taking one period with another, Government securities are valuable things to hold. Profits can be made from them but that will not be caught within the capital gains code.  People buying into Government securities today, when the market is far from being on top, could make a very handsome capital gain and not be required to pay tax on it.  That, therefore, would be the incentive to which Deputy de Valera referred earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Minister to subsection (4) (b):</P>
      <P>an annuity granted otherwise than under a contract for a deferred annuity by a company as part of its business of granting annuities on human life, whether or not including instalments of capital.</P>
      <P>Such annuities are according to sub-section (4) not chargeable gains. Could the Minister tell me why the exclusion &ldquo;otherwise than under a contract for a deferred annuity&rdquo;? Would a contract entered into by a self-employed person with an assurance company for what is from his point of view a pension be a contract for a deferred annuity which would be excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to section 20 subsection (1).  That deals specifically with life assurance and deferred annuities on the life of any person.  We are providing in this section that no chargeable gains shall accrue on the disposal of rights to an annuity granted otherwise than under a contract for a deferred annuity by a company as part of its business of granting annuities on human life, whether or not including instalments of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but is there some contradiction between section 20 <Col N="352" /> subsection (1) and this subsection, or what is the purpose of the exclusion in this case of a contract for a deferred annuity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 20, as I have said, deals with the annuity of the type to which Deputy Colley refers and which is already specifically exempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Then why the reference here to a contract for a deferred annuity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an annuity otherwise than under a contract by a company as part of its business of granting annuities on human life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  In other words, a contract for a deferred annuity entered into with an assurance company would get the benefit?  The only thing that is being excluded here is a contract for a deferred annuity that is entered into, say, with a private individual, not with an assurance company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  Presumably the reason for that is that it is open to abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as section 24 subsection (2) paragraph (c) is concerned, do I understand this to mean <Col N="353" /> that a sum obtained by way of compensation or damages for injuries sustained by an individual's property is subject to this tax and, if so, is that not unreasonable if the purpose of the damages is simply to restore him to his pre-accident situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the compensation in those circumstances is reinstated in an asset similar to the property destroyed then no gain would arise. Otherwise, it would be treated as a disposal.  That does not arise here. This deals purely with the question of compensation in respect of injuries to a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>But, by virtue of the fact that it excludes references to property, is there not an implication, reading this subsection on its own, that damages received as compensation for injury to property&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a separate section which deals with damage done to property and the reinvestment of compensation.  We have already dealt with that.  It is section 8 subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it comes up again in one of the Schedules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 24 sub-section (1) paragraph (b), do I understand the position to be that if somebody buys Government securities and makes a loss, he cannot set off that loss against his other assets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be fundamental to capital gains legislation that if gains are not taxable, losses in similar circumstances are not allowable either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not feel that this discouragement of investment in Government securities in view of the fact that most people who bought them from time to time have suffered heavy losses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I would advise them to hold on to them, to wait <Col N="354" /> until the market improved.  If anybody in 1974 had the wit to ignore Fianna Fáil's advice they would have made an appreciable capital gain on such Government securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like land bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had had the good fortune in his practice or otherwise to have been landed with a load of paper that goes in the name of land bonds&mdash;I know some people who got last week a load of paper with the name &ldquo;land bonds 1974, 12½ per cent&rdquo; for land that was taken off them in December 1974&mdash;and if he went to his stock broker yesterday with them and was told that the best price that could be got for them, on the Dublin Stock Exchange, if he could get anybody to buy them&mdash;and nobody will buy the rubbish except the Government stock broker&mdash;is £81.50, would the Minister not feel that it is somewhat unfair in those circumstances that a person has to stand a capital loss of 18½ per cent on the very day that he got the wretched things?  Is there not some justification in those circumstances for allowing him for the very serious loss that he is suffering in having to take land bonds that are currently being doled out by the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an argument against the system of compensating people for land bought under the Land Acts.  The Deputy's colleagues issued more land bonds than have been issued by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally.  We were in office for a great deal longer than the Minister was and the problem of inflation was not nearly as acute, as the Minister knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister also aware that when land bonds were issued in previous years they were standing at or very close to par?  On the very day they are issued now they are being traded in on the Dublin Stock Exchange at £81.50 or £81.75.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would care to open any of the newspapers <Col N="355" /> today he would find that 12½ per cent land bonds were traded in on the Dublin Stock Exchange at £81.50 to £81.75. I know the Minister does not care a rap for the misfortunate people who have to take them and who have to suffer an enormous loss after having their land confiscated.</P>
      <P>Apart from land bonds, so far as ordinary Government securities are concerned, securities issued some years ago&mdash;perhaps as recently as six or seven years ago when the going rate of interest was 6½ or 7 per cent&mdash;are now standing at figures ranging from £55 to £60 with a consequential capital loss of £40 to £45 on every £100.  If those people are not able to take the Minister's cynical advice that they should keep the bonds or the securities until such time as they mature 20 years hence, or whenever, because of the economic situation in which the country is, and in which so many individuals are, they have to sell them at a capital loss of 45 per cent or more.  Does the Minister not feel that the enormous losses which they suffer through having to sell such securities at such bad prices should be offset by allowing them to be put against any gain they might make on the sale of more useful or lucrative securities than Government loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before that idea could be entertained you would have to make gains on Government securities taxable.  You could not introduce the idea of allowing losses to be set off if gains were not taxable as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could exclude land bonds from this and let them claim the gains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the problems which arises from the interlinking of all this legislation. There are two separate issues here. One is the question of land bonds which Deputy O'Malley raised and the separate issue he raised about Government securities.  He made the point much more precisely than I did when he adverted to it earlier.  The <Col N="356" /> Minister will recollect that on another occasion recently the question of land bonds was raised.  It would be totally irrelevant to go into the details.  Here is a very strong case for excepting land bonds from this list.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley has just made the very important suggestion that this problem could be met by the Minister by omitting the paragraph which specifies land bonds.  I wonder is that in itself sufficient.  One would have to be careful to ensure that it was not captured, so to speak, by something else, possibly by section 24 (1) (c) or by some general provision elsewhere in the section.  I wonder would the Minister consider that because there is obviously a very specific case here.  I suggest that he should consult with his appropriate colleague in the Government.  All our legislation becomes very much intertwined in matters of this nature.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned the history of Government securities and capital losses.  The Minister said you would have to charge capital gains on Government securities if you were to allow for losses.  Suppose we accept that.  The probability of losses on securities of the nature mentioned by Deputy O'Malley is infinitely greater than the probability of gains.  The blocking of what you might call a quick take at the point of issue is only blocking the speculator, not the investor.  I mentioned the case where there was a favourable float and a temporary appreciation, and that is the only likely time at which a gain can occur.  It is a speculator who will be involved rather than a <i>bona fide</i> investor.  I, for one, would not object very much to taxing that gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of compensation, or a pension, or a gratuity, where there is a question of a genuine investment in Government funds which are supposed to be safest and best, the situation is different.  There is a rapid deterioration, not through any loss of reputation by the State or the Government, but through the inevitable action of inflation due to two factors also mentioned by Deputy O'Malley, the inflation in money values and the consequent depreciation <Col N="357" /> of any settled sum, which is your capital, coupled with the inflation of interest rates.  These two things conspire to mark down the stock and this means a considerable capital loss.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister can very easily tell me that is not how I started off. We are here in Committee to examine the possibilities and the Minister and the Opposition often change their point of view in the face of argument. I must confess that having started one way I feel myself coerced by the arguments of Deputy Colley and Deputy O'Malley to change my view. I earnestly recommend to the Minister that he should consider what is to be gained&mdash;that is a pun&mdash;from the point of view of the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners by having this section in the Bill and what is to be lost by removing it.</P>
    <P>Prize bonds, of course, are a problem in themselves.  They are a fixed payment at a particular time.  How the fund goes is the Minister's problem, in a sense.  I am thinking in terms of the individual taxpayer, the citizen, rather than the Government. Whether it is prize bonds or land bonds or any of the things listed here, perhaps there could be a revision of that list following another look at whether such a section should be in the Bill at all.  This might be a useful exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have followed well established practice in relation to Government securities not just in Ireland but elsewhere.  I certainly do not mind considering the matter in greater depth but we are satisfied that, on balance, this operates to the benefit of the investor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that the Minister says he has followed standard practice.  I do not doubt that for a moment.  As Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, standard practice is now irrelevant to a large extent.  There was a time when standard practice was very relevant because of stability.  Here we have an absolutely unstable moving situation which is affecting us not only here but in the whole environment and therefore it is not likely to be brought under <Col N="358" /> control quickly.  We do not quite know in what direction it will go, so that the plea of relying on standard practice leads me to ask the Minister to consider whether maybe this is not the time to ask the question: &ldquo;Do we depart or should be depart from standard practice?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but remember that if we follow the pattern elsewhere, as I am sure we will, the rate of inflation will decline and that will mean in that situation capital gains on Government securities compared with their current prices, so that the very amendment sought here might operate to the disadvantage of investors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Land bonds are in a particular situation or are a particular category of Government securities in which it is virtually impossible for anybody ever to make a capital gain. Everyone who has ever had the misfortune to hold land bonds of any kind loses and loses heavily on them. Can they not be excluded in view of the fact that there is no possibility of a capital gain?  The people who get them invariably do not want them but are lumbered with them because this is the method of payment.  The people who are inflicted with them are people who had a valuable asset which in the normal course of events was growing in value every year and instead they are given a paper asset which declines in value every year.  Everybody who holds them loses on them.  They are to a great extent irredeemable, so that the question of waiting until they become redeemed is just not on for most people.  Could they in those circumstances not be excepted from this <Col N="359" /> Bill at least to the extent that losses sustained on them would be allowable against any capital gains made elsewhere in a particular year?</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should understand that nobody voluntarily buys land bonds but they are doled out with these things by the Land Commission against their will.  One does not buy them and in spite of the fact that one does not buy them and does not want them and that one makes a huge loss on them every year one holds them, still they are not allowable against any other gains you might make.  Surely it is only equitable that because the system here demands that some people who have land taken from them by the Land Commission have to be paid in these virtually non-negotiable pieces of paper the heavy losses they sustain should be recognised by the State for the purpose, if not of relieving them directly of tax, of offsetting some other or any other capital gains which they might be fortunate enough to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really opening a land bond debate again on a Bill which by this clause is not treating them in any different way from the way they are now treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no answer to the point put.  We all know that they are wrong and want to see an end to them but we are faced with the fact that, unfortunately, many people hold millions of pounds worth in paper of these things and are losing money with every week that passes.  Why should they not get some relief?  We are not asking that they should be exempt from capital gains tax.  All we are asking is that the Minister recognise the reality of the situation, that they entail, invariably and constantly, for the people unfortunate enough to have them a continuing annual loss and that loss should be allowed against any other capital gain in the year that the person concerned might be fortunate enough to make.  It is very unfair that if a man loses £2,000 on land bonds in a particular year and makes a gain of £1,000 on some other form of security, he should have to pay <Col N="360" /> tax on the £1,000 gain and get no relief and can offset in no way the £2,000 loss which he makes through no fault of his own.</P>
      <P>Again, I would remind the Minister that land bonds are not bought by individuals as speculative ventures. They are inflicted on unfortunate individuals against their will by the Land Commission and they are quite distinct from any other Government security because any person in the State is free to go out and buy a Government security if he wants to, but nobody buys land bonds, but many people get inflicted with a lot of them every year and suffer very heavily as a result.  There is the example I have given of someone to my knowledge being given within the last few days 12½ per cent land bonds in payment for land taken from him last December because the Land Commission allege that it is the date of acquisition of the land which is the relevant date and that the new bonds were not in operation in December, 1974, with the result that this person is given bonds which are worth £81.50 or £81.75, less commission, if you can sell them at all.  If there was any case of downright blatant confiscation of property, that is it, when you are given pieces of paper in payment for your valuable asset which on the very day you are given them are worth almost 20 per cent less than what your land was valued, and judicially valued in many cases.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has said, we could stray into another area here but the Chair and the Minister will bear with me if I point out another possibility to reinforce Deputy O'Malley's argument.  The Wealth Tax Bill will be coming and I think we have to have regard to that fact, because if we start here without looking at this whole thing together the House may find itself tied either in complexity or contradicton.  The suggestion I would like to make is this: take land bonds clean out of this category as Deputy O'Malley suggests and consider them absolutely separately, if necessary, by a separate Act, and let normality take its course in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> It does not seem very difficult to justify that a specific case where it is, as one might say, mathematically certain that substantial losses are going to be incurred that would normally if it were any other type of investment qualify as a compensation where capital gains are concerned under the Act anywhere else, should be singled out specifically as it is in this section.  It is not that this is an accidental consequence of a general provision in a section.  It is that there is a paragraph (c) of the first subsection specifically dealing with this and in actual fact, imposing, to use Deputy O'Malley's word, unfairly a penalty on the holders of these bonds who, as he points out, were unwilling recipients in the first place.</P>
    <P>With that in mind, I would urge strongly on the Minister that he take the initiative himself to eliminate land bonds, if only these in this paragraph, from the section and divorce them from the rest of the discussion and, if necessary, deal with the question of land bonds as a whole with his colleague on another occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>It is not a penalty. They would not be charged to gains and, therefore, losses are not available either.  With interest rates falling as interest rates are falling now, gains are more likely in the foreseeable future than losses.  Land bonds are part and parcel of the Government money market and they cannot be distinguished. Essentially their nature is that of being a Government security and they cannot be treated, fundamentally, in any <Col N="362" /> different way.  If there are arguments about the rates of interest, the surrender value and so on of land bonds that is a matter for consideration in the realm of land bonds itself and we had a full debate in the House recently about them.  With respect, it does not fall for consideration here. The only reason why this debate has taken place is that we are treating them, as we must necessarily, as part and parcel of the securities issued by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister is saying and I accept his approach but it is not irrelevant to point out that land bonds are such an exceptional thing that they should be taken out of the Act and dealt with separately.  We cannot pursue that now but we can say on the section that if that is what we are advocating the first step is not to have them referred to in the section.  Secondly, land bonds are different from the rest of Government securities so that the Minister's argument, though formally justifiable and correct, I submit&mdash;I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister&mdash;is a trifle specious when applied to land bonds because they are not voluntarily bought.  A State loan is voluntarily bought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land bonds have depreciated and there is no profitable market in them. They are likely to attract considerable capital losses.  Although the Minister is correct in what he is saying, the equitable fact is that the holders of these bonds will, pending a revision of the system, be the sufferers of capital losses.  Had land bonds been in any other form of capital other than State capital such losses would have been taken into account as a contra where capital gains are concerned. It is in this sense that I say that the land bond holders are being penalised.  I accept that the Minister is exempting land bonds but, in doing so, he is exempting them as a chargeable asset and the factual position is that in practice it operates as a penalty. My submission is that land bonds are such a peculiar category that it would be better to take them out of this legislation, put them aside and deal with them in a short Bill.  Of <Col N="363" /> course, that would mean dealing with the Minister's colleague.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that this section was an exempting section but it is not in so far as land bonds are concerned.  It simply provides that they, among other things, shall not be a chargeable asset.  We are not asking that any profit that anyone might make on land bonds, which is unlikely, should be exempt from capital gains tax.  That is purely an academic point because no one can make a profit on them unless one happens to hold them at the time they are drawn for redemption.  I have been suggesting that heavy losses on them are inevitable because they are issued at a time and in a way that their very issue causes a loss, as I demonstrated, at present of almost 20 per cent in the value of land acquired by the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Because nobody voluntarily acquires land bonds but has them inflicted upon him compulsorily in these circumstances it would only be equitable, not that they be exempt from this tax, but that the inevitable losses that would be suffered on them would be offsetable against capital gains on some other property or securities which that person might be fortunate enough to make in the same year.  I do not think that is too much to ask. It is incorrect for the Minister to say that land bonds are just part of the ordinary Government securities; they are not.  They are totally different.  Nobody is compelled to buy national loans, Exchequer stock or conversion stock.  If one acquires them one does so of one's own choice.  One pays the money and takes the chance.  Good luck to the person who can make a profit on that but it is unlikely that one will.  However, land bonds are totally different.  Nobody voluntarily acquires them; they are inflicted on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister has any sense of fair play left in him, he should look into the position of people who this week are getting £50,000, £60,000, and £70,000 nominally of 12½ per cent land bonds, which are being sold on <Col N="364" /> the Dublin Stock Exchange at £81.50 and £81.75.  It should be remembered that the person who owns land has the constitutional right to appeal to a judge of the High Court if he is dissatisfied with the price and to have that price fixed by the High Court ultimately.  The High Court in fixing that price fix the price that in its opinion is the value of the land.  If the court fix a price of £50,000 as being the value of the land the court take for granted and assume that the owner of the land would be paid £50,000.</P>
    <P>Our land bond legislation and this whole system never envisaged the situation we have today, that a man whose farm is valued at £50,000 is handed £50,000 worth of land bonds and the value of each bond, if one could sell them and one can only sell a small quantity at a time, is £81.50 and £81.75 and dropping.  I doubt if the Constitution envisaged such a situation. Certainly the High Court judge in fixing the price on appeal did not envisage that if he fixed the price at £50,000 the person concerned would be paid £40,000 which is, in effect, what is happening now.  I venture to think that if the judge who fixed the price in the cases talked about in early 1974 knew that this would happen instead of valuing a particular farm at £50,000 he would have valued it at £60,000 or £65,000 in order to allow for the serious drop that was going to take place.  It may be that the judge would be precluded from doing that; that he would have to assume that land bonds would be issued with a value close to par.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister once again, if he has any sense of fair play left in him&mdash;and I often wonder since he changed sides in this House whether he has&mdash;would he take account of this situation?  As Deputy de Valera has said, it is quite different from the ordinary Government securities. The arguments that might or might not be valid in relation to them do not apply to these land bonds which I would emphasise again no private individual in this country acquires voluntarily.  In every case they are imposed on him by the Land <Col N="365" /> Commission.  I have never seen anyone anxious to get paid in land bonds; a person will always say: could we be paid in cash?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider seriously accepting what Deputy O'Malley has said because it is one thing about which I know a lot.  Nobody accepts them; they are forced upon them.  Deputy O'Malley mentioned a percentage of 12½ but there are land bonds at present being sold at 30 per cent, old land bonds, because there is no guarantee given at all.  They may be for years and they may be forever.  They are different from any other State loan.  It is because the land is acquired compulsorily that they are paid in land bonds.  The price for the land is settled in the High Court and supposed to be the genuine price of the land.  Even taking 12½ per cent bonds into consideration, that amounts to 80 per cent of the price of the land only.  Therefore, an exemption for them is not sufficient.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House but I wanted to add my voice in support of that aspect because I know a lot about land bonds.  Land bonds should be taken out of it altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has been made so convincingly by my colleagues I do not need to repeat it.  There are practical steps which could be taken which I should like to suggest to the Minister.  There are two separate issues involved here.  I shall deal with the first, which is the issue of land bonds.  That is a separate, distinct issue which was raised by Deputy Colley earlier, by Deputy O'Malley in detail here this evening and supported by Deputy Callanan.  Having grasped what is the case we want to investigate what should be done about it.  Obviously what should be done is to allow land bonds fall into the category of general capital, treated for capital gains the same as any other form of capital and let gains and losses be taken on their chances on land bonds. In other words, it means excluding it from the section.  We are not asking for any specific treatment for land bonds, we are asking for the <Col N="366" /> removal of a specific treatment of land bonds.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister's difficulties when this type of argument develops and I will give him credit that he wants to do the right thing and to help in this respect.  A very simple amendment would meet that case, provided the section stood.  Suppose he had only sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) in subsection (1) of section 24; delete the italic (c) and continue (b) as follows: &ldquo;other than&rdquo;.  In other words, after the figures 1965 in subparagraph (b) insert the words &ldquo;other than&rdquo;, when subsection (b) would read:</P>
      <P>securities issued by the Minister for Finance under section 4 of the Central Fund Act, other than</P>
      <P>&mdash;if you like&mdash;&ldquo;other Government securities&rdquo;</P>
      <P>land bonds issued by the Minister for Finance under section 4 . . .</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be done if there was any trap.  I was worried that there might be a residuary trap in the rest of the section. But, as Deputy O'Malley has just said, it can be dropped, though I was trying to safeguard against what I might call a residuary capture.  It is quite obvious that the intention is to capture Government securities by the section.  Technically the Minister is correct in his argument.  Technically, I suppose, land bonds would come into that general category.  Perhaps the Minister could see his way to doing this which would be an equitable act but would not be a large administrative or drafting job.  I would strongly urge it on the Minister for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 25 states:</P>
      <P>(1)  This section applies to a gain accruing to an individual on the disposal of, or of an interest in&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a dwelling-house or part of a dwelling-house which is, or has been occupied by him as his only or main residence, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> (b)  land which he has for his own occupation and enjoyment with that residence as its garden or grounds up to an area (exclusive of the site of the dwelling-house) not exceeding one acre:</P>
    <P>The rest of the section provides for the circumstances under which there will be no chargeable gain in respect of such an interest, namely, a dwelling house with one acre.  The section also states:</P>
    <P>Provided that where part of the land occupied with a residence is and part is not within this sub-section, then that part shall be taken to be within this subsection which, if the remainder were separately occupied, would be the most suitable for occupation and enjoyment with the residence.</P>
    <P>The Minister is saying the one acre must be the land surrounding the house.  Having regard to the specific descriptions in paragraphs (a) and (b), I should like confirmation that if a man has a house and two acres he will get exemption for the house and for one acre and that only the surplus residue will attract the gain.  I do not know if I am correct in that assumption and I should like the Minister to clarify the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be unduly contentious but it is worth recalling that when the White Paper was issued originally it was intended not to exempt private residences but to apply a certain threshold.  I regarded that as a most misguided approach and anti-social and in my immediate comment on the White Paper I made a strong point in that regard.  For that reason I welcome the fact that this relief is provided in the section.  However, there are other matters arising&mdash;admittedly they are more peripheral&mdash;that the Minister might, with advantage, consider since he has found it possible to take the major step involved in this section, as distinct from what was in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> I understand there is a provision in the British legislation that might commend itself to the Minister in relation to the private residence. Where a residence is provided free by a taxpayer for a dependent relative it is added to the special relief in addition to the principal residence. There cannot be many such cases but the arrangement makes sense and it is equitable that it be done.  I stress it is only in the case of a dependent relative, which would clearly prevent abuse of such a provision.  I mentioned this on Second Stage and I should like to hear the Minister's views on inserting such a provision in the section.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is another provision in the British legislation that might also commend itself to the Minister.  I confess freely I have some reservations about it on general principles but in a difficult situation it may be the only way to approach it. in the British legislation I understand there is a provision relating to the area surrounding a house, somewhat on the following lines: &ldquo;such larger area as the commissioners may in any case determine&rdquo;.  My objection to that in principle is that it may be too wide and may give too wide a power to the Revenue Commissioners.  However, the idea seems to have something to commend it and I should like to hear the Minister's reaction to this point.  I wish to raise other points on the section but it might be as well to let the Minister deal with this matter before I proceed further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If one takes the case of a house and one acre plus a margin of land beyond, that land may not have much market value because it may be too small or it may be scrubland or rock.  However, it may enhance the value of the house because it may make it more remote or give it a certain setting.  The additional land may not have much market value and in that case the Revenue Commissioners will not be concerned with trifles.  However, the extra land may have a significant value&mdash;in an urban area it might have a considerable value&mdash;and if one goes beyond that one is getting into the <Col N="371" /> realm of land that might have an exceedingly high value.</P>
      <P>The weight of criticism in relation to this section has been against the generosity of the exemptions which is not bound in any way by the value of the principal private residence or the number of acres that residence could cover.  I do not think there is any element of meanness so far as the Exchequer is concerned with regard to this relief.</P>
      <P>With regard to the dependent relative, I would be prepared to examine that point further.  As Deputy Colley pointed out, the number of such cases would be quite few and the number of cases where capital gains would be made on the disposal of a residence for a dependent relative would be even fewer because in that case the disposal would be by the person who owned the asset.  In most cases a person would not dispose of an asset made available for a dependent relative unless that relative moved into an institution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us take the case of a residence and one-and-a-half acres.  Capital gains will arise only on disposal but suppose that the whole lot is sold as one item, on what basis will the exemption be computed? The house occupies less than one acre.  The Minister has assured us that the house and an acre is exempt, that it will be the half acre that will be taxable but how is the gain computed in respect of the half acre?  Is it taken as a third of the entire lot?  That would defeat the idea that a house and an acre would be exempt because in such computation there would be no allowance for the house.  Therefore, some type of mechanics of evaluation must be invoked here.  Has this aspect been explored?</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Deputy is dealing with an auctioneer's advertisement which refers to a house standing on one-and-a-half acres but that will not be the way in which the Valuation Office will consider it.  They will look at the house and the land around it and that may be 1.2 or 1.4 acres, depending on the ground covered by the house.  All they will do is take the fraction of land left after allowance has been made for the house and one acre.  The remainder would be valued on local site value for capital gains tax purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (10) ensures that exemption is not to apply where a house was acquired wholly or partly for the purpose of realising a gain and the same principle is to apply in relation to such gains as are attributable to any further expenditure on property incurred with the object of making a gain.  In other words, if it is a business as distinct from a roof over a family, it would not qualify for exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet, in order to qualify it has to be the taxpayer's principal residence.  It seems to me that what is being said here is that if a house was purchased for the purpose of making a gain or if expenditure was incurred in respect of the house by the taxpayer for the purpose of making a gain, although it is his principal residence, the relief in this section will not apply.  At the very least it seems that in such circumstances the onus of proof should rest with the Revenue Commissioners and not with the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us put it this way: the onus would be on the Revenue Commissioners to establish their right to tax in the event of a person being aggrieved by a demand for tax. One could visualise a situation in which a person might acquire a large office block and occupy it or claim to be occupying it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is not beyond the capacity of some people to dream up far-fetched schemes and to put them into operation.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister tell us what sort of gain or acquisition is envisaged in subsection (10) because the drafting of the subsection is very broad and, leaving out the nonessentials, one could read it as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section shall not apply in relation to a gain if the acquisition of the dwelling house was made partly for the purpose of <Col N="376" /> realising a gain from the disposal of it.</P>
    <P>Virtually every house bought in the last 25 to 30 years as a private residence is included because everyone had as a part of his motive in buying a house the ultimate hope&mdash;indeed, assurance in recent years&mdash;that on selling it he would realise a gain from the disposal of it.  That is inevitable, times being what they are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a gain in terms of the Bill.  It would not be a real gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Inflation would, of course, take the reality out of the gain but in terms of a gain as defined in this Bill, without any allowance for inflation, which the Minister has so persistently refused to make, it would seem to me on the wording of this subsection that virtually every main private residence bought within the last 25 years does not get the relief.  To me, that is unacceptable because the Revenue Commissioners or the inspector of taxes, if so disposed, could argue that virtually every house bought as a main private residence was bought purely for the purpose of realising a gain from the disposal of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago&mdash;I do not think it is there now because the grants are not worth it; they are too small now &mdash;when in real terms the grants were far more generous than they are now, there was a tradition of people buying houses, going into them, getting the grants and rates remission and going out again after about three years and going into another house. The grants have not been increased now for several years and they are worth little or nothing and so people do not do that any more.  Would a person in that situation not clearly forfeit the relief given here?  Indeed, someone who acted not as blatantly or obviously as that but decided to buy a house because it might be worth more in a few years and he would sell it then and buy another one, then virtually, leaving out the non-essential words in subsection (10), any realisable gain will be subject to tax and in virtually every case the gain made is not really a profit in the normal meaning of the word; it is merely an <Col N="377" /> increase in the paper value of the house because of inflation.  To take away the relief and impose capital gains tax on the paper profit made, because of inflation, on potentially practically every dwelling house is quite wrong.  Subsection (10), read in that way, is far too wide and could defeat the whole purpose of the section.  The words &ldquo;or partly&rdquo; should certainly be excluded and, by agreement, we could agree to exclude them now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be to open the door to the kind of avoidance devices people of considerable property could engage in where they would be able to show they were using the premises partly as a dwelling house and partly for the purpose of making a gain and, because they had partly used the premises as a dwelling house, the gain would be exempt.  However, I will take another look at the section to see if it needs to be tightened up to prevent even the Revenue Commissioners acting unreasonably or in the way Deputy O'Malley suggests.  The facts of every case would have to be looked at, the nature of the occupation, the duration of the occupation, the size of the dwelling, the number of occupants and the purposes to which the proceeds of the sale were applied.  If they were applied in the acquisition of an alternative dwelling that would tend to indicate that the purpose of acquisition and disposal was for the improvement of the family home. That would be perfectly laudable and nobody could question that or say it was for the purpose of making a gain. There are several different factors I have mentioned which are, I think, sufficient to indicate the necessity to draw this subsection widely so that all the facts of individual cases can be taken into account.  This is not a section which would apply to the general run of cases and it is quite clearly not intended to apply to the general run of cases.  It would apply where the nature of the original acquisition, occupation and disposal were such as to lead one to the reasonable conclusion that the purpose of realising the gain was the dominant <Col N="378" /> factor in the disposal of the property. I would prefer to take a look at it in the light of the suggestions that have been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated earlier that I had reservations about this subsection. Deputy O'Malley has spelt out very clearly some of the dangers involved. I must confess my reservations have been increased in listening to the Minister now.  All the time we are dealing with the principal residence. If I understood the Minister correctly what he said was that if a man sold his principal residence and invested the proceeds of the sale in the purchase of another house this would be evidence of the fact that it was a genuine case coming within the provisions of this section and entitled to the relief. By implication does that mean if a man sold his house and invested the money in a business, which might be in need of that investment, and moved himself and his family into rented accommodation, that that would be evidence of the fact that he should not get the benefit of this relief under this section? I do not know if that is what the Minister had in mind, but it seemed to be implied in what he said.  If that is so this matter needs to be looked at a little more closely to see precisely what we are trying to do under sub-section (10).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera asknowledged the fact that there is no end to the ingenuity of people in devising avoidance measures.  Section 25 is a section which grants exemptions to private residences.  I consider it necessary, in the public interest, that steps be taken to ensure that the exemption, which is to cover the genuine person who invests in a dwellinghouse for himself and his family, is not availed of by people whose purpose is that of making a profit and not that of housing their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worst that can be said about this subsection is that the effect of it is that occasionally somebody who has occupied a dwellinghouse for that purpose only may have it alleged against him by the Revenue Commissioners that he occupied it and disposed of it wholly or partly for the purpose of <Col N="379" /> realising a gain on the disposal of it. I would prefer to look at this between now and the next Stage to see if something needs to be done to deal with that extraordinary rare case.  If such a case was a genuine one I am quite certain that the person's conduct would stand up to any effort by the Revenue Commissioners to suggest that the purpose of the sale was for making a gain on the disposal of it and not in relation to the fundamental thing which we are endeavouring to protect, which is the principal private residence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said and I do not wish to prolong this discussion, but could he give us an idea of what I might call the worst kind of abuse of this relief that he can envisage, having regard to the fact that we are talking about the principal private residence? It seems to me the scope for abuse is fairly limited by reason of the fact that it must be the principal private residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only purpose of answering that would be to give an indication of the attitude of the Minister for Finance towards tax avoidance. I do not think it would be appropriate for me to give a whole range or indeed the most extreme sample of tax avoidance devices that could be engaged in.  I have given a fair cross section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know some people are obsessed with using avoidance measures. I believe the Minister and his advisers are becoming a little obsessed in relation to this.  It is difficult to see how any real abuse could be created under this section.  We must be satisfied that it is the principal private residence before any relief can be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says he does not think there could be any real abuse and I am sure he would add to that &ldquo;even on the part of the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;.  Therefore, what has he to fear from section 10?  If no abuse has occurred on the part of the person involved there is no reason to fear any abuse on the <Col N="380" /> part of the Revenue Commissioners in the operation of this section.  If there is such an abuse it will be open to the person affected by it to appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that that is a sufficiently good answer on the ground that one should not be creating a situation like this.  I am satisfied, if the Minister will have a look at it in the light of what we have suggested. If the Minister does not want, for his own reasons, to go into details of how this might be abused I respect that. I feel this thing may be going a bit too far in the light of a purely theoretical possibility of abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that Deputy Colley and I mainly referred to the first half of that subsection.  The second half is equally ominous.  Deputy Colley referred to having reservations about that.  Indeed, well he might.  This section is two-and-a-half pages long and there are 61 lines in each page.  It is very boring for everyone to have to go through this but is it not in the public interest that we should do so? The Minister for Finance should not be in the position that he can have legislation passed without any comment on it at all, that this relief section will not apply to someone who acquired a house as his principal private residence, which in most cases is the only private residence, partly for the purpose of realising a gain from its disposal.</P>
      <P>The second part of this talks about expenditure and says that the relief shall not apply to a gain so far as it is attributable to any expenditure which was incurred after the beginning of the period of ownership and was incurred wholly or partly for the purpose of realising a gain from the disposal.  Clearly envisaged here is the sort of a situation where a man buys a house, his family grows or he becomes more affluent and he decides he needs another room or two.  This is a common thing which happens in every part of the country every day in the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> This man adds one or two rooms to his house, which may be a humble back kitchen in the country or something more elaborate.  He knows this will increase the value of his house and he knows he will get more for the house when he sells it.  He would not add the extension to it if he did not expect to get some gain from it. Does he not come within this definition, that he is incurring this expenditure partly for the purpose of realising a gain from its disposal.  Does this mean that anyone who adds anything to his principal private residence, which in the case of 99 per cent of us means the only private residence, is rendering himself ineligible for the relief given in subsection (1) of this section but which is grudgingly taken away in various ways afterwards? Surely the Minister does not seriously expect that this subsection should go through without any comment?</P>
    <P>What is the point of the relief if it is taken away afterwards?  If a man spends money on his house he is not doing so for the purpose of allowing the value of the house to remain static or even to decrease.  He obviously partly has in mind the realisation of a gain on the sale of the house, that the house was too small.  Perhaps it had three or four rooms and needed another room or two.  He adds them and it becomes worth proportionately a lot more. Why should he be penalised for having done that?  It is quite unfair.  If it was done wholly for that purpose one would think he would be nearly entitled to do it anyway, but certainly when it was partly for that purpose it is most unfair because in the usual course of events it is being done to accommodate a larger family or to give the existing family more room in their home.  It must inevitably be partly for the purpose of increasing the value of the house.  Unless that was going to happen he would not do it anyway.  People often say, when they are adding a room or two to a house: &ldquo;When we come to sell it, it will be worth all the more.&rdquo; It is a perfectly laudable and legitimate reason for adding rooms to a house, but notwithstanding the fact that it is <Col N="382" /> laudable and legitimate by any normal standards the Minister is here excluding people who do this from the scope of this relief.  It is not right, and subsection (10) should be amended.</P>

We want to protect those people.  We have given them that protection <Col N="383" /> but we propose in this subsection to ensure that that genuine, reasonable relief is not going to be availed of by the fly-by-night speculators who will use that section in order to make tax free capital gains by a misuse of relief that has been provided for the genuine citizen.  I make no apology for ensuring that as we grant exemptions they are not going to be abused by people, and no matter how much Deputy O'Malley may make mischievous comment in a debate which, until his arrival, was a constructive one I am not going to yield to that kind of pressure, no matter how much of it goes on, because it is contrary to the national interest, it is contrary to fair taxation and it is only making it more difficult to produce a fair code which will work to tax capital gains which deserve to be taxed and, at the same time, will relieve people who should not be called on to pay a capital tax on their dwelling houses.</P>

      <Col N="384" /> The Minister tells us that his purpose in subsection (10) is to avoid abuse of the reliefs.  Nobody is quarrelling with that purpose.  What is at issue is whether subsection (10) merely prevents the abuse of the relief or whether, although the Minister did not intend it, it goes further and does the kind of thing outlined by Deputy O'Malley.  That is what is at issue, and I do not know why the Minister should blow his top in relation to that situation.  He would be wise not to do so.  I am sure he is at least as anxious, if not more anxious, than we are to make progress on this Bill, and that kind of thing does not help us.</P>

      <P>If we could have an example, if there is any example other than the rather far-fetched one we got from the Minister of a person living on his own in an office block, it would put this matter more into perspective. For asking a perfectly simple and obvious and necessary question like this I am accused of being mischievous and a number of other things.  I realise that by asking a perfectly obvious and necessary question I will provoke another display of uncontrolled, petty, ill-temper from the Minister.  Nonetheless, I feel it is my duty as a Member of this House, as it is Deputy Colley's, Deputy de Valera's and that of anyone else who wishes to take part in the debate, to ask these questions.  I have put up the postulation that on a strict reading of subsection (10) somebody who adds a back kitchen to a labourer's cottage is liable to find himself in the position that he is taken out of the relief or exemption given for principal private residences.  I put that up to the Minister.  If that is wrong let the Minister explain to me how it is wrong.  It is not enough just to get up and make abusive personal comments about me.  That is no answer.  It may display a lot of things about the Minister personally, as it quite clearly does, but it does not help this legislation. If adding rooms to one's principal private residence partly&mdash;I am not talking about wholly&mdash;for the purpose of realising a gain when one comes to sell it, in other words of getting more money for it when one comes to sell <Col N="385" /> it, should take a house out of the relief that was given in this section I think it is wrong and I make no apology for thinking it is wrong.  If I am wrong in suggesting that I would like the Minister to explain precisely how I am wrong.  I do not want any more abuse.  It does not matter to me, but in the national interest it would save time if the Minister would just answer the questions and leave out the personal abuse.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would leave out the mischievous misrepresentation then we could get on with the legislation, but his objective is perfectly clear.

      <P>I hope I will not be accused of trying to misinterpret the Minister.  I am as anxious to catch speculators as the Minister is, but in this case we are dealing with a private residence.  If a speculator buys a house and renovates it to make profit on it and he has a private residence other than the one he buys he should be caught but the person for whom I am afraid is the person who, for example, gets an appointment in a certain town and buys a house which is not big enough to accommodate his family and who adds to the house.  He may then get a change of appointment and have to sell that private residence. The back kitchen was not added for the purpose of making a profit but to accommodate the family.  Would there be a danger that they would be caught simply because they had made an addition to their private residence? I should like a clear answer to that question.  The addition to their residence was not done for the purpose of making money.  On the other hand, it was not done with the intention of losing money.  If a man has a house and he changes his job and has to sell that house he may look for more than he bought the house at.  It would be worth, say, £200 more.  Is there a danger of such a man being caught by this provision?  I am not trying to throw a spanner in the works.  As a <Col N="386" /> neutral observer I would like an answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a long day here.  Let us try to maintain the calm we had.  I see the problem in this section that is in so many sections, the capturing of more than was intended and perhaps not capturing what was intended.  Deputy O'Malley is quite right in the case he is making.  I am afraid the <i>bona fide</i> case might be captured by this section. It is always just as well when arguments get to this stage to be specific.  Supposing I have a house on less than one acre and am living in it with my family; I have occupied it for the whole period of ownership; during that period I have done things to improve the house.  Suppose I am going to move, in other words, taking cognisance of the last words of subsection (10), surely, the natural thing for me to do would be to paint the house or in the course of ownership to make an addition such as Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Callanan talked about.  There is a point for the Minister to consider here.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I think I know what the Minister is getting at and this is where the speculator would come in.  I would have sympathy with the Minister if he pointed to this possibility.  Suppose I own a residence that is too big for one residence.  I happen to be a <i>bona fide</i> owner or have acquired it and lived in it for a while to qualify as a <i>bona fide</i> owner. I get a bright idea and change the whole character of the residence by turning it into flats and get a gain out of that transaction.  It is something like that that the Minister is thinking about.  Surely one can differentiate between the two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One does not have to go to the extent of looking for office blocks on the site to see the type of thing the Minister would want to stop here.  If somebody acquires a residence like that and manages to be <i>bona fide</i> to come within the qualification and then alters its character so that what he is selling is not the <i>bona fide</i> residence he had but a set of flats, already made.  That involves expenditure.  To be specific, <Col N="387" /> if to every room you add sanitary and plumbing accommodation and erect partitions, and so forth, so that what was a <i>bona fide</i> residence is turned into a set of residences for speculative purposes, I can understand what the Minister is at and the difficulty of opening the door.  If one analyses it in that way one can understand the Minister's problem, but that does not take away from the fact that an extremely valid point has been made by Deputy O'Malley.  It is beyond our ingenuity as a Parliament to devise a way out of that difficulty and to meet both these problems satisfactorily?  It is in that spirit that I would approach the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy acknowledged that that is the way I approached it an hour ago or whenever the debate began.  Since then it has been interpreted in a way which was never intended and which could not be reasonably applied.  He has given a perfect description of the kind of situation that could arise.  To some extent it would be dealt with under the next subsection which deals with apportionment of considerations where the person disposes of a dwelling-house only part of which is his or his only or main residence.  If he was occupying, for instance, some of the flats or a flat himself, that would be his residence. The remainder would not qualify for the relief.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Callanan, I can say once again that the case he described of a person who adds to the house to provide additional accommodation for himself, to improve his own housing standards, is not caught and is not intended to be caught.  I have said a long time ago that I was prepared to take a look at it to ensure that such a person could not conceivably be caught even if the Revenue Commissioners were to be unreasonable in their application of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If it is done for the purpose of making a profit, that is another thing.  This is not a new concept in law because under the law as it existed up to now where there was no question of capital gains, the Revenue Commissioners have often had to decide whether a particular activity was in the nature of trading or was a casual or accidental gain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  A person could have improved a house and disposed of it in the past and questions have arisen as to whether or not the frequency with which he engaged in that kind of thing converted a casual gain into a trade, an activity generating profit, which ought to be treated as an income for income tax purposes. The only effect of this section is to allow the Revenue Commissioners to do as they must do in the application of the law, to look at situations which this section envisages could occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has argued earlier today that the ideal legislation would be that which covered only a tiny fraction of the paper covered by this legislation, leaving it to the <Col N="389" /> Revenue Commissioners to act reasonably in the exercise of their discretion. Yes, we can agree that that would be the ideal but it is not the practicable one for the simple reason that the Revenue Commissioners must act within the law and they only act on the specific powers given to them.</P>
    <P>Very generous exemptions have been spelled out here which will mean that the ordinary person with a property who occupies it as his private dwelling house, who uses it as his private dwelling house, and who improves it for private residential purposes will be exempt.  We want to ensure that, where people seek to avail of that exemption in order to generate profit, they will pay their fair share of the capital gain when they have, as it were, used that private residence for the deliberate purpose of generating a capital gain.  Nobody can be certain at the time he goes about improving his property that he will sell at a price which will cover the cost of the improvement.  Nobody can be certain that he will, in fact, make a capital gain.</P>

On the assumption that the Minister will have a look at the subsection with a view to making it as clear as possible that the situations envisaged by Deputies cannot arise, I would be quite happy to let the section pass&mdash;on the assumption that the Minister is looking at it in the same way as we are and will see if he can reword it to ensure that that is what is brought about as distinct from what is intended.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27a:</P>
      <P>In page 26, line 18, to delete &ldquo;ten&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;four&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to reduce the period for which a business or farm which is disposed of on retirement has to be held before the relief given in subsection (1) would become applicable.  We feel that a requirement that the qualifying assets as defined in the section should be held continuously for a period of ten years up to the time of their disposal is too long.  People may well have held assets perfectly <i>bona fide</i> for a shorter time than that so far as shares in a family company or a business company or a farming company are concerned.  A man could have been working all his life at a particular business or at farming and have changed his business or farm within ten years before he wanted to dispose of it on retirement and he would be <Col N="392" /> deprived of the rather limited relief given under this section.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, to require him to have held that particular company or farm for a period of ten years is too long.  The limited value of the relief given under the section should be available if the qualifying assets have been held for a period of four years.  This should be long enough to prevent any abuse of the situation because it would only apply in the case of a farm or family business which the man had carried on over a reasonable period.  The fact that he may not have carried on in that farm or in that company for the full ten years should not disqualify him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I support Deputy O'Malley. There are a few reasons why we thought ten years was too long.  A man could buy a farm or a business and through ill-health he could be unable to carry it on for the time laid down in this section.  His business could go against a man and it would be desirable that he should dispose of it within less than ten years.  As I say, a man could fall into delicate health after purchasing a business or a farm.  He would be deprived of this exemption if he were forced to dispose of it within that time limit.  If a man's business went against him he might find himself in the bankruptcy court.  If he had to dispose of his assets he would not qualify under this provision.</P>
      <P>These are some of the reasons why we put forward this amendment.  We believe that four years is a more acceptable period.  These are the people we have in mind whom we tried to cover in this amendment, people who will be forced out of business through no choice of their own. They are not doing it voluntarily but will probably be compelled to do it, and we would like to think that they would get this qualifying concession in regard to the £50,000 relief.  I think the Minister could accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I hear arguments criticising the additional <Col N="393" /> exemptions we have given, the more I see an argument in favour of having left the original ideas in the White Paper alone.  Every time one gives a further exemption or concession one widens, I suppose, the circumference and more and more cases are drawn to your attention which are just on the other line of the exemption granted.  What we are dealing with here is the case of a person who is retiring from business, and I do not think it is unreasonable to suggest that a person of 55 years of age would be expected to be about ten years in the business or the farm from which he is retiring in order to gain this exemption.</P>
      <P>What we are being asked in this amendment to do is to say that four years' involvement in the business of farming would suffice for this exemption. I think it would not be difficult for any reasonable speculator to set up an arrangement to gain from section 26, if it were limited to four years.  It may be possible for him to do it in a ten years' span too&mdash;that I would accept&mdash;but it is at least two-and-a-half times more difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless he could so arrange his affairs, could make his investment in such a way as to produce for himself a tax free gain of £50,000 if he made his arrangements at 51 years of age and went out at 55. That is not too long a period for a person to make an arrangement.  Indeed, he may make an arrangement over his life span, and people have been able to do it in the past to avoid liability to income tax and estate duties, but the genuine purpose of the section&mdash;and I think nobody will dispute this&mdash;is to come to the relief of a person who has spent a lifetime, or a substantial part of his lifetime, in some particular business and who is forced for some reason or another to retire at the comparatively early age <Col N="394" /> of 55, or above that date, because the relief applies to anybody above that date, and even though they are not transferring the asset to a member of the family they can get total relief on consideration up to £50,000.</P>
      <P>That is a significant help, and to extend it now would be to encourage entry into and quick exit from business in order to make an untaxed gain.  I would think that entry into and exit from a business within four years is of such a nature as to lead one to believe that the particular action was dictated by a desire to avoid liability to tax.  A ten-year period makes that a lot less likely, the element of avoidance a lot less likely, and a ten-year period is related to a significant proportion of a person's working life, and that is the relief we want to give.  Hard cases make bad law, and I noticed that throughout the whole debate on capital taxation, the extremely unusual case, the unique case, is always produced to suggest that hardship is being caused to the case which is not typical.  I would consider that we have a duty to provide relief in all appropriate cases, and I am not arguing that anybody's predicament is insignificant or beneath the concern of Parliament.  It should not be, but to suggest that retirement relief should be given to people who are only four years in the business is to urge upon the Oireachtas a suggestion which is not related to the ordinary experience of mankind where retirement occurs from business at the age of 55 when one has spent at least a decade in that business, and that is the case we are giving relief to here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing the point of this amendment.  It is not that one should be only four years in a business or in farming, or whatever.  The point we have been endeavouring to make is that particularly in regard to farming&mdash;it would arise less obviously in relation to business as such&mdash;a man could have been in farming all his working life, for 30 and perhaps even 40 years, and he wants to retire.  Because he has been progressing in his farming throughout his working life, he may have ended <Col N="395" /> up in the second, third or fourth farm since he began, having purchased larger farms and sold smaller farms as he worked his way along. If he has the last farm for less than ten years, he will not get this exemption, and we feel that is wrong.  He should not be penalised in that fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection whatever, and we would have no objection, to a requirement that he should have been in farming or in a business, or the profession or in any of the activities set out here for at least ten years.  Indeed, we would have no objection to a requirement that he be in it for perhaps 20 years, but we do think it is wrong that if he sells within ten years of having acquired the particular asset which he holds at the date of retirement, even though he may have been 30 or more years at the particular trade, whether it is farming or otherwise&mdash;it is wrong that if he holds the particular asset for less than ten years at the time he sells on retirement, he should be deprived of this relief, which is not particularly generous in any event, to say the least of it.  This is dealing with people who have never made speculative <Col N="396" /> gains but who have worked hard all their lives to build up an asset and find themselves now in the totally unsatisfactory position that they are being charged the same rate of tax, capital gains tax, after a lifetime of hard work as someone who went in and out of a speculative mining share in a matter of a month and made a large sum of money in that time.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I cannot see that there would be any element of speculation in this section when the consideration is only £50,000.  The Minister mentioned that it could open up an element of speculation and avoidance but the consideration here is for £50,000.  It is obvious that no speculators would concern themselves with this type of a consideration of £50,000.  That element can be discounted.  The proposals put forward by Deputy O'Malley are genuine.  There are cases where property would have to be disposed of within the statutory time laid down but I could not see how it could be used as an avoidance measure if the proposal was accepted.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In subsection (6), page 26, line 28, after &ldquo;individual&rdquo; to add &ldquo;provided always that the period of ten years aforesaid may by decisions in writing of the Revenue Commissioners be reduced by such period as to the Revenue Commissioners seems just where the individual has been prevented by ill-health from working as a full-time director for the said period of ten years or where the individual concerned is the widow or widower of the next preceding owner and is unable to carry on the trade, business, farming, office, employment or profession of his or her former spouse&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the discussion on the previous amendment, the relief proposed in this section is that in connection with the disposal of a business or a farm, on retirement.  But there are, of course, a number of conditions in the section to be met before the relief can be obtained. In subsection (6) (b) there is the definition of qualifying assets for this relief.  That definition refers to assets which an individual has owned for at least a period of ten years ending with disposal and the shares or securities of a company which has been a trading or a farming company and has been a family company during the period of ten years ending with the disposal and of which he has been a full-time working director throughout that period.  There are further references to the ten years&mdash;the period of ten years shall be deemed to include a period immediately prior to the transfer during which the assets transferred were owned by the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that a fairly common situation can arise in which this relief should be given but, in fact, in the section as drafted would not be given.  One such situation would arise <Col N="399" /> where, say, a man had been a full-time working director of a family company throughout his working life. Then ill-health strikes him.  The normal pattern would be that he would try to carry on as long as he could. But ultimately he might well be told by his doctors that if he continues any longer it will probably mean his death.  Therefore, he does not have any choice.  He has to give up the full-time working directorship.  Of course, in the meantime, an effort is made to carry on the business.  Eventually&mdash; and again this is the common pattern &mdash;as a result of the absence of that man from the business, the business deteriorates until ultimately it becomes necessary, in order to avoid further losses, to dispose of it.</P>
    <P>Of course, the same thing could apply in the case of a farmer, as indicated in the discussion on the previous amendment.  But in either case&mdash;as the section is drafted&mdash;this relief would not be obtained because, in the ten years immediately prior to the disposal of the assets, the man would not have been a full-time working director. He might have been a full-time working director for 25 or 30 years but, because of the ill-health situation and his retirement from the business for some time before it becomes necessary to dispose of the assets, he loses the benefit of the relief given in the section.  That is one situation.</P>
    <P>Another reasonably common situation is where the owner of the assets, be it either a farm or a business, dies and his widow tries to run the farm or business but, not being trained for the work involved and perhaps with a lot of family commitments, ultimately finds it is not possible for her to carry on the business or farming.  In both those cases, again on the wording of the section, the relief would not be available, cases in which I believe the relief should be available.</P>
    <P>But, recognising the dangers of abuse of this section, I have tried to cover the kinds of cases involved by providing a discretion to the Revenue Commissioners that, where they are satisfied in circumstances of this kind, that it would be just to allow the relief <Col N="400" /> even though the period involved was less than ten years, then the relief would be given.  It seems to me that this amendment is meeting cases that should be covered and, secondly, since it puts discretion in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners it is ensuring the relief will not be abused or availed of by people to avoid liability for capital gains tax.  In the circumstances I hope the Minister will not have any difficulty in accepting the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy as a former Minister for Finance knows the pitfalls inherent in any system which visualises giving tax relief for health purposes.  The question whether a person is in a proper state of health to devote more than a certain amount of time to a particular activity is a matter that leaves itself open to wide diversification of views, medical, commercial and fiscal.  While I accept the amendment is well intended, I am not able to accept it because to do so would create very bad tax law for very good motives.</P>
      <P>The question of what is ill-health, which prevents a person from carrying out his business, obviously is something that is not easily determined. I do not think giving discretion to the Revenue Commissioners would solve it because there are questions of medical degree here and it is not improbable that there may be conflicts of medical evidence.  The same predicament would face the appeals commissioners.  While the amendment endeavours to deal with a comparatively small number of hardship cases, it would leave itself open to considerable abuse.</P>
      <P>With regard to widows, the section will be interpreted as meaning there is a continuity and the Revenue Commissioners will count the deceased husband's ownership and the widow's ownership as one.  The capital gains tax code visualises that a husband and wife are treated as one and, therefore, the latter part of the Deputy's amendment would not appear to be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the previous section says a disposal between a husband and wife is not chargeable <Col N="401" /> to capital gains but it seems to be stretching it a good deal further to say that for the purpose of this section a widow is deemed to be in exactly the same position as her husband and that there is no break in continuity.  Can the Minister state if there is a more specific basis for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of references in the Bill that are based on the principle that for capital gains purposes a husband and wife are treated as one person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be going against the whole code if the Revenue Commissioners were to interpret this section contrary to the fundamental philosophy behind the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister knows, it is not the philosophy but the actual provisions relating to husband and wife on which one would have to rely.  Can the Minister quote anything that would support that contention? I would be very relieved to hear it was so, but I have some doubts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 13 (7) provides:</P>
      <P>Where subsection (5) is applied in relation to a disposal of an asset by a husband to his wife, or by his wife to him, then in relation to a subsequent disposal of the asset (not within the said subsection) the one making the disposal shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as if the other's acquisition or provision of the asset had been his or her acquisition or provision of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that is so in relation to that subsection but surely the Minister would not contend that subsection would have the effect of giving this relief to a widow in the circumstances I have described?  On the face of it it does not do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="402" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Revenue Commissioners' interpretation.  They are satisfied the proper way of treating it is to treat it as a continuity between a husband and wife.  Therefore, the ownership of the deceased and the ownership of the widow are treated as one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 13 (5) appears to deal with one year only. If the effort to sell by the wife was more than a year after the death of her husband the continuity the Minister spoke about would not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The year of assessment is the year in which the disposal takes place and the gain is calculated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the disposal took place before the year of assessment, what is the position?  If the husband died this year and if the wife disposes of the property next year, what will happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no charge this year.  There could be a charge with a subsequent disposal. The ownership is treated as a continuity between husband and wife, as one ownership.  Calculation of the gain would be made only on the ultimate disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister were asked to give an opinion, quite apart from the way the Revenue Commissioners may intend to interpret this section, would he be inclined to say the wife would get the benefit?  I venture to suggest that if the Minister were asked for his opinion he would say it did not extend to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I would be that definite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would give a reply something on those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I might refer it to counsel for an opinion and counsel would confirm the opinion I am giving of the Revenue Commissioners' interpretation.  However, I will look at the section to see if the intention <Col N="403" /> can be expressed so that it is beyond doubt.  However, there is the difficulty that if we are specific in one section in dealing with the case and are not specific in another, by a process of deemed exclusion it might be regarded as not applying in other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but it is also true that there are a number of references to disposals between a husband and wife in different sections.  So long as there is more than one, the danger to which the Minister has referred arises.  It is another reason for saying the widow would not get the benefit unless it is specifically provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As they have not dealt with that situation in this section it shows they do not consider a disposal takes place.  They see it as a continuity between husband and wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be much happier to see it spelled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will think about it <Col N="404" /> but I do not want to cause any difficulties to widows in other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>At least we have established that the Minister's intention is that the widow should get the benefit. When he looks into the matter I am sure he will find that it is both possible and necessary to spell it out more clearly.  If that is so, then one of the points sought to be achieved in the amendment will be dealt with. The other point involved in this amendment is not covered by what the Minister has said.  I put it to him that there is a serious problem involved here and it is not sufficient to say there would be problems about medical certificates.  The Revenue Commissioners are obliged already to operate under the income tax code in determining matters about illness and medical certificates.</P>
