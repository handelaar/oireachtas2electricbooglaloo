    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations, as I am sure the Minister has, from the Irish Farmers' Association in regard to section 5 (1).  The IFA point out that in recent years quite a number of farms have been put in trust and the effect of section 5 (1) would be to include all such farms under the umbrella of section 5 and thereby remove the benefits of thresholds under other sections of the Bill.  They have urged that where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that the beneficiaries' only assets&mdash;I presume to take that literally would not be correct but that where the substantial portion of the beneficiaries' assets were there contained in the trust&mdash; that the trust be treated in the same way as if all the property were owned by the individual.  They also urge that provision should be made, by way of exemption from gift tax and stamp duty, for the unscrambling of those trusts for those who with to do so within some specified period of time. I would be glad to know the Minister's attitude in regard to those representations from the IFA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements to which Deputy Colley referred were carried out in most, if not all, cases with the objective of tax avoidance and, as the Minister for Lands has already explained, it is not the practice to provide periods during which people may, <Col N="1019" /> as a consequence of new tax laws, unscramble existing arrangements which they have made to suit their own purposes under the law as it previously existed.  We would not consider that we would be justified in providing a period of exemption such as is sought to allow for the unscrambling of these totally artificial arrangements.  It is difficult to visualise any case in which it is necessary to form a company in order to run a farm efficiently.  It could certainly be argued in relation to other business enterprises that the best way of carrying them on is through an incorporated company but the same argument cannot be advanced in relation to farms.  If, under the existing law, people find that it is not in their interests to continue to hold farms in discretionary trusts they will, no doubt, unscramble those trusts and the worst that can happen is to have a once-and-for-all liability.</P>
      <P>I would point out that it was known for a long time that wealth tax was to be introduced.  It was not something that was suddenly imposed on people without warning.  It was a matter which was announced before the last general election.  A mandate was given to the Government for it and a White Paper was published as far back as February, 1974.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands has already pointed out that the White Paper made no reference at all to allowing a period of time within which people could arrange their affairs in such a way as to avoid liability of tax where the arrangements would affect living persons or the assets of living persons. Such references as exist in the White Paper contemplated allowing people to rearrange their affairs under wills and testamentary dispositions but there was no suggestion at any time that time would be allowed for living persons to rearrange their affairs before the impact of the wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I was interested to note, and I am sure many people who voted for the Minister's party in the general election will note with great interest, the Minister's statement that the Government obtained <Col N="1020" /> a mandate at the general election for the introduction of this wealth tax.  I noted this with interest and I presume a number of people who voted for the Fine Gael Party will also note this with equal interest. The Minister speaks of trusts that were set up in relation to farms as tax avoidance.  Of course, in the main, it was tax avoidance.  It was avoidance of death duties.</P>
      <P>There are two things to be said about that.  The first is that in so far as the Minister and his colleagues could do so they certainly led farmers to believe that the impact of death duties was not only damaging but inequitable and that they should be abolished.  In a context of that kind it savours slightly in my view of sharp practice for the Minister now to condemn efforts to avoid liability for death duties, efforts which were legal and fully in accordance with the law, and to condemn them implicitly, if not explicitly, as he has done, and to have no regard at all to the consequences for persons who so arrange their affairs.  The consequences are that such persons will get no benefit whatever from the thresholds mentioned here and will pay a wealth tax on the first £ of their wealth and upwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of providing time for unscrambling, the Minister says that the statement in the White Paper was intended to convey that time would be given for people to alter their wills and testamentary dispositions.  Of course, wills and testamentary dispositions have to be formulated in relation to the manner in which one's property is held.  It is a little unreal to suggest that time is allowed for that but is not allowed for the necessary changes in the manner in which property is held.  I suggest it is illusory to think that one is given any time in that way if one does not give time for changes of the kind advocated by the Irish Farmers' Association.  As to what time has been given to persons to change their wills and testamentary dispositions that is a matter which is not very clear to me at the moment, having regard to the date of operation of this <Col N="1021" /> Bill and indeed of the other Capital Taxation Bills.  Consequently, it seems to me that the Minister's rejection of the representation made to him by the Irish Farmers' Association is unreasonable and without a valid, logical basis.  The matter, has, however been put very clearly to him and he has clearly explained his position, which is all I can ask him to do.</P>
    <P>I would now like to ask the Minister a question in regard to paragraph (b) of subsection (1) which sets out a number of possible cases in regard to discretionary trusts where the property, or some of the property, is situate outside the State.  In each of them except No. (iii) the phrase &ldquo;ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo; is used.  Why is that omitted in the case of No. (iii)?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. (iii) states: &ldquo;The settlor was domiciled in the State at the date of his death.&rdquo;  I will come to that in a moment, but I would first like to deal with the other points which the Deputy made in relation to farmers.  Lest there be any misunderstanding about the position it should be emphasised that the vast majority of farmers will not be affected by the wealth tax and still fewer will be affected by the fact that the Bill does not allow any temporary arrangement to facilitate those who have been farming through the medium of discretionary trusts.  A farmer could have assets up to £250,000 and still pay no wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not with a discretionary trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if it is a family discretionary trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Lands could be worth £150,000, livestock and machinery worth £65,000, dwellinghouse £16,000 and other miscellaneous assets £19,000. That is a fair-sized farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It would be a very small farm with inflation running at 25 per cent for three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair-sized farmer.  The plea made here is one on <Col N="1022" /> behalf of such people.  If there is to be a wealth tax it will have to be paid by those who are comparatively more wealthy than others.  Nobody can dispute that as it is axiomatic.  That being so, it seems to me that it is making a plea that has little merit to ask for special arrangements to be made to facilitate people who have that dimension of wealth and have used a device in order to avoid payment of estate duty in the past.  The reality of the matter is that they do not need such special arrangements to be made for them.</P>
      <P>The normal practice in respect of a settlor is always to look to his domicile. It is very difficult to determine with sufficient legal certainly what was the ordinary residence of a settlor who may be long since dead.  That is why, in the case of the settlor who has died, it is necessary to apply the test of domicile and no other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why then is it included in No. 2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The settlor will normally be still alive at No. 2.  In No 3 he is dead.  It will obviously create difficulty to determine the ordinary residence as of the date of death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should it create difficulties?  It is something which arises fairly regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has given so much difficulty in the past that the practice has been not to endeavour to determine ordinary residence but to rely on domicile as the determining factor in relation to trusts in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it then that the effect of No. 3 is that if the settlor was resident outside the State at the date of his death, and perhaps for many years before it, but was in the legal sense domiciled in the State in that he intended to return there, any of the property in the trust situate anywhere in the world would be subject to wealth tax without a threshold?  Is that the practical effect of No. 3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that that is reasonable having regard to the terms of Nos. 1, 2 and 4 where <Col N="1023" /> some effort is made to approach the matter on the basis of applying the wealth tax only to those who are in the broad sense subject to the laws and jurisdiction of this State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows from filling up schedules of assets and administering estates the test is domicile. We are not changing the law or the practice.  We are applying the well-established rules.  We are dealing with a situation which has a finality. The settlor is dead.  What governs the situation is the position at his date of death.  The only changeable residence thereafter is from purgatory to a better place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to the two matters raised by Deputy Colley concerning section 5 (1) the question is that all property in discretionary trusts is brought within the net and there is no threshold.  This was discussed briefly.  It allows for the exemption of family discretionary trusts such as parents might arrange for their children.  This is the normal course taken by a family which has wealth and which would be subject to heavy tax or estate duty.  That gets the threshold just as any straightforward trust would.</P>
      <P>Further concessions were made where there was a member of a family who was not a minor but who would require looking after because he is unable to look after himself. In such cases a prudent parent would draw up a trust providing for that type of individual.  A further concession was made to enlarge that part of the section so that there would be no misunderstanding and that there should be full coverage for such cases. Basically one can look at section 5 &mdash;and I am looking at it from my experience of dealing with discretionary trusts&mdash;and see that the section does preserve the family's right to deal with property within the family and still obtain the benefit of the threshold provided under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Dublin Central)</i> mentioned inflation.  It is well to remember so far as valuation of property is concerned it has been fixed <Col N="1024" /> as on 5th April of this year.  That valuation persists for three years unless there is a radical change of circumstances. An obvious change would be farmland which was sold and given to a developer for building.  Changes in use of such property and its income in such circumstances would make revaluation likely.  The previous valuation bears no relevance to the new valuation.  Wealth under this Bill means net wealth.  It is the wealth as ascertained on 5th April, 1975.  That figure will last for three years.  There is an inbuilt hedge against inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister has not given any undertaking about revaluation or told us what yardstick he will use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certain limitation on valuation.  One must be realistic.  The valuation office in this country take a realistic approach to the valuation of property.  There is also the question of time being allowed to people to unscramble legal technicalities. By its nature every discretionary trust leaves discretion to trustees. The trustees are the absolute authority in so far as the trust is concerned. They have free power of appointment.  The general run of discretionary trusts is to leave the discretion completely to the trustees.  In those circumstances trustees have the power to appoint.  In appointing a trustee could set up another trust for any named beneficiary by virtue of that power.  It could be a trust that would not be a discretionary one.  He can take property out of the discretionary trust.  People might argue that the discretionary trust that gives the threshold exemption is limited to a certain class such as the immediate family.  If there is a beneficiary who is not within that group it is easy for a trustee to take that beneficiary out and give him one shilling or his allotted property.  He can be taken out of the trust altogether.  Then one is dealing with a discretionary trust and gets full exemption.  Any discretionary trust that has been properly drawn, where a person has been properly advised by one who understands how to draw up such trusts, will have all these powers and many more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> This section should present no difficulty whatever to the family person who has taken steps to avoid estate duty.  He will be no worse off.  At a touch of a pen on a sheet of paper all the exemptions and thresholds will be given, but one person will be caught, and that is the man who uses discretionary trusts not for estate duty purposes but to avoid sur-tax and higher rates of income tax.  I am talking about a man with a hefty income who likes to have it salted away and to pay just minimum income tax.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in this House to the encyclical <i>Rerum Novarum</i> which concerns a man's duty to society.  Fair enough if he can get away with it, he will get away with it, but it is our function on this side of the House to see that everybody pays his fair amount of taxation when he is able to pay it.  I have not got a terrible lot of sympathy with people who have an income of such a size that they are in the higher income tax bracket and who enter into these complicated transactions whereby their property varies between all the islands off Europe, America and the Caribbean so as to avoid paying income tax.  I have very little sympathy with these people and I think Deputy Colley has the same attitude&mdash;he said as much earlier on in the debate&mdash;and any person with any experience in the legal or accountancy professions has to concede that, and one cannot shed too many tears for them.  I want to come back to the point that the genuine farmer with a family farm, a family property, is amply protected under this section, and if he has a discretionary trust, he need have no worry about getting out.  If there is something wrongly drawn for the purposes of the section, it can be dealt with within 24 hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out, in endorsement of what Deputy Esmonde has said, that if an appointment is made under a discretionary trust to a member of the family, no stamp duty will be payable in those circumstances and no capital acquisition tax will be payable either in any case where property up to a value <Col N="1026" /> of £150,000 is appointed to a wife or children.  That caters for the normal run of farms and I would say that 99 per cent would be exempt under that account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of what the Minister and Deputy Esmonde have said, one of the great merits of the body of legislation we are bringing in is that it does tackle effectively, and highly effectively, the problem of avoidance, primarily in the area of capital taxation, but, as the Minister said, incidentally in the area of income tax.  One of the great defects of the capital taxation code is that &mdash;I will not say it lends itself to avoidance because that understates the position&mdash;it effectively encourages it, and this is both a source of loss of revenue on a large scale to the State and a source of great social injustice because of the fact that those who are best off find it worth while and are most able to avoid it, and a source <Col N="1027" /> of great undermining of the public confidence in the tax system and a weakening of the willingness of people to pay tax, a willingness which must relate to the feeling that the tax system is equitable.</P>
      <P>Because of the interlinkage between the different Acts and their operation and because of the annual character of the wealth tax as against the uncertain and variable incidence of the existing estate duty&mdash;because of these reasons avoidance becomes very much more difficult, and this is a great merit of this body of legislation.  In the process of tightening up on avoidance, one comes up against a difficulty always of the margin between avoidance and the genuine hard case, and I think the particular section we are discussing is one of the key cases where this difficulty arises.  It arises because, as I understand it, hitherto common law countries had not had wealth taxes of this particular kind, and in civil-law countries discretionary trusts do not exist.  I hope I am well advised in this because I am in a technical area in which I have minimal competence, but my understanding is that this is a problem which exists in the common law system where discretionary trusts operate and we have had to devise a solution to the problem &mdash;and we are the first, I think, to devise a solution&mdash;the very difficult problem posed by the discretionary trust, some of which are genuinely related to family requirements where the property must be protected and the concern put in the same position as if it were not a trust, but others of which relate to tax avoidance on the income tax side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem posed by this is a difficult one.  When we were preparing this tax code, the one problem in my mind which worried me was whether we would be able to find an equitable solution to the problem.  I lack the technical knowledge to know how one could do it, and it was an act of faith in our taking a decision to go ahead that we would find a way of devising an equitable solution of the problem of discretionary trusts, and as one who was concerned about it and who saw this as the one possible real difficulty <Col N="1028" /> about this enormously improved capital taxation code, I am very pleased with the section in the way it has dealt effectively and fully with the genuine problems, while not making concessions to discretionary trusts which are not for family purposes but for tax avoidance purposes.</P>
    <P>It is right that Deputy Colley should probe this and try to ensure that what we have done here provides the optimum solution to the problem, and the discussion we are having is very useful from that point of view, but having listened to some of the discussion for the past half-hour and from what I can make of the section in its highly technical form, it seems to me that we have, in fact, resolved ingeniously, and I think satisfactorily, one of the most difficult problems connected with this whole tax code, the one upon which in a sense it might have foundered if we did not find a solution, foundered in the sense that we would have had to bring it in with a bit of a blunt instrument in this area, with possible certain inequities for people and the greater good might have required us to do that but it would still be an unhappy situation.  I would like to congratulate the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners for having found a solution to the problem which seems to me, and I am confirmed in this belief by the discussion, to have resolved the issue before us.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should underestimate the importance of this antiavoidance effect of these Bills.  I recall, and this is what first sparked off my interest in this subject, an article in <i>The Economist</i> of September, 1963, in which it was stated, though no evidence was given for the proposition but as an informed guess, that at that time in Britain two-thirds of the liability for estate duty was avoided.  I do not know what the scale of avoidance is here.  It may well be that in a country where there is less wealth, a lesser number of wealthy people, less total wealth, the scale of avoidance is less, and perhaps significantly less, than in Britain, but I think that most people connected with the relevant professions, <Col N="1029" /> accountancy and law, would feel that the scale of avoidance has increased over the years in Ireland, that the period of growing prosperity of the 1960s, during the latter part of which a number of large fortunes were made by speculative rather than constructive activities, was a period in which there seems to have been a rapidly increasing interest in tax avoidance measures, both in the capital and current taxation fields.  It may well be that although in 1963 the problem may have been very much smaller than in Britain, today the scale of avoidance may be not as great as in Britain but very much increased, and certainly any Government has a duty to try to deal with this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley in his time made all possible efforts within the existing system to tighten up on avoidance.  I would not accuse him of any lack of energy in that respect because I remember Finance Bills coming in here in his days and the days of his predecessors in each one of which there were measures to deal with avoidance.  But the problem was being nibbled at and the ingenious people who were inventing avoidance measures always kept several steps ahead of the Revenue Commissioners and the Ministers for Finance.  They succeeded because the system was one which lent itself to avoidance, the system under which you had an interval of perhaps 80 years of taxation payable or, in other instances, payable perhaps three times in a shorter period.  That itself is a source of inequity for the people concerned.  It was inequitable, therefore, because of its variability which could involve very long periods indeed in which no tax was payable.  It lent itself to avoidance by transference of wealth.  To some extent this was recognised by the State in the rule that transfers made more than a certain number of years before death were accepted as being not taxable.  In that way the gift tax or capital acquisitions tax legislation will help us to complete this package and tighten up in a way which will certainly make a very big difference to avoidance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> I would not claim, and I am sure neither the Minister nor the Revenue Commissioners would claim, that we have solved the problem.  It is not a problem that any legislation can solve short of the kind of legislation which we do not want to see which gives a discretionary power to the Revenue Commissioners to just decide that somebody owes tax and charge them accordingly.  Short of that you are always liable to have some avoidance. But the system of annual taxation on wealth over very high thresholds which exempts the vast majority of people currently paying capital taxation and reduces the burden on all but a tiny fraction of the remainder so that 99.5 per cent of the people will be better off in future, has the merit of exempting people who, under the previous system, were quite unfairly taxed on what was described as wealth but which at present, in view of the inflation over the last 20 or 30 years is not really wealth&mdash;as well as having that merit of exempting 92 per cent or 93 per cent of people completely from capital taxation and reducing taxation on all the remainder except, perhaps, .5 per cent of the total, that system has this additional merit, because of the regularity of the taxation annually and because of the introduction of the capital acquisition tax, of taxing avoidance frontally in a way which should be largely effective.</P>
    <P>The discretionary trust was a real problem in this connection because had we not tackled it and found a solution we would have been forced either to allow it to be a continuing vehicle for avoidance&mdash;which we did not wish to do&mdash;or else, had we not found the solution ingeniously provided in this section, or else in tackling discretionary trusts as avoidance measures, we would have found ourselves in the position of acting inequitably <i>vis-á-vis</i> cases where the discretionary trusts were genuine.  We were concerned to meet genuine family problems of minority or mental incompetence, or whatever it may be.  Therefore, I think this is a key element in the legislation and that the solution found here is absolutely <Col N="1031" /> essential to the success of the whole body of legislation, both in the revenue sense in ending avoidance&mdash;indeed in the social justice end by ending avoidance&mdash;but also successful in being fair and just to different elements in society who have a genuine reason, as some people have, for creating discretionary trusts.</P>
    <P>It is for these general reasons of policy as well as because of my perception of the merit of the section in this context that it seems to me that this section warrants the support of the House.</P>

It suggests that at least there was a certain amount of confusion among Members of the present Coalition Government if the Taoiseach found himself in a position to give in writing an undertaking that there would not be a wealth tax when the Ministers now say that it formed part of their programme which they put before the people.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to come to that.  We might in normal circumstances be somewhat concerned at the breadth of the speech delivered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this section, particularly having regard to the Government's expressed intention of guillotining this Bill through; nevertheless, for the reasons I mentioned, we welcome the contribution of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I know it has not been possible for him to be here very often and to keep <Col N="1033" /> in as close touch as he would like with the progress of the Bill and with particular amendments on this section but I am sure he would like to know that the facts are that this section, as drafted, contrary to the belief he expressed just now, did not fully and effectively solve the problem of discretionary trusts.  It has, however, been considerably improved as a result of amendments from this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that the problem has been fully and effectively solved but it is certainly a far more satisfactory section now as a result of our amendment than it was when produced by the Minister and his colleague in the form in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed such great confidence a few moments ago.</P>
      <P>On the whole question raised by that Minister in regard to dealing with tax avoidance and his statement that this Bill, combined with the other capital taxation measures, will be effective in dealing with this matter, I want to point out&mdash;if it should be necessary; perhaps it is; sometimes listening to the Minister for Finance and now to the Minister for Foreign Affairs one wonders if the obvious thought which I am about to offer ever crosses their minds, but in view of what was said I think I had better record this again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course it is possible to devise a system in which there can be virtually no tax avoidance.  Of course it is possible to do that.  But one has to look at the price one will have to pay and the first price, if you devise a system which is almost 100 per cent effective, is that personal liberty and freedom will disappear.  If you are prepared to sacrifice those then of course you can devise such a system.  But I do not think either side of this House would be prepared to pay that price although, in the legislation we finished with last night there are indications that the <Col N="1034" /> Minister for Finance is prepared to go a great deal further for this purpose; where he sees a danger of evasion he simply does not care what happens to those ordinary citizens acting within the law and he forgets their rights in order to close the evasion loophole. That is by way of general comment.</P>
    <P>There is another very important economic aspect of this.  If one were to devise such a system and implement it one must also, as a responsible Government, estimate and take into account the economic effects of what one does.  Listening to the members of the Government and, in particular, to the two members who are sitting opposite at the moment, one gets a very firm impression that the economic consequences of what they have been doing in regard to capital taxation has just not occurred to them or, if they did, and were reasonably accurately estimated, were totally disregarded because of a simple basic error of judgment. The fact is that, rightly or wrongly, the reaction of the people on whom basically the expansion of our economy depends to this package of taxation has been adverse because it is adverse to the interests of our economy and adverse, therefore, to the interests of the workers.</P>
    <P>One could argue at some length as to whether or not this reaction is justified.  That is not the point.  The point is that it is there, that it has happened and that it has done dam-age. Any responsible Government, introducing measures of this kind, has of course to take account of such things.  This is not an ideal world and any Government would wish to do many things it does not do simply because, if it does the sums of the consequences one way or the other, it finds they come out totally adverse; taking the consequences into account one gets and adverse balance which counteracts the good that could be done by the particular steps.</P>

I have made clear what I wanted to make clear.  It is an interesting topic though it may not be appropriate to this section.  The only point I want to make finally is to reiterate what I have already said: when dealing with a problem like this it is not merely a question of the effectiveness of one's measures in stopping taxation avoidance.  It is also a question of the economic consequences of what you do and I am suggesting the Government did not take due account of that aspect of their proposals.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I, too, dealing with the section, might make two slight comments on what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said.  In this section one has to take the economic situation into account.  I do not want to delay the House by making a Second Reading speech but I am afraid the philosophy behind the Minister's approach is the self-same philosophy that has brought England and Ireland to their present situation. I want to quote now what Mr. Wilson said, as reported in yesterday's papers:</P>
      <P>The issue now is not whether this, or any other democratic Socialist Government, can survive and lead the nation to full employment and a greater measure of social justice.</P>
      <P>It is whether any Government dedicated to the principles of consent and consensus within our democracy, can lead the nation.</P>
      <P>In England now there is the whole question of the future of democracy. It is the same philosophy as that expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs here this morning.  All I will say is be careful that your road is not leading to the Iberian Penninsula.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a great deal of expansion but I shall <Col N="1037" /> keep to the rules of order.  However, I think I am entitled to make some rejoinder to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I shall do that as succinctly as I can.  He talked about taxing the rich for the benefit of the majority.  That is a fair point but one must get it into perspective.  There are other points, but this academic liberal approach may lead us where I said.  I thank the Minister for his contribution. We have been blaming the Labour Party, possibly wrongly, for the instigation of this legislation.  It is obvious now the instigation has come from the if-you-cannot-beat-them-join-them element in Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I come now to the section.  I am sorry to have to be so blunt.  I cannot afford the diplomatic refineries and verbiage of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Being a mere backbencher I have not the time he has or the status he enjoys.  However, after that good-humoured exchange, I hope, let us get back to the section.  Before the adjournment of the debate on this section&mdash;it is on the record and I do not intend to delay the House&mdash;I made a point on subsection (1) paragraph (iv).  It seems to me that there is a grave practical difficulty in enforcing it.  I have not got the Official Report with me.  That is my fault.  I do not wish to delay the House particularly as the guillotine is to be applied.  I wonder does the Minister recollect the point I was making or has it been brought to his notice?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House by repeating it but there is something in the section which needs to be examined.  There are imperfections of this nature within the context of the section.  I freely conceded that the discretionary trust, like the private trading company, was a device which was over-availed of.  It was invented by legal ingenuity and exploited by legal ingenuity for the purpose of avoiding death duties.  If we are accepting the replacement and reimposition of that capital duty, we should try to make the section as equitable and workable as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> It is in that spirit I would ask the Minister whether he has considered this point where the corpus is situated outside the State and the settlor is outside the State or otherwise inaccessible, and only the <i>cestui que trust,</i> the beneficiaries, are within the State.  Is it possible to capture that? The answer given to me was that from an income tax point of view the Revenue Commissioners would have information and so forth.  Putting it in rather simple and rather crude terms I said that Johnny's Aunt Mary might send sums of money periodically, irregularly and in different forms.  Is that income?  The actual sums might be traced on arrival.  Are they taxable income?  Can they be captured if they are based on an extra-territorial trust?  This was an impromptu question and I would be interested to know the Minister's answer before we leave the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  It raises a slight difficulty of another sort.  That was essentially the suggestion made in friendly debate with the Minister for Lands on the last occasion.  A very simple answer is that we can trace the money coming in and, if we cannot treat it as capital, we will treat it as income and tax it under income tax. If it were being taxed as income tax and that was a bigger burden than taxing it as capital the person concerned would plead that it was capital in order to pay the lesser taxation.  Is the section sufficiently wide to enable such a procedure to be adopted?  The Minister thought I wanted an amendment but I was raising a difficulty on the section as a point for focussing on. I have not any very illumined alternative solution to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We may be able to home in on this matter with greater precision when we come to section 14 which deals with accountable persons, the persons who are accountable for payment of the tax because, in the last analysis, that is the critical matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The accountable person is likely to be the recipient. I am thinking of the ordinary com-mon-or-garden person who is paying the tax.  I do not want to anticipate section 14 but perhaps I would be allowed to make this general remark. It appears to me that when it comes to enforcement we must keep clearly in mind the practical distinction between people such as professional people, trustees, personal representatives and agents generally as accountable persons.  They have not sufficient interest to prompt evasion usually and have very great interest in their own integrity even from the point of view that, practically, honesty is the best policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a totally different situation in so far as the taxpayer is concerned. When he is up against this problem <Col N="1040" /> he will go to a length that no agent of the sort I have described will go. This is a practical difficulty which we may have to discuss a little later on section 14, the anti-avoidance section.</P>
    <P>What I am visualising here is the recipient of money at irregular intervals. It is probably a theoretical case to the extent that if it were a significant sum of money from the point of view of the Revenue it might be possible for the Revenue to get after it, but it would be very difficult if the only person to be got after was the beneficiary.  The Revenue Commissioners are very knowledgeable people in these things in the normal way, and the example I gave of regular donations from my Aunt Mary in Boston would not be the serious one.  The serious examples would be those in which accumulations may be made in a foreign location if the settlor in corpus is there. Deputy Esmonde knows it would be very difficult for anybody to contemplate general principles in the abstract in our thinking in common law because no court ever entertains in our jurisdiction, quite apart from whatever the Minister for Foreign Affairs could let us know about the civil law jurisdictions elsewhere, but in common law jurisdictions nothing is ever decided except in a concrete case.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde is particularly equipped to comment from his practical knowledge and experience in the areas on which I am intruding.  I am afraid that possibly the inclusion of a section like this may give rise to opportunities for invasion that might be significant. Therefore it always raises the question as to whether it is wise to include a specific detail like this in a section which makes it quite clear what are the limitations of the discretion and power of the Revenue Commissioners. I am back again to my <i>delenda est,</i> in that I am again pleading for certain discretions while at the same time agreeing with adequate powers for the Revenue Commissioners.  In this I agree with the Minister for Foreign Affairs that short of providing that <Col N="1041" /> they would be as essential as they would be in any drift into a Liberian position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I would be in favour of a certain amount of discretion. I would cut the cackle and face the facts and let there not be the facade that we are limiting powers that in fact we are not limiting.  I agree with the Minister about the need to secure the maximum public morale for the acceptance of taxation and co-operation in its payment, but I wonder does this paragraph do anything to help or is there some other little thing needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to one of the points raised by Deputies Colley and de Valera.  I am very much in tune with what Deputy de Valera said at the end of his remarks but I was puzzled as to why he made such an impassioned plea earlier on of a more general type.  My point in intervening in this section is because I think the importance of the section is that it is crucial to find within a common law system a solution to the problem of discretionary trusts which would deal with the genuine problems but would not, however, leave scope for avoidance which would destroy the basic reason for this legislation which has a very marked anti-avoidance feature.  That was the purpose of my speaking on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept what Deputy Colley has said, that this has been done with the assistance of the Opposition.  I fully accept that this is something we have worked on together, but on the basis of the original Bill, the section basically does what is necessary and it seems to me we have resolved what could have been a crucial dilemma in the whole process of legislating for this body of capital taxation.  As I have said, I cannot quite reconcile the very reasonable approach of Deputy de Valera at the end of his remarks with what he said in more general terms earlier.  What he seemed to be saying earlier is that if one tackles the question of avoidance effectively, in <Col N="1042" /> some way one is weakening and undermining the economy to such a degree as to lead to political chaos.  That seemed to be what he was saying.</P>
    <P>I can quite see that if in dealing with avoidance one had to take measures so drastic in terms as to give discretion to the Revenue Commissioners to tax whom they like as much as they like, then you would have a system so uncertain and inequitable that it would create problems for the democratic system.  I fully accept that limitation.  Therefore, I was glad that we were able to deal with the point of avoidance without having to give that discretion which would be undemocratic and unacceptable.  It is very important that we solve that problem. If we do not and if it were to be the case that it was impossible to reform the capital taxation system in such a way as to minimise avoidance without taking the kind of drastic undemocratic measures that have been referred to, then it would raise a doubt of the viability in justice of the capitalist system.</P>
    <P>If we accept this system in its mixed form, with the large measure of State enterprise we have, which from a broad political viewpoint is a desirable one, then we must try to resolve this problem because the unacceptable face of capitalism would be totaly unacceptable if avoidance could not be tackled. I do not think people would accept a system which was as defective as that.</P>
    <P>That is where I see the danger.  This section is crucial to the Bill.  Our success in legislating in a common-law situation for the first time for discretionary trusts, seemed to me from the beginning, before the Bill was drafted, to be crucial to our success in tackling this problem.  That is why I was moved to speak on the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would be entitled to reply to one specific misunderstanding&mdash;I would prefer to say rather than misrepresentation&mdash;of what I have said, with the diplomatic politeness I should accord to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the game he is currently playing.  All I would say is that the Minister has not put <Col N="1043" /> me in context.  May I just record that, and I hope the record will show what I have said.</P>
      <P>Getting back from Second Reading speeches or any general discussions, it is a different thing to talk about the policy of the Bill as a whole and to talk about the section, and it is the section we are dealing with.  My point was that I wanted to try to help to improve this section.  Perhaps I might be permitted to say this for the benefit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has not been in on this legislation &mdash;nobody can criticise him for this; he has been busy elsewhere&mdash;that our attitude on this side of the House has been strictly this: we have opposed the principles of these Bills for good and sufficient reasons stated on the Second Readings and on the other Stages but when it comes to Committee Stage our attitude is that two things arise on any section like this: one, the particular policy of the section itself may be objectionable and then we oppose it in principle and on policy, but if we do that then the attitude is to try to co-operate as far as we can to improve the section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

The Minister for Finance cannot fault us to much on that approach.  I am saying this so that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will understand the context in which I said these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point in brief, without repeating myself, is that I wonder should paragraph (1) (b) (iv) be omitted, particularly having regard to (c) as being ineffective and, in providing for something that is not completely effective, may provide the mechanics for evasion and that possibly in a case like that a more general provision would be better, even, as I said, if the only way of getting out of the situation that I <Col N="1044" /> dealt with, thinking in terms of income tax, was to take some special step.  I was not able to help the Minister with a positive amendment or proposal here.  I did want to help him, but expressing my fears, and if they are not grounded I am very happy and will not delay the House or the Minister any further on that.  Nor do I expect any analytical answer.  If there is anything the Revenue Commissioners can be caught on they will have been alerted and no doubt will take what they consider to be appropriate action.</P>

However, I have drawn his attention to it and if he is satisfied with the position, that is a matter for him.</P>

Paragraph (c) provides that in the case of a foreign trust &ldquo;the following property shall in addition to its entire Irish property be liable to tax, that is to say, the proportion of its property outside the State which is equal to the proportion that its Irish beneficiaries bears to all the beneficiaries.&rdquo;  To give an example, if the Irish beneficiaries represent one-quarter of the total beneficiaries, then one-quarter of the property outside the State would be deemed to be Irish property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This deals with a life interest or a limited interest which is comprised in a discretionary trust. Where an individual has a limited interest in property the property <Col N="1046" /> underpinning the limited interest is the taxable wealth.  The relevant sections as regards the individuals are subsection (3) of section 3 and paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (5) of that section. The same treatment is accorded to a limited interest in the hands of a discretionary trust by the application of these relevant parts of section 3 with, of course, any necessary modifications to the limited interest.  The result is that where the discretionary trust has acquired a limited interest the property in which the limited interest subsists is the taxable wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister means that is the taxable wealth in so far as the trust is concerned. Does this bring us back to the question we had before that this is a case in which the tax can be levied on both parties, that is, in this case, the trust on the one hand and the owner of the superior interest on the other? Does it mean that either can be assessed in respect of what, in effect, is the whole property, not just a limited interest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will accept that two people cannot own the one property at the same time and there can only be one liability to tax. If the person with the limited interest hands that over to the discretionary trust then it becomes part of the trust property.  If the trust property has it and wants to get rid of it then it can be appointed out of the trust.</P>

      <P>What the Minister said would make sense to me in the normal way but I have to have regard to the provisions of subsection (4) of section 3 and also to (ii) at the top of page 3.  I think the effect of those two together is that the limited interest is the taxable wealth of both parties, and the question arises as to who is going to be liable.  In this case <Col N="1047" /> it would be the taxable wealth of the discretionary trust and of the owner of what I may call the superior interest.

      <P>The Minister has said that there cannot be two owners of the one property at the one time, and I would agree with that proposition, but it is not what the Bill says, and in relation to a discretionary trust it would now appear that where the property in the trust includes a limited interest the position will be that the trust and the owner of the superior interest will both be liable in respect of that limited interest and that the Revenue Commissioners will be entitled to choose which they will go for.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo; is defined in subsection(1) and it includes both</P>
      <P>a remainder expectant on the determination of a lease,</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>a reversion expectant on the determination of a limited interest created by the person.</P>
      <P>That is at the bottom of page 2 and top of page 3 of the Bill.  In subsection (4) of section 3 it is provided that</P>
      <P>where the property to which an individual is beneficially entitled in possession includes a reversion expectant on the determination of a limited interest, the individual shall himself be deemed to be entitled in possession to that limited interest and the provision of this section shall apply accordingly.</P>
      <P>Let us take those two provisions together. First of all, there would appear to be a conflict between them, but we dealt with this before and I understood the Minister to say that the practical effect was that both parties were deemed to be entitled in possession and, therefore, liable for wealth tax on the limited interest and that since both were liable in respect of the same property and the Revenue Commissioners would not be collecting the tax twice in respect of the same property in practice what would happen would be that the Revenue Commissioners would opt as between one or the other.  If that is so that would appear to me to include the position in regard to the discretionary trust under subsection (5).  It does not make a great deal of sense to me.  The proposition put forward by the Minister that you cannot have two owners of the same property at the one time makes sense to me, but I do not think that is what the Bill says, and that is not what the Minister is proposing to do in regard to a discretionary trust.</P>

In other words, it is making clear that these items set out are in fact deemed to be a limited interest in addition to what would normally be a limited interest and that the treatment of a limited interest in general in the Bill, which presumably should apply to a discretionary trust also is, as I have stated and not as the Minister said, that you cannot have two owners of the one property at the one time.</P>

I do not think he can say that because the use of the phrase &ldquo;limited interest&rdquo; in section 5 (5) is clearly related back to the definition section.  Therefore, what is being provided in section 5 (5) is that where there is a limited interest, as defined in section 1, forming part of the trust property, then sections 3 (3) and paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 3 (5) <Col N="1050" /> will apply.

      <P>A general comparison of section 3 with section 5 and indeed section 6 should entail a note of where the sections differ and where they are together.  The taxable wealth of a discretionary trust shall include all property.  The taxable wealth of an individual is essentially the same concept but has to be worded differently.  I want to come back to points like the one I made on section 5 (1) (a) (iv).  There is in the sections referred to in section 5 (5) reference to section 3 (3) and also reference to subsection (5).  In particular there is reference to paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 3 (5).  Paragraph (b) refers to annuity or other periodic payment which is not charged or secured on any property.  It also refers to income or part of income or an annuity or other periodic payment on property.  This raises in a much more general manner than I raised the import of these paragraphs in subsection (5) of the section under discussion and the question of periodic payment as a measure of limited interest.  It seems to suggest to me periodic payments which are irregular and can be taken out of the category of periodic&mdash;almost by definition one considers an annuity to be a periodic payment&mdash;and income.  The Minister could perhaps help me on this point.  When one looks at the question of income how does this element of periodicity come in?  If somebody is assessable for income tax and does a casual job on television, for instance, and is paid for it the State body concerned will be very careful to co-operate with the Revenue Commissioners by noting that that payment has been made and is returnable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question in relation to a block <Col N="1052" /> of wealth or assets which are the property of the subject of this section can be dealt with in a broad discretionary way, but does the use of the words &ldquo;periodic&rdquo; and &ldquo;annuity&rdquo;&mdash;and these defined words are designed primarily to capture what might escape&mdash;also circumscribe and leave a lot of scope for the further exploitation of devices or other things?  If one takes subsection (5) is it required to bring in these subsections from the earlier section? What would be the consequences of omitting this subsection?</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister will say that this already is in for individuals and that its omission would be as significant as its inclusion.  I take that point straightaway and I see the difficulty. It would mean a throwback. This is always a difficulty we meet at Committee Stage.  Something occurs on a later section which suggests possibly even a new approach to a section which has already gone.  We cannot help that.  We can only point out to the Minister that there may be substance in it.  That particular section includes a limited interest.  The section starts off by saying that the taxable wealth of a discretionary trust shall be all the property.  Other considerations are then put into it.  Going into fine detail in regard to trusts and limited interests makes me wonder whether this is necessary or desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question of the necessity of putting in the words &ldquo;periodic payment&rdquo;. This has been utilised in the past in order to avoid annual payment and to get over certain taxation provisions in other Bills.  The legal profession have advised people to so draw their documents to avoid being caught within the taxation net.  Basically, the first thinking in regard to taxation was to base tax on annual payments. That is the reason why the words &ldquo;periodic payment&rdquo; are used.  If I find that a client is going to be stuck for an annual payment I will change that perhaps to quarterly or to a payment every second year or every 18 months and still give him the same amount as he would get on an annual basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an incidence of this if my memory is correct. There is a stamp duty on covenants and it is at a different rate on an annual covenant to what it is on another period of payment.  I have a distinct recollection of deeds where the period was changed in order to avoid stamp duty on an annual payment. I changed it to quarterly or to a nine-month period or to 13 months. I changed it to get my client outside having to pay what would have been a higher rate of tax.  This is here to deal with that sort of situation.</P>

      <P>There are some other points I want to put to the Minister before we conclude on this section. The Minister will appreciate that I am in some difficulty because some time has elapsed since we dealt with this section before.  I am not certain whether this point was raised but I do not think it was.  In regard to subsection (3) it says:</P>
      <P>Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners that a discretionary trust exists on the valuation date for the exclusive benefit of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) one or both parties to a marriage, or</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (3), after line 1, to insert &ldquo;but does not include&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  a body corporate (other than a company within the meaning of section 2 of the Companies Act, 1963) established by or under an Act of the Oireachtas, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  a company within the meaning of section 2 of the Companies Act, 1963, which is under the control of a Minister of State,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On reconsideration it appears that the section as drafted had the effect of making taxable entities of certain companies which were not intended to come within the scope of the section.  Among those unintentionally captured by the section could be State bodies established by statute and companies under the control of a Minister of State.  As regards (i),  State bodies such as the ESB and Bord na Móna are bodies corporate without being incorporated as companies under the provisions of the Companies Acts. They are incorporated under special Acts.  If they had less than 50 shareholders and had not issued shares to the public and were under the control of not more than five persons and fell into the non-trading category, they could be liable and taxable entities. As regards (ii)  there are quite a number of companies in which the Minister for Finance holds the vast bulk of the shares, the remainder being held by nominees or, in some cases, by another State company.  As the section stands they would be taxable entities.  In subsection (3)  company as such is defined and at the end of the subsection such of those companies as are treated as private non-trading companies are defined.  It was never the intention that the bodies or companies referred to at (i) and (ii) should be regarded as companies for the purposes of this section.  The purpose of the amendment, therefore, is to take them out of the definition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it this is a reasonable amendment because I think it is reasonable to expect that it was not intended that what are broadly called State companies would be subject to wealth tax.  There is, <Col N="1059" /> however, an implication in this which ought to be considered.  There are many State companies&mdash;I am using that term in the particular sense of covering what is covered in the Minister's amendment&mdash;which are in effect in competition with private enterprise. The effect of this amendment would be to exclude from liability for wealth tax these State companies in competition with private enterprise.  When I say &ldquo;private enterprise&rdquo; that includes not only individual traders but also companies in competition with State companies.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say trading companies are not liable.  That is true, and I think we dealt with this at some length before, and the position is that in so far as the impact of the wealth tax falls on shareholders in trading companies it does, of course, affect the operation of trading companies. It is quite illusory to suggest that the impact of the wealth tax on individual shareholders would not in any way affect the operations of trading companies.  Therefore, in effect what the Minister is providing in his amendment is that where State companies are in competition with private enterprise, whether in the form of individuals or companies, the State companies will have the competitive advantage conferred on them by this amendment in that they will not be affected in any way by the imposition of wealth tax, whereas private enterprise in the form I have mentioned will be so affected and thereby made less competitive with State companies. While, as I said at the outset, on the face of it this amendment would appear reasonable I think, for the reason I have given, further thought should be given to the implications to which I have drawn attention.  We are justified in saying that, in cases like this, competitive advantage is conferred on State companies as against the private sector with which many of them are in competition.  I should like to hear the Minister's view on this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking of the State as a shareholder paying tax to itself on its shareholding in the whole body of State companies. How would that book transaction inside the Exchequer affect the trading position of a trading company <i>vis-á-vis</i> the private sector?  I hope I understand it correctly.  Perhaps I do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that the fact that State companies pay valueadded tax and in some cases income tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The company pays it, not the shareholder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. The fact that such taxes are paid on the operations of State companies means that the imposition of wealth tax on the operations of State companies would not be inconceivable. The question raised is not whether it is a good idea to levy wealth on shares held by the State or shares held by individuals in the State companies. The question raised is: is it right and proper to confer an additional competitive advantage on State companies which are in competition with the private sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> In the case of many State companies there is, of course, a certain subvention from the State.  That is recorded and it is possible, to some degree at any rate, to measure the position of the State companies <i>vis-á-vis</i> their rivals and to see the degree to which they are getting assistance in their operations.  I suggest this provision would have the effect of giving a form of hidden subsidy which is not measured to enable State companies to compete more successfully with the private sector and would distort even further than is at present distorted the competitive position of State companies.</P>
    <P>I am posing the question whether that is a good or a bad thing.  I am suggesting that the Minister for Finance, by implication, is saying it is a good thing.  If he is, I want him to say openly that is what he is doing, and to justify doing it in the context of conferring a greater competitive advantage on State companies.  It is possible to make a case for that.  The point I am at is that that case should be made and it should not be slipped through without adverting to the consequences of what is being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If what the Deputy said were correct, of course a case should be made.  He has not answered the point I made.  If we are talking of a competitive position being affected it must be a trading company.  If it is not trading it cannot affect somebody else.  If it is a trading company it does not pay wealth tax.  Therefore, only the shareholders, which is the State, pay wealth tax.  What the Deputy is suggesting is that the State with its hundreds of millions of pounds invested in State companies should, through a book transaction, pay wealth tax to itself on its shareholdings. Being a circular book transaction this would in no way affect the trading position of the companies, nor would it affect the ability of the State, because it is paying the money to itself, to plough money back into State companies.  Therefore, the whole basis of the Deputy's case is faulty in fact and the question of affecting the trading position does not arise. Perhaps the Deputy would advert to <Col N="1067" /> my argument and tell me if I am wrong.  I may be wrong.  Would he say where I am wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister say that the imposition of wealth tax would not affect the operations of a company&mdash;I am talking about the shareholding in State trading companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the State as shareholder would be liable for wealth tax on hundreds of millions of pounds invested.  The sum of money would be calculated and the State would pay that money to itself.  The net position of the State is unchanged. The State's ability, therefore, to plough money back into the company, which is the point the Deputies are talking about, is unaffected.  The case being made by the Deputies is that wealth tax can in certain circumstances affect the viability of a company because if there is a shareholding in a private company which keeps it going by ploughing money back in, the shareholding's ability to plough money back in is affected.</P>
      <P>This has not been covered by the provisions of the legislation and we are endeavouring to cover it to a very large degree.  We are now talking about whether if the State were exempt from having to pay tax on its shareholdings in State companies its competitive position would be affected. Its competitive position could be affected if the State, by having to pay tax to itself, found its ability to plough money back into the companies adversely affected, thereby changing its competitive position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the private sector.  Because it has been paying the money to itself, unlike private companies who pay money to the State, this could not have that effect, and therefore the difficulties the Deputies are raising are inoperative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is completely missing the point Deputy Colley has been making.  Each semi-State company stands on its own feet. The capital is provided by the State and therefore the shareholders are the <Col N="1068" /> State.  In its trading situation, its competitive situation, its financial situation, each State company either gets a massive subsidy affecting the charge for its services&mdash;that is what the Minister is missing&mdash;and it is not a question of each semi-State body being part of the Exchequer.  It is a separate entity in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this may be the case.  There are some companies which are not affected.  We are talking now about whether the State as shareholder in a State trading company&mdash;it must be a trading company or this issue would not arise&mdash; having to pay tax to itself on its shareholding in a State company would affect the operation of the State companies.  The only way I can conceive that it would affect it is if as a result of imposing this obligation to pay wealth tax, the State's ability to plough money into these companies was unfavourably affected, thereby creating a situation of parity with trading companies.  Because the State is paying the money to itself, that could not happen, and as I do not see any other way in which the payment of wealth tax by the State in respect of its shareholdings could affect the competitiveness of State companies I do not think there is any argument. If there is some other way I have not understood, perhaps Deputies opposite would mention it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Allow me to make the distinction which the Minister is missing and which Deputy Brugha drew attention to.  If, for instance, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were a company, that case would be completely covered by what the Minister <Col N="1069" /> said because both the trading and the capital of the company would be covered.  The point of the Minister for Foreign Affairs has full validity in any case such as that which I invoked the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, where the State is not only the shareholder but also the operator and is involved in the trading accounts of that company.  But the situation is totally different in the case of semi-State bodies.  In the case of such bodies the normal thing is that the State is the owner, the shareholder, and puts the capital into it, and the body is expected to trade in normal circumstances and to be economic and successful as a business venture.  That is the whole concept of semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>Such concerns were set up because the capital to set them up was not otherwise available and, the capital coming from the State, it was right that the State should have the proprietary interest, but thereafter, in principle it is expected that each company should trade normally.  It may happen that continued subventions are necessary but I do not know of a case where, so to speak, the State enters into the routine profit and loss accounts of each body.  An essential part of the profit and loss accounts is taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But not wealth tax. That cannot enter into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Regular routine taxation has to be found out of revenue.  I go a good deal of the way with the Minister but I am trying to give him the answer to the question he posed.  Let us take CIE which are attempting to trade and are perpetually trading at a loss because they have to fulfil the role of a social service, in commercial competition.  Let us assume we are talking about a semi-State body, owned and controlled by the State, which are in competition commercially. The validity of Deputy Brugha's point is that in such cases, in the efficiency of trading, the moneys required to service the demands of taxation come from revenues earned.  I am purposely avoiding the trap the Minister for Foreign Affairs has set for me in labelling particular accounts.  Incidentally, in trading you do not necessarily <Col N="1070" /> have the same type of accounting as we have in budgetary accounts or statistical public assessments of economic returns.  I am talking about the common-or-garden businessman and of business companies such as Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about.  If what I have been saying is correct, there is a point in what Deputies Colley and Brugha have been saying, namely that there is money to be found for taxation in the case of the private company that we do not have to find in the other type of company.</P>
      <P>I admit the validity of what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said&mdash; that in the last analysis it leads to the absurdities he postulated, but then there are many absurdities in our financial and banking system.  We have to live with the realities, which in this case is that if there are two such companies in competition, a trading company can provide taxes.  Of course, the question of a trading company comes into this in a peculiar way.</P>

      <P>No.  My reference to the ESB and Bord na Móna was simply to give examples of incorporated bodies which were set up other than under the Companies Act.  That was the only purpose of that.  I would accept that this has led to some confusion. I then went on to deal with the situation of private non-trading companies.  A State body might be regarded as a non-trading company, and they will now be dealt with as trading companies.</P>

      <P>I confess that just for the moment the Minister for Foreign Affairs put me off course. Fair enough, in the cut and thrust of debate.  The point is that I was making the point about revenues here and revenues for taxation.  Although you make the distinction between the shareholder and the company itself, in the last analysis the company is the shareholder, the shareholder is the company and the taxation coming off the shareholders is going to have a repercussion on the company itself, because it means there are levels of remuneration required at the capital level and that affects trading accounts. I am still back to where I started&mdash; a comparison of the revenues here.</P>

      <P>All right.  If it is a non-trading company, if you put me back on the question of a non-trading company, in that case, I grant you, there is some substance in what the Minister says, but in the case of a non-trading company it boils down to this, that the State is furthermore moving in a direction of socialisation. That is all I can say about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this amendment there is another <Col N="1072" /> very interesting point.  &ldquo;Under the control of a Minister of State&rdquo;&mdash;I wonder could that not have unforeseen consequences. I am not accusing the Minister, but could the Minister not possibly conceive of the situation where a company would be put under the control of somebody and that somebody would become a Minister of State by election to this House and by selection of the Taoiseach into a Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question I am asking.  Would that simple process exempt the company?  I ask it with full consciousness that the Interpretation Acts or some other provisions will cover the point I am making but <i>prima facie</i> it is &ldquo;under the control of a Minister of State&rdquo;.  I know the Minister will appeal to the essential difference between himself as Deputy Ryan and himself as the Minister for Finance with a corporate sole.  He would make that distinction in his own case and a similar distinction for any of his colleagues or a similar Minister sitting over there, but I wonder is that a sufficient distinction for the purposes of an Act of this nature.  It is clearly the intention&mdash;and I am making no further point on it than that&mdash;but if that possibility were there it might be as well to ensure that it was not.  In other words, in contemplation of law and accepted interpretation, is it quite clear that the phrase in an Act, &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo;, can mean and mean only&mdash;the important thing is can mean and mean only&mdash;the corporate person who is the Minister of State and whose corporate identity is personified in the seal of office?  If that is so, the intention here, which is not impeached, will be properly implemented, but if perchance the phrase should be interpreted to have a wider meaning&mdash;and in this connection we have had some surprising results of the constitutionality of statutes that were thought to be clear &mdash;having regard to the wording of the Constitution for the setting up of Ministers and the Government and to other relevant enactments and case law, is the Minister absolutely satisfied that that would not automatically import an exemption <Col N="1073" /> of a company if it was under the control of a person who happened to become a Minister of State.</P>
      <P>It is not a likely thing, and the Minister might answer that in any case it is customary for people to resign such posts, but there is no constitutional requirement, unlike the case of the Judiciary, and there has been controversy in this House about office-holders, Ministers even holding similar offices simultaneously with the office of Minister.  It would be useful to have that point examined.</P>
      <P>As I say, I clearly appreciate the intention here and, read in connection with subparagraph (1) of the amendment, the intention would seem to be abundantly clear.  Nevertheless, there are technicalities and this is tax law and it would indeed create a very piquant situation&mdash;it might even be a motive for seeking the office&mdash;and even amending retrospective legislation might not cure it.  If there is any danger I suggest that the wording should be looked at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I was making the point that there were three major ills facing the country at this time&mdash;(1) inflation, (2) unemployment and (3) the balance of payments deficit.  I was querying whether the budget introduced a couple of weeks ago did anything to cure any of those three evils.  At budget time a Minister for Finance must look at the economy as a whole, taking in all sections. There are two sections of our economy in serious trouble and neither of them got any assistance in the recent budget.  They are the fishing industry and the horticultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> Last April we saw the spectacle of the fishermen, normally a quiet group in the community, forced into taking militant action, blockading the port at Dublin and some other ports. Throughout the history of this State fishermen have been passive but at this time their plight had got so bad that they had to take some drastic action to bring the attention of the country and the Government to the problems of their industry.  It is not a small industry.  There are over 5,500 full-time fishermen and about 4,000 part-time fishermen.  There are about 2,000 engaged in the processing industry and in the region of 1,000 working in boat building.  The industry faces many problems.  There has been a lack of Government action.  The representatives of the fishermen have been calling for certain actions to be taken by the Government&mdash;the restructuring of the fishing fleet, education, marketing, shore facilities, conservation, fishing limits, the potential of the industry and a marine rescue service.</P>
    <P>One point that is of immediate importance to the fishermen is the question of oil subsidies.  Any Deputy who represents a maritime constituency will be familiar in the last few months with the sight of fishing boats tied up at the harbour wall.  Because of the high cost of fuel it was not an economic proposition to go to sea and sell catches at the prices that were going in the markets.  What action was taken by the Government to carry the fishermen over this difficult period?  No action whatever. There were various promises, various meetings with the fishermen's representatives, but no action.  The Minister had his opportunity last month to take some of the burden off the fishermen's shoulders by giving them an oil subsidy but as is typical of this Government no action was taken.  Various minor reliefs were given, supposed subsidies on certain goods but, of course, these have been eaten up already by inflation.  No assistance was given to the fishing industry which employs quite a number of people.  The Minister with a stroke of a pen could have helped this industry by a fuel subsidy.  The problems <Col N="1075" /> of the fishing industry can be linked with those of the horticultural industry.</P>
    <P>In July, 1974, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, realising the problems of the horticultural industry, gave a subsidy of 5p per gallon on fuel used for heating glasshouses. However, he gave it for the last six months of the year when only about 20 per cent of the oil is used instead of giving it for the first six months of the year when 80 per cent of the oil is used.  The greatest need for fuel oil is during the winter to bring in the early crop.  From about September on we on this side and I personally put a number of questions to the Minister about the possibility of continuing and increasing the size of the oil subsidy.  The Minister refused to give any decision and then in January he came forward with a subsidy of 2p.  In the meantime oil costs went up and inflation further exacerbated the situation.  If the growers needed 5p for the last six months of last year from July onwards, surely they needed at least 7p or 8p for the January to June period of 1975?  The Government, in my view, attempted to destroy the glasshouse industry and gave them a miserable 2p.  I do not lightly make the charge of the Government agreeing to the destruction of the glasshouse industry because about six weeks ago Mr. Lardinois, the Commissioner for Agriculture, succeeded in pushing through the European Parliament, against the Fianna Fáil members who voted against the proposal, a system of initiating grants to take down glasshouses.  This was done after the Fianna Fáil Government year by year encouraged the growth of the horticultural industry.  Those same people are now being given grants to take the glasshouses down for which they were given grants to put up.</P>
    <P>It is not alone the Fianna Fáil Party who are aware of the importance of the horticultural industry. <i>The Fingal Independent</i> of 27th December, 1974 and 3rd January, 1975, referred to this industry.  It was stated in one of those issues that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> Mr. Donegan, speaking at Termonfeckin said, horticulture today is big business, giving a good return to those engaged in it who have the necessary knowledge and skill. In addition, it provides one with outdoor life with plenty of variety. The level of job satisfaction in growing crops for the market is greater than in most occupations.</P>
    <P>The Minister was only too well aware of the importance of the horticultural industry, but he is a Member of a Government that at the very time he was speaking in Termonfeckin was taking a cold decision to destroy the glasshouse industry.  That is the only way one can describe what the Government did.  In the previous six months they thought a subsidy of 5p was adequate for the horticultural industry, and when things get worse they reduced the subsidy to a miserable 2p.  The Government are party to a decision in the European Parliament which allowed Mr. Lardinois to ring the death knell of the horticultural industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are an independent nation and despite the fact the Government are incapable of making a number of decisions they could at least give some subsidisation to the two sections of the community I speak about, the fishermen who have their boats tied up at the harbours and the horticultural industry that is going rapidly to the wall.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I said there were ills facing the country, inflation, unemployment and a balance of payments deficit, but there is a fourth one which comes down to the question of confidence. Unless the business community and the public generally have confidence in how the country is going and have confidence in the Government ruling it the country cannot advance.  The Irish people had confidence in the Government up to the time of the last general election.  They felt there was a good Government which was governing the country well. They felt that progress was being made at a steady pace.  This confidence has gone and it cannot come back until there is a change of Government. <Col N="1077" /> The Minister for Finance, since he came to office, has brought in five budgets.  I call on him and the Government, having failed to manage the financial affairs of the country, as can be seen by over 100,000 unemployed, the plight of our school leavers with no jobs to go to and the lack of investment, to resign, call a general election and let the people once again come back to a one party Government of the Fianna Fáil party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Two non-events of this financial year were the January budget and the recent budget. The Minister rightly described the January budget as a holding operation. It was holding on to the <i>status quo</i> and holding on to a situation where the financial house was tumbling about their ears.  In view of the fact that the January budget did not have any beneficial effect on the three major problems of the economy, inflation, unemployment and the lack of confidence among people, who would invest in industry and other productive schemes, one would have thought that the Minister would have taken steps to ensure that the fiasco created by the January budget was not repeated.</P>
      <P>I imagine that what the Minister meant by the January budget being a holding operation was that it was to hold the situation from getting any worse.  This budget is a pulling operation. He is trying to pull back from the situation mainly created in the January budget of the economy going into reverse.  This budget can also be described as a holding budget with a certain element of pulling away from a regressive situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When will the Government get down to a serious effort at tackling problems which are affecting the country, unemployment at such a very high figure, increase in inflation and the balance of payments which is a catastrophe for the country?  Will we have more financial measures in the autumn?  Are we to go into 1976 and have a budget in January of that year with a situation where inflation is rising, unemployment rising further, a balance of payments problem and a budgetary deficit of between <Col N="1078" /> £250 million and £300 million?  One can visualise the measures which will then need to be taken, despite their unpopularity, so that if this Government are still there they will have, for the first time, to get down to work and to make up for the neglect of the two or perhaps three budgets of 1975.</P>
    <P>Before dealing generally with the provisions of the present second budget of 1975 now under discussion it would be a good idea to let the Minister know how this budget will affect the economy of Donegal.  I should mention the transport problem and the subsidies paid to CIE.  There is a very serious transport problem for manufacturers, industrialists, farmers and fishermen in the northern half of county Donegal. In that part of the county freight and passenger transport services were provided by the Lough Swilly Railway Company whose head office is in Derry city.</P>
    <P>A month ago 50 employees of this company were notified of their impending redundancy in the freight section of that company.  We appealed to the Minister but nothing has happened. These employees will lose their jobs.  The industrial economy of the area will be seriously affected.  The agricultural community, because of the distance from centres of population in the rest of the Republic, already have serious transport problems.</P>
    <P>The Lough Swilly Railway Company will continue to operate some part of the freight service.  CIE are being allocated the remainder of that service in that area but the employees are not being taken over.  The existing company are handing over a major part of their freight transport to CIE.  The employees are being made redundant. There is no responsibility on CIE to re-employ them.  They are falling between two stools.  There is a complicated freight transport position at the moment.  Nobody knows how much the Lough Swilly Railway Company will continue to carry or what items CIE will carry.  The freight services in Donegal should be taken over completely by CIE.</P>
    <P>The Lough Swilly Railway Company have received a subsidy before now, but unless they are given a subsidy and all the freight there will still be a <Col N="1079" /> complicated situation.  CIE have already got a subsidy and they should get an increased subsidy to cater for this position.  They should get all the freight so that the workers will know where they stand, as well as the agricultural and business communities.  The situation will be neglected.  I would advocate that some of the subsidies being granted in this budget should go to create a transport system which will be satisfactory to the community.</P>
    <P>I also wish to speak about the textile industry.  I have raised this problem before on a number of occasions during debates, by way of Dáil question and in discussion in time allocated for Private Members' Business.  The only concession given in this budget to the textile industry in Donegal and elsewhere&mdash;and especially to the shirt industry which is a major part of the textile industry in Donegal&mdash;is the abolition of VAT on clothing and other commodities. I inquired from the Minister at the time of his budget statement whether the abolition of VAT on home-manufactured clothing would apply only to home-manufactured clothing or to imported clothing also and the answer he gave me was that it would apply also to imported clothing.</P>
    <P>The precarious position of the textile manufacturers has been mentioned in the Dáil.  Reference has been made to the problems of my constituents and of the fears of redundancies in the shirt and hosiery industries.  The problems of unemployment and of the closing down of shirt factories have been mentioned. There is nothing in this budget which gives the employees any hope. Unfortunately the Minister for Industry and Commerce refuses to take any steps to remedy the situation. There is a dumping problem but the Minister refuses to admit to its existence.  He refuses to tackle it.  He could impose import duties and quotas on foreign goods but this has not been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance gave the impression that he was going to do something for the relief of the shoe manufacturing industry and the textile <Col N="1080" /> industry.  He said that the abolition of VAT would be of assistance to them, but it will also be of assistance to importers and to manufacturers in Korea, Thailand and Hong Kong.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will meet a deputation from Donegal next week.  I hope he will have something hopeful to say to those engaged in the textile industry.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this budget which will help those engaged in agriculture, fishing and services such as water and sewerage.  No provision is made for the small farmers of Donegal or the west generally.  We have the situation in the west where the farm modernisation scheme which we on this side opposed does not cater for the vast bulk of farmers and there is no other farm grant scheme which does cater for the smaller farmers.  We should have had some indication in these budgetary provisions of what the Government were going to do by way of grant to the smaller farmers who cannot become transitional farmers, cannot become development farmers and who, because they are not classified as either of these, cannot avail of grants as from 1st of February, 1974.</P>
    <P>Even if there is delay in carrying out the Directive No. 161 on the disadvantaged areas agreement in the meantime the Government should not sit back and say &ldquo;We will do something for you when the finer points, the nitty-gritty points, of the disadvantaged areas scheme are sanctioned&rdquo;.  The Government should step in now, because I would hope that when the disadvantaged areas scheme is in operation there will be a substantial contribution by the national exchequer on top of whatever grants may be available from the EEC scheme, but it is not good enough in the interregnum period to sit back and wait.  If the Government can take no action to speed up the operation of this scheme, they should at least in the meantime pay grants and adopt schemes.</P>
    <P>In the case of the other two directives, Nos. 159 and 164, one providing for farm pensions to get small <Col N="1081" /> farmers off the land, the Minister for Lands boasted that he went much further in that direction, with much better grants than his EEC partners have done and has given better terms in order to get small farmers off the land.  In the case of the farm modernisation scheme, 75 per cent of the grants available are moneys provided by the national exchequer, only 25 per cent coming from EEC funds. Will the Minister be able to boast when the disadvantaged areas scheme comes into operation that he has done better <i>vis-á-vis</i> his EEC partners in respect of that scheme and will he be able to say that the Government and the Department of Agriculture have agreed to give 75 per cent of the moneys for this scheme?  It will be interesting to see, and I warn the Minister that if he does not do as well in respect of the disadvantaged areas scheme we will be asking pertinent questions in this House.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, it is not enough, in relation to the 80 per cent of farmers who are classified as small farmers, for the Minister to sit back and say: &ldquo;This scheme is not in operation yet.  It has not been fully sanctioned and the terms of this scheme are being negotiated.&rdquo;  That is not enough.  Since 1st January, 1974, the small farmers are twiddling their thumbs, not able to provide for very desirable schemes, and if there is to be a further delay, the Government should step in and say that these grants are available from national funds now.  As a matter of fact this should have been done 12 months ago and the Minister is not doing it in this budget.  I criticise the budget for that neglect and especially in view of the overall fact that in this budget the farming community are receiving the lowest allocation of funds for the development of their industry.  The sum of £3.8 million or £3.5 million for the farming industry is the lowest of any of the provisions announced by the Minister in this budget.</P>
    <P>I will not follow up the fishing industry where Deputy Burke has made a very good case for the giving of aid. The fishing industry people have in their minds a number of question <Col N="1082" /> marks as to what is to happen about the fuel situation, about limits, about prices and about fish imports.  We would excuse the Minister bringing in a third or fourth budget this year to provide for these people and remove the question marks from the minds of fishermen and the minds of many others engaged in the economy of the country.  The sooner the better.</P>
    <P>Again, and this applies nation wide, there is the matter of water and sewerage schemes.  The Minister for Local Government announced recently that the provisions in this budget will provide 2,000 extra jobs in the building industry.  This, again, is trying to pull back the building industry from the situation in which it is in reverse gear, and when an industry is in reverse gear the pulling back process can be a more difficult one than any holding operation the Minister for Finance talks about.  In the past few months, about 1,000 people have disappeared from the construction industry and I fear that the Minister is more than hopeful in saying that he can, in a reasonable length of time, add 2,000 to the dwindling figures of employment in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the west of the country, I would ask how much is in this budget for the Gaeltacht areas.  It is not enough after two-and-a-half years for the Minister for the Gaeltacht to continue to engage in a publicity campaign to show on paper new projects starting up here and there, new projects in the pipeline and new projects being announced, some of them being announced three and four times. The people of the Gaeltacht deserve an answer to the questions they are now asking.  Where are these industries? When are we going to get them?  What is the position about the small farming community in the Gaeltacht?  When will grants be available for farm operations, for specialised farming?  What about the factories needed there such as that which Deputy Faulkner as Minister had built, in Gweedore, for example, and also throughout the country where advance factories were provided? Are there any plans to train workers <Col N="1083" /> for these factories or to train local people for management?  I see no provision here in that regard.  It is good to provide industrial employment for the people of the Gaeltacht and western counties, but if we are to be serious about the Irish language we must ensure that not only are those on the shop floor Irish speakers but that management and key operators and technicians will set an example. Unless that is done there will be a serious problem.  A start was made on this four or five years ago at the AnCO training centre at Gweedore. But that is not enough; there must be progress in this type of training.</P>
    <P>Regarding the very serious problem of inflation the Minister in his speech said that the future prosperity and growth of the country depend on exports and to remedy the inflationary situation we must produce and we must sell.  What is there in the budget to encourage manufacturers to produce more at prices at which we can sell? The 4 per cent reduction in the cost of living envisaged by the budget provisions is already partly eroded by increases in electricity and other charges since announced.  In regard to the part of the package which is dependent on the agreement of the workers, if agreement is not reached reasonably soon the workers may not be able to accept the reductions the Minister devoutly hoped for because many workers are affected by the increases in charges that have taken place since.</P>
    <P>If future prosperity depends on exports, in order to increase exports one must pour money into the industries we have.  They must not suffer from lack of investment, but at present, money which should be available for investment in industry and agriculture is fleeing the country.  That is partly due to the situation created by the Minister for Industry and Commerce whereby if manufacturers increase their production they have no confidence that they will not be deprived of part of the home market because clearly this country is being used as a dumping ground for industrial products.  One has only to go <Col N="1084" /> into the shops to see that the gist of that statement is correct.  Not only are EEC countries but all countries in the world are using this country as a dumping ground.  This is the effect of the negligence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That Minister's hands may be tied, but one of the bitterest speeches made in this House on our accession to EEC was made by him.  Is that Minister's heart in his job?  Why is he not taking action?  If he is debarred from taking action why is he not spending more time negotiating some deal and putting our case abroad?</P>
    <P>The EEC Minister who arrived here about eight days ago said he was meeting the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He said that for the first time the Commission had received a report on the twin problems of footwear and textiles and that he would be discussing possible solutions with the Minister.  This is an unbelievable situation.  Instead of Mr. Borschette saying that here, our Minister should have been saying it 12 months ago and should have been putting forward the case for antidumping provisions and exceptions to be made in the case of this country.</P>
    <P>The other problem in the industrial field is lack of confidence in the case of those in our own country who would be prepared to invest money in new industries or in extending existing industries.  These are people who would be prepared to do this under a good Government.  Confidence is seen to be eroded.  If any industrialist walks through the shops in Dublin he might ask himself what encouragement is there for him to manufacture or increase the production of this, that or the other item, items which are freely on sale throughout the Republic.</P>
    <P>There is no price control.  A proper system of price control could negative some of the difficulties created by the lack of effort on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce is prepared to allow these imports then price control would to some extent reduce the incentive to import.  The Minister because of his lack of price control is actually making the incentive <Col N="1085" /> to import more attractive.  In a small shop in this city there were goods marked &ldquo;Made in Korea&rdquo;.  The goods were shirts.  There was a certain brand name which I shall not mention.  The same shirts in another part of the country had a sticky label placed over the &ldquo;Made in Korea&rdquo; label.  The shirts were £1 dearer.  They appeared to be identical.  I removed the sticky label and found that the cloth label which should have been underneath had been cut out.  The sewn edges were showing. The first shirts I mentioned were retailing at £2.  The latter were retailing at £3.  The genuine &ldquo;Made in Korea&rdquo; shirt was selling at about 400 per cent of the cost of import.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce can come to his own conclusions as to what happened.</P>
    <P>Since there is no price control is it not being made more attractive to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Irish manufacturer of shirts and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the traveller who comes in with South Korean shirts and says they are good value at such and such a price?  Of course it is made more attractive to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the salesman for Korean shirts and &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the salesman for Donegal shirts.  That is one aspect of the problem about which the Minister has not bothered his head.  It is symptomatic of the malaise affecting industry here.  There are a hundred and one difficulties put in the way of our own manufacturers. State aids and State assistance are not sufficient.</P>
    <P>I believe it is fair to accuse the Minister for Industry and Commerce of neglect of our industrial arm. There is no indication that this budget will improve the present unsatisfactory situation.  The Minister for Finance will have to make some provision in future&mdash;he has not done it yet&mdash;to protect our industries and assist them to export.  People in industry must be given confidence, so much confidence that they will be prepared to invest their profits in industry. Every section should have confidence in investing in industry. Steps must be taken to ensure that those who were encouraged to come in here with their money and their skills will not be left sitting on the <Col N="1086" /> fence waiting to see what is going to happen with capital gains tax, wealth tax, capital acquisitions tax and generally in the financial sphere.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget statement said that other countries, including our partners in the EEC, had taken action, in some cases quite drastic and unpopular action, to curb inflation.  As the team with the highest score inflation-wise could the Minister, the Taoiseach or any member of the Government say there is any worthwhile measure in this budget designed to do what other countries, including our partners in the EEC, have done to curb inflation? Why is something not being done? As I say, we are at the top of the league inflation-wise.  Is there something preventing our Government from taking unpopular and quite drastic action?  We would like to hear the answer to that question.  The measures taken elsewhere have been beneficial.  Should we not take similar action?  We have a more serious series of ailments to remedy.  The Minister wound up by saying we must do the same or suffer the consequences if we do not.</P>
    <P>In the first bite of the cherry in January we could excuse the Minister for not doing the same but, in the light of what has happened in the intervening period, and in the light of his experience of other countries which have taken action&mdash;Italy, for instance, reduced her inflation rate from 24 per cent to 12 per cent&mdash;in the second bite at the cherry it was expected that the Minister would take action.  He says we are in this together and we must all pull up our socks.  We know we are all together in a situation of high unemployment, high cost of living, high inflation, high adverse balance of payments and high budgetary deficits.  We have got to remedy this sooner or later, and the sooner the better.  The Minister and the Government must set the example for others to follow.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The situation is now extremely grave.  There is a growing threat caused by our intolerably high rate of inflation, to employment and to <Col N="1087" /> business generally.  There is now an inescapable obligation on all of us to accept that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House accept that.  He went on:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;collectively and individually, steps must be taken to curb inflation. The withdrawal symptoms will undoubtedly be painful but they will be far less agonising than the dreadful consequences that will ensue if we fail to correct present tendencies.</P>
    <P>The cost of living was reduced in the budget by 4 per cent on a certain limited number of commodities.  If the period which must be allowed between that announcement, which was the only one worth talking about in the budget, and the other one which was left hanging in the air, that is, the wage agreement, becomes too extended, a problem must be created. Those provisions which affect the cost of living and bring it down by 4 per cent will not last for ever.  In the meantime they may have to give other concessions.  Is he prepared to do this?</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Government will maintain as high a level of expenditure on the public capital programme as is possible in the light of the available resources.</P>
    <P>That is quite a vague statement. He went on:</P>
    <P>The first priority will continue to be investment which creates permanent and self-sustaining employment. While every effort will be made to maintain a high level of social investment, expenditure on industrial, agricultural and infrastructural investment will have first call on scarce capital resources because this kind of investment is a pre-condition of growth.</P>
    <P>Later we will be asking the Minister to indicate what investment has been made in the various spheres of productive industry and productive expenditure. So far, there is no indication that the unemployment situation has improved.  There is no indication <Col N="1088" /> that, in the long term, the evils we have been discussing in this budget will be cured.</P>
    <P>The £12 industrial subsidy will not be sufficient.  Factories have closed or gone on short time for many reasons. First, the cost of production is too high.  Secondly, goods imported from low cost countries are affecting them. Thirdly, there is an inability to sell on foreign markets.  I do not think the £12 subsidy will generate enough activity to bring back very many short-time workers into factories, and it certainly will not cause any factory to be reopened.</P>
    <P>It has been decided to subsidise butter.  We have been advocating this for some time.  I tabled questions in the Dáil about it.  I urged that we should avail of the EEC subsidy which Britain availed of.  By availing of that subsidy for butter, and by adding the statutory subvention from the Exchequer, the British were able to sell butter very much below the Irish price, in some cases almost 20p below the Irish price per lb.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries consistently refused to avail of the EEC subsidy and, as a corollary, to add so many million pounds from the Exchequer, as is required, to carry out the same operation here.  Now he has done it.</P>
    <P>Why is the subsidised price here, which is 10p per lb less than it was heretofore, still about 12p per lb higher than the price in Northern Ireland?  Is there something Britain can do that we cannot do?  Butter is an important commodity in the household budget.  While we welcome a reduction of 10p per lb, why is it not on the same line as the reduction presumably made in the same way and under the same EEC conditions in Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>I mentioned the disadvantaged areas and I notice the £27 million stimulus the Government propose to give generally in this respect by way of public capital programme.  The Minister for Local Government has told us he expects that 2,000 extra people will be employed in the building industry but I am afraid that by his lack of finance for water and <Col N="1089" /> sewerage schemes the Minister is hampering building development.  People in the private sector and small contractors who would be willing to build will find that lack of these services will be a drawback not only because of difficulty in relation to planning permission but also because local authorities are not very anxious to have small housing schemes built if the supply of these services is limited to springs for water and septic tanks for sewage disposal.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the lack of finance for these services will bring building construction throughout the country, especially of houses, to a full stop.  In County Donegal no new water or sewerage schemes can be commenced this year because the amount of money available is not sufficient to finalise schemes at present under construction.  Therefore, I urge that a reasonable proportion of the £27 million be utilised for the provision of these services which form the infrastructure for house building.</P>
    <P>Another matter in regard to house construction which it is legitimate to mention in regard to budgetary provisions is the matter of grants which have not been increased in the past four years.  It is the policy of Fianna Fáil to increase such grants by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will explain in relation to income tax collection how he proposes to introduce PAYE in relation to the Civil Service, teachers, gardaí and the Army.  Has he made some arrangements to switch over without giving it in the neck by way of double taxation to these categories? I should like to be assured that those who have been paying tax on their incomes for the financial year 1975 will not now have to do that and at the same time be switched to PAYE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government introduced this package with two objects, one to stimulate employment and the other to reduce or to control the rate of inflation.  I am sure they did this after consultation with the various interests.  There are many criticisms that could be made, one <Col N="1090" /> being that no extra taxation was imposed. The Minister opted for a deficit, but the options open to him were very limited because the amount of taxation revenue which would be derived from an increase in the usual sources might not be very great when we considered that in the previous term Exchequer returns under the various headings showed a decline.</P>
      <P>The Government have shown in this package that they are determined to reduce inflation.  If we allow the inflation rate to continue the worst sufferers would be the poorer sections and the workers.  I am not a great believer in subsidies of various kinds. For instance, subsidies on food would be enjoyed by the very rich and by those who serve food in very expensive places of entertainment.  In present circumstances it was vitally necessary to introduce subsidies in order to reduce the cost of living. The items selected for subsidisation are those that I would have selected as being used to the greatest extent by the poorer sections of the community, for instance, bread and butter.  Also, in removing VAT from fuels the Minister adopted the right line.  He is hopeful by these means to reduce the inflation rate by about 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Government's influence on inflation is limited.  The budget is designed as a package in which everyone would play a part.  Even before the Financial Statement by the Minister for Finance it was indicated clearly that there were sacrifices that would have to be made by everyone.</P>
      <P>The second objective of the budget, of course, was to increase employment. In the short-term, the extra money provided to the building industry for the provision of houses is the speediest way to create new jobs. If the building industry is doing well, a large section of the economy is doing well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that all sections of the community should regard the budget as a package and should realise that if there are certain benefits to be gained, certain sacrifices must be made.  If the worker is prepared <Col N="1091" /> to take some reduction in the national wage agreement as I believe he will, seeing the sincerity and interest of the Minister, it must be made clear to him that the income, dividends and profits being pocketed by other people will also be reduced or at least held without further increases. If all sections of the community co-operate, we can make the package work.</P>
    <P>It is essential for all of us, irrespective of the political outlook we may have, to do everything possible not only to avoid further increases in inflation but to reduce the rate of inflation. It is accepted that action must be taken and that it can be effective only with the co-operation of everyone concerned, worker and employer.  The budget is an indication of the determination of the Government to tackle the problem.  If other measures have to be taken I am sure the Government will be willing and ready to discuss them with the various interests.  It is vital that there should be a reduction in inflation and that new jobs should be created. These two things are vital to the survival of the economy and must be tackled realistically.</P>
    <P>The injection of capital into the building industry will help as a temporary measure to create jobs.  The food subsidies and the removal of VAT from fuels and the subsidy to CIE are steps in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I believe that the workers' representatives in the national wage agreement are prepared to have another look at the agreement.  I realise that profits are necessary for the development of an industry.  I accept that on the understanding that they will be ploughed back into the industry.  However, if the extra profit is put into the pocket of the investor and if he is to gain an advantage over and above what is available to the worker the whole package may be upset because workers may be led to believe that it is only they who are called on to make sacrifices.</P>
    <P>We can all criticise the extra taxation imposed in certain brackets.  If extra taxation must be imposed it is <Col N="1092" /> not easy to select the place where taxation will be most productive of revenue.  It is my view that the taxation was imposed in the right place.</P>
    <P>Action must be taken in areas where factories are closing because they are unable to sell their product. If factories are finding difficulty in selling their products&mdash;and this applies to factories in my area&mdash;some means must be devised of reducing their costs if it is price that is causing them to be uncompetitive, in the markets where they must sell.  If the countries to which we sell are not in a strong economic position and the people there are not buying, our troubles are great indeed.  It is a fact that 50 per cent of our exports go to the British market.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister reconsider this matter as the factory, as the Minister must be aware, is surrounded by Land Commission land? Although sales were agreed to before between the Land Commission and this person which enabled certain extensions to be made to the factory the factory has since been very successful and is in need of further ground for extension.  This man cannot purchase land from any person except the Department of Lands who surround him.  As I believe he has established a very successful export business, would the Minister, in view of that and employment in the area, agree to review the decision?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Representations were previously made in regard to this matter and every consideration was given to it by the Forest and Wildlife Service.  They simply feel they cannot sell this land to the person mentioned.  As the Deputy knows, the forestry service is under pressure in various parts of the country to release land.  If they leased all the land they are required to lease, they would be in great difficulties. This person has been reasonably well treated by the Forestry Division. They have sold him one plot to facilitate the expansion of the factory and sold him a plot for housing and also sold three-and-a-half acres by way of accommodation to a near relative of the person concerned, and I understand that the amount of land now required by this person could be acquired from the relative who got the three-and-a-half acres.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The revised proposals to assist the Turbot islanders call for very careful examination by the Departments concerned, particularly in relation to the location of new houses.  This examination is being pushed forward as quickly as possible and it is hoped that final conclusions can be reached without delay.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that I have been making representations over a long period of time in this matter but consistently since last September following the tragedy when everybody on the island agreed to transfer to the mainland?  There may have been some doubts in the minds of some of the families up to then, but these islanders were hoping that the Minister's Department would facilitate their transfer so as to avoid their having to reside on the island for another winter.  As many months have passed since September when the tragedy took place there is very little chance of these people being transferred before September.  They are upset at the long delay in coming to a decision.  I understand that it rests with the Government and I would urge the Minister again&mdash;he has listened to my pleas before&mdash;to expedite an early and favourable decision on their behalf.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the Deputy knows, when the change of Government came about, plans were in an advanced stage for the evacuation of Turbot Island and I more or less adopted the plans that had been prepared.  The Turk islanders availed of the assistance given and for all practical purposes they have been accommodated. As things turned out, the Turbot islanders were not in a position to avail of the financial assistance offered.  There are 17 families involved and questions have arisen as to whether they should get 17 different small plots <Col N="1108" /> or should be accommodated in one scheme or group of houses.  Even with the best will in the world it would not be possible to have that sort of operation completed before next winter, much as one would wish to do so, but I do appreciate the urgency of the matter and the Deputy may take it that it is being treated as a matter of urgency.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Present arrangements in the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department are that foresters are asked to complete five assignments which usually <Col N="1115" /> involve four transfers of duty in their first seven years of service.</P>
    <P>This procedure is designed to afford young foresters opportunities of gaining experience in a wide range of forestry operations and on a variety of sites.  This is of benefit both to the efficiency of the State's forestry operations and to the individual forester in qualifying him for advancement in the Service as opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>The normal notice of transfer is at least seven weeks to married men and three weeks to single men though in isolated cases practical difficulties necessitate shorter notice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that this obviously imposes very definite hardship on foresters, especially those who are married?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Some of them are married.  These arrangements have been worked out with the association representing the foresters and my Department.  They are regarded as being in the interests of the foresters themselves so as to qualify them as soon as possible for promotion and for a useful life in the Forestry Service.  Further, when the five transfers are completed, the minimum transfers take place thereafter and the policy is to settle foresters in an area when they are fully qualified. If Deputies consider it, they will come to the conclusion that while some inconvenience is caused in the early stage of a forester's life, in the long term it is in the interests of all concerned.</P>

I have adverted to these in response to previous questions.  The Government attaches considerable importance to the question and will continue to pursue it as appropriate.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Because what I said on that occasion was true.  What was originally proposed in 1973 was a survey of the north-western regions with a view to establishing forms of joint action desirable to improve the economy of the area which has, objectively speaking, been disrupted by the existence of the Border.  Subsequently, on the British side, there was a suggestion that a similar survey should be carried out in the north-eastern part of the area, which we thought was a good idea.  However, those proposals did not make progress.  There have been proposals from the British side for specific <Col N="1119" /> detailed projects as a replacement for the general surveys which were agreed to at Baldonnel and confirmed subsequently and which we regarded as an essential preliminary.  It was these general surveys for the north-western projects, and subsequently the British Government agreed for the north-east, which held up agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland will ratify the Oslo Convention when legislation to give effect to its provisions in this country has been enacted.  I understand that the Minister for Transport and Power hopes to submit to the Government in the near future proposals for such legislation.  In the meantime national control over dumping at sea is exercised through existing fisheries legislation.  Any licences issued in this regard by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries adhere to the letter and the spirit of the Oslo Convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, it is because of the Government's concern to tackle the problem on the widest scale.  Under the Oslo Convention what seems to be at stake is the dumping at sea for which we would be responsible.  In the first instance, this would appear to be confined to dumping by Irish ships or dumping within Irish territorial waters.  The Government <Col N="1122" /> would, however, like to be in the position to extend, if possible, their control over the Continental Shelf. This raises issues outside the Oslo Convention, issues we regard as very important, and it is the consideration of these issues and consideration of the question as to whether legislation could legally and legitimately be extended to the Continental Shelf which has been the prime factor in delaying legislation.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that it would be the ideal to have it done on a comprehensive basis as he suggests.  Does he not accept that, in the meantime, in view of the urgency of this matter, such steps as are available should be taken? Arising out of what Deputy O'Leary asked, is it not the Minister for Local Government, or whoever poses as the Minister concerned with the environment, who should introduce this legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of sectarian assassinations, which the Government regard with the gravest concern, has been raised with the British Authorities on numerous occasions since we took office.  It was raised most recently by me during a meeting which I had with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 15th May last when I reiterated our concern at the horrifying continuation of sectarian killings and our view that effective action should be taken by the British Government to deal with this campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has taken efficient and sufficient action in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that he has taken very considerable additional action designed to deal with this and that it has yielded some concrete results in terms of arrests and convictions.  So long as sectarian assassinations continue, nobody can be satisfied that the action is sufficient and, to a significant degree, they still continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that a number of arrests have taken place.  The problem is the escalation of sectarian violence.  This is of more concern than the arrests immediately afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got in front of me the exact figure over a period of time.  I would think it remains at a disturbingly high level.  I would not think it is escalating in the sense of increasing in intensity. The measures taken by the British Government have, perhaps, limited it but have by no means eliminated the problem.  Much more remains to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the British Government are wont <Col N="1125" /> to exercise pressure on this Government from time to time when it suits them, does the Minister not think that it would be appropriate in these horrible circumstances that he and his Government should be far more zealous in exerting pressure on the British Government at the moment and that a sufficient number of representations have not been made at the meetings since April and May?</P>

      <P>Over a period of a month we made five sets of representations on this matter and, since then, considerable additional action has been taken.  It is difficult to judge the efficacy of this action without allowing some time for the results to show. It certainly does not appear to have ended the problem but it does appear to have made some impact on it. It is difficult to assess this.  We will continue to press the British Government on the matter which is of the most vital concern to us all.</P>

      <P>I am aware of instances of very young Irish persons going unaccompanied to Great Britain but such instances are, I believe, very few.  The minimum legal age for employment in Britain is 16 years so that persons 14 years of age and under would not be legally employable in Britain.  Persons of such age would tend to come to the attention of various welfare agencies and ultimately would be returned to Ireland under the repatriation scheme operated by my Department.  Since April, 1974, only three young persons aged 14 years and under have in fact been so repatriated, and this suggests that the matter is not of any magnitude or that it presents any problems which cannot adequately be dealt with by existing facilities.</P>

    <P>(5) the time to be allowed for consideration of the motion in the name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs relating to the Agreement establishing an International Energy Programme and the motion in the name of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries approving the draft of the Elections of Conservators (Postponement) Order, 1975 shall not exceed two hours in each case; and if the proceedings in each case have not already concluded at the expiration of the allotted time the Question necessary to bring them to a conclusion shall be put forthwith from the Chair; provided that the provisions of Standing Order 123 relating to the postponement of divisions shall be applied to any division demanded.</P>

    <P>In moving the motion standing in my name, I would like to explain to the Dáil the background of, and the necessity for, such a comprehensive motion.  Its object is to allocate the time of the House to essential business over this week and the next three weeks, after which the House will I hope rise for the summer recess.</P>
    <P>I would like firstly to emphasise that a good deal of the business of the House is arranged, not by dictation by the Government, but by agreement.  Obviously it is the Government who decide on the initiation of legislation and other measures, but the Government endeavour by means of informal contacts between the Whips to order the sequence of business, or the time of commencement or interruption of any particular item on any particular day, in such a way as will not cause difficulty to the Opposition; and in the normal way if the Opposition indicate for instance their wish for the postponement of any item due to the indisposition or unavoidable absence of their spokesman, this is conceded as a matter of course if at all possible. Similarly, Opposition requests for special debates, for example, on Northern Ireland or on the economic situation, have been regularly met and the hours requested by the Opposition regularly conceded out of Government time.  I accept that the same conventions were respected by the previous Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government may, however, claim credit for an innovation showing its willingness to give the Opposition every opportunity of expression: namely, the recently adopted Standing Order under which time is given for Private Members' Business throughout the calendar <Col N="1133" /> year rather than merely in the short period when financial business is not being discussed.</P>
      <P>Until now the Government on only one occasion availed of their right under this same Standing Order to appropriate Private Members' Time without agreement; and the consequence has been that up to today, with only half this calendar year over, 46½ hours have been given to Private Members' Business, compared with an average of only 17½ hours per entire calendar year in the years 1968-74.  This does not take into account the one-and-a-half hours to be devoted to Private Members' Business tonight if this motion has not been passed before 6.30 p.m.  Moreover, every three-hour Private Members' Debate resulting in a division, as almost all do, costs the Government a further 15 minutes for the taking of the vote.  In all, it is true to say that under the new order roughly 25 per cent of normal sitting hours on Tuesday and Wednesday is given up by the Government for business determined by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>This circumstances makes the Government's task in the Dáil peculiarly difficult when, as now, very substantial reforming legislation is being enacted along with the normal quantity of routine legislation.  For this reason, on the Government's instruction, I proposed to the Opposition verbally last March and again by letter to Deputy Lalor on 2nd April that the Committee Stage of the three capital taxation Bills should be taken in a Special Committee such as is envisaged by Standing Order 90 and such as had formerly been used for such Bills as the Value-Added Tax Bill, 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seemed to us that these Bills were ideally suited to such treatment, and that the obvious thing was to have their sections discussed in a special Committee by about a dozen Deputies from both sides of the House &mdash;Deputies with special experience and knowledge of economic and fiscal matters&mdash;while the main body of the Dáil got on with other business; the whole Dáil of course had already debated these Bills very fully at Second Stage, and would subsequently <Col N="1134" /> have dealt again with these Bills anyway at the Report and Final Stages.</P>
    <P>We were all the more hopeful of agreement to take these Bills in special committee, since the informal All-Party Committee on Reform of Dáil Procedure, presided over in the time of the last Government by Deputy O'Malley and containing a Fianna Fáil majority, had recommended that more Bills should be sent to special committees, and had said that Bills so referred need not be of a purely technical nature.  The Government proposal was however rejected by the Opposition in a letter from Deputy Lalor to myself of 18th April last.  The reason given was that &ldquo;extremely important taxation measures of this kind are not appropriate for transfer to a small special committee of the House&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I might insert here for the benefit of those who do not realise it that a Special Committee of that kind would have been no less accessible to the Press and the public than a Committee Stage debate in the House.</P>
    <P>On a former occasion, on the completion of the Second Stage of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1973, the Government had suggested a special committee for the Committee Stage of that Bill, but this proposal was rejected on two grounds: that too many Deputies were interested in it, and that it had an &ldquo;ideological&rdquo; content which disqualified it for treatment by a special committee.  In fact the Committee Stage of that Bill has up to now attracted contributions from only a small number of Opposition Deputies, who could very easily have been accommodated in a special committee; and it is a fair comment that if the only Bills which the Opposition are willing to co-operate in sending to a special committee are Bills of a relatively unimportant, ideologically neutral nature, of interest to few Deputies if any at all, the purpose of such committees is lost, since such Bills would pass Committee Stage in the body of the full Dáil in a very short time anyway.  In fact only one Bill&mdash;the Bill to set up a Law Commission&mdash;has been sent to a special <Col N="1135" /> committee in this Dáil and the frequently uttered hope for an extended committee system remains unfulfilled because of the attitude of the present Opposition to what effectively was their own recommendation three years ago.</P>
    <P>Having failed to get agreement on a special committee, the Government instructed me to propose to the Opposition Whips and to the Opposition spokesman on Finance, Deputy Colley, that a timetable might be mutually agreed between Government and Opposition on the disposal of the three capital taxation Bills.</P>
    <P>I repeatedly asked them to suggest the number of days or hours they wanted for each Stage of each Bill, indicating that the Government would agree to any reasonable proposal&mdash;inviting them, therefore, virtually to draw up their own timetable for the disposal of the Government business.  These approaches were however rejected.  It is true that, after the Committee Stage of the Capital Gains Tax Bill had ended, agreement was secured on a timetable for concluding the remaining Stages of that Bill, but I could get no agreement of any kind for disposing of the Wealth Tax Bill or the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it became obvious that the Opposition proposed to delay the financial legislation for as long as possible, and beyond the point of reasonable debate; the worst instance being section 2 of the Wealth Tax Bill, on which after 18 hours of debate, the Government were obliged to move the closure.  It is true that no exception could be taken to the Opposition's handling of the debate on the Report Stage of the Capital Gains Tax Bill; but in view of recent experience in the case of the Wealth Tax Bill, the Government could have no confidence that if the business proceeded in an open-ended debate, the tactic of deliberately prolonging debate to an intolerable extent would not be again resorted to.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances&mdash;the refusal of a special committee and of an agreed timetable, and the likelihood <Col N="1136" /> of indefinite obstruction, aggravated by the considerable human strain on Deputies and on the staff of the House throughout the unusually long sittings of the last six weeks or so&mdash;the Government feel obliged to assert their right to impose a timetable for the despatch of the business which in the Government's view needs to be disposed of before the House rises.  This business does not include the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, which the Government propose to leave until after the resumption, but it includes the Wealth Tax Bill, and the Finance Bill; and several other items, most of which, however, are, or so the Government expect, uncontroversial and likely to be disposed of quickly.</P>
    <P>The major item is of course the Wealth Tax Bill, and for the remainder of the Committee Stage, to which 44 hours of debate have already been devoted, the Government propose to devote the rest of today after the disposal of this motion, together with the major part of four more sitting days: the Report Stage and Final Stage of the Bill will get the major part of three further sitting days; and between the end of the Committee Stage and the taking up of the Report Stage a week will intervene.  The Government believe that this amount of time, if properly used, will be enough for ample and effective debate of all sections and amendments; the responsibility for this will, however, lie with the Opposition.</P>
    <P>To the Finance Bill the major part of another day is being allotted.  As the Bill contains only two sections of substance, and since the proposals to which these sections will give effect have already been discussed at length in the budget debate, the Government consider this sufficient.  The Government are of course not prepared to allow the Second Stage of the Finance Bill to be turned into the occasion for yet another budget debate.</P>
    <P>For the other items, admittedly arbitrary times have been allotted. The Government believe that some of these items, being of a routine, uncomplicated and uncontroversial nature, should pass in normal conditions <Col N="1137" /> in well under the times allotted by the motion.  Any Deputies who have experience of such Bills will know that Bills of this kind frequently pass in a matter of a few minutes. On the other hand, if a genuine difficulty should arise in connection with any of these items&mdash;such as to make it evident that it cannot be properly considered in the time allotted&mdash;the Government will be willing to agree with the Opposition on a reasonable extension of that time.</P>
    <P>I conclusion I would appeal to the House to try to make this system of time allocation work well over the coming few weeks.  I believe that if it were seen to operate satisfactorily, the system of allocating time to a number of items of business for periods of roughly a month ahead might become usual, though of course it would be desirable for such allocations to be agreed rather than imposed. I think both sides of the House and the public would greatly benefit from the more orderly and more rational despatch of business which such a system would bring with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion, which the Parliamentary Secretary has just proposed, is euphemistically called a time motion but we know well what it is: it is a guillotine motion, and we know too that such a motion should be used sparingly and with due consideration for the rights of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>This guillotine motion has been described by the Parliamentary Secretary as a comprehensive one and, indeed, it is so comprehensive that it literally cuts a swathe through the whole process of Parliamentary democracy and, if for no other reason, in the interests of parliamentary democracy we intend to oppose this motion and oppose it vigorously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is being introduced at a time when the country is facing serious economic difficulties.  I can well understand the anxiety of the Government to get out of this House as quickly as possible to avoid the criticisms that we are bringing forward of the Government's mishandling of the economic situation.  This motion undermines <Col N="1138" /> the authority of the Dáil in the worst possible fashion.  Procedure in the Dáil is governed by Standing Orders and this motion, of course, is designed to set aside Standing Orders so that the Government can achieve their purpose.</P>
    <P>Most parliaments operate by way of set rules of procedure and/or Standing Orders, but parliaments operate as well by way of precedent, and I suggest to the Government that this is a very, very dangerous precedent for them to adopt, and particularly in this case.  It is dangerous, first of all, because of its unnecessarily comprehensive nature embracing, as it does several Bills, including Bills which are already before the House.  I can understand the propensity of a government to shorten a debate or a series of debates on Bills that cause some difficulty for them. They may do so because of that very fact that it causes difficulty, because they feel that exposure of the terms of these Bills will not redound to the credibility or the standing of the Government. They may also, of course, and justifiably to some extent, seek a closure because they feel that a Bill has been debated for a sufficiently long time, and that is the usual procedure, but this motion goes far further than that.  It is going to shut out reasonable parliamentary debate on a series of Bills, reasonable debate over a period of not less than four weeks at the end of which, I take it, it will be the intention of the Government to propose the adjournment of the Dáil for the Summer Recess.  Therefore, because of the impending Summer Recess, the Opposition will be denied any opportunity of redressing in the Dáil whatever mistakes will have been made in the drafting and presentation and implementation of the provisions of a variety of Bills.</P>
    <P>There is no use in telling the Opposition that these Bills will have to go to the Seanad.  If the Dáil will have been in recess, as I expect it will, then whatever mistakes will have been made in the processing of these Bills in the Dáil will have to be perpetuated in the Seanad because there will be no opportunity for the Dáil to amend these Bills and I do not think I have to tell the Dáil that any <Col N="1139" /> amendment made in the Seanad would have to be approved by the Dáil.  I assume that in the course of events these Bills would go before the Seanad towards the end if not at the very end of the session here in the Dáil.  If not all of them, certainly some of them would have to be debated in the Seanad as they left the Dáil whether amended or otherwise, and amendments will be practically impossible in the conditions of the timetable now being imposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>The second dangerous precedent is this and it is more important and more likely in this particular case, that an Opposition who will become the next Government will naturally have regard to that undesirable, and I might say in the circumstances of the damage being done to parliamentary democracy, disastrous precedent that we are now debating.  An incoming Government will in these circumstances be justified, if justification is the word that one could apply to this, in bringing forward similar motions in the future, motions that will cut out adequate and reasonable parliamentary debate and, as well all know, this could have a snowballing effect.  If in the event a succeeding Government is put out of office and the new Opposition come in then they will be disposed to using this precedent and perhaps even more ruthlessly than the present Government are doing it now.  Therefore, we are facing a most serious situation as far as parliamentary democratic procedure is concerned here on this occasion.</P>
    <P>A third and most serious precedent is being created.  This motion refers to a Bill which is already for some weeks before the Dáil&mdash;a Wealth Tax Bill&mdash;a Bill which we are debating at length because we believe that that Bill is inherently and particularly at the present time damaging to our entire economy and it is not only our right but our parliamentary and democratic duty to ensure that that Bill will be so amended at least to do the least possible damage to our economy, and this is exactly what is <Col N="1140" /> being done by our very effective and I might say constructive and responsible opposition to this Wealth Tax Bill.</P>
    <P>But, that apart, other Bills have been mentioned here: the Finance Bill which contains, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, two main provisions.  We do not know if that is to be the end of it, but I will come back to that in a second.  Paragraph 4 of this motion refers to five other Bills only one of which has already been circulated.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that these other Bills not yet circulated will be of a routine nature and not likely to be complicated or controversial.  Do we know that at this stage?  Do the Government know whether these will be routine, uncomplicated and non-controversial?</P>
    <P>Let us examine these Bills as they are and as they appear on this motion. The Employment Premium Bill&mdash;yet &mdash;we were given an indication in the Minister's budget statement a fortnight ago that this Bill is likely to contain proposals providing for an employment premium of £12 up to a limited period and for £6 for a more limited period thereafter to employers who can re-employ redundant workers. Quite rightly our spokesman and subsequent speakers from these benches commended the Minister on that initiative as being imaginative and possibly useful in the event.  However, we have not seen that Bill yet. During the course of the budget debate I suggested that the proposition as put before the Dáil might not be the most equitable and efficacious way of providing a stimulus for the reemployment of redundant workers.  I suggested that in certain circumstances a firm which was in a position to employ lowly paid labour could have an advantage over a firm in which the level of wages would be somewhat higher.  I suggested that the premium might be based not on a fixed rate but rather on a percentage rate.  I believe that if the Bill goes forward in the manner indicated by the Minister for Finance, that is on a flat rate, we would be entitled to put forward an argument, and amendments <Col N="1141" /> if necessary, to change the flat rate to one of a percentage.  I am certain that the time-table put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary will not allow for adequate debate, much less debate on amendments.</P>
    <P>We do not know what else will be in this Bill.  I do not know whether any member of the Government knows what else will be in it.  As of now we do not know where the money required to pay these premiums is going to come from.  We do not know what, if any, provision there will be in this Bill which will be in the form of taxation, and this Government have imposed taxation by rather unorthodox methods in the past.  Just before last Christmas they&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a time allocation on the subject matter of the Employment Premium Bill, the subject matter of the Gaeltacht Industries Bill, of the Turf Development Bill and the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill and on the Agricultural Credit Bill which has been circulated.  None of the other four have been circulated.  I am entitled to argue that it is unreasonable to impose a time limit on these Bills, Bills the content of which we do not yet know, and to give my reasons why, because of this, we are entitled to oppose this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are not disputing my right to do that, Sir, I propose to proceed to exercise my right.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that we do not know fully what this Employment Premium Bill will contain, whether it will contain means of providing money to pay the employment premiums and, if so, will the extra money be raised by means of a device which was used&mdash;the Imposition of Duties (Order) Bill&mdash;when £27 million extra taxation was collected by the Minister for Finance before Christmas, I am entitled to comment on that at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Gaeltacht Industries (Amendment) Bill I should imagine will at least provide for an increase in the allocation of capital moneys to Gaeltarra Éireann.  This is purely speculation on my part.  I do not know what else this Bill will contain, in what way it might offend against existing legislation, <Col N="1143" /> for example whether it would be possible to apply grants to Gaeltarra Éireann to industries situated outside the Gaeltacht.  I do not know that yet.</P>
    <P>The Turf Development Bill I am sure will be a wide-ranging one notwithstanding the fact that I anticipate that it too will make some provision for the increased capitalisation of Bord na Móna.  What else will it do? We do not know.  What other provisions will it contain?  We have been given no indication.</P>
    <P>We have not seen the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill either.  We do not know what it will contain.  We do not know what it will refer to at all.  It may provide for extra capitalisation or a change in the form of capitalisation of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta.  It may provide for giving power to Nítrigin Éireann to engage in the exploitation of minerals or other resources on our soil or in the seas surrounding our land.</P>
    <P>Has the Employment Premium Bill come before the Government? If it has, has it been cleared? Has it been sent to the Parliamentary Draftsman and, if so, when can we expect to see it?  The same applies to each of the other three Bills.  If this motion is passed not only will the Opposition be forced to limit debate on these Bills but so also will Government Deputies who, like ourselves, have not seen these Bills.  I believe there is no process whereby they can see Bills before Members of the Opposition.  Will they be forced to go through the Division Lobbies in support of limiting their rights, as well as ours, of debate on these Bills?  Will they be forced to go through the Division Lobbies like sheep, not only like sheep but like blindfolded sheep, not knowing what their Government have in mind by way of legislation on these matters?</P>
    <P>I have asked for these specific questions to be answered.  Have these Bills which have not yet been circulated been agreed by the Government?  Have they agreed the heads of the Bills? Has the Parliamentary Draftsman drafted them?  Has the draft in draft form come back to the Government <Col N="1144" /> and has it been approved by the Government in that form?  Has any one of these Bills gone through that process? We have been given no information or no indication whatever of what the position is in relation to those Bills.</P>
    <P>May I refer now to another aspect of this motion?  Paragraph 4 provides that:</P>
    <P>Where the proceedings on the Second Stage have not already concluded the Question necessary to bring them to a conclusion shall be put from the Chair on the expiration of one hour from the commencement of the debate on the Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The debate on the Second Stage commences when the Minister opens up his brief, reads its contents and explains the contents of the Bill in the House.  We have no indication here of how long the Minister will occupy in presenting the legislation to the House. It may well be that it will occupy most of the hour.  The Parliamentary Secretary or somebody else might say no, that they are technical Bills and would be uncontroversial Bills.  If they are technical and uncontroversial Bills nevertheless they need explanation and exposure of their contents by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The House will be denied that if the Minister limits himself to too short a time and, therefore, the Second Reading debate will be inconclusive and incomplete.  Should the Minister take an undue proportion of that one hour's time it will leave only a very limited time for the chief spokesman of the Opposition on that particular subject, with no time whatever for a second speaker from the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>That is serious, but not as serious as the second part of paragraph 4 of this motion, which states:</P>
    <P>the proceedings on the remaining Stages if not already concluded shall be brought to a conclusion on the expiration of one hour from the commencement of the debate on the Committee Stage by putting from the Chair the Question necessary to bring them to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> Further, and this is what I think is a most dangerous precedent, it says:</P>
    <P>That (all amendments set down by the Member in charge of the Bill and not disposed of are hereby made to the Bill) (the Bill (as amended) is hereby agreed to and (as amended) is reported to the House and (all amendments set down by the Member in charge of the Bill, including any requiring Recommittal, and not disposed of are hereby made to the Bill and) Recommittal and Fourth Stages are hereby completed and) the Bill is hereby passed.</P>
    <P>It may be that reasonable and necessary amendments would be proposed by the Opposition but these, of course, will automatically fall.  It appears that any amendments deemed to be necessary by the Minister responsible will obviously not be fully debated and any amendments that have not been debated, irrespective of their merits and even irrespective of an explanation of what they mean, will willy-nilly have to be passed by the House and not only that but they will be sent to the Seanad.  This House will have no opportunity whatever, because of the forthcoming recess, to mend the hand of the Minister or to correct mistakes that might have been made in the preparation by the Government or the parliamentary draftsman or in the processing of the Bill by this House.</P>
    <P>Mistakes have been made in the past.  Mistakes have often been cured in the Seanad.  Indeed, many times mistakes have not been cured until amending legislation was subsequently introduced.  We have enough experience of the matter of drafting Bills, of the manner of debating them and of ensuring full debate to ensure that they procure the desired results, that they do not offend against the Constitution and that they do not offend against existing legislation, to know that these things happen and that some Bills have offended previous legislation, that they failed to procure the results desired by the Minister and the House.  They have often needed amendment, and often those defects were spotted in the Seanad and cured in that House.  They <Col N="1146" /> were subsequently endorsed by the Dáil.  There will be no opportunity whatever for this democratic process to be pursued on this occasion.</P>
    <P>It is highly undesirable, to say the least of it, that this House should be asked to agree to a motion to foreclose debate on Bills, to preclude debate on the amendment of Bills, to preclude the possibility of Opposition amendments being considered and with the very possible undesired results.  As I said at the outset, this is a serious time for our economy.  Much of the content of these Bills will have an effect one way or another on the saving of our economy, if that can be done by the Government.  Certainly, in advancing the spheres of the economy which will be covered by these Bills, the agricultural industry, the Gaeltacht industry, turf development, the manufacture of fertilisers or the provision through Nítrigin Éireann of the processing of our natural resources, all these impinge greatly on our economy. In present times, when that economy is floundering under the maladministration of this Government then at least in these particular instances we are entitled to have these matters examined, debated adequately and if necessary amended in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is a negation of democracy.  It is destroying parliamentary democracy in a manner that has never been done before.  I should like to comment on a couple of the points made by the Parliamentary Secretary in his opening statement which I can describe as being more truly special pleading than any statement I ever heard read in this House. In the first place, he claims credit for the innovations by the Government's willingness to give the Opposition every opportunity of expression and later on, gratuitously, he accepted that the manner in which this was being done was as a result of recommendations made by the committee headed by Deputy O'Malley.  These recommendations were made before this Government came into power.  They had no alternative but to adopt them.</P>
    <P>Even in this respect, if there was an innovation and if there were so many hours, 46½ hours already, allocated <Col N="1147" /> to Private Members' time, how many extra hours have we been willing to sit in the Dáil since this Government came into office?  We have been sitting long days on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.  We have also been sitting on Fridays.  We have not demurred from this procedure because we felt all the time was necessary not only for the Government but certainly for us to expose the inadequacies of this Government.  This special pleading of the Parliamentary Secretary does not wash against what is inherent in this motion, the establishment of undesirable and most damaging precedents and cutting across the parliamentary democratic procedure in a manner that was never yet witnessed in this country, and this from the so-called open Government.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Lynch used the phrase that we are undermining parliamentary democracy, that this is a negation of parliamentary democracy, that this is a disastrous motion and that wealth tax would be inherently damaging to the economy.  I felt like reaching for a very large dose of salts from the Dáil restaurant because, quite frankly, I do not believe a word of it. <Col N="1148" /> I suppose we have to go through the motions this afternoon, we have to have a mock battle and we have to have a little bit of shadow boxing between the Opposition and the Government in relation to something that they all knew was coming for the past month and which, with due respect to Deputy Lynch&mdash;no finer practitioner in the art of parliamentary procedure than the Leader of the Opposition, a magnificent, competent leader in that regard&mdash;we all knew at Government level we would give sufficient rope to the Opposition to hang themselves from any part of Leinster House they might wish to in relation to this motion.  We have done so.  We have bent over backwards and we have sought agreement but have not been able to reach it.  I personally as one of the Government Whips have the greatest personal regard for Deputy Lalor and Deputy Browne, both performing their jobs within the constraints of Opposition quite well on behalf of the party.  I can understand that they were a bit irate when the Minister for Finance last night hogged some time and I thought he deserved a bit of a kick for that and Deputy Colley gave it to him but that is over and done with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch used the words &ldquo;special pleading&rdquo; but I would throw back the words &ldquo;selective pleading&rdquo; and suggest that it is necessary that we pass this motion as quickly as possible because I would hope we would not spend the rest of the evening debating this motion and then have to apply the closure to it because that would make a farce of parliament.  It may well be that we shall have to do so.  I would refer to the very strong comments made by Deputy Lynch in relation to the agriculture and NET legislation pending. I have not seen the Bills either but I can assure him, and it is clearly contained in the final statement of the Parliamentary Secretary, that the Government will be willing to agree with the Opposition on a reasonable extension of that time and if there is anything particularly unique about the Employment Premium Bill, and no doubt it is quite a complicated issue and from my trade union experience <Col N="1149" /> I can see quite a number of complications in it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to make representations on the Deputy's behalf to the Government and should anything particularly unusual arise in relation to these three Bills, the NET Bill, the Agriculture Bill and the Employment Premium Bill, I have not the slightest doubt that Deputy Lalor and Deputy Browne can get together with Deputy Kelly and myself and work out an effective timetable for that.  There will be no problems in that regard but what we will not do, and we do have a responsibility in Government, is hand over to the kind of spectacle we had here of section 2 of the Wealth Tax Bill being debated for a solid 18 hours until finally we had no option but reluctantly to bring in a closure motion because a Government has to have some sense of government.  A Government cannot abdicate.</P>
      <P>If I might make a few more brief points, the Dáil and indeed the Seanad have met on more occasions, have sat through more hours and had more debate in relation to a wide range of legislation than at any time in the period since the State was founded.  This is imposing a strain on all Deputies and other members and particularly imposes a strain on the staff of both Houses of the Oireachtas. For example, looking at some of the Seanad debates, I find that for the first time in its history, it has now met on something like 42 occasions this year, because a great deal of material had to be sent to the Seanad because it could not be got through this House.  The average in the history of the State has been about 35 times and by the time it finishes sitting it will have sat 60 times, a historical record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time in the history of the State Dáil Éireann has put in more hours, has given more time to the Opposition and has sought every possible agreement&mdash;this is why I talk about rope&mdash;and we have sat back patiently and tried to reach agreement. <Col N="1150" /> For instance, we made a suggestion in the case of the Misuse of Drugs Bill, Deputy Haughey being the spokesman for the party, and we suggested it in relation to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill and there was not a budge from the party in opposition.  We repeatedly said that these two Bills could very usefully go to Select Committees.  The Law Reform Commission Bill went to a Select Committee, of which I was appointed Chairman.  We had a very co-operative session, notwithstanding the Galway by-election, and Deputy O'Malley turned up with his exceptional legal competence, as a former Minister, and was fully aware of the difficulties of that legislation and we were able to put through the Committee Stage of that Bill with great expedition but we did it in this House. We could not do it of course in relation to the Misuse of Drugs Bill, because apart from a few medical doctors on the other side of the House and a few laymen with a particular interest, together with some doctors on this side, virtually nobody of the 144 Members knows anything about the question of the misuse of drugs.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, we suggested a special committee for that Bill and now I discover to my amazement that the Fianna Fáil Party are showing an enormous desire to get the Bill through the House as quickly as possible. I wonder why did they change their mind and I leave that question hanging in mid-air.  They are screaming to get it through the House at the moment and yet they will not go to a special committee.  In relation to this Wealth Tax Bill, there are three or four Deputies on the opposite side &mdash;Deputy O'Malley who I concede has competence and brilliance in relation to wealth tax measures and Deputy Colley, former Minister, who has shown a great mastery of the complexities of the Wealth Tax Bill, the Capital Gains Tax Bill and of the Capital <Col N="1151" /> Acquisitions Bill and Deputy de Valera who is fully confirmed in his knowledge of his ability to handle it, as he would think, well.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is another who has shown exceptionally assiduous attention to the Bill, but if I may say so directly to the Opposition, quite apart from those Deputies and one or two others on our side, Deputy Esmonde, Deputy FitzGerald, Deputy Ryan and Deputy Fitzpatrick, nobody else has the foggiest idea of the complexities and technicalities of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It was eminently reasonable that we should have sent this Bill in the House to a Joint Committee.  It would have sat publicly.  We made that offer to the Opposition and we were told no, these Bills are of such major ideological and national importance that they must be debated line by line in the full glare of national publicity and to the eternal boredom of the members of the Press Gallery.  Therefore I do not accept at all the allegation of Deputy Lynch that in putting down this motion we are in any way undermining parliamentary democracy. We have simply set a timetable but we set it well in advance, to the end of July, and if things go bad we can revise it.  I have no objection personally to sitting until the middle of August or September but I do think we have to have some regard for trying to get the business of this House through. We sought agreement from the Opposition; we got none.  In no way do I blame the Opposition Whips for this; I do blame what I would call the consensus of attitude in the parliamentary party.  People say &mdash;to use a colloquialism&mdash;&ldquo;We will screw them one way or the other and this is the way we might as well do it.&rdquo;  But it will not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the House that as regards the other Bills they will be published quite quickly.  For the most part they are capitalisation Bills and as we know from the initial announcements in relation to them there is no major ideological or controversial viewpoint emerging in regard to them.  I have no doubt that the <Col N="1152" /> staff of this House have to be taken into consideration, both ushers and reporters, whether people are getting payments or not for it.  They have to be taken into account also. We must bear in mind that we must resume after the Summer Recess and it is best now that we finish at the end of July having put the Wealth Tax Bill behind us.</P>
    <P>The Government have been quite accommodating.  We scrapped the idea of putting through the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill in this session; we will take it next session because we are determined to complete our programme. With due respect to the Fianna Fáil party's assumption that it was going to get a particular constituency benefit and kudos from its opposition to the many capital taxation measures, I believe it will go down in the history of the State as about the most misguided piece of opposition in the history of that party, and when future generations come to read of the emergence of new taxation measures in this House I think they will not regard the Fianna Fáil party as either republican or central or populist but rather as speaking over the past couple of months in this House for a couple of wealthy accountants who have been advising people on how to avoid capital taxation.</P>

      <P>Our party in Opposition are fully against this guillotine motion which, despite what Deputy Desmond said and what was said previously in the Parliamentary Secretary's lecture to the House covers up the fact that it deals with eight Bills.  It means guillotining eight Bills through the House between now and 30th July, coupled with two motions and four very important Estimates.  I have before me a record of the contributions made in this House by Deputies who are now on the Government side and by Deputies who are no longer on the Government side, of contributions made when the previous Government, on two occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This motion is the greatest negation of democracy ever introduced in the House, and it is rather remarkable that, the motion having been introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, we cannot have a Minister present. Not one of the brilliant Cabinet can be here to stand over this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been at the receiving end of lectures from the Parliamentary Secretary and I have listened to them in the House but because the Parliamentary Secretary has paid tribute to his opposite number over quite a while, I want to say that outside the House I find the parliamentary Secretary to be a gentleman but when it comes to performing his business as Parliamentary Secretary I am afraid I cannot say the same on his behalf.  Putting his name to this motion is, I think, the greatest mistake he has ever made.  He endeavours to present everything in a rational way but I do not think that anybody, even the Parliamentary Secretary with all his legal training, can justify before the House this type of guillotine motion which spells out that eight Bills&mdash;four of which, 50 per cent of those listed, have not yet come before the House for observation as the Leader of my party has just said&mdash;must go through the House before 30th July.  These Bills are known or should be known to nobody except the Government: perhaps they have not come before the Government yet.  They were all introduced hurriedly last Friday morning and although Friday's Official Report is not yet available I have a clear recollection that the Minister for Agriculture was not here and the introduction of his Bill was moved by the Minister for Labour who, peculiarly, was here.  When I asked when the Bill would be circulated he quite brazenly said: &ldquo;Next Tuesday or Wednesday&rdquo;.  When I asked when the next Stage would be taken he replied: &ldquo;The middle of next week&rdquo;.  I asked if he could give any idea of what was in the Bill and he said: &ldquo;Wait for the circulation of the Bill&rdquo; or something <Col N="1154" /> of that nature.  I cannot give the exact words as the Report is not yet available.</P>
    <P>Generally, there was this rushed arrangement resulting in the Agricultural Credit Bill being introduced last Friday morning and the Minister for Agriculture was unaware of it.  With due credit to the Minister for Agriculture he has ensured that the Bill has been circulated.  I was watching this situation over the past few days, having been informed by the Parliamentary Secretary last Friday that a time motion was being introduced today.  I was subsequently officially informed of it in the House and sought a copy and was informed that in the case of motions of this nature copies were not available.  Subsequently, last Monday, I was presented with what was described as an incomplete copy subject to correction.  I fully accept that: it is a very long motion and would have to be corrected on Monday by the Parliamentary Secretary's office.  Later on Monday I got a typed, unrevised copy from the Dáil Office itself.  The end product was a motion on the Order Paper yesterday which differed considerably as I see it from the draft copy which the Parliamentary Secretary gave me and also differed from the copy I got from the Dáil Office.  I should like to know at what stage were the amendments made.  Yesterday's Order Paper carried this motion and if one did not look carefully one would think today's Order Paper gave the same wording of the motion but, strangely, between yesterday and today the motion had again been changed. Yesterday's format was changed on today's Order Paper.</P>

      <P>My understanding of the situation is that there is nothing in Standing Orders which makes any special provision for the introduction of a Government motion and it does appear to me to be becoming more and more the norm for the Government <Col N="1155" /> to find their own way to circumvent and overcome Standing Orders. This is most unfortunate and I should like the Ceann Comhairle to explain to me how these changes can be arranged under Standing Orders.  I have studied Standing Order No. 28 which covers the matter.  It provides that, by agreement with the Ceann Comhairle, motions and amendments may be made on shorter notice.  I would like to know if it is not possible for the Opposition to be given an opportunity of making amendments. Having seen the blunders in the original motion I should like to know what provision there is for this side of the House to put in amendments. I am referring to the technicalities now.  I should like to hear from the Chair at some stage how the Opposition are enabled to put in amendments.</P>
      <P>We have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and the Assistant Whip coming in here and telling us this medicine is good for us. The Assistant Whip laughingly endeavoured to get across to us that we are more pleased with this motion than they are over there.</P>

One thing the Parliamentary Secretary carefully refrained from mentioning today is the fact that he indicated that all of this business is urgent and needs to be cleared before the summer recess.  I do not know why he did not mention that.  I told him officially that, if the Government were anxious to get the Wealth Tax Bill before the summer recess, the Opposition were willing to sit through August and September to debate that measure.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Parliamentary Secretary went into details purporting to show how the Opposition handling of business costs the Government time.  The party Leader has just indicated quite clearly that at no stage&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of this&mdash;has he received any approaches from me as Opposition Whip to curtail time in any way.  He orders the time and we accept it and we are willing at all times to give a sufficiency of time at all stages to deal with all business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> It is rather remarkable that the Parliamentary Secretary in dealing with his request to refer Bills to a special committee indicated that he had been in communication orally and in writing with me as Whip of the Opposition Party.  He said the reason given by Deputy Lalor in reply to him on 18th April was that extremely important taxation matters are not appropriate for transfer to a small special committee of the House.  He changed this today.  That is why I have repeated it now.</P>
    <P>I notice he carefully avoided talking about the number of Fianna Fáil Deputies who have contributed to the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  He paid a well-deserved tribute to the Members of this party and his colleague, Deputy Desmond, paid tribute to the number of Deputies who have debated the Capital Gains Tax Bill in detail and helped the Minister for Finance considerably.  Having kicked the Minister for Finance in the groin, the Assistant Whip, Deputy Desmond, went out of his way to pay these tributes and to spell out specifically that the only people who seemed to know what they were talking about were Deputy Colley, Deputy Fitzpatrick, Deputy de Valera, Deputy O'Malley and some others from our side of the House.  It was rather remarkable that he deliberately omitted any reference to the Minister for Finance and, quite honestly, I could not agree with him more because over the period during which we have been debating the Capital Gains Tax Bill the one man who proved he knows nothing about finance is the Minister for Finance. That is pretty well established now. It has been pretty well established in the light of the economic state of the country at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said this Special Committee would be no less accessible to the public and the Press than the Dáil Chamber is.  He went on to say that we had the case where the Bill setting up the Law Reform Commission had been discussed at Special Committee level.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me what publicity was <Col N="1158" /> given to the contributions made at that Select Committee.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said they repeatedly asked the Opposition to suggest the number of days or hours they wanted for each stage of each Bill, indicating that the Government would agree with any reasonable proposals, inviting them therefore, virtually to draw up their own time table for the disposal of the Government business.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that the Parliamentary Secretary said that to Deputy Colley and myself.  When we were being offered that, no indication was given to me or to Deputy Colley or to anybody on this side of the House that an Agricultural Credit Bill, an Employment Premium Bill, a Gaeltacht Industries Bill, a Turf Development Bill and a Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill would be introduced and discussed. We are being asked to do the Government's job for them in the dark.  We will not do the job for them.  Despite the allegations made about the Opposition, it is quite obvious that if they followed our advice over the past year and a half to two years their job would have been done for them, reluctant as we are to give them that advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary came to me and asked me to create a time table for him.  As he says, a good deal <Col N="1159" /> of the business of the House is arranged, not by dictation by the Government, but by agreement.  I fully accept that is the main way business is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>Two weeks ago the Parliamentary Secretary came to me and asked me to come to some sort of an arrangement about the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  We finally agreed that it would be cleared through the House by last night.  With certain break periods we would have three full days and they should be sufficient to clear the Report Stage of the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  I checked this out with our spokesman on Finance and this was agreed.  Once the Minister for Finance knew there was a closing time on that Bill he became what he had not been for a short while, his old arrogant self. In justification of what I am saying the Parliamentary Secretary gives credit&mdash; and I admire him for it&mdash;to the manner in which the Opposition dealt with the Capital Gains Tax Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions Deputy Colley drew attention to the fact that, once this agreement was reached, the Minister for Finance, who had become reasonable for a couple of days and had been willing to discuss things, automatically became his old arrogant self.  Last night there was a vote at about 9.30 p.m. and the House started to deal with the Final Stage of the Bill at about 10 o'clock.  There was a quarter of an hour left for debate on the Final Stage and the arrogant little Minister for Finance could not let that quarter of an hour go without strutting his words across the House.  When challenged, after a dissertation lasting seven minutes, by Deputy Colley seeking the right to reply to him, he offered him half the remaining eight minutes.  This is one of the handicaps the Parliamentary Secretary is labouring under. We have to put up with the arrogance <Col N="1160" /> of a number of Ministers in the House but when it comes to arranging business I will stand for none of that arrogance.  The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>It is true that no exception could be taken to the Opposition handling of the debate on the Report Stage of the Capital Gains Tax Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to say categorically that we take exception to the Government's handling of it through their Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was trying to say was that if the rest of the financial business had been handled in the way that Report Stage was handled, there would be no need for this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's response to legitimate, straightforward, unexceptional handling of a Bill by the Opposition is this guillotine motion. The Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that he hopes to be able to give the major part of the next four sitting days and the remaining hours this evening to the Committee Stage of the Wealth Tax Bill.  With the knowledge we have of the conduct of the Minister for Finance when it comes to the allocation of time, there is nothing to stop him from using up most of that time operating his old propaganda exercise. We have last night's example.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in his own lecturing way goes out of his way deliberately to write down in a prepared speech that the responsibility for the guillotining of eight Bills, two important Motions and four important Estimates rests with the Opposition. There is nothing the Parliamentary Secretary cannot persuade himself of if he sets out to do it.</P>

      <P>I am in the happy position that I can go to bed with an untroubled conscience and sleep.  The Parliamentary Secretary said&mdash;and it was a big admission for him&mdash;that for the other items arbitrary times have been allotted.  I am not putting those words in his mouth.  He says they are arbitrary times but they are our responsibility.</P>
      <P>I will not bring out the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs but I should like to quote from column 3255, Volume 255 of the Official Report.  We had a similar motion on the Prohibition of Forcible Entry Bill, on 4th August, 1971&mdash;mark the date, 4th August.  The spokesman I want to quote as opposing a guillotine motion to deal with that Bill, which at that stage was on Report, not at Second Stage or Committee Stage, was the present Minister for Lands, Deputy Fitzpatrick.  He said:</P>
      <P>The guillotine motion which has been proposed by the Parliamentary Secretary on instructions from the Government, is a rare parliamentary procedure.</P>
      <P>It was rare even for Fianna Fáil.  He went on:</P>
      <P>It is a good thing it is rare because the object and the effect of the guillotine motion is to restrict Parliament in its deliberations on legislative proposals of the Government.  This is the second time in the last ten years that such a motion has been proposed in this House.</P>
      <P>I have not had time to check on the number of guillotine motions we have had from this Government.  The Government, on 4th August, 1971, after days and days of debate on the Forcible Entry Bill, came in with a guillotine motion, on one Bill at Report Stage.  We had Deputy Fitzpatrick saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> This is the second time in the last ten years that such a motion has been proposed in this House.  The previous occasion was on the Marts Bill, and I believe such a resolution has only been proposed in the House on a few occasions since the foundation of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now got the basis for Deputy Cruise-O'Brien's definition of &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo;&mdash;his own colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I want to tell the Parliamentary Secretary, as I told him two weeks ago, that we are willing to sit through August and September in order to see that the Wealth Tax Bill is a proper measure when it goes through.  Deputy Fitzpatrick continued:</P>
      <P>As I say, this is a procedure which takes away from Parliament the function of Parliament to examine, discuss and scrutinise legislation, particularly legislation of a controversial nature, affecting the rights of the ordinary citizen.  One would expect, therefore, that when a resolution like this is introduced in the name of the Taoiseach's Parliamentary Secretary it would be justified on the grounds of urgency, at least.</P>
      <P>I cannot see that the Parliamentary Secretary today learned anything from his colleague Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Did he know when he came into the House with this motion so early in July that he was embarrassing the Minister for Lands? Deputy Fitzpatrick on that occasion said:</P>
      <P>There is no urgency about this measure.  There are many measures on the Order Paper which are much more urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond tells us that this is a guillotine motion on only the Wealth Tax Bill.  Did nobody tell <Col N="1163" /> him that there are seven other Bills involved, two motions and four Estimates? Here is the Labour Party Whip who has got the message from his Labour partners quite clearly: &ldquo;Deputy Desmond, get that wealth tax through because you never know what the Taoiseach might do in August or September.  We must get that wealth tax through or we cannot hold our heads up in the next election&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>You have the Fine Gael Deputies who are left without a service from the Government Information Service for the speeches they are making.  The speeches of the GIS are one kind but the speeches being made by Deputy Esmonde and various other people appearing in the local papers at home are: &ldquo;Listen, farmers my friends, there is no wealth tax.  It will be watered down.  You need not have any worries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>But here you have the socialists: &ldquo;Get this wealth tax through&rdquo;.  The Parliamentary Secretary will believe that I have friends in the Fine Gael party in my constituency.  There are a few decent people in Fine Gael.  I have met good people down there, people who have been agents for the not so good people who are Deputies, and they have told me things. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said I to one of them, &ldquo;how in the name of God are you going to face your supporters in the next election with this wealth tax?&rdquo;&ldquo;There is no problem,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;We are going it alone the next time.  We are going to shake off those fellows and I can assure you there will be no wealth tax as soon as we shake off those Labour fellows.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot understand this motion.  I told the Parliamentary Secretary two or three weeks ago that we could have our summer holidays without the Wealth Tax Bill, but the rebels must have gone into action and said: &ldquo;You will not&rdquo;.  Here we have a guillotine motion to deal with urgent business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>They were never shrinking like the Parliamentary Secretary is now.  At column 3257 of Volume 255, four years ago, Deputy Fitzpatrick said:</P>
      <P>There is no urgency about this measure.  There are many measures on the Order Paper which are much more urgent, measures which have been disgracefully neglected, measures which are not of a controversial nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael put down a Bill to amend the Planning and Development Act in 1963, a Bill designed to take planning appeals out of the hands of the political head of the Department and his political <Col N="1165" /> friends.  We debated the Bill for a considerable time and the then Minister for Local Government said he accepted our Bill in principle and that he would introduce his own Bill to bring about the desired changes.</P>
    <P>Here we are, going on our summer holidays four years later, and it is the intention of the Government to take planning permission out of the Minister's hands and they do not think that is urgent now.  Fair enough, I accept that.</P>

      <P>There is one other quotation I should like to give.  At column 3269 Deputy Cluskey, who is still with us, thank God, is reported:</P>
      <P>The Government, by their complete denial of the rights of the Deputies in this House to discuss the Bill adequately and properly, in my opinion dealt a far more serious blow to parliamentary democracy than they have ever done in their history, and God knows their history, as far as parliamentary democracy is concerned, is nothing to be proud of.</P>
      <P>That was Deputy Cluskey's idea of Fianna Fáil when we were moving a guillotine on a Bill on Report Stage, having discussed three amendments in 40 hours.  Of course we then had a contribution from the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who had some difficulty with the English language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>He was just back from Africa then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The then Deputy Cluskey who felt it was wrong at that stage, however has changed his mind now.  He felt that a Bill that had been debated for a considerable number of days in the House needed further debate.  In fairness to him, he saw something in the Bill with which he disagreed.  But we are being asked <Col N="1166" /> here today to deal with four Bills and we do not know what is in them. This House including the backbenchers, the democrats, of the Fine Gael and Labour parties, are being asked to vote for four Bills.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Lands, Deputy Fitzpatrick, felt it was a negation of democracy to confine the time on a measure that the Government felt had been adequately dealt with.</P>
      <P>If the Government felt that the Wealth Tax Bill should be confined, one could make a case for them, apart from the Parliamentary Secretary's reference to the amount of time we spent on the Second Stage.  The Second Stage debate proved to the Parliamentary Secretary that his allegation was wrong that there were only four or five people on the Fianna Fáil side that had an interest in the Wealth Tax Bill.  We proved on Second Stage that every member of Fianna Fáil would have had something to say about the wealth tax but for the guillotine that was used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered the system that the Deputy is suggesting.  It would not have worked.  If we had not included all the business the rest would have been talked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I give the Parliamentary Secretary credit that he is honest enough to have given consideration to it.  I find it impossible to believe of him as a democrat, as I accept he is, and as a reasonable man, that he would come into the House and ask Members of Parliament to give a mere two hours debating time to four Bills which we have not seen.  We know from our experience of the Minister for Finance that every one of the Ministers involved in those Bills would be capable of making a 60 minute Second Reading speech.  We know from the example we got from the strutting, arrogant Minister for Finance last night that they would be capable of doing that, thus ruling out any contribution from the Opposition. In regard to the Gaeltacht Industries Bill, the Government Information Service, with the full and wholehearted <Col N="1167" /> co-operation of RTE, dictated to by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, have spent the last week on the projection of the Minister for the Gaeltacht, and the least he could be expected to be given to project himself would be an hour.</P>
      <P>There are so many questions that the ordinary person here wants answered that he would need an hour. He was not here yesterday and was very incompetently represented by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  No blame to him.  He just had not the information. If you are going to invent something for television scripts the Government Information Service want something to give the impression that something is happening. The poor old Minister for the Gaeltacht tried to supply it and sent this reference to 1,000 new jobs.  He will have to justify it in some way.  It appeared that the capacity of the Department of the Gaeltacht to supply back-up information tion that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government could use in this House fell short of requirements.</P>
      <P>Our legitimate fear arises from our experience.  In regard to the election of conservators, there is no reason to believe that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will not take a full two hours on the motion.  Nobody in the House could imagine that the Minister is not capable of speaking for two hours.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary may nod his head.  He is taking good example from his boss in that regard.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are occasions when it would be just as well for the Parliamentary Secretary not to make statements.  At column 3271, Volume 255 of the Official Report, the then Deputy Cluskey said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we made it clear that we intended acting as an Opposition and intended doing what we were sent here to do by the electorate&mdash; oppose&mdash;and were not concerned unduly with our holidays, there was <Col N="1169" /> a campaign in the corridors of the House whereby Fianna Fáil Deputies brought ushers and other members of the staff into corners to tell them what bad boys the Opposition were, particularly the Labour Party, and that this was a tremendous blow against workers.</P>
    <P>I am not making the case that Government Deputies are doing this at the present time, getting members of the staff to try to agree to this, because I do not accept for a moment that the Government give a damn about the members of the staff.  They have shown that consistently from the type of business ordered both in the Dáil and Seanad, which I maintain is non-essential business in the normal course, in order to satisfy the ego of one or other Minister, and in some cases to try to fix up the problem within the party but they have consistently shown that they do not give two hoots about the staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed our willingness, on the instructions of the Leader of my party, two weeks ago to sit here and debate the Wealth Tax Bill until it is properly put through.  We stand over that and we are willing to stay here.  If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks we are bluffing, let him withdraw the guillotine motion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond said this is for the closure of the Wealth Tax Bill only. Will somebody educate him?  He said:</P>
      <P>We all knew this was coming.</P>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary checks the record in regard to the two guillotine motions of the Fianna Fáil Government in 16 years he will find that in both instances the Taoiseach had specifically spelled out in the House about a week beforehand that if something had not been completed he would be forced to do something. This was not spelled out on this occasion. Deputy Desmond is a crystal ball gazer.  He said:</P>
      <P>We all knew it was coming.</P>
      <P>He also said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have given the Opposition enough rope to hang themselves. <Col N="1170" /> I do not know what he meant by that.  He admitted of course that Deputy Colley last night was quite entitled to kick the Minister for Finance in the groin.  Deputy Desmond is not privy to what happens in Government, or he should not be, but he said that we have nothing to worry about in the four Bills which we have not seen.  It has always been the practice that backbenchers and even Parliamentary Secretaries, with the exception of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, should not know what is in Bills until they are circulated.  Deputy Desmond apparently does know because he tells us that there is nothing in those Bills to worry about.  There is a Finance Bill which the Parliamentary Secretary said contains only three sections and that there is no reason why we, the bold boys in Fianna Fáil, should be allowed to talk it out.  He said they will give so many hours for it, most of the day.  He will probably put in speakers to use up most of those hours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or half the hours we agree on, if we agree on anything again.  If Deputy Colley has not convinced the Minister for Finance I will not mention a stone wall but there is the saying that timber is dense.  The situation is that we have to complete the Second Stage of the Finance Bill in the four or five hours of debate the Parliamentary Secretary speaks about.  It will have to be completed at 9.15 or 9.30 and, irrespective of what ideas Deputy Colley or any Member of the House might get about an amendment for Committee Stage, we will have half an hour, if that amendment is allowed to be moved because if the Ceann Comhairle at that stage calls&mdash;there was a new development last night&mdash;on the Minister to move the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill that is the last time a Fianna Fáil Deputy will be given the opportunity of speaking on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the guillotine which Deputy Desmond says is only aimed at the Wealth Tax Bill.  Here is a Finance Bill.  Normally we only have one <Col N="1171" /> Finance Bill in the year but in this extraordinary year we will have three. There is no question of urgency.  Time is not an issue because there is oodles of time.  It is clear that the Parliamentary Secretary is obsessed with trying to facilitate the wives of the Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Lalor on a very entertaining speech, one of the most entertaining I have ever heard in this House.  I am only sorry he spoiled it a bit, for me at least, when he suggested&mdash;we have been sitting very long hours and they have been a strain on those who work in Leinster House&mdash;that his side of the House and that alone had concern for those who work here, for their conditions, for their hours.  I do not think that is true.  I do not think it is true of either side of the House.  I think both sides of the House are concerned about it, and should be, and I do not think we should bandy that kind of approach around or get people involved in the political firing line who do not belong on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been reminded that in the past I have made very long speeches, as indeed I have, but I do not propose <Col N="1172" /> to do that on this occasion.  I propose to make a very short one.  I do not blame the Opposition for opposing or even for pushing, stern, stubborn opposition to a measure they detest to the verge of obstruction and even a bit over the verge.  They have done just that.  OK.  They object strongly to the wealth tax for reasons many of which they have put on record and they have set themselves to talk out the wealth tax.  That is of course what they have been doing.  They talk now as if what they were at was being prepared to sit into August and into September in order to improve the wealth tax.</P>

      <P>I would admit that they have as much desire to improve the wealth tax as they have to sit into August and September, and that is none at all, because they do not want the wealth tax, they are opposed to it.  Fair enough.  But the Government are committed to the wealth tax and the Government intend to get the wealth tax through this session.  Deputy Lalor has suggested, and has a political right to suggest, that the Government are divided on this issue and that there are rebels kicking one another in various parts of their anatomies and so on.  It is not like that at all.  The Government are united on this.  We are determined to get this measure through.</P>

      <P>It is the business of the Opposition to oppose but it is also the business of the Government to get Government business through and get it through on a reasonable schedule.  If we are to be faulted at all it would be for not introducing this measure a bit earlier, for not getting on with it as soon as we saw the pattern of things but we, considering the various considerations that there are in this matter, and they are complicated, decided to allow a great deal of time for this to be thrashed out, more time than has been <Col N="1173" /> given to almost any other measure, but there comes a time to call a halt. I do not believe in this willingness of Deputies opposite to sit into August and September because I saw when in Opposition an example of it.  I heard them when they were pushing a particular measure through which we were opposing with the same stubbornness and determination they have opposed the wealth tax.  I heard them say: &ldquo;Oppose away.  Keep it up.  Pour it on.  Talk away.  We will sit into August and September.  Sit as long as you like.&rdquo;  When they saw we were prepared to keep up that opposition into August down came the guillotine, bing, bing, bing, three times in a few hours, if I remember rightly.  It went through.  We complained about this.  These things happen.  That is part of the democratic process.</P>

      <P>We do not expect these Bills to be contentious. should any of them present problems it is my understanding that the Government will be reasonable and flexible in their interpretation of these measures.  We have no desire to crush reasonable debate in this matter but we have a strong desire to get our measures through and in particular to get the Wealth Tax Bill through, which is the most important measure in our society, before the end of this month.  It is our job to do that, and I believe the country know that it is our job to get through Government business.  I believe the passage of these measures will be welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the passage of the Wealth Tax Bill will be welcomed more widely in the country, perhaps, than Deputies opposite, who have fought it so long, find easy or perhaps palatable to believe.  In a debate like this, when everybody really knows, as the Parliamentary Secretary said in his bucket and spade intervention, that people here are anxious to terminate <Col N="1175" /> our proceedings as soon as reasonably possible and for the Dáil to go into recess, we have here something of a mock battle.  It is possible to say about that kind of mock battle that it is unedifying, distressing, farcical and so on.  It has elements of farce about it.  Democracy has elements of farce in it and perhaps these are not unhealthy.  Democracy is a substitute for a war.  It is a kind of mock battle. There has been a lot of mock battling in some of the speeches we have heard here.  It was one of the pleasantest aspects of Deputy Lalor's speech that he did not take it entirely seriously, and I do not think he intended the rest of us to take it so seriously either.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that well-known renegade Liberal, disagrees.  He says it will not. I agree with him.  It will mean that instead of having proper parliamentary democracy in Ireland, as we <Col N="1176" /> knew it over the years, we will have the sort of democracy they have in Portugal at the moment, a parliament that is elected and has about as much power as this Parliament will have when this sort of motion is passed.</P>

This was not done because of any military reason, any personal ability or qualities they might have but because it is in the interest of the Irish horse that they be seen to be promoted to senior positions in the Army. Is it any wonder that a Government which contains a Member who is prepared to treat the Army of the nation, which has always been loyal to the State rather than to any faction or any party in this country in such a way, should come along and move the most comprehensive guillotine motion that has ever been known in the history of the State and that certainly has no precedent in the history of Dáil Éireann and for which I suggest there is no precedent in the parliament of any western democracy?</P>

In each case the Minister concerned is entitled to start the debate and in each case, as Deputy Lalor has pointed out, he cannot be stopped utilising the entire two hours in relation to each of those Bills.  Then the Bills must go through. We are asked to accept that that is democracy, that it is respect for the parliamentary institutions of the country, that it is respect for the people of the country in respect of whom the Members of this House are the elected representatives.  I would like to conjecture what might have been the reaction of noted ex-liberals, like the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, if any Fianna Fáil Government ever tried to move a motion that contained one-eighth of what this contains.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the action of the Minister for Defence in altering the Defence Force Regulations so as to enable him to ignore the recommendations of the Chief of Staff in the promotion of Army Officers thus undermining the morale of the members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Dowling.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sad, indeed, that the occasion arose when Deputy <Col N="1178" /> Dowling had to put down this motion on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party. He had to do it for one reason and one reason only, that is, that the confidence of the Irish Army has been completely undermined and they are greatly disturbed by the fact that political influence has entered into the promotion of Army officers.  The Minister, by order on 17th June, saw fit to undo certain regulations made in 1954 by the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Defence.  These regulations give to the Chief of Staff the right to promote officers.  The Minister had to sign the promotions but it was really the Chief of Staff who made the promotions. The regulations of 1954 took out of the hands of politicians the right to appoint officers within the Army.</P>
      <P>From the foundation of the State up to 1954 experience has shown that that was the correct order to make at that time.  Now, in 1975, we see a complete reversal and we are back to the pre-1954 situation.  That is complete back-tracking.  It is bad for the country.  It is bad for the morale of the Army and it is bad for young men who are anxious to join the Army and have the brains and the ability to rise to the top.  Not only have we seen promotions given through political influence but they are given on the basis of a man's knowledge of horses.  This is something to which I will refer in a minute.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on the Minister to withdraw that order, to annual it and to get back to the previous procedure. He came in here last night and told us of his great friendship with the Chief of Staff, of the great discussions they had, how they might have had little disagreements but that it fell on his own broad shoulders to make some decision.  Surely if everything were going so well there was no need for him to bring in the order of 17th June, abrogating to himself completely the power to appoint the officers in the Army.  Promotion should be on merit and on ability as was the case down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Men of good education join the Army and wish to make it their <Col N="1179" /> career, but they will now ask themselves: &ldquo;What can I do if I have not got political pull?  What Government will be in power when I will be due for promotion?&rdquo;  That is very wrong.  It is high time we got rid of the political patronage being exercised at the moment.  Many jobs are given out under patronage, ability to do something for a political party.  We have it in relation to post offices and other sectors as well and it is bad for the country.</P>
    <P>The Army are entrusted with safeguarding the nation in time of war and with the preservation of law and order, working with the Garda.  This is a sector into which politics should not enter at all.  A young man in school might have thoughts of pursuing an Army career.  He may come from a humble cottage on the side of a hill.  He may come from an urban area.  He may come from a small town.  He may never have seen his father owning a brood mare.  He may never have seen the little foal at the back door or sold at the local fair. What chance has he of rising to the top, despite whatever ability he may have, if the Minister for Defence is to hold office for some years to come? Please God, he will not.  That young man's confidence in the institutions of this State can be completely eroded.</P>
    <P>I have seen this happening on committees of agriculture and so on and unless people have some political connections, be they Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, they have no chance on those bodies.  It is quite obvious now that unless a person is affiliated some way or another with or has done something for the Fine Gael Party he or his family are not going to get promotion within the Irish Army whether they deserve it or not.</P>
    <P>We have often used the expression &ldquo;To cherish all the children of the land equally&rdquo;.  Surely the order made by the Minister on 17th June cuts completely across this.  It is quite obvious that only the selected few will rise to the top.  The Minister came in here last night and tried to defend what happened.  He did so in a very subtle and cocky way but he did not <Col N="1180" /> really dwell on the nub of the whole matter and that is now his right to promote or not to promote officers within the Irish Army.  It is his sole right.  He does not have to say to the Chief of Staff: &ldquo;What do you think of this person?  What do you think of that person?  What kind of career had he?&rdquo;  He does not have to say that any more.  He has just to ask for a list of names and having got it, he can promote Mr. A or Mr. B. The Chief of Staff could say to him: &ldquo;That man is not fit for promotion&rdquo;. The Minister can tell him to mind his own business from now on.  What will happen in future is that the Chief of Staff will not say anything to the Minister.  He will just place a list of names in front of him and allow him to make his own choice.  This is bad.</P>
    <P>How is the Minister going to choose? What special knowledge has he that the Chief of Staff has not got?  He has none whatsoever, except political knowledge.  Why did the Minister state that he knew that some of the men he would be promoting had a Fianna Fáil outlook?  Why should the Minister have to know that?  I thought there was secrecy of the ballot.  Has the Minister that on his records&mdash;a man's political outlook, how he votes, how he does not vote?  This is a disgrace. It is shocking for a Minister to say to an Irish Parliament or to say to the newspapers: &ldquo;I know the men I have promoted.  I know their political outlook.  I know the party they support.  I know how they are going to vote in the next election.&rdquo; This is not good enough.  It is a very bad thing.  It is a bad thing for any Minister, or even a layman, to find out a man's political allegiance before giving him promotion.  This is very sad.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that if a person was involved in the Army Equitation School&mdash;the Army Equitation School are doing a very good job&mdash;it would be to his advantage.  The Minister has said that they would have to be looked after very well in order to advertise the Irish horse.  It is not so long ago since the Minister told me that they were now working in conjunction with Bord na gCapall.  They do not seem to exist at all now.  They do not get <Col N="1181" /> credit for anything.  If someone wants to become an <i>aide-de-camp</i> to the present Taoiseach he must have a knowledge of horses; from there on, Bob's your uncle, you fly the course the rest of the way.  If there is a Taoiseach who has a liking for a particular pastime, he is entitled to it but he is not entitled to promote people within the Army because they also share the same pastime.  Suppose there was another Taoiseach who was a great admirer of soccer players and he promoted some soccer star in the Army, would that not be a ridiculous situation?  I will not mention what would happen if we had a Taoiseach who liked camogie players.  I suppose if the Minister had his way he would promote people who were interested in yachting.  A person's pastime should not be taken into account.  If a person's pastime were to be taken into consideration before he could be promoted in the Army, that would be very bad.  When this debate is finished I hope the Minister will stand up and say he is reverting to the original position and is giving the power back to the Chief of Staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that it is only Fianna Fáil who are complaining.  I have newspaper cuttings which quote the views of various people.  An article in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 28th June states:</P>
    <P>When they were discussing it as one senior officer said last night, there has always been a certain amount of jobs for the boys in the Army but this is the most blatant case of all.  From now on it appears that to be a good officer every man will have to pass through the Equitation School.</P>
    <P>I quoted that in order to show the Minister that it is not only Fianna Fáil who are complaining; it is also happening within the Force because confidence has been undermined.  As Deputy Dowling said yesterday, the Minister is taking on a dangerous mantle of power.  Dictatorship is bad and dangerous because everything depends on the whims and fancies of the dictator.  We had the example in the last month of General Amin. One day he was sentencing a person <Col N="1182" /> to death and the next day commuting the sentence and letting the person go free the day after that.  He did not really know what he was doing.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister&mdash;perhaps he is a very strongwilled person; we all have our own characteristics&mdash;has often taken over power at the wrong time to the embarrassment of the Army and the nation.  We all know what happened in the case of the <i>Claudia</i>.  At that time the Minister took over complete command and he made a right &ldquo;cod&rdquo; of the affair. People were allowed to go free out of the country while nationals who were on the same ship had to appear in court.  Those nationals are paying dearly for their involvement; they have been deprived of their jobs but non-nationals were let go free on the Minister's instructions.  That is something the Minister should not have done.  We also have the case of the Border incursions.  Application must now be made to the Minister by the British Army if they want to defuse a bomb or fly over the Twenty-six Counties.  Why not give that authority to the Army or to the men in the field?  The Minister could be away in Cork, Kerry or even yachting.  More luck to the Minister to enjoy his spare time, but how would he be contacted? All this adds up to the fact that the Minister appears to be taking over complete control of the Army and has no respect for the Army Council or for the views of the Chief of Staff. It was quite obvious that the Chief of Staff resisted the Minister when he made the recent appointments; especially when a junior commandant was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. That was a big jump.  It has been said that he was one of the most junior officers in the Army and jumped over 100 places in rank.  That is bad for Army morale.  The Minister has said himself that there are not too many promotions, but the ones given should be seen to be given on merit.</P>
    <P>Another point which I want to comment on was the discussion of this matter by the media and the sickening article written by a reporter in <i>The Sunday Independent</i> on 6th July, 1975, entitled: &ldquo;An Army Row: Fianna Fáil must be joking&rdquo;.  The article <Col N="1183" /> quoted the case of people years ago, claiming they got to the top by patronage, by knowing people, by political pull.  The impression was given in the article that this was the right thing to do and that the Minister was right in taking precedents from that period. I thought that in the 1954 Act, where we gave the choice of promotion to the Chief of Staff, we had done away with patronage.  Imagine a reporter writing an article backing up what the Minister is now doing and saying there was a precedent for it in 1930, 1932, naming people and actually naming them in the wrong as it stated because there was a Bill brought in to give people with 1917-21 service an extension of two years.  Deputy Dowling will probably refer to this when he is winding up the debate.</P>
    <P>This was a shocking article.  My first reaction when reading it was that somebody from the Government Information Bureau had tipped off somebody to write it.  We all know that the taxpayer is paying heavily for the public relations job that is being done for the present Government. It seems it was intended to stymie discussion in the House on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.  The article also stated on 6th July that the Leader of Fianna Fáil might softpedal his demands for a full debate on the change in the regulations which the Minister for Defence has made. There is no such thing as soft-pedalling at all.  What has been done is completely wrong, and if the Minister wants to do the right thing he will stand up and undo the changes; in doing that he will have the best wishes of the House.</P>
    <P>How can any of the Deputies opposite vote against this motion?  The motion simply says that the action of the Minister has to be deplored because it enables him to ignore the recommendations of the Chief of Staff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde said last night that the Minister was no more than a rubber stamp up to now; that the Minister should do this and the Minister should do that.  Does that principle run all through our society? There are key jobs throughout the country; there are such institutions as <Col N="1184" /> interview boards; there are such things as appointment commissioners. What about the Civil Service?  The Minister does not make the decision there.  What about the appointment of a teacher in a primary school?  The appointment must be sanctioned by the Department; yet it is not the Department who make the decision but a person at local level.  Many Ministers have very heavy responsibility in regard to appointments but they do not actually make the appointments. Therefore, Deputy Esmonde's case falls down completely on that point.  His idea if implemented acrossthe-board would be that the Minister would appoint everyone to every type of position.  It is a fact that from 1954 until 17th June, 1975, the various Chiefs of Staff&mdash;we have had excellent men including the present man&mdash;have been able to consult with the Minister for Defence regarding the various promotions.  There may have been differences but they were resolved.  That is now a thing of the past.  The Chief of Staff no longer has the right to say to the Minister: &ldquo;This is the best man for promotion.&rdquo;  Instead of that, we have the position where names will be given to the Minister and he can choose from those names or get other names instead. That adds up to patronage of the highest order.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that when vacancies are to be filled the word goes around. It will be more like the appointment of a postmaster or a postmistress in an urban or rural area where the local Dáil Deputies of the governing party are contacted to make representations so that a certain person may be appointed.  Even at that level, there is an interview board which will select the candidates.  Often two or three names will be sent to the Minister.  I thought that was a bad system.  What will happen now is that it will be the same system when it comes to appointments in the Army.  You will have Deputies of all parties trekking to the Minister's room to make sure that, no matter what comes up in the files, Fine Gael or Labour should be down after that man's name.  Is this not very sad?  The Minister has stated that quite blatantly and openly. <Col N="1185" /> It is very sad indeed, and I will say it again, that he should ever say, even in newspaper interviews, that he knew well the politics of the men who were promoted.  That was a wrong thing to mention.  That was their own private business, and if they wanted to belong to political parties that was a matter for themselves.  Their political outlook should have nothing at all to do with their promotions, if they have the ability and have served their time well, bearing in mind that the Army is there to serve the country as a whole regardless of politics.  That is what the Army is there for.</P>
    <P>If the Minister goes back he will find someone to back up my views, none other than the late Deputy Seán Collins who in 1951&mdash;look up the 1951 Defence Bill&mdash;stated that political influence should be completely divorced from Army promotions and should not have anything at all to do with Army life. The late Deputy Seán Collins was a member of the Minister's party; he was a nephew of the late Michael Collins.  I could not quote any man who would be more influential within the Minister's party than the late Deputy Seán Collins.  That was his view in 1951 and it is something well worth listening to.  But now it is backwards we are moving, backwards to the old game of patronage.  It is not a case of who you are at all, but who you know.  It is not a case of your ability to perform in the field, but a case of your ability to pull the right strings.  This is a sad day.  We have seen a great deal of patronage from this Government, wicked patronage.  We have seen men having each way bets who ran, as they say in the country, right through the judicial system, right up to the top of their each way bet; if they did not win one contest they were sure to win in another.  We have seen peace commissioners who are more plentiful now, as somebody said down the country, than warble flies, and they were very plentiful at one time.  All these have been promoted on patronage because of what they did for a political party. <Col N="1186" /> It would be bad for the country if, when Fianna Fáil get back into power, they were to stick to the Minister's rules and regulations.  That would be very bad for the nation.  It would be very bad for the morale of the Army.  I am thinking mostly of the young men seeking out Army life as a career.  What do they think of the Ireland of 1975?  Are they not entitled to rise to the top in any walk of life they choose without their political affiliations either advancing or retarding them?  How can a Minister who is rarely in his office know men better than the Chief of Staff who has known them for nearly 30 years.  He knows the day men joined up.  He knows their progress, their characters, how they will suit the different positions.  That is all gone now.  The names come before the Minister and he can, with the stroke of a pen, appoint whom he likes.</P>
    <P>I support this motion.  If this country is going to continue on this course of wicked patronage, we are heading for a shock, for dictatorship and the destruction of democracy as we know it.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Power and Deputy Bermingham, I have the honour to represent a constituency in which we have the largest military establishment in the country and it is my business to know about the morale and the mood of Army personnel. Since the advent of the present Government and the work which the Minister, Deputy Donegan, has done for the Army, morale was never higher.  In fact, until the present Minister took office the Army was the Cinderella of all the public services.  It was well known that to get young fellows to join the Army was just not on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister has made the Army a worth-while career for young fellows.  They are now well paid and well looked after.  They have equipment, pay and housing such as they never had before.  I believe and hope that the progress made in such a very short time will continue.  Because it is the responsibility of the Minister, he has <Col N="1187" /> exercised his power to bring about vast changes in the Army and Opposition speakers will not be thanked by the Army for the attitude that they have adopted in this debate.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that Deputy Power reproved the Minister for what he has done and I was disappointed because I do not think that Deputy Power is the kind of man to make a political football out of the Army. He refers to the postal vote, which is fair enough.  But why did we get it? We got it because it was impossible to get a job in the Curragh, Kildare or Naas unless you were a member of the local Fianna Fáil Cumann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very well known that this political patronage went on for years under Fianna Fáil.  It was, I repeat, impossible to get anything in the nature of a job in the Army or promotion in the Army unless you were a Fianna Fáil sidekick. Even more important was the reference, yesterday evening, by Deputy Dowling who stated, that he had the priority lists of people who have been passed over regardless who had given long and valuable service.  Let Deputy Dowling tell us exactly what he has got.  Is this confidential information?  If he has information which is confidential it is his duty to tell us when he is replying to this debate where he got that information and, if necessary, perhaps he would have a word with the leader of his party who could speak to the Taoiseach about it.  If he has confidential information who else has it? There are people in this country who would be only too delighted to lay their hands on a photostat copy of something or other.  It is frightening to think of what the position would <Col N="1188" /> be if people who are prepared to leak information might do something similar to further their own political ends.</P>
      <P>I know Deputy Dowling is interested in the Army.  As spokesman on Defence for the Fianna Fáil Party, I know he has visited some of the military establishments, perhaps all.  To use the phrase Deputy Meaney used so often in his speech this evening, it is very sad that a responsible spokesman should come into this House and try to undermine the morale of the Army and the Minister.  We have had many debates on defence.  We have had interesting debates on the Estimates but we have never had one such as this which tries to undermine the morale of the people we depend on to look after our interests in times of emergency.</P>
      <P>When it came to making appointments and promotions, there were seven positions to be filled, and only seven.  The Minister is to be congratulated on his courage in the manner in which he set about this task.  Of course there are disappointed people. There are disappointed people on these benches here because they were not made Ministers.  There are disappointed people on the other side of the House because they are not sitting on the front benches since the Leader of the Opposition reshuffled the front bench.  There are disappointed people in all walks of life who have to wait their turn.  If the tone of this debate from the other side of the House were to continue we could tragically have more than disappointed people.  I would ask Deputy Dowling to be man enough now to withdraw the motion because all it can do is harm to a body which has stood the test of time in serving the country and the people well.  We hope that it will remain that way forever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support this motion.  I deplore the circumstances which provoked the motion.  Deputies on this side of the House have justifiably criticised at length the Minister's action in taking a most vital function relating to the Army out of the hands of the Army Chief of Staff and the Army Council.  Detailed criticism <Col N="1189" /> has been made of various aspects of the Minister's action, but I am more concerned about the security aspect. I shudder to think what could be the consequences of this decision on the part of the Minister in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>We in this House have always acknowledged that the Army are the buttress of the State.  It is important to say this because they are the last line of defence.  We recognise their value to the nation.  From time to time Members on both sides of this House have paid suitable and welldeserved tribute to the unswerving loyalty of the armed forces to the Government of the day.  Indeed, few armies in the world have as fine a tradition in this respect.  It has always been emphasised in this House&mdash;and I remember doing so in my last contribution to the Defence Estimate&mdash; that the Army are one area from which politics should be absolutely excluded.  In view of the Minister's recent action in taking on himself the right to decide on Army and military promotions, I am beginning to think that the views expressed in that regard by individuals from time to time were ill-founded and misplaced.</P>
      <P>The recent promotions are over and done with, and perhaps the people most embarrassed are the beneficiaries themselves.  By far the most serious aspect of the serious action is its possible consequences on the security of the State in particular circumstances.  The change in Defence Force Regulations which the Minister has made takes away from the Chief of Staff the control of the appointment and promotion of officers.  The Minister has now assumed these functions.  That being so, look at the risk this involves.  It takes the major responsibility for senior structuring of the Army away from the Army Council and the Government-appointed specialist the Chief of Staff, and it places it in the hands of the Minister of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognise that we might not always have a Minister as responsible as the present Minister.  In changing times there will be changing Ministers and ministries.  That ministry could <Col N="1190" /> well fall into the hands of an individual with lesser qualities of judgment and in the extreme situation with subversive tendencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy speaking about the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Without casting aspersions in any direction there are some gentlemen in this House to whom I would not give responsibility for the armed forces.  The Minister, by his action now, controls the Army.  He can make and break.  He can shift and change.  He can promote if he so wishes.  If he wants to&mdash;and he seems to be doing so; I would not place all the blame on the Minister; the Taoiseach and the Government are equally to blame&mdash;he can promote his favourites into key positions.  That is not important.  The important point I want to stress is that it is totally irresponsible to take away from the specialist Government-appointed Chief of Staff, the function of judging the performance of his officers and promoting them, and give that function to whoever may be appointed Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>At one time I held that office.  I know what happens.  I never had problems with the Chief of Staff in relation to promotions.  He followed the regulations of the day in recommending officers for promotion.  I took advantage of my entitlement and my right to query the appointment of officers from time to time but never once did I exert my influence on the Chief of Staff to appoint one officer above another.  I shudder to think of being made responsible for the selection of officers down the line.  I just would not accept it.  I am disappointed that the Minister has taken this right unto himself to the total exclusion of the Chief of Staff.  It is most unpatriotic and, to say the least, it is selfish and it is tainted with politics right throughout.  We know some of the personnel concerned.  That makes no difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of thing&mdash;apart from the principle which I have attempted to outline&mdash;is very bad for the morale of the Army.  Like Deputy Malone and Deputy Power I have a first-class <Col N="1191" /> military unit in the first motor squadron in Fermoy.  It has distinguished itself many times.  I know the mood of the Army.  I know the reaction at many points to the latest change in the regulations.  This is the third time in 25 years that this Defence Forces regulation has been changed, and it is more than a coincidence that the changes took place in each case during the term of office of a Coalition Government.  Fianna Fáil left the responsibility as of right, in the hands of the Chief of Staff.  That is as it was and as it should be.  When Fianna Fáil get back to office the Chief of Staff will be the boss in relation to the promotion and the selection of officers.  I hope that will not be very long.</P>
    <P>Coalition Governments appear to have been determined to put their own men in key positions in the Army.  Personnel are severely punished if they have any political taint at all connected with their requirements whether it be a transfer or anything else.  If a private looks for a transfer, for domestic reasons or otherwise, from one post to another and if it so happens that in the past political representations were made to bring that about, he is paraded.</P>
    <P>So far as Army promotions, especially at the top level, are concerned, I am disappointed that the Minister should have taken this action which will add a political taint, political skulduggery, to the appointment of officers.  It is bad for the morale of the Army, and whatever Deputy Malone will say in trying to defend the action of the Minister in relation to Army promotions, it is no use. Young men who apply for cadetships will now feel more than ever that unless they have pull with their local TDs they have no possible chance of even becoming a cadet not to mind reaching the level of officer, colonel or lieutenant-colonel and so on.  I would beg of the Minister&mdash;he is a man of common sense, he has shown fine qualities in many ways&mdash;to remove this thing right away before it creeps right through the Army and lets down a force and an organisation <Col N="1192" /> which has served this country proudly for many years.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to criticise the Minister during the early stages of his appointment.  It had to do with the matter of military ex-servicemen.  We had two fine officers who had given distinguished service both at home and at the United Nations rejected and pitched off the Army Pensions Board and replaced by two hacks from the Fianna Fáil organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>They were two fine officers who had given service both at home and at United Nations level. One had got a particular rank because of his service.  Three months after the election of the Coalition Government these two officers were shoved away and in their places were put two gentlemen who would not know an Army uniform from a Garda uniform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael, of course. There was not even one from Labour. Deputy Meaney referred to <i>The Sunday Independent</i> article, which, of course was anonymous, criticising a former Minister for asking certain officers to submit their resignations. The writer said the officers submitted their resignations and they were accepted.  He did not say in his report that the Minister of the day gave a two-year leave with pay to the resigning officers.  Neither did he say that the officers were asked to resign because the previous Minister for Defence had made a mess of it in giving extensions for people with medals&mdash;creating a block in promotions. The logical thing for the Minister to do then was to clear the way for promotions and open up some hope within the defence organisation.  He did it in an honourable way and gave suitable gratuities to the retiring officers.  This must be put on the record and made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the aspects of the present decision have been referred to.  I could go all over them again but that would be a waste of time.  I have the utmost respect for the Army personnel. <Col N="1193" /> I had a lot of dealings with them for three years.  They are upright and honourable and they expect respect from this House and from politicians, from the Minister for Defence and the Government.  A Government to them is a Government they can serve loyally as they have shown.  In 30 or 40 years they have given their loyalty to the Government of the day.  For heaven's sake, would the Minister change his mind about this?  He may not do anything desperate, and I am sure he will not, but perhaps a Minister will succeed in the conglomeration of Government which we have&mdash;some queer fellow might become Minister for Defence and God alone knows what he would do when it comes to Army promotions.</P>

      <P>The fault I would find with the Fianna Fáil motion is the general inadequacy of it.  I do not think it is sufficient for one to come into this House and table a motion critical of any Minister unless one has a rational alternative to offer. Deputy Dowling and Deputy Power failed to advance a point of view.  If I may remind the House, we heard last evening a horrific alternative from the Fianna Fáil benches, namely, that there should be a selection board from the top echelons of the Army, a promotional procedure composed of a number of representatives of the high ranks in the Army, and one from each of the political parties.  This was advanced in all seriousness by Deputy Dowling as the most desirable political&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I regard the Irish Army as part of the democratic institutions of this State.  I regard the future role of promotions within the Army as far too grave an issue to be merely the subject of an Opposition motion and the kind of proposition we had from a Deputy from County Kildare, an important Army constituency.  Apart from the criticisms of Deputy Dowling, we have not heard from him, as shadow spokesman, what he thinks is the most desirable procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been over the years changes in promotion procedures.  In my experience in public life since 1969 and in my experience <Col N="1195" /> in trade union life perhaps the one outstanding feature that I have found irrespective of what Government were in power, and I say this in the presence of a former Minister for Defence, Deputy Cronin, has been always the most serious and disquieting allegation made that this officer or that officer had received promotion because of either his personal political leanings (unknown) or the personal political leanings of his father (unknown) or of his mother (unknown) or the service of his uncle or aunt in the Army (unknown).  There has always been that particular overtone in Army promotions.  Okay, we as politicians have glossed over it.  It has suited some, it has not suited the others.  That is the most outstanding feature that I have found as a trade union official.  I wish they had a trade union in the Army, and I would remind Members of this House that in many countries, including many NATO countries, members of the Army are organised in their public service trade union and they negotiate with the Government of the day promotion procedures.  As we see, conceded by the institutions of the State and conceded by Dáil Éireann now, in relation to the Garda Síochána, there are the Garda representative bodies, the various bodies for the various ranks within the Garda Síochána and they have discussions, negotiations, promotion procedures, selection procedures and interview board procedures and they are known within the force and by and large the extent to which there is a degree of accusation or a degree of frustration arising out of the latest political influence is substantially mitigated by the existence of these organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying to the Minister that we have arrived at the stage of political maturity when perhaps it would be desirable to review promotion procedures&mdash;I speak purely from a trade union background with no personal record in the Army, apart from knowing various officers over the years on a purely <Col N="1196" /> personal social basis, and each person has his own covert version, how soand-so got promotion and how he did not get it.  I would suggest that there is a serious case to be made now for reviewing the promotion procedures within all levels of the Army.  I do not think it is in any way a defence on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party to suggest that there have been three changes in the various Coalitions we have had here because I have heard, during the periods of office of successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Defence as many allegations and I would stress &mdash;let us be careful&mdash;unsupported allegations where people have rumoured that perhaps they were done out of promotion or otherwise because they did not have a particular political leaning or their family had not.  I do not think that it is any great consolation to the Opposition to note that these feelings and frustrations within the Army were any better during their term of office than they may be within the terms of office of a Coalition Government.  We are allowed to talk freely within the House on such a matter.</P>

I just throw out the question to a former Minister, Deputy Cronin: is it desirable that we should have Deputy Cronin making the kind of statement which he made here tonight&mdash;and I stand to be corrected if I did not hear the Deputy correctly?

After all, the Government appoint the Chief of Staff. Nobody is going to deny to any Government or any Cabinet the right to appoint a Chief of Staff.  I pay tribute to the Minister.  He is the most outstanding Minister for Defence we have had, in many areas, certainly since the Second World War.  I can only go back to the 1940s. From what I know of Irish political history, the Minister, Deputy <Col N="1199" /> Donegan, has been outstanding, not just for the Army, but for the Navy and many other areas, and he is held in very high esteem in the Navy, in the Army and in many other areas.</P>

I would not be happy to see, for the sake of argument, Deputy Dowling or Deputy Power replace the Minister and say: &ldquo;Well, now, we are going to change it once again&rdquo;.  Here we go on what one might call a political promotional merry-go-round.  We owe the Army something better than that. The Army is deserving of a better approach from us in that regard.</P>
      <P>I strongly suggest, therefore, that we should examine the regulations. The Minister is an entirely objective person and a man who is deeply involved in the Army.  He has given it, God knows, more than an honest day's work.  He has given it all his time since he took up the portfolio.  To use his own phrase he has been up to his tonsils developing the Army and the institutions of the State and ensuring that he obtains sufficient money from the Cabinet to continue his excellent work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had no discussions with the Minister on this motion.  I reserve my right always, as a Labour Party backbencher, to come in and talk on any motion.  It is accepted, I am sure, in that spirit by the Minister for Defence.  I think the Minister is sufficiently open and sufficiently sensitive and the Government are also sufficiently sensitive, in the best interests of the State, and by that I include the Army as a pivotal element within the democratic institutions of the State.  I think Deputy Dowling and his colleagues would also share my view that perhaps it would be a desirable <Col N="1200" /> and essential exercise in the preservation of the democratic institutions of this State and in preserving an atmosphere of entire satisfaction within the Army that we should review promotional regulations and have them down in black and white, define precisely the role of the Chief of Staff, define the role of the senior hierarchical elements and define the role of the Minister.  On a personal superficial examination, I think the role of the Minister is quite superficial in that regard, it is quite vague in terms of what the Minister may do or may not do in terms, for example of where the Minister has said he was in disagreement over one promotion with the Chief of Staff.  Was he going to back down?  Was the Chief of Staff going to back down?  Is it desirable that we have that kind of situation in relation to the Army?  I submit that it is undesirable and we, as the legislators, as the men who must one way or another put the regulations into the Dáil Library and stand over them, owe it to nation and to the Army to review the procedure as a matter of some urgency.</P>
    <P>These are my comments on the motion.  I understand Deputy O'Kennedy wishes to speak and I do not want to prolong the discussion any further except to put on record my personal respect for the Minister. If I had no respect for him I would not bother my head to come in and talk on Army promotions.  I have found the Minister, Deputy Donegan, to be a man to whom I can always go. I would stress, however, that never once since I became a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas have I gone to either Deputy Cronin, the former Minister, or to Deputy Donegan, and said: &ldquo;Johnny so-and-so is looking for a transfer from Dublin to Collins Barracks, Cork, or he would like to go down to Athlone.&rdquo;  I have never gone to a Minister and said I wanted him to do something for an Army officer or indeed for any member of the Army of any rank.  It is now under statute a criminal offence for a Member of this House to make representations to the Minister for Justice in relation to a matter which appertains <Col N="1201" /> to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I would like to see it a similar offence under a regulation of this House for any Member of the House to go to a Minister and make special representations to him about an Army officer who is perhaps coming up to retirement and who might feel, or whose family might feel, that he should get promotion.  I would make it a criminal offence for a Member of the House to make that kind of representation.  I do not know if Deputies would agree with me.  Let us consider that kind of <i>modus operandi,</i> that kind of regulation. Let us broaden out the regulations. In fairness to the Chief of Staff, who has been the subject of criticism, the No. 1 man, whether it is the Minister or the Chief of Staff, always has to face criticism from within and from below and he is always in an invidious position.  We, the Members of the Oireachtas, owe it to the Chief of Staff to protect him from that kind of situation.  We owe it to him, and the Minister owes it to himself, to ensure that regulations do not place him in the position in which he found himself, and the Chief of Staff does not find himself, through regulations, in a position of conflict with the Executive of the day.  I assure Deputy Cronin that he need have no worries whether any member of the Coalition Government can finish up holding the Defence portfolio, we will hold it and respect it with equal distinction in this House.  Deputy Donegan has, to my mind, been an outstanding holder of that portfolio.  He is a most sensitive Minister in relation to his work.  With due respect to the Fianna Fáil Party, I should not like to put the procedure they suggested of a limited number of the hierarchy of the Army, together with one representative of each political party, before any Army mess or Army canteen because, God knows, the horse laughs would come, not from the equitation school but from the transport and supply unit itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter on which we could all reach agreement and that is that the role and function of the Army, so aptly described <Col N="1202" /> by the former Minister, Deputy Cronin, as the last bulwark of defence of the nation, should not in any way be determined or conditioned by the personality of the holder of the office of the Minister for Defence for the time being.  If it were not so conditioned and limited it would be a very hazardous thing and that last bulwark of defence would, in fact, change or alter according to the personality of the Minister for Defence for the time being.  If I have interpreted Deputy Desmond correctly in what he said, and I sympathise, though I was confused initially, with the spirit of what he said to a considerable extent&mdash;I am not quite sure about some of the detail&mdash;I think he, too, would strongly support that.</P>
      <P>The Army in its own right, by virtue of the role it plays in this and any State must, in fact, be allowed to function to the greatest possible extent independent of the political executive influence.  Deputy Cronin properly and fairly conceded that there have been many fine things done by the present Minister and I would be less than honest if I did not concede that too.  Having said that, might I analyse what I think is more crucial to this debate and that is the Minister's attitude on what his function is <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Army.  What greater authority could one have for this than the Minister's own words here in the House last night?  I am rather surprised that the commentators in today's newspapers&mdash;those who did comment&mdash;did not make any comment on some of the statements made by the Minister last night which I found surprising and rather frightening. He said, and I quote from the unrevised version, which I have had an opportunity of checking in the Editor's office in relation to his function:</P>
      <P>I am in between, if you like, the Chief of Staff and the men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever else the Minister for Defence is in relation to the Army, that is one place in which he firmly and clearly is not entitled to be, in between the Chief of Staff and the men.  There might be some argument for saying that the Chief of Staff was <Col N="1203" /> in between the Minister and the men. I am not sure that would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I regret to say the Minister has no function in between the Chief of Staff and the men except, of course, and this is not on the basis on which it was said, under the Defence Act and under the redress of wrongs section in the Act to adjudicate.  That, of course, is not to put him in between the Cheif of Staff and the men.  That is to put him in his role of Minister above them, to adjudicate on the basis of the authority exercised by the Chief of Staff and by other command staff.</P>

I have to adjudicate.  I do not want the job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I regret to say the Minister's function, whether or not he wants the job, under the Act, which we all cherish so much, is to do just that, but in doing so the Minister has no right to come between the Chief of Staff and the men.  Perhaps it was a loose expression on the part of the Minister, but he will find that when this debate is published&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it should depend on the personality of the Minister of the time.  I am merely saying that the Minister's understanding of his function is not in any way in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Act.  Again I am surprised that no commentators referred to this.  Again I quote from the unrevised version of what the Minister said:</P>
      <P>If I find myself in disagreement with the Chief of Staff then I have got to decide if I have the strength and courage, the guts, to make a change in the regulations or do I sit down and do nothing and allow that particular man not to be promoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clear impact&mdash;not implication&mdash; of that is that if the Minister finds that a particular man who he feels should have been promoted, would not be promoted on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff, then the Minister must show the guts, the courage and the conviction to change the Army regulations to enable him to make that promotion.  Again I have to say, that is not the function of the Minister under the Defence Act of 1954, nor the function of the Minister as outlined so fairly by Deputy Desmond, nor the function of the Minister as we would like the Army to understand it to be.  If the Minister <Col N="1205" /> is now acknowledging that that is why he is bringing in this amendment so that he may exercise the guts and show the strength and courage, then he is showing a false awareness of what his position is.</P>
    <P>I found the possessive talk last night most disquieting&mdash;&ldquo;My colonels, my men, my seven colonels&rdquo;.  I do not think any Minister has ever spoken in such a possessive manner of the Army.  This should not be a matter of personal judgment.  I am talking now of the broad issues of this matter. It must not be just a simple question of the judgment of the Minister <i>vis-à-vis</i> the judgment of the Chief of Staff. That will not resolve the real issue. The Minister might be right, the Chief of Staff might be right.  It is a question of which of these men in their judgment can best secure the morale of the Army?  Which of these men in their positions and their responsibilities can best secure the morale and place of the Army?  I would have to say, and I think anybody who looks at it objectively would have to say, irrespective of the personalities of the holders of these offices for the time being, that the man best equipped, by virtue of his profession, his standing and authority in the Army and by his place and responsibility in the Army, is the Chief of Staff.  On the question of adjudicating the merits of two different men, the Minister and the Chief of Staff, even on that level &mdash;it is not the level on which it should be approached&mdash;surely the Chief of Staff must be, all things being equal, in a better position to come to better decisions than the Minister who is not a permanent member of the Defence Forces in any event.</P>
    <P>There was a danger that we might have this debate on the basis of whether the Minister is better equipped than the present Chief of Staff or the present Chief of Staff is better equipped than the Minister. That is irrelevant.  It is a question of what the authority and status attaching to these two offices are.  I want to say to the Minister that now that he proposes to take to himself, as Minister, in discharge of this personal responsibility which he feels so <Col N="1206" /> strongly, he needs to discharge with strength, courage and guts&mdash;if he is doing that now is he equally satisfied that whoever comes into this position after him, as Minister for Defence, will have the same judgment, commitment, courage and guts that he has?  I do not think the morale of the officers of the Army or the Chief of Staff of the Army should depend on that accidental habit.  That is the inherent reaction I have to this amendment.</P>
    <P>We heard some reference again to law and order last night.  This Government and their predecessors in Government have from time to time, spoken of law and order as if they are the sole arbiters of what true law and order are.  The law and order of this nation reside in many institutions and are not the sole prerogative or responsibility of any one Minister, but what is being done here tonight entitles people to raise the question: &ldquo;Whose law?  Is it just the law as seen by the Government for the time being, and if so, what type of order will we get if that is the kind of law we are going to introduce into this House?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want briefly to refer to the Deputy who asked me to answer two questions, Deputy Malone.  One was in relation to a priority list and the other was in relation to the withdrawing of the motion.  I will not withdraw the motion.  In relation to the priority list, any Deputy in this House can go into the Library, get general routine orders, see if an officer has been promoted and make his own mind up as to who is next for promotion on the basis of priority.  There is no question of getting information from somebody, notwithstanding the fact that information is obtainable from time to time.  Any Deputy in the House can do it.  I bring that to the attention of Deputy Malone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond has displayed complete ignorance of the whole set-up in relation to what he stated. There is complete confusion in relation to the people who made the statements, so I will not pursue this point any further.  First of all, the <Col N="1207" /> debate has produced very important statements from a number of speakers. I was very disappointed with the manner in which the Minister made his contribution to the debate.  In fact, he said nothing.  He did not give the assurance that was required to establish morale and he has left the position much as it was.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Official Report of 10th April, 1975, Volume 279, and to quote from my own speech:</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that throughout the service at the moment political appointments are taking place.  People should be appointed on their ability; irrespective of the colour of the shirt they wear, the best man must get the job.</P>
    <P>That was a quotation from the Defence Estimate debate.  I warned the Minister on that day that this was happening.  I went on to state:</P>
    <P>The point I want to get across is that even one promotion on a political basis out of line with normal procedure causes a reaction right through the forces.  We must have the best man for the job at all times.  Then there can be no crib, irrespective of the colour of the shirt or the hair a man has.  There is a belief that political appointments are taking place in certain sections of the Army.</P>
    <P>At that time there was disquiet throughout the forces that political appointments were taking place and I referred to the appointment of an FCA officer which was completely out of line and irresponsible.  I am not going to deal with the problem in general because it is referred to in the debates of 10th April, 15th May and 1st May.</P>

He indicated that the Chief of Staff made the appointment.  When I mentioned that the Chief of Staff was then responsible, the Minister said that he was not going to discuss the matter, that it was inconclusive.  It would be discussed with other appointments made in the FCA which had caused concern.</P>

      <P>I merely brought this to the Minister's attention but he is not going to use my time tonight.  I want now to deal with the illegal promotions which have taken place.  I want to tell the Minister that it was not a barrack-room lawyer who advised me.  I sought the best legal advice available and the person who advised me had even more experience than the Attorney General.  He advised me that I was right in my assumption.  I will quote for the Minister's benefit so that he can then go back to his legal advisers.  I respect the advice given to the Minister by the Attorney General but I would suggest that the Minister withdraw it and make the amendment under section 26, or the matter will be challenged at some expense to the State. Article 26 of the Defence Act states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may make regulations not inconsistent with this Act in relation to all or any of the matters mentioned in the Fourth Schedule of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the general regulations in relation to the Defence Forces.  Taking the Fourth Schedule first, which is the important one, in that it gives the Minister the powers, it is headed: &ldquo;Matters in respect of which regulations may be made under section 26&rdquo;. The Minister must bear this in mind. One of those is the appointment to, promotion in and tenure of commissioned rank in the Defence Forces and another is the appointment of <Col N="1209" /> officers.  Under the Fourth Schedule they are matters in respect of which regulations may be made under section 26.  When we come to section 45, the promotion of officers, it states:</P>
    <P>(1) The Minister may, in accordance with regulations made by him, promote any officer to a higher substantive rank.</P>
    <P>(2) The Minister may, in accordance with regulations made by him, promote any officer holding a substantive rank or an acting rank to a higher rank.</P>
    <P>So the Minister may, having amended the regulations under the appropriate section, section 26, make the appointment. The Minister did not do that. Therefore, I say the appointments&mdash; with the advice I have received&mdash;are illegal and the Minister will have to mend his hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to operate contrary to the Act he can do so but that is what the Act states in section 26 and section 45.  Section 45 distinctly states that the Minister &ldquo;may in accordance with the regulations made by him&rdquo;.  That means, in effect, that the regulations must be made by him before he can make an appointment.  I would advise that the Minister examine the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to waste any more time.  The matter can and will be challenged.  The Minister has given no indication to the members of the Defence Forces that he will change the situation.  He has left in doubt the future prospects of people serving in the Defence Forces.  It is now a career of chance rather than a career of occupation.  No one can plan for the future.  This will have a very serious effect on morale and on recruitment to the Military College and indeed to the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to indicate, in one of the newspapers, that two of the men promoted were of Fianna Fáil persuasion.  The Minister did not correct the situation.  I should like to ask him if he has made a survey of <Col N="1210" /> the political persuasions of all the officers.  How did he know that some of the officers appointed were Fianna Fáil supporters?  Has everyone been checked out?  What effect will this have on recruitment?  These are important questions which the Minister had the opportunity to answer but he declined to do so.  I should like to say to the Minister that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister will have another opportunity.  I would like to deal further with the so-called amended Defence Forces regulations, amended under section 45.  The Minister has taken upon himself the powers to appoint, irrespective of the recommendations of the Chief of Staff. The Minister now has the authority for the promotion of officers he thinks are suitable.  A few moments ago the Minister mentioned the question of the redress of wrongs.  If an officer feels aggrieved because he is not promoted when he should have been, he submits a redress of wrongs which goes to the Minister.  Will the Minister then examine the situation in relation to himself.  What type of decision will he give.  Will he say that he did what <Col N="1211" /> was right?  So the redress of wrongs is a farce in so far as officers are concerned and has no bearing whatsoever. It is stupid for the Minister to speak about the redress of wrongs.</P>

      <P>We heard Deputy Desmond speak stupidly about men joining trade unions.  One would like to know if a man joined a trade union in order to put forward his claim as suggested by Deputy Desmond, to whom would his loyalty be?  Would it be to the Government, the Army or the union?  We must know exactly to whom he would give his loyalty.</P>
      <P>Under the Defence Force Regulations a man had the opportunity to have wrongs redressed.  The Minister, aided and abetted by the Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave, and the other Ministers of this open Government where there is collective responsibility, is completely responsible for this situation which deprives a man of the opportunity of having any redress of wrongs at all unless he goes to Deputy Donegan, the Minister for Defence, who is the supreme commander of the forces, according to himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has taken on all these powers. As Deputy O'Kennedy stated yesterday, he spoke of his colonel, his men: one would think they were all personal to himself.  I should like to say something further: the Minister last night said it was ridiculous to suggest that men could not be promoted except by the establishment.  There are many men promoted who are serving with high ranks at the moment who are not on the establishment, who are outside the establishment.  In the Defence debate when I tackled the Minister he agreed that men serving the two years were outside the establishment and that officers can be so promoted.  The Minister knows well that men can be appointed in that position.  It is quite easy for the Minister if he wants to appoint a colonel or an officer personal to himself to do so.  He criticised the President last night for something less but <Col N="1212" /> the President has powers under the Defence Forces Act as well.</P>

      <P>The former President. All Presidents have powers under the Defence Forces Acts and, apparently, last night the Minister did not know he had powers.  I should just like to quote before I conclude:</P>
      <P>Appointment of Officers: The President may appoint any eligible person to be an officer in the Permanent Defence Forces or the Reserve Defence Forces in any commissioned rank.</P>
      <P>Apparently, the Minister did not know that.  I would refer him again to section 42.  As a matter of fact, I would refer him to the particular Act because he does not appear to know anything about it, having amended the regulation under the wrong section, appointed officers illegally because the amendment is not changed in accordance with the Act.  I have given him the information and I hope he will act upon it but if he does not act upon it, I would suggest a remedy now if he does not want to go back. That is to get out, to resign and let someone else restore the morale that has been shattered in the Army by the irresponsible action of the Minister, the Taoiseach and his colleagues. The quicker he gets out the sooner the morale will be restored and the sooner we will have a situation of normality; the sooner the country will, in a serious security situation such as this is, have an Army that can respect the people at the top, that can respect the Minister for Defence, because that is required.  I would say: Get out now and allow the Government to establish a situation where we have normality once again.</P>

      <P>We are informed that this motion was put down by the Government on Friday last.  We have the Parliamentary Secretary's word for that because, of course, for some reason none of us received a copy of the motion.  The normal procedure in this House is that, when a motion is put down by any Member, whether a member of the Government or a private Member, the motion is immediately printed, or typed, and circulated to Deputies at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I bow to your ruling, Sir, but I understand the procedure to which Deputy O'Malley refers does not apply as it does to ordinary procedural motions. I informed Deputy Lalor last Friday of the gist of the motion and told him then that it would not be circulated and would not appear in print until the Order Paper was circulated on Tuesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not suggested, Sir, that the motion is not in order. I am just saying that, notwithstanding the fact that it is a motion without precedent in the history of this House and runs to two full pages of the Order Paper and covers nine different measures, the great majority of Members did not become aware of its terms until yesterday morning when they got their Order Papers for yesterday. It is not a very satisfactory situation, particularly for any Member who wished to put down an amendment or amendments in respect of which he must give two days' notice under the Standing Orders.  Even allowing for these matters, it appears that Deputy Lalor was given some form of copy of this motion on Friday last.  On Tuesday in the Order Paper a somewhat altered form of motion appeared. In today's Order Paper yet another altered form of the motion appears. We have, therefore, before us this evening the third version of this unprecedented <Col N="1219" /> omnibus guillotine which, of course, included the extraordinary provision that four Bills which have not yet been published will be guillotined although no Member of the House has seen the contents of them.</P>
      <P>One would have thought that, after all that time, and the fact that three efforts were made to draft the motion, it might have been drafted properly, but we find in paragraph (5) of the motion a proviso at the end; &ldquo;provided that the provisions of Standing Order 123 relating to the postponement of divisions shall be applied to any division demanded&rdquo;.  Standing Order 123 relates to the question of Estimates and motions arising out of Estimates.  The Standing Order is perfectly clear in that respect.  It allows the postponement of votes on Estimates to 10.15 p.m. on that night if the House sits so long and, if not, on the next night on which the House sits until 10.15 p.m.</P>
      <P>There is no way in my view in which Standing Order 123 can be applied to two motions of the kind referred to in paragraph (5) of this motion, namely, the motion to approve the International Energy Agreement which is one about which there is a great deal of disagreement and controversy and potentially this Agreement could be very damaging to our interests.  I do not know what precisely the provisions of the Elections of Conservators (Postponement) Order, 1975, are, but whatever the provisions are, it clearly is not an Estimate or a motion connected with an Estimate.  Notwithstanding that an effort, and a rather crude effort, is made even in this third amended motion which is before us now to relate the provisions of Standing Order 123 to these two motions when clearly they have no relevance to it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, in addition, an effort made by the Government to confine the Second Stage debate on each of these five Bills, four of which we have never seen, to one hour and the debate on Committee and Remaining Stages to one hour.  There is no limit, as the House knows, on Second Stage <Col N="1220" /> speeches.  There is nothing to stop the Minister involved in each one of these five Bills making a speech lasting one hour&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will personally undertake that that will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not refuse the Parliamentary Secretary's undertaking but I do not think we should have to accept the undertaking of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not think that a matter such as this should be dealt with in this way and that the Parliamentary Secretary, even before the motion is passed at all, or fully debated, should have to undertake in this House personally that the terms of this motion will not be complied with.  If the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government have no intention of ensuring that the House complies with these terms, why put them down here?  Why move them? Why force the House to pass them if they are not going to use them in the way it is open to the House to use them?  I do not think it is good enough that things of this nature should be forced on the House and then the Parliamentary Secretary says: &ldquo;I undertake that we will not use them&rdquo;.  I strongly suggest that we should not have to pass this kind of thing and the four Bills which, for all we know can be of very considerable importance, will be shoved through in this way, possibly without more than a few minutes contribution from this side of the House, without more than a few minutes dissent to something which may be very serious indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch and Deputy Lalor referred earlier to some of the likely or possible provisions of some of these Bills.  I would like to refer only to one which impinges on the Department of Industry and Commerce, at least I assume it does, that is, the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill which is mentioned here.  This Bill presumably will be to raise the capital of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta and possibly to extend its objects and matters like that.  One of the most important projects which Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta propose to undertake in the <Col N="1221" /> next year or two is the use of natural gas which has now been discovered off Kinsale, in County Cork, the use by Nítrigin Éireann in a new factory which they are about to build in Cork of that natural gas, for the purpose of making a form of fertiliser which is very conveniently and very cheaply made from natural gas.</P>
    <P>This proposal brings up the whole question of the utilisation of natural gas.  It is something that we have not been able to debate in this House even though we know there is, by Irish standards, a very substantial find of natural gas off Kinsale and, by European or world standards at least a moderate one, with a capacity, it appears at the moment, of about 100,000 cubic feet per day in the particular well.  We understand also, from what we have been told, that only about 15 per cent of this gas can be used by Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta in this proposed new factory and that about 70 per cent of the gas, the balance that is used neither by Nítrigin Éireann nor in the Cork town gas system, will be given to the ESB for conversion into electricity.  The conversion ratio of gas into electricity is 32 per cent.  In other words there is a waste factor of 68 per cent of that gas.  I would have thought that a Bill which deals with this very point is extremely important for this country and calls for a very full and a very thorough debate.  How we can have that in one hour on the Second Stage and one hour on all the other Stages is beyond me.</P>
    <P>It may well be that, in addition to these matters which have to be in the Bill or at least relevant to the Bill, there may well be a whole lot of other matters which can be very serious indeed.  The same remarks apply to all the other Bills.  The whole question of turf development at this time has taken on a very grave new urgency and importance.  The turf industry a couple of years ago might be regarded as one that possibly had no great future because oil was comparatively cheap and it was the fuel everyone was anxious to use.  The situation is totally different today. The whole question of the turf industry is now one of major importance. <Col N="1222" /> There is a Bill being passed which, no doubt, has important provisions in relation to that industry but that Bill has to go through this House in one hour on the Second Stage and one hour for all the other Stages.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Lalor to the remarks of various members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties in this House in particular on 4th of August, 1971.  It is no harm to remember that at that time a guillotine motion was moved in relation to the small remaining part of the Report Stage of the Prohibition of Forcible Entry Bill, 1970, which had already been before the House for four or five months at that time.  The Report Stage had already occupied about 50 hours at the time the guillotine was proposed by the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Andrews.  What it was proposed, in fact, to guillotine was the remainder of the Report Stage, a couple of amendments that were left at the time, and the Fifth Stage.  That was moved early on 4th August, 1971. There were approximately six or more hours left at the time, if that motion was accepted, to debate the remainder of the Report Stage and the Fifth Stage.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the amount of time that was left on that occasion for the debating of the remainder of Report Stage, which had already occupied about 50 hours, and for the Final Stage of a Bill that had been before the House for several months, by that guillotine was longer than the total time that has been allowed by this motion for the entire debate on all Stages of all of four Bills that we have never seen.  Any attempt, therefore, by anybody on that side of the House to make any comparison between the actions of the guillotine in those circumstances on 4th August, 1971, and the brazen effort to wipe out the elected Parliament of this country that is contained in this motion, is a dishonest one, and those who attempt to make it well know that it is dishonest.</P>

      <P>Among the numberous things that were said on 4th August, 1971&mdash;Deputy Lalor has already quoted several of them and I do not propose to repeat them&mdash;there is one other one that struck me.  The reference is Volume 255 of the Dáil Official Report and this one is again for Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> at column 3527.  He said:</P>
      <P>Any Deputy who cherishes Parliamentary democracy must be deeply concerned by the introduction of the guillotine at any time and on any measure, but we are particularly concerned about it when we find it being applied to a highly controversial piece of legislation like the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill, 1970.  Rarely has a more controversial piece of legislation come before this House.</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Higgins: Hear, hear.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, as he then was, was very strongly of the opinion that any Deputy who cherishes Parliamentary democracy must be equally concerned about the introduction of the guillotine at any time and on any measure.  His views are ones that are not to be disregarded and not to be lightly passed over, because he is now Chief Justice of this country.  He now presides over the Supreme Court at a salary of about £13,800 and something per annum.</P>

It is very much to the same effect as the speech which Deputy Lalor and I quoted of the present Minister for Lands.  In those circumstances and in view of your ruling, it is presumably not necessary to refer to it other than to say that I think the Chief Justice's views are well known on the use of the guillotine, and that guillotine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The guillotine that was used on 4th August, 1971, was used in circumstances which were totally different from those that are in use here tonight.  I would invite the Parliamentary Secretary, if he proposes to reply to this debate, or whoever else proposes to reply, to give any precedent either in this country or in any western genuine parliamentary democracy, of the use of a guillotine by any government in respect of four Bills which were not even published, and force the passage of four Bills in a ridiculously short period of time when no Member of the House knows, even in an approximate way, what is contained in those Bills.  We have had accusations by the Parliamentary Secretary in his speech moving this <Col N="1225" /> motion of deliberate time-wasting on these capital taxation Bills.</P>
      <P>I would invite the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, or anyone else who is interested, to look at the number of amendments which were not just put down on the Committee Stage and on the Report Stage of the Capital Gains Tax Bill&mdash;that is the only one which has been finished&mdash; but at the number of amendments which were actually made.  I have not had the opportunity to add up the whole lot but it certainly runs into several dozens.  There were 20 to 25, perhaps more, amendments made by the Minister, mostly at the suggestion of Deputy Colley and other Deputies at this side of the House, and there were about 20 amendments made on the Report Stage of that Bill.  Those amendments were clearly necessary. The Minister agrees they were necessary because he would not have allowed them to be made if he did not.</P>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that a Bill which requires perhaps 40, 50 or more amendments, should not have been discussed at great length?  Is he not already aware that there is a huge number of amendments down to the Wealth Tax Bill, even though it is a much shorter Bill, that many of these are in the name of the Minister for Finance and, presumably, even by the Government's own standards, are necessary?</P>
      <P>I have the sheet that was issued today and it runs to six full pages but it only starts at section 6 because the amendments which had been dealt with before now, which perhaps amounted to 20 or more, do not appear on this sheet.  Is he suggesting that a Bill which needs such enormous amounts of amendments as these two Bills, do not need through and full debate?  I can recall the Minister for Finance saying that even though the debate on the Committee Stage of the Capital Gains Tax Bill was very long and tiresome, he thought it was useful and beneficial and that the Bill would be greatly improved by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three Bills we have been discussing here, one of which is included <Col N="1226" /> in this motion, are by far the biggest changes which have been made in capital taxation since 1894, 81 years ago.  A fundamental change is being made now.  Whether it is for the better or for the worse is not a relevant matter.  The fact is that it is a totally fundamental change.  A lot of the old concepts are going and a lot of new methods are being used which are completely foreign to our methods of dealing with various matters up to now.  It is being done in three Bills, all of which are very necessary.  It is essential that all these Bills be discussed in a reasonable and rational way, that a full and thorough discussion, such as has gone on, should take place.  The fact that 50 or more amendments were made to the Capital Gains Tax Bill is the greatest possible proof of that.</P>
    <P>We have another Bill here which is just as important and it is proposed in this guillotine to put a stop to further discussion except for short periods at the discretion of the Government. One can make statements about democracy being damaged and so on.  The Government will try to get people to laugh at these statements and say they are exaggerated and that they are foolish and untrue.  I would invite those serious great ex-liberals whom we now have on the Front Bench of the Government for the time being to change their position for a while, to try to think, if they have any objectivity left, what their reaction would be if a Fianna Fáil Government were to guillotine at one stroke, nine measures four of which had not yet been published.  I repeat my invitation to the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister for Finance or whoever else wants to do it to quote for me precedents of four Bills or any substantial number of Bills that have never been published being guillotined through any Parliament other than one in some communist country or some protalitarian regime.</P>

I would have no confidence whatever that any one of the ex-liberals who now sit on that side of the House, the people whose hearts bled for every cause up to two-and-a-half years ago, will do the honourable thing and what they know they should do and put a stop to this outrageous motion that is down here.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Kelly, if it should happen in perhaps 20 or 30 years' time some learned lawyer in this country will write a book the title of which will be &ldquo;Fundamental Rights and Freedoms under the Irish Constitution&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are ways of abusing the Constitution without being seen to go outside the law.  It may be or it may not be that the Government and the Parliamentary <Col N="1228" /> Secretary think they are keeping themselves within the law and the Constitution and the respect for people's rights with this motion but, I can assure them of this and so can anybody else who has read this and has pondered on the consequences of it, that this is flying in the face of every right and every freedom that is protected by the Constitution and that is cherished by the people.</P>

      <P>And even today they have expressed privately their delight that at long last they can arrange their holidays.  I was very interested that one of our national journals within the last few days said, very aptly I thought, that it is a serious thing to question the fitness of a political party to govern but still more serious is it when the nation has to call into question, as it does today, the fitness of the Fianna Fáil Party to oppose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made the point about the possibility of somebody in 20 years' time referring to this motion in a book to be called &ldquo;Fundamental Rights and Freedoms under the Irish Constitution&rdquo;.  I would expect any commentator writing in 20 years' time, or now, on fundamental rights and freedoms including parliamentary rights and freedoms to have regard also to the corresponding duties and <Col N="1229" /> obligations which go with those rights and freedoms.  Any objective commentator endeavouring to assess whether the Opposition had discharged their duties and obligations would form the view that they had not.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was quite right in saying that the parliamentary system can work only if there is reasonable co-operation.  That has not been forthcoming.  It is some four months since the Opposition were approached and asked to agree on a time programme for, among other items of legislation, the ones for which I have principal responsibility, the three Bills dealing with capital taxation.  On each occasion that an approach was made, agreement was refused.  The reason it was refused was that the Fianna Fáil front bench came to the decision months ago to obstruct the passage of this legislation and to force the Government to bring in a guillotine motion.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note now the principal disappointment is that the Government did not bring it in earlier.  The Government have given them fair notice that they can use the next three weeks to better advantage if they are serious about discussing the legislation before them. They can use it better than they used a lot of the time in the past.</P>
      <P>As a parliamentarian in this House for some 16 years and having some pride in the traditions, records and achievements of this House, I pay tribute to the way in which the House has improved the Capital Gains Tax Bill and is improving the Wealth Tax Bill but I am convinced that the debate on both Bills could have been a lot better and a great deal more relevant and that many of the contributions might have been improved if they had been more pertinent and had had less emotion and less irrelevancies, if they had been directed to the specific amendments before the House and the specific sections on which they were supposed to be speaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am applying this criticism to every person who deserves it and that, on occasions when I was provoked, includes myself.  But it points again to the reasonableness of our suggestion which some Deputies opposite agreed with&mdash;they were not allowed by their party to put into effect&mdash;and that is our suggestion that these Bills, which are mainly very technical Bills, whatever may be their broad effect, which were discussed on the Second Stage and on Fifth Stage, but which are primarily technical Bills for discussion and analysis by technocrats and experts on the Committee and Report Stages, should have gone to special committees of this House.  I believe the best moments of the debate on the Capital Gains Tax Bill and on the Wealth Tax Bill have been when a small number in this House have behaved as though they were at a Select Committee, where they have respected one another as legislators and as adults and have got down to the merits or demerits of specific proposals and of the wording of particular sections and amendments.</P>
      <P>That is a very difficult task to perform in this arena or forum of the Dáil, the very structure of which is such as to set people, as it were, against one another in a less-thancreative way.  Of course the work of committees is not dramatic&mdash;the less dramatic it is the more effective it is; the less emotion you have in it, the more precision you will have in it; the less politics you have in it, the better will be the end result in the legislation.  I would respectfully suggest, seeing that there are two of the principal gladiators of the Capital Taxation Bills present, we have ample time left under this Government motion tonight for an adult and effective debate on the Wealth Tax Bill which will enable us to complete the Bill in good time, both in its Committee Stage and its Report Stage before the House goes into recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large number of amendments to the Capital Taxation Bills are as a result of discussions which we had on <Col N="1231" /> the Second Stage.  A number of amendments from both sides of the House deal with the same topics; simply expressing the same thoughts in different words.  A very large number of the amendments are procedural; several of them are already agreed and their number should not be interpreted in the mischievous way in which Deputy O'Malley interpreted it, as an indication either of the complexity of the Bill or of the fundamental issues of the Bill not being accepted.</P>
    <P>Let us get rid of the histrionics; let us act like adults; let us observe what the commentators are saying about us.  They have been saying, and I think very honestly saying, that there has been a great deal of time wasted in this House this year which has sat in 1975 to date for more days than the average number of sitting days for a full year for very many years past.  Deputies who have been accepting the burden of work thrown upon them know that that is true.  That being so, I think the time has surely come when we should accept that we would be better legislators if we accepted some discipline of time, some discipline on our contributions, made them direct and relevant to the business before us.  If we did that there would be ample time left in this session for the completion of all the business before us.</P>
    <P>The Government had a choice, either to give the three weeks' notice which is being given by this resolution or else to leave it to the last week and to bring the shutters down with a clang when Deputies would not have been put on notice.  The Opposition knew for months past that this was going to come unless they gave more co-operation than they have given.</P>

Never has the House been given such reasonable long term notice of the legislative programme ahead of it. There are three weeks to come and I suggest to the Opposition, if they wish to discuss other measures which are before the House this session, that the sooner we conclude the debate on this motion and take a vote on it the more time we will have to discuss the other important issues which the Irish people expect us to decide before we go into recess.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at the outset to deal with the last point the Minister made.  May I suggest to him that not even he could hope to persuade the Irish people that the Bills proposed to be guillotined through here are vital, fundamental matters, having regard to the state of our economy. There are very important matters in them but there is nothing coming through, if this guillotine proposal is carried and the business that is proposed to be got through in that time is got through, there is nothing emerging in all that that is going to cure our fundamental ills, and even the Minister for Finance could not hope to persuade people that there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned at the fact, which was evidenced from some of the remarks from the other side of the House and in particular from some remarks by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, that on the Government side this question of the guillotine is regarded as a kind of a game.  When Deputies on this side quoted some statements made by, for instance, the present Minister for <Col N="1233" /> Lands in 1970 or 1971 on a guillotine motion, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach indicated by his remarks that when the present Minister for Lands said that he did not really mean it, and no more, he contended, did we mean what we were saying.  I regard that as disturbing because this is not a game.  The remarks quoted were to the effect that the use of the guillotine in parliamentary procedure should be a very rare matter, a remark to which I would subscribe fully.  Having said that, I freely admit that there are occasions when a Government must bring in a guillotine.  It should be very rare and it should be done only with the greatest reluctance and when there is no other course open but there are occasions when it should be done.  I suggest that this is not one of them.  The occasion when it has to be done is when there is a matter before the House which is of vital importance, the passage of which is of major importance to the well-being of the people and when it is clearly being obstructed.  That is the only occasion on which it is justified.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions here by Deputy Barry Desmond that the only thing involved in this is the Wealth Tax Bill.  Of course if he looked at the motion he would see that that is not true.  Let us take the Wealth Tax Bill since it is the major one picked out as the cause of this guillotine.  I would suggest that the best way to judge whether a political party believes what it is saying is by what it does.  As evidence of the fact that we believe what we have been saying in this regard there is the record of this party in government and the very few and rare occasions on which they used the guillotine. Compare that with the record of the present Government in their relatively short time in office and their use of the guillotine.  Compare that with the purposes for which they propose to use the guillotine now.  As I say, the major reason put forward and the only reason, by Deputy Barry Desmond and others, is the wealth tax.</P>
    <P>As distinct from what may be said on either side of the House, what do the facts and the official record <Col N="1234" /> show?  They show that the Government introduced three measures of capital taxation and some consequential sections in the Finance Bill. They show, in relation to the wealth tax, that the Government announced details of their proposals in a White Paper published on 28th February, 1974.  They also show that the Wealth Tax Bill was circulated a year later, a year late.  Now, five months after its circulation the Government are trying to guillotine it through this House.  They took a year to produce the legislation but in the five months which have since elapsed we have dealt with all Stages of the Capital Gains Tax Bill, the Second Stage of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill and all Stages of the Finance Bill, which contain relevant provisions and, of course, a lot of other business.  Nevertheless, the Government now feel justified in guillotining this Bill through after five months from the date of its circulation.</P>
    <P>The Official Record also shows&mdash; this is the best part&mdash;that in the discussion on the Capital Gains Tax Bill, which was the first of the package, which went through last night, there was a long, detailed discussion on its provisions and on many occasions a tedious discussion.  Here I might be permitted to enter a personal note. As one who has been largely involved very much in the debate on these measures, I make no secret of the fact that it is no pleasure to have to come in 12 hours a day, day after day and debate these measures and do the home work that is necessary on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking purely from a personal point of view, it would suit me very well if the Government guillotined the Wealth Tax Bill through tonight.  I could go home and relax if that happened.  But there is more involved than the personal feelings of Deputies, be they Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries or anything else.  The official record shows that that detailed, and sometimes tedious, discussion on the Capital <Col N="1235" /> Gains Tax Bill produced a Bill which has many defects but which is far superior to the Bill which was originally brought in here.</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out, numerous amendments were made to that Bill. Most of them, particularly on the Report Stage, were amendments suggested from this side of the House. There is one particular part of the Capital Gains Tax Bill which I think illustrates precisely the point I wish to make.  The argument in regard to the Wealth Tax Bill is that it can be shoved through and that the Government are allowing enough time for it. The Government's view, no doubt, was that far too much time was taken on the Capital Gains Tax Bill.</P>
      <P>I invite anyone who is interested to have a look at paragraph 11 of what is now the Fourth Schedule of the Capital Gains Tax Bill&mdash;it was the Fifth.  It will be found that as that Bill was introduced paragraph 11, which is a long and detailed paragraph, was in a certain form.  As a result of criticism of its provisions on the Second Stage the Minister fundamentally amended it on Committee Stage, but the amendments he made were quite unworkable and unsuitable. When this was pointed out to him he then brought in another amendment on Report Stage which completely deleted the paragraph and introduced a totally new one.  When we examined that on Report Stage yesterday, although it contained a number of improvements, it also contained some things which were very defective but one quite impossible provision, the effect of which was to deprive people in certain circumstances of their legal right to recover money due to them. We debated that point at some length across the floor of the House and yesterday, in the course of the Report Stage, that amended version was amended again twice.  I do not say it is perfect but it is now a workable, tolerable paragraph, which it was not as introduced, as amended on Committee Stage or as amended by the Minister on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention this point specifically because it is a clear example of the <Col N="1236" /> benefit to be derived by this long, tedious, unglamorous work which goes on in this House and has gone on on that Bill.  I suggest to the House that if the Wealth Tax Bill is subjected to the same tedious&mdash;I stress that word because from my point of view it is very tedious and I am sure it is from most people's point of view &mdash;process, that lengthy process, there is no doubt that, despite the fundamental error, in our view, of introducing a wealth tax at this time, at least the Bill will come out a far better piece of legislation than it has come into the House.  The official record of what happened on the Capital Gains Tax Bill is sufficient evidence for that.  Yet the Parliamentary Secretary, on behalf of the Government, is telling us that he is able to judge how much time is needed to complete the Wealth Tax Bill.  I could not judge that.  I suggest the Minister for Finance could not judge it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on how the debate goes, on the points that are uncovered and how they are dealt with.  Anybody who pays any attention to what has happened on the Capital Gains Tax Bill will verify the truth of what I am saying.  One cannot escape the conclusion that what the Government propose to do is to ram the Wealth Tax Bill through, no matter what defects it contains.  Of course, it contains enormous defects as did the Capital Gains Tax Bill.</P>
      <P>That brings us to the question of the long delay in producing these Bills and even after that long delay, the tremendous defects which have appeared in these Bills.  Many of these defects have been remedied&mdash; not all of them by any means&mdash;in the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  There are many in the Wealth Tax Bill.  I am absolutely certain that if this motion is carried many of those defects will remain in the Wealth Tax Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and other speakers on the other side of the House referred to the fact that he sought agreement on the package of these Bills but did not get it from Fianna Fáil.  That is true.  I venture <Col N="1237" /> to suggest that the agreement which the Parliamentary Secretary got in regard to the conclusion of the Capital Gains Tax Bill, and to which he referred, and how it operated shows why we were quite right not to offer any agreement in relation to the Wealth Tax Bill, or the earlier Stages of the Capital Gains Tax Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary knows that what happened&mdash;not I admit all the time after the agreement was made but for a good deal of time after the agreement was made when there was a definite closing time for the debate&mdash;was that the Minister for Finance, on a number of occasions, simply ignored the arguments put forward and did not bother to reply to them.  Whether he was going to accept them or not, at least we feel entitled to get a reply to the arguments put forward, and we did not get it, until, eventually, I was obliged to protest in the House at what the Minister was doing or failing to do, and obliged to warn him that in future he should not directly or through his Whip, seek an agreement with us in relation to legislation he was putting through this House because he was abusing that agreement.</P>
    <P>Then, last night, again, we had a further abuse of that agreement by the Minister.  There were 15 minutes available for the Final Stage and the Minister for Finance, in the words of Deputy Desmond, hogged those 15 minutes, to prevent us having any say whatever on that Final Stage.  The lesson is quite clear: if there is an agreement by us, it will be abused by the Minister for Finance.  That is what the record shows.  We may assume that, if this motion is carried and there is a definite time limit fixed, the Minister for Finance will treat us in the same way.  He may do so, and he may think that it is to his advantage, but I want to assure the Government and the Minister that it will not be to his advantage in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The Wealth Tax Bill is a very important measure and to rush it through this House without adequate debate, such as the Capital Gains Tax Bill got, is doing a disservice to the <Col N="1238" /> people.  I have already referred to the fact that the Government delayed enormously in bringing forward these Bills.  Now they are trying to take out that delay on us by rushing it through and preventing us giving adequate discussion to it.  We are entitled to ask why must the Government have the Wealth Tax Bill by the end of this month.  What is the compelling reason that prevents the Government allotting sufficient time to enable it to be properly discussed as the Capital Gains Tax Bill was?  We are entitled to ask that and we have not been given any reason for it.</P>
    <P>We are also entitled to ask why is it that the Government does not care about getting the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill through before the summer recess.  It is not included here and it has been made clear that it is not proposed to bring it forward for Committee Stage before the summer recess. That is of some significance because the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill is the major Bill, replacing receipts for death duties.  It is the one that is of most importance to the Exchequer, but the Government do not care about that one.  They want to get the Capital Gains Tax Bill and the Wealth Tax Bill through.  The estimated receipts from both of these together do not go anywhere near the estimated receipts from the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill and yet the Government do not care about the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.</P>
    <P>I think we are entitled to ask for the Government's version of why this is so and why this should be done. We have our own theories as to why this should be so, but perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would do us the honour of explaining the Government's great rush to get the two minor Bills, in terms of revenue, through and to forget, for the moment, about the major Bill in terms of revenue at a time when the Government certainly need all the revenue they can get.</P>
    <P>I suppose we should not be too surprised by the Government's efforts to sweep this under the carpet.  They have never been very happy about having their capital taxation proposals objectively <Col N="1239" /> assessed and the other side of the argument, apart from the propaganda we have got from the Government side, put forward, so that people could begin to see the reality of what was proposed to be done as distinct from the propaganda measure about abolishing death duties&mdash; which were not abolished, and about the great relief for a whole lot of people who have been subject to death duties.  The small print, of course, of these measures gives quite a different picture and it is understandable that the Government do not want this to be highlighted.  Nevertheless, it is something that has to be done.</P>
    <P>It is a duty which rests on any responsible Opposition to go into the small print, to draw attention to the effects of what is proposed and to try to have the defects in the Bills remedied.  That is precisely what we have been doing; that is precisely what we propose to continue to do.  If the Government do not like that, then the responsibility for that is on the head of the Government, not the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Let me also point out, since a point has been made on the other side about the length of time we have spent on these Bills, that there is a very good reason for that, because now we have an Opposition which is doing its job.  The fact is that when the people over there were on these benches they did not do their homework. There is a lot of hard work to be done, whether you are in opposition or in government, and whatever about the work they are doing at the moment, whether it is hard or easy&mdash;I am not commenting on the effectiveness or the ineffectiveness of it&mdash;it is incontrovertible that most members of what were the Fine Gael and Labour Party front benches on this side of the House did not do their homework and were not prepared to embark on the kind of hard, slogging, unglamorous work that we have been prepared to do.  If, as a result of the Opposition doing their job, longer time is spent in debating Bills than in the past, that is to the credit of the Opposition and the discredit <Col N="1240" /> of the Government, and not the other way around.</P>

      <P>The record speaks for itself as to the work done by this Opposition in relation to this type of legislation, the value of that work and the paucity of similar work done when the present Government parties were in opposition.  The record shows what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been dealing so far with the wealth tax element in this motion, but of course, there is a great deal more to it, and I must say that I find it incredible that any party purporting to be concerned with democracy would come into this House and propose to guillotine through four Bills which have not yet been published, which we have not seen.  If one stands back for a moment and looks at that proposition, how can one reconcile with democracy a proposal to guillotine through Bills that have not yet been published?  It is an incredible proposal and yet, we have seen pseudo-liberals over there supporting it.  They are a bit uncomfortable about it and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when tackled about it tried to get out <Col N="1241" /> of it by saying that the Parliamentary Secretary had indicated that if necessary time could be stretched a bit if there was some difficulty.  That is not good enough.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise what he is proposing?  A guillotine on Bills that have not been circulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy give way so that I can explain?  The Government is not afraid of debating these matters.  The trouble was that if we put in the Wealth Tax Bill alone and did not take account of these other items, which are essential, there was nothing to prevent them being talked out so as therefore to wreck any programme we had for the Wealth Tax Bill.  Therefore any bit of business which needed to be done by the end of July had to be taken account of in the motion.  That is the only reason.  There is nothing more sinister in it than that.  If I could have a guarantee that that would not be done, a guarantee I could rely on, these items would not have figured in that motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that these items do appear in the motion and the Parliamentary Secretary has to accept responsibility for that.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a motion in his name purporting to guillotine through this House four Bills which have not been circulated.  He can give any explanation he likes but that is the fact, that is what he is proposing to do. Then the question immediately arises that if these Bills and the Estimate, and so on, are essential why then does the Parliamentary Secretary think that the Wealth Tax Bill is essential?  He said because one is essential the Opposition might keep talking on the wealth tax and he would not get the other, what he calls essential, business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Whichever one it is, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would explain why in that case the Wealth Tax Bill is essential in the <Col N="1242" /> sense that I understand him to mean the others are essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that what we are asked to do is something which has never been done in this House and, as Deputy O'Malley said, I cannot say this with certainly but with a great deal of confidence I say that I do not believe that there is any democratic parliament in the world which has ever had a guillotine motion in respect of Bills which had not been published.  It is an incredible proposition.  If the Parliamentary Secretary could stand back from that proposition for a moment and look at it he would agree and he would amend this motion.  There can be no justification or excuse for such a proposition.</P>
      <P>I do not want to dwell unduly long on this but I would like to invite Deputies to consider the implications of this and the extensions of this.  If you can guillotine through a Bill that has not been published what is the next step on the road?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is frightening.  The implications of that proposal to me are frightening.  I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary, with whom I have had a number of disagreements but for whom I have respect in regard to his regard for Parliament and constitutional procedure, must have an uneasy feeling in the back of his mind about the proposal.  If he has not I would be very disappointed in him.  It is a proposition which should never have been put to this House.  It is going to create a very dangerous precedent. However, it is before us.  We want to record our total opposition to it, our detestation of such a proposal and our concern at the precedent which is being created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that these matters are being <Col N="1243" /> put in because they are urgent.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary recall some months ago the Minister for Justice introducing a Bill in this House&mdash;the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill&mdash;and assuring the House that it was urgent?  If it was urgent why is the Parliamentary Secretary not making provision in this for the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but if the Parliamentary Secretary is suggesting that it cannot be got through the Seanad before 30th July, which is the date dealt with here, I would not accept that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is that urgent why not have it guillotined in the Seanad and bring it in and guillotine it through here?  The implications of this are very serious.  Any Government in future will find itself with a precedent for bringing in the most controversial legislation and guillotining it through and telescoping all Stages together.  If <Col N="1244" /> this motion passes tonight there is a precedent for that and the Parliamentary Secretary, whose name will be to that motion, will not be proud in the longer term that his name is to this motion tonight.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary's idea is, and it appears to be, not just tonight but from his previous performance, that he gets agreement from the Opposition, that means we agree to precisely what he wants otherwise we are un co-operative and we get a guillotine motion.  That is how it works.  As far as we are concerned that is not the way it is going to work and if this Government want to guillotine business through in this way they can take the responsibility for it.  We are not accepting any responsibility for what is being done here this evening.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows that at no time on this side of the House did we ask for a summer adjournment. At no time did we say that we were not prepared to sit on to complete the business.  On the contrary he was told that we were prepared to sit on.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary indicated that he considered this whole matter was a game and that when you were in Opposition you said this kind of thing and opposed it and when you were in Government you said the other.  I do not regard this as a game.  I think it is an extremely serious business with grave implications.

He and the Government decided they must get the Wealth Tax Bill through.  They decided they must adjourn at the end of July.  They are the Government's decisions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice in this motion also that the Parliamentary Secretary appears to have built into it a provision whereby approximately ten hours of debate will be devoted to dealing with Estimates and motions which will not be voted on when they conclude. If a vote is sought it will take place only on a Tuesday or Wednesday at 10.15 p.m.  I think I am interpreting it correctly in that way.  The point I am making is that this great determination on the benches over there to get this urgent business through, to sit long hours, does not extend to being present to vote on these things, say, on a Friday.  That is the meaning of that provision.</P>

Incidentally, the Parliamentary Secretary will recall that he suggested we might sit on Tuesday of this week before three o'clock because he thought we would have enough time in the rest of the day to complete the Capital Gains Tax Bill.

      <P>One second&mdash;under Standing Orders, without any consultation with the Opposition the House would normally have sat at three <Col N="1247" /> o'clock.  The inquiry I made of Deputy Lalor was whether, in view of the fact that of the 41 amendments to the Capital Gains Tax Bill we had succeeded in disposing of 34 in two sitting days the Opposition required this unusually long day.  I did not propose to order a shorter day if the Opposition felt that that was going to be in breach of the spirit of what we had agreed.  Deputy Lalor said it would be in breach of the spirit and that was the end of it.</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting for a moment that the Parliamentary Secretary was either trying to breach the agreement made or trying in any way to curtail the debate, as agreed, on the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  What I am suggesting is that he felt that, if the sitting from three o'clock on would be sufficient in our view to complete the Capital Gains Tax Bill, the Dáil should not sit until three o'clock.  The point I am at is with all this urgency and guillotining, why give up half a day that was available?  He was telling us about hours lost here and there in his speech.  Why throw that time away? Why not use it?</P>

      <P>I am simply pointing out the inconsistency of the approach of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government in providing a guillotine for this alleged urgent and essential business when they contemplated throwing away a valuable half-day this week which could have been devoted to some of this business.  That is all I am pointing out.  As for the inconvenience to Deputies, of course I am aware of that, but I also pointed out earlier that, on a personal basis, all of this business is of great personal inconvenience to me and it is no joy to me to have the Wealth Tax Bill stretching on into August and September. As I said earlier, from a purely personal point of view I would be very happy if the Wealth Tax Bill were guillotined through tonight, but we do require to have regard to more than our personal convenience in this House.  I suggest that our public duty requires a great deal other than what is proposed in this motion.</P>

    <P>I would also point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that he was asked repeatedly, on at least two occasions and maybe three, to give the reason why the Finance Bill No. 2 had to be passed before the summer recess and, to the best of my knowledge, he has not yet given it.  He certainly did not give it in his speech today.  We are told that these unknown, unpublished Bills which it is proposed to guillotine through in the way I referred to earlier are simple non-controversial Bills.  I wonder does the Parliamentary Secretary recall that description being <Col N="1249" /> given not so long ago to the Traffic Wardens Bill.</P>

      <P>I am speaking in connection with the proceedings of this House; the record of the proceedings of this House in relation to the Capital Gains Tax Bill shows the value of the work that was being done and could be done on the Wealth Tax Bill.  I am not going to pursue that. I simply want to say that the Parliamentary Secretary says this is an historic moment because it is an innovation in the approach to the procedure of this House.  It is an historic moment all right.  I want to tell him, if this is the beginning of a procedure which the Government propose to follow in future, it could be the beginning of the end of democracy here. To guillotine through measures which have not yet been published is, as I said earlier, an incredible proposition as far as I am concerned, but it is made ominous now when the Parliamentary <Col N="1250" /> Secretary tells us it is just the beginning; this is the way it is intended to do the business in the future.</P>

      <P>No. I appeal to the Opposition to give this thing a chance to see how it works and, if it works, we may get an agreement in the future to allocate time in lots of three or four weeks at a go.  There has to be flexibility.  I completely agree that, if some snag appears in one of these four or five small Bills, we will have to look at the situation again.  I completely agree about that.  I ask the Deputy to put himself in the position of a Government with a very, very heavy legislative programme and in the position of a Government which is expected, because of the conventions of this House, to put up with endless free-wheeling on the part of the Opposition.  I have done it myself on our side when I had to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>The fact is that, whatever the reasoning, whatever seemed to the Parliamentary Secretary to make it plausible to propose to this House that we should guillotine four Bills we have not seen, this is one of the most dangerous and disgraceful proposals ever put to this House.  It makes me wonder if a good point was not made by those who observed at a Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, not so very long ago, the group who were raising their arms and shouting &ldquo;Up the Blue Shirts&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a few words to those already expressed <Col N="1251" /> by my colleagues in relation to this unprecedented procedure we are witnessing here this evening.  I want to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that I had occasion, as Chief Whip to the Government, to arrange the Adjournment Debate and to arrange the package of legislation to be taken before the adjournment of the House. On many occasions I sat down with the late Deputy Sweetman and we went through the Order Paper and decided what we could leave over and what we would take.  I can assure the House &mdash;and it is not necessary to give an assurance because the record will show it&mdash;that not for one moment did we ever contemplate putting into a package something that was not yet introduced in the House.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has made the astonishing statement that he is trying out an innovation on procedure, as he says, to prevent free-wheeling. A former Deputy, Deputy Dillon, used to wax eloquent on the importance of democracy and its preservation. He said that every Deputy has a right to speak on everything brought before the House.  That is what he is sent here for by his constituents. This is depriving every Deputy of the opportunity of discussing important legislation.  Nobody can defend the action being taken.  I remember at a council meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, one of the principal items for discussion was the power of Parliament over Government.  There are many instances where Parliament does not meet frequently and the Government proceed to do the work. The council were unanimous that this is a definite step in the wrong direction, a step towards the destruction of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember early one July, Deputies making a very strong attack on the Government&mdash;I was a Parliamentary Secretary at the time&mdash;for having too much business on the Order Paper before the recess which was then fixed for early August.  That was the year when the Dáil had to be recalled to deal with legislation in connection with the power strike in the ESB.  The speeches from this side <Col N="1252" /> of the House were convincing. Nobody could deny they had sincerity. The only thing we found wrong about them was that they were talking about something that was not going to happen.  There was no intention of preventing debate on any of the legislation on the Order Paper. There was no intention of unduly curtailing any debate, and any proposed legislation listed on the Order Paper was postponed until after the recess. We took what we agreed to take and brought it before the House by arrangement.  It was not easy to arrange.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary's difficult task.</P>
    <P>Why, at this time, is this device being used?  Not only are we establishing a precedent here but we are creating a new device to circumvent Parliament. The Parliamentary Secretary says it is an innovation, and he is going to try it out to see does it work.  Deputies from the different constituencies are expected by the people who send them here to show reason why they have come here. Their primary duty is to discuss legislation, and their constituents have to see that they do that.  They have to be seen to be doing it.  This is depriving them of that opportunity.  We, as an Opposition, can do nothing about it.  It will be steam-rolled through the House.  If we did not protest in the strongest possible terms against the action being taken here, the people who sent us here would think that we were a very poor outfit indeed.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat all the examples given of how the then Opposition behaved whenever an attempt was made to curtail in the slightest way any debate during our time in Government, nor will I instance all the occasions when there was free-wheeling by the then Opposition, in relation to important matters.  Reference was made to the Prohibition of Forcible Entry Bill on which the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs then devoted, as reported at columns 2841 to 2998, Volume 255 of the Official Report of 29th July, 1971, six hours to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If there was any pique about lack of agreement on this side of the House on the part of those who are anxious to arrange their holidays, I could understand the Government bringing in the guillotine to deal with legislation which had been before the House for a long time.  There might be some justification for that.  But they rolled into that package a number of things not yet published.  We are discussing a guillotine relating to matters which we have not seen.</P>

There is only an hour allowed for Committee <Col N="1254" /> Stage and for Second Stage and this hour can be consumed by the proposer, by the particular Minister who is piloting the Bill through the House. Two hours are allowed for the International Energy Programme motion, two hours for the Elections of Conservators Order, one-and-a-half hours for Estimates.  What about the Industry and Commerce Estimate which I understood was to form the Adjournment Debate?  Is that to be taken now in the one-and-a-half hours?</P>

      <P>I do not know what we were offered, but if democracy is <Col N="1255" /> to prevail every individual in this House has a right to speak on every matter coming on the Order Paper for discussion in this House.  We are being deprived of that right.  If anybody can attempt to defend that I do not know where the defence is, if we are going to keep within the framework of what we have come to know as democratic procedure in Parliament. I think it is a disgrace, and I would be doing less than my duty if I did not say a few words in the strongest possible terms to condemn what the Government are doing on this occasion.  The Parliamentary Secretary must feel very uncomfortable.  He has to face the music and do what he has been ordered to do in this connection. I am not accusing him of doing it.</P>

      <P>He has to come in here on the orders of the Government to compel the House to pass through a number of important items.  They are introducing the guillotine at a time when some of the matters have not yet been seen and we only know what the heading are.  We are not even being given the long titles to the Bills in question.  This is no defence.  When the Christmas recess comes around there is nothing to stop the Government bringing in another guillotine and putting legislation through the House, if the innovation works now as the Parliamentary Secretary hopes it will.  There is the precedent for another Government in another day.  Another Government in another day will go a step further and we who have been Members of this House for a long time know how much precedent is claimed on matters of procedure in this House. When the Ceann Comhairle has not the written Standing Orders, he goes on precedent established in the House. Any Government from now on have an established precedent to do this heretofore unprecedented act of rounding up a lot of legislation, whether it is circulated or not, and having a guillotine motion to ensure that it is steamrolled through by a <Col N="1256" /> particular date.  Parliament will not have a chance to debate it or make any attempt to amend it or make it better than what it is.  If that is not totalitarian Government I do not know what is.  No matter what we say it will not change it.  The Deputies will likely vote for it and the only excuse is that they want to get their holidays early.</P>
      <P>We have had an excellent summer up to now and the rains have come. From now on it is immaterial how long we sit.  The best of the year has gone.  It would be far more important for this country that we would stay here and deal with matters that affect the country at a time when it is going through one of the most difficult periods in its history.  Anything we could do by way of screening legislation coming before the House would be our duty.  I do not suppose there is any chance of the Parliamentary Secretary withdrawing this omnibus guillotine motion, but I would ask him to reflect and to say at some future stage, if not now, that he is sorry he ever introduced it.</P>

      <P>I ought to remind the House that even the shortest look back through the debates of this House will show that the Dáil has been getting more and more prolix and more wordy over the years rather than less.

I would advise Deputies to consider that if this Government were to introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution by replacing it with a new Constitution with the new wordiness which we have become accustomed to in the debate it would take ten volumes, and even they would not hold it.</P>

      <P>I know there are Deputies on the Opposition side who do their work and do it very well.  I do not want to be condescending or patronising in saying that, but I know perfectly well that Deputies who bore the brunt of this financial legislation on the opposite side have been putting their backs into it and worked very hard.  But their efforts have been nullified, so far as getting the work of this House done expeditiously is concerned, by a few episodes which leave this Government with little confidence that any kind of certainly can be had in regard to the disposing of future business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If all the financial legislation this year had been treated in the rational and useful way that was seen here over the last three days with the Capital Gains Tax Bill, there would have been no need for this motion. I accept what Deputy Colley said that the Capital Gains Tax Bill is a better Bill now than it was when it came into the House.  I am equally prepared to agree that a serious Committee Stage debate can make of any Bill a better measure than if the Bill is simply accepted.  Deputy Colley's description of his own job, and I must pay him the tribute of recognising that he has been very hardworking, <Col N="1258" /> though the Minister has had to do the whole thing single-handed, whereas if Deputy Colley wanted to sit back and rest for a few minutes there was somebody else to carry on the work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true to say, as Deputy Colley said, that the work is dull, tedious and unglamorous but this brings me to what this whole debate is about.  Should the Dáil, the full 144 Members, be engaged on this kind of work?  I notice that not one of the speakers from the Opposition here this evening, neither the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy J. Lynch, nor Deputy Lalor, in his excellent contribution, nor Deputy O'Malley, nor Deputy Brennan, nor Deputy Colley, mentioned the question of the special committees which this Dáil was full steam ahead for in the public Press and the mouths of the publicists like Senator Lenihan over the last months and years.  Not one mentioned this question.</P>
      <P>I want to quote briefly; I did not do it at the beginning of the debate as I did not want to raise the debate at its outset to a high temperature.  I want to quote from page 13 of the 1972 report of the Informal Committee on Reform of Dáil Procedure. This committee had a Fianna Fáil majority, actually, presided over by Deputy O'Malley, who spoke here this evening.  Deputy O'Malley and his merry men said:</P>
      <P>We note that the present Standing Orders contemplate the Committee Stage being taken in Committee of the whole House or in some other Committee.  It has, of course, been the practice to take practically all Committee Stages in Committee of the whole Dáil but it is a practice which should now be changed in order to ease the pressure on the time of the House.</P>
      <P>A few lines further down they say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> We recommend that the Bills to be referred to Special Committees should be selected by the Whips and we do not consider that they need to confine their selection to Bills of a purely technical nature.</P>
    <P>Now, these Bills were crying out for treatment in a special committee.  If that had been done, if the Press were bored by it, and nobody could be blamed for being bored by the details of financial legislation, unless one was an economic or fiscal expert, they could have stayed away and it has been very evident to me that the Press have been bored by the deliberations of the Dáil day in, day out. That, needless to say, is not a reason why the Dáil should do anything except carry on in the way it feels it is right to do.  But it is not, perhaps, a bad index, in some ways, of the way in which the Dáil does its work when you find that the Press and the commentators, to a man, are bored to death with what goes on in here.  No wonder the House is not only half empty but almost entirely empty most of the time.  It is because it is boring. Apart from the boredom, which is a very small and unimportant aspect when we are dealing with some very important questions like the ones here at present, it is an index of the frustration anyone, either in the Dáil as a Deputy or anyone working for the Dáil or around the Dáil must feel at finding day after day that there are something like 120 or 130 grown men and women around this House, sweating in the hot weather, filling in time as best they can, to the detriment of their health, to the detriment of their work.  For what?  &mdash;to be put like sheep through a gap when the bell rings at the end of a section.  That is not a rational way of doing business and the right way of doing the Committee Stage of these three Bills was as we originally proposed.</P>

      <P>Need we chop straws about this?  Everybody knows that a Deputy here is regarded by his constituents as having one job more important than any other and that is to look after them.  Since I came in here I have received hundreds of letters from constituents asking me to do this, that or the other.  I am still waiting to get a letter from a constituent to say: &ldquo;Please go into the Dáil and make a speech.&rdquo;  I am still waiting for the first letter asking me to go in and make a speech.</P>

      <P>Deputies must get on with their other work, which is what the people who sent us here regard as being valuable.  If the Dáil is losing its relevance as a deliberative, legislative Assembly, part of the reason is the way in which it does its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This afternoon we had a debate and we rarely were without a quorum and the reason was that it was interesting.  It was a procedural rather than a substantive motion and the result of the motion itself will not make a difference to what happens in the country but it was interesting and you could listen to it and you could feel that here was something being discussed, the way the Legislature does its business.  That is what the full body of the Dáil should be for. But the small print work should be done in special committee.  That is what Deputy O'Malley and his merry men recommended three years ago.  I fully subscribe to the recommendation and so does the entire Government. But despite all the recommendations the only one of substance which has been put into effect, with the agreement of the Opposition, since this Government came into office, was one which benefited itself, namely, an enormous increase in the amount of time given to Private Members' Business but when in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges <Col N="1261" /> it was suggested that we might put this into effect, we got no cooperation at all.</P>

      <P>My belief and the Government's belief is that the determination of the Opposition was simply to stonewall this legislation.  This was confirmed when their Chief Opposition Whip told me perhaps four weeks ago: &ldquo;You will get the Capital Gains Tax Bill before the summer and that is all you will get.&rdquo;  Those were more or less his words.  I took that to mean, as anybody would take it to mean, that the Opposition were going to use all and every means&mdash;I am sorry Deputy Colley is not here to contradict this&mdash;to prevent the Wealth Tax Bill going through, no matter how long we sat.</P>

      <P>I will.  It is a political reason.  This Government have been committed to a certain course of action with regard to capital taxation since before the election.  There has been enough delay already.  The longer the delay goes on the greater will be the public uncertainty, and the Government cannot permit that indefinitely. The Government made a political decision, which I entirely support, that this Bill would have to pass before we rose.</P>

      <P>That is unrealistic and Deputy Browne knows that very well. Not only is it unrealistic but, even if the Government were so foolish as to let themselves go in for such a thing, there would still be no certainty that it would not be soldiered indefinitely.  I said today, when opening the debate, that I asked Deputy Colley, Deputy Lalor and Deputy Browne in the presence of each other how many hours or days they wanted.  I asked them to name how many hours or days they wanted and provided the thing had got some relation to reality the Government would agree.  I asked them to name their own time, and I could not get them to agree.  I know Deputy Colley feels able to say: &ldquo;When we see the way we are treated when we have agreement we cannot be expected to agree.&rdquo; I will not comment on that. Whether I agree or disagree it has got nothing to do with it.  The point is that agreement between Government and Opposition is very frequent and usually works all right.  Deputy Browne will not deny that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne knows very well that, leaving aside that particular incident, which I know Deputy Colley complained about, rightly or wrongly, an enormous proportion of the business of this House is done by agreement.  It gets on very well with no bother at all.  I naturally do not expect the Opposition not to fight but the sequence of business, the length of time it will last is done by, if you like, hand to mouth ways, but it is done reasonably and in a friendly kind of way, which is beneficial to everybody.  That is what I wish to see. I am certain, if this thing works well, the Opposition will, as well, wish to see it extended not merely from day to day but over a period of weeks or, let us say, up to a month.  I do not care for this way of doing things especially when I find the Opposition are so disinclined to accept it.</P>
      <P>This may seem naïve but I actually hoped the Opposition might agree to this motion, that they might make an act of faith in our goodwill and agree to this motion.  I was not without hope that that might be done.  I see now that, whether sincerely or otherwise, they are opposing it.  I suspect they are delighted the thing is being introduced and the last thing they wish is to see it defeated.  If by any chance a couple of my Deputies got stuck in a lift there would be a cheer for a moment but they would go home with very long faces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there was one thing more than another which got a hammering here today from the Opposition benches it was the question of these four Bills which have not yet been published.  I explained in interruptions twice the reason why all these items of business appear on this motion.  There is nothing sinister about it.  I originally thought of devising a motion which would have mentioned only the Wealth Tax Bill, but as soon as I started to think about it I could not think of a way of doing it.  If we <Col N="1265" /> simply built this motion around the Wealth Tax Bill, and only that, and were then required by Minister X, Minister Y and Parliamentary Secretary Z to come along and feed in this motion or that Bill that motion or Bill would not have been covered by the allocation of time motion and there was no other way, short of producing another such motion for a closure or preventing the Opposition from talking out such a thing and wrecking the allocation of time for the Wealth Tax Bill.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I do not dissent from Deputy Lynch's description of this motion as cumbersome, and I do not know whether or not it is unprecedented. It may be unprecedented but I want the House to understand that there is nothing sinister about any of these Bills so far as I know.  I would have phrased it differently if I thought the Bills were anything more than ones which in the normal course would go through the Dáil in a few minutes.</P>
    <P>The reason why all these items are detailed in the motion is because if they were not the introduction of such an item with no time limit attached to it might have provided an opportunity for wrecking the time allocation in regard to the Wealth Tax Bill.  That is the reason and there is no other reason.  If I could, even now, get an agreement in regard to the Wealth Tax Bill that it would be finished on the 30th July I would abandon this motion and, provided it included the passage of the other items, we could take out these things and put them in by agreement according as they fell due but on the understanding that they would not be used to torpedo the time programme for the Wealth Tax Bill.  That is the reason for it and there is no other reason for it.</P>
    <P>I said in my opening statement that if difficulties emerged about these Bills the Government would be prepared to extend these times by agreement.  That remains the case.  Deputy O'Malley mentioned the importance of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, from which I do not dissent.  Whether the whole affairs of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta ought to be debated for a day or two on a twosection Bill, which has a very limited <Col N="1266" /> purpose, is quite another matter.  I need not go into the details of that but I do not see the necessity for doing that and I do not think that the Government, who are in difficulties in regard to time, have any obligation to make the Dáil into a forum for a day or two on a very large issue for which there are other opportunities of debate, merely in order to secure the passage of a Bill with a limited purpose like this.  I do not see that the Government have any obligation to do that at all.</P>
    <P>That is more or less all I want to say about it except, that in the year we are moving into, and I do not care if we change sides next month, or as Deputy Lalor thinks, in September, or whenever he thinks an election will be &mdash;perhaps there will be and perhaps in October we will have changed sides if we are here at all&mdash;I believe the same problem will face Fianna Fáil if and when they are back in Government. There is no doubt they will be sooner or later.  We are moving into an era&mdash;this is a banality and everybody knows it&mdash;of increasingly complex life and the legislation which goes to regulate life.  The days of freewheeling and of open-ended debates on large measures and so forth may not be over now but if they are not they will be over tomorrow.  I do not believe, in spite of the generalities uttered on the far side that there is a single Parliament in Western Europe which does its business like us, in which all debates are open-ended except for Private Members' Business and in which no Government are able to foresee when a particular item will come to an end.  I do not believe any other Parliament does business like that and I do not think the same principles, if applied to private business, could possibly make that business flourish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>People across the floor of the House have spoken today about jackboots, fascism and all the rest of it.  Any Deputy who has something to say must be allowed to say it but there comes a point, which is, I know, subjectively judged by the Government side, when a genuine point of view is giving place to mere talking for talking's <Col N="1267" /> sake; and when that time comes, a Government which has a difficult job and a heavy programme is entitled to draw the debate to a conclusion.  I freely admit that that attitude is open to abuse and I hope this Government will never be guilty of such an abuse.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I appeal to Deputies on the other side, if this motion passes tonight, to try to make sure over the next month that this will work.  Let us give it a chance.  It might be seen to be in the interests of everybody.  It might easily be&mdash;from our point of view I promise as much flexibility as I can possibly deliver&mdash;that if this thing works, when the heat of today is forgotten and when we come back in October, the Opposition Whips and myself, if we are still in our respective jobs, will be able to agree allocations, at least rough allocations, of times for a few weeks ahead.  I believe that every Deputy would benefit from that and for that reason, apart from the fact that we must get this business done, I genuinely recommend the motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Brennan's understanding of it is not correct.  There was no agreement to take that Estimate as an Adjournment Debate.  Certainly this is the first I have heard of it.  What we promised to do was to have one Estimate debated in consideration of the Opposition's passing all the Estimates <i>en bloc</i> two weeks ago, which they agreed to do.  The Opposition selected an Estimate for debate and the one they selected was Industry and Commerce. The Minister for Industry and Commerce duly introduced a £10 Estimate and on two occasions we offered to put it on and&mdash;I make no point about it&mdash;on one occasion it did not suit the Opposition to take it on the day I suggested and on the other occasion they said they would rather go on with the budget debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  You will not find me making a casuistical case for doing something ludicrous here over the next month.  What I was afraid of, and Deputy Brugha will not deny that we have grounds for that fear, was that if we had fixed time merely for the Wealth Tax Bill, we might have had, say, the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill, which in the ordinary way might have passed through all Stages in about ten minutes, talked out, deliberately to torpedo the other.  That is the reason. Experience over the past couple of years does not suggest that is impossible.</P>

      <P>The main point being made this morning on amendment No. 7 was that made by Deputy Colley in relation to his query to the Minister in regard to competition by what are described as non-trading but, basically, by semi-State bodies with other ordinary trading organisations. At that stage the Minister for Foreign Affairs came in and we believe he went a little bit off the track; he seemed to be under the impression that, if it was a semi-State body, it did not matter whether or not there was an extra charge in relation to wealth tax.  What Deputy Colley was arguing was that wealth tax could affect the private company or corporation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs maintained that it did not matter whether it did or not because, if you were a semi-State body, then whether you charged or did not charge a semi-State body made no difference because you would be collecting the money and giving it back. We pointed out to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that his approach was wrong, that semi-State bodies have to show a balance.  They have to balance their accounts in the same way as any other corporation.  If there was a charge made in the case of a semi-State body which was in effect to some of its operations in a trading organisation competing with private enterprise that charge would be reflected in its accounts and would either be part of the charge on any surplus it had or would have to become part of increasing subsidy if it was a semi-State body relying on a State subsidy.</P>

Therefore, no <Col N="1273" /> question of competition between the public and the private sector arises.</P>

      <P>Very briefly I want to deal with the confusion that arose today with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, by giving what I hope is a clear example of what we had in mind.  If you have a private trading company&mdash;private in the sense of not being a publicly quoted company&mdash; valued at £X, and if you have a State trading company with assets valued at £X, and if the liability on the private trading company for wealth tax in a year is £Y, there is no doubt that in the vast majority of cases of that kind £Y has got to come from the earnings of the private company although, in theory, under the Bill, it will come from the individual shareholders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The liability is on the shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The liability is on the shareholders but, in practice, it will come in that case from the earnings of the company.  Therefore, the earnings of the company will be reduced by £Y.  If the State, as shareholder, is not liable, then in the case of the State trading company, it will not have the liability for £Y and will be that much better off.  If, on the other hand, it were liable, the only way it could be made up would be by the Exchequer increasing its investment or subvention to that company, which would be a separate transaction and could be gauged, whereas not to do that means a hidden additional subvention to the State company.  That is the net point we were trying to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the answer when we come to the section.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> In page 9, subsection (3), line 50, after &ldquo;1967,&rdquo; to insert&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and whose property on that date consisted wholly or mainly of property from which that investment income is derived,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The test applied in section 6 in determining whether a company is trading or non-trading is the nature of its income. If it is wholly or mainly investment income, the company is regarded as non-trading.  The period over which the income was looked at was 12 months.</P>
    <P>However, it has been pointed out that if a genuine trading company suffered a loss in its trading activities in the period prior to a valuation date and during that period had some small investment income, for example, from money on deposit or a small reserve held in securities, its position would be that its income was mainly investment income.  In these circumstances a private trading company could find itself liable as a non-trading company through the fortuitous circumstance of an unexpected loss in trading.  This was never our intention.  It is clear, therefore, that a test which is concerned solely with income is inadequate as it can give undesired results when a trading company hits a bad patch.  To rectify the position it is, therefore, proposed to take account of the property which the company holds.  The test of whether a company is a private non-trading company will now be determined by two factors.</P>
    <P>Firstly, was the income in the 12 months prior to the valuation date wholly or mainly invested income, and secondly, was the property of the company on that date wholly or mainly property from which that invested income was derived?  The test should ensure that a genuine trading company should not, through a fortuitous loss in its trading operations in a given year, find itself in the position of being treated as a private non-trading company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a point I raised on Second Stage.  The Minister's amendment meets it fully as far as I can see and, for that reason, <Col N="1279" /> of course, we support it.  Without it we would have had grave anomalies and indeed injustices.  Perhaps I may be forgiven in the context of the discussion we had earlier this evening for pointing out that this is another example of the benefits which can accrue from a proper detailed examination of a Bill of this kind.  The suggestions made from these benches, in some cases at least, deserve to be listened to and incorporated in the Bill.  It is desirable that full opportunity should be given for such suggestions to be made from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 10, after line 10, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>(5) This section shall not apply to a private non-trading company of which a body corporate which is not a private non-trading company has control and, for the purposes of this subsection, where a body corporate (in this subsection referred to as the first body corporate) has control of a second body corporate and the second body corporate has control of a private non-trading company, the first body corporate shall be deemed to have control of the private non-trading company and if a third body corporate has control of the first body corporate, the third body corporate shall be deemed to have control of the private non-trading company, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public companies, both Irish and foreign, often find it necessary for fiscal, commercial or other reasons to interpose holding companies between themselves and their trading companies. These holding companies collect, invest and govern the dividends from the trading companies. These holding companies are owned entirely by the parent public company. As a company is a legal person the holding company is controlled by one person, the parent company, and its income is investment income, being <Col N="1280" /> the income of shares in a trading company.  The holding company thus becomes a private non-trading company within the meaning of the section. It is often found that there is not only one but several holding companies between the parent company and the lowest subsidiary company.</P>
    <P>It was not the intention of the section as drafted to make holding companies which are controlled by public companies liable as entities. That this, however, was the effect of the section was pointed out in a number of representations I received, the reason being that a public company is a legal &ldquo;person&rdquo; and that, therefore, a holding company in those circumstances is under the control of &ldquo;not more than &lsquo;five persons&rsquo;.&rdquo;  For other reasons, it was not open to us to use the word &ldquo;individuals&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment rectifies this situation.  However, it goes even further.  It takes out of the charge for tax any private non-trading company which is controlled by any body corporate which is not a private non-trading company.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a private non-trading company is not a taxable entity if it is controlled:</P>
    <P>(i) by a trading company whether public or private or by</P>
    <P>(ii) any public company whether trading or non-trading,</P>
    <P>(iii) any private company which is not a private non-trading company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is also a point we brought up on the Second Stage and I am glad to see the Minister is tackling it.  However, in this case I cannot give the amendment my full support for a few reasons which I will outline.  The basic one is that the approach in the Bill to this section is, in my opinion, wrong.  I believe that the liability should attach in a uniform way throughout the Bill and that we are getting into a morass by approaching it in the way the section does.  Given the approach in the section, the Minister's amendment is the right one, but it produces a morass.  I <Col N="1281" /> suspect this particular amendment may be providing an enormous loophole for evasion of wealth tax.  I will develop that later.  It also has relevance to a point we discussed at some length in earlier sections with regard to the effect on private investment.</P>
      <P>The first point I should like to put to the Minister is a drafting one.  In the second line of the amendment there is reference to a:</P>
      <P>body corporate which is not a private non-trading company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other references later on to a body corporate but the other references do not incorporate the phrase &ldquo;which is not a private non-trading company&rdquo;.  It may be that the Minister will say it is inferred but it is not clear to me that it is inferred. If it is not, I think the Minister will agree that it should be.  In other <Col N="1282" /> words, that where there is a reference anywhere in this amendment to a body corporate what is meant is a body corporate which is not a private non-trading company.  It is not clear to me that that meaning is carried through, and if it is not I think the Minister would want to ensure that it was carried through.</P>

Perhaps we could agree that we have arrived at the appropriate hour to report progress and take it up in the morning.</P>
