      <P>Section 23 was amended in Committee with the result that the definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; is now in subsection (2) whereas before the change it was in subsection (4).  The amendment therefore made a correction of the cross-reference.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 16, after &ldquo;partial intestacy&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or by virtue of the Succession Act, 1965,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendments are designed to ensure that where property passes to a surviving spouse under sections 56 and 111 of the Succession Act, 1965, or to children by virtue of a provision made under section 117 of that Act the treatment for capital gains tax will be the same as if the property had passed under a testamentary disposition.  In the absence of the words &ldquo;or by virtue of the Succession Act, 1965,&rdquo; there would be a capital gains tax charged on the transfer of property to them under the Succession Act, 1965.</P>

      <P>These amendments appear to be in order as far as we are concerned except for one point which the Minister might explain.  The Minister will know that in the first two amendments he is proposing to insert the words &ldquo;by virtue of the Succession Act, 1965,&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;partial intestacy&rdquo; but in amendment No. 4, line 25, the reference to &ldquo;partial intestacy&rdquo; is omitted.  Should there not be a reference to &ldquo;partial intestacy&rdquo; also in line 25?</P>

      <P>We do not talk about partial disposition either.  The disposition or intestacy are the words which describe the manner in which the property passes.  There is no quantification in those two words, &ldquo;disposition&rdquo; or &ldquo;intestacy&rdquo;.  Quantification arises further up where one is dealing with a testamentary disposition or an intestacy or partial intestacy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 34 to 40, and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The adjustment shall be such as to secure that the amount of capital gains tax to which he is chargeable for that year of assessment shall not exceed the further amount of income tax to which he would be chargeable if, in addition to any other liability to income tax, he was chargeable to income tax for that year under Case IV of Schedule D&mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to delete lines 34 to 40 and to substitute the words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adjustment shall be such as to secure that the amount of capital gains tax to which he is chargeable for that year of assessment shall not exceed the further amount of income <Col N="228" /> tax to which he would be chargeable if, in addition to any other liability to income tax, he was chargeable to income tax for that year under Case IV of Schedule D.</P>
    <P>The obligation on the taxpayer to make a claim under section 6 was removed by a Committee Stage amendment with the result that an adjustment was made mandatory. Such an adjustment could, however, result in an increase of tax.  It was intended that the adjustment would be made only when it was in the taxpayer's favour and this amendment makes it clear that only adjustments by way of reduction of liability may be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not appear to be any provision in this amendment for the payment of interest on an overpayment.  I have an amendment coming up later which seeks to provide for this.  I understood the Minister to say that in effect this amendment is consequential on an amendment made on Committee Stage.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall that this aspect of the matter was adverted to on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised on Committee Stage the possibility that a wrong assessment might be made under this section and inquired as to the mechanism for readjusting the wrong assessment and making the repayment.  This is where the question of the interest on the repayment arose for which provision does not appear to be made here.  The effect of the proposed amendment, in so far as I can see, is that it should have the effect of ensuring that where there is a further amount chargeable it will not exceed the amount of income tax which would have been chargeable.  In so far as it is putting that kind of limitation on it the amendment is acceptable to this side of the House but I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister has not provided for the possibility of a mistake being made in the assessment with the necessary consequence of readjustment of the assessment and perhaps repayment and consequential <Col N="229" /> interest on that repayment.  I have no objection to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Schedule IV of the Bill adapts for capital gains tax purposes the income tax provisions in relation to the payment of interest in the same circumstances as interest arises on a repayment under the income tax laws.  This provision that we are seeking to insert in this amendment arises out of the case that was made that the Revenue Commissioners should be under an obligation to make the adjustment and not to leave it to the option of the taxpayer. It is a little unreasonable to be complaining that, as a result of coming to an Opposition suggestion that the Revenue Commissioners should discharge the obligation of making the assessment at the lower figure, there should now be some additional provision in this section dealing with interest.  The amendment made on Committee Stage and this amendment will operate to the relief of taxpayers, not to their detriment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 10, after line 12 to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided, however, that the shares issued for cash shall not be assets for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a typographical error in this amendment which is my fault and not that of anybody who was transmitting it.  It is that the definite article appears before the word <Col N="230" />&ldquo;shares&rdquo; and it should not appear there.  It should read:</P>
    <P>Provided, however, that shares issued for cash shall not be assets for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I referred to this matter.  On the 13th February I referred the Minister to what I understood to be the interpretation placed on the clause in this section which is exactly similar to that contained in the British legislation by some commentators in Britain.  Having drawn the Minister's attention to it I suggested that he might look into the matter.  At column 448 of the Official Report of 13th February, 1975, I said:</P>
    <P>What I should like to know is could the Minister say whether this will cover the issue of shares in cash.  I understand that some British commentators, in regard to a similar provision in British legislation, take the view that it would cover the issue of shares for cash. However, I am not clear on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am interested in the Deputy's comment.  I have not had this issue brought to my notice.  I shall certainly have a look at it.</P>
    <P>I added:</P>
    <P>If the Minister would have a look at it and then perhaps on the next Stage he would get an opportunity of commenting on the matter.</P>
    <P>I put down the amendment largely to give the Minister an opportunity of indicating now what view he takes on the meaning of paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 7, as to whether or not it does cover the issue of shares for cash.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not responsible for what some commentators may say nor can we legislate in response to some far-fetched interpretation by some British commentators. The position under our law will be that there will be no charge on a company which issues shares for cash.  If the amendment were to be pressed and accepted all shares would become <Col N="231" /> non-chargeable assets, thus gains made on the stock exchange would not be chargeable.  It would be open to people, including very wealthy people and speculators, to make very significant gains on the stock exchange free of any tax liability.  Having regard to all the exemptions provided in the Bill the only assets of any significance which would then be liable to tax would be lands.  It would even be possible then for people to find a convenient way of avoiding the tax on land by providing for the ownership of land through the medium of companies. So, the amendment, if accepted, would make nonsense of the whole Bill.  It will be noted that there are special provisions made in section 4 that foreigners cannot avoid tax on land and mineral rights in the State and assets situated in the Continental Shelf by the formation of a company. If this amendment were to be accepted the provisions of section 4 would be rendered ineffective.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If the Minister's reading of the section as it stands is correct, well and good, but the purpose I have in drawing his attention to the interpretation placed on this in Britain and in putting down the amendment for this Stage was to enable him to consider whether there was any validity in the argument that had been put forward in Britain on the same wording so that if there was some validity in it he could perhaps redraft the relevant position of the section to ensure that what he was trying to achieve would be achieved. If he is satisfied that that is so and that it is being achieved then as far as I am concerned my purpose in raising this has been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish in any way to undermine the scope of the capital gains tax but if it should happen that as a result of the wording of paragraph (c) the Minister should find it undermined in future he will, I hope, <Col N="232" /> recall the fact that I have drawn his attention to the possible interpretation of paragraph (c).</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  The only question I would like to ask the Minister in this regard is simply this: is not the essence of the point that, accepting everything the Minister said, there is a danger that as the wording stands the total assets of the company if there were extra shares issued would be increased and that <i>pro tanto</i> there would be a gain for all shareholders, and so on?  There is that other danger in it too.  Would he consider that?  I reinforce Deputy Colley's point and I will not say any more. I will not trespass on the Chair's indulgence.  I would have to elaborate. Thank you.</P>

There are a lot of amendments.  The Minister, while he did not give an undertaking, did mention that at least he would not object if Deputy Colley, at least, was allowed to speak twice on a few occasions.  You will find that in the Official Report.  I know that <Col N="233" /> this is Report Stage and that the procedure is laid down.  That matter was raised on Committee Stage.</P>

The Minister, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, did not give an undertaking to that effect but did indicate that in such circumstances he would not object.  That was in relation to particular aspects of the Bill.  If it is necessary, when we come to that, I will so propose.</P>

      <P>The real purpose of this&mdash;whether it is achieved, I do not know; the Minister will have something to say about this&mdash;is to try to secure greater clarification in subsection (6) of section 8. The Minister may recall that on Committee Stage I argued that this subsection as drafted was in fact contradictory because as it stands in the Bill the first portion of the subsection reads:</P>
      <P>An asset shall be treated as having been acquired free of any interest or right by way of security subsisting at the time of any acquisition of it, and as being disposed of free of any such interest or right subsisting at the time of the disposal...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> That is the first part of the subsection. That is clear enough but the next part seems to me to contradict it.  It says:</P>
    <P>...and where an asset is acquired subject to any such interest or right the full amount of the liability thereby assumed by the person acquiring the asset shall form part of the consideration for the acquisition and disposal in addition to any other consideration,</P>
    <P>which seems to me to be saying the opposite.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this matter on Committee Stage on 13th February, 1975, at column 461 of the Official Report, I said:</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this is not a matter that can be settled across the floor of the House.  I would like the Minister to look at it again because I think there is a direct contradiction in this.  While the Minister is having a look at it, would he consider something on these lines &ldquo;where an asset is acquired subject to any interest or right by way of security subsisting at the time of any acquisition of it, and had been disposed of free of any such interest or right subsisting at the time of the disposal, the full amount of the liability thereby assumed by the person acquiring the asset shall form part of the consideration for the acquisition and disposal in addition to any other consideration.&rdquo;  That is what the subsection is trying to say.  Perhaps the Minister would consider what I have proposed?</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I will have it examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendments do not appear to cover this subsection at all and, as I say, in an effort to achieve a greater degree of clarity I have proposed this amendment.  Perhaps I do not understand the subsection but it seems to me my amendment does what the subsection is trying to do.  If I do not understand the subsection, particularly having regard to the discussion we had on Committee Stage, then the <Col N="236" /> Minister may take it that there will be a number of other people who will not understand it either.  The beginning of the subsection states one proposition&mdash;I do not think it is a correct proposition&mdash;and the second part of the subsection seems to me to state a directly contradictory proposition.</P>
    <P>The first part of the subsection states that the asset shall be treated as having been acquired free of any interest or right at the time of acquisition.  I do not know why it should be so treated.  The second part goes on to say it will not be treated in that way. It provides that where it is acquired, subject to any interest or right, that is added to what is, in effect, the normal consideration in order to determine what is the consideration both with the acquisition and the disposal. It seems to me that the second portion of the subsection is saying the correct thing and the first portion, which is contradictory, is stating something which, I think, does not stand up.  For that reason my amendment suggests a slight amalgamation of portion of the beginning of the first part with the second part of the subsection. It is designed to achieve what I believe is being sought to be achieved.  The effect of it would be that, where an asset is acquired subject to any interest or right by way of security subsisting at the time of its acquisition, then the full amount of the liability assumed by the person acquiring the asset will be part of the consideration.  Putting it in simple terms, if a person were to purchase an asset for £20,000 subject to a mortgage of £5,000 and if he were to take on the liability for the mortgage, then for the purposes of assessment the cost of acquisition or cost of disposal. depending on which part you are looking at, would be £25,000 and not £20,000.  In effect, that is what the second part of the subsection says but the first part of the subsection says &ldquo;free&rdquo;; you disregard the mortgage in a case like that.  This was the point I raised on Committee Stage.  I trust the amendment clarifies the position and is doing what was intended to be done.  If it is not, then the Minister should have some amendment clarifying the effect of this subsection.</P>

      <P>We are, I am afraid, at loggerheads here.  Deputy Colley's amendment makes the situation more confused and, whereas there is no contradiction in the section, the amendment introduces a contradiction. The subsection is concerned with four basic situations in regard to acquisition and disposal:</P>
      <P>(1)  Acquisition free of a charge and disposal free of a charge.</P>
      <P>(2)  Acquisition free of a charge and disposal with a charge.</P>
      <P>(3)  Acquisition with a charge and disposal free of a charge.</P>
      <P>(4)  Acquisition with a charge and disposal with a charge.</P>
      <P>The first part of the subsection establishes the principle that the value to be taken is the full value without any encumbrances and the second part elaborates on this and sets out that, where a liability is assumed, the value of that liability is to be added to any other consideration given in order to get the full value of the asset.  The subsection covers the four basic situations. Deputy Colley's alternative provides for an acquisition subject to a charge and a disposal free of charge and it thus covers only one of the possible situations.  If I may say so, without disrespect, the second part of Deputy Colley's amendment is contradictory to the assumption of disposal free of charge.  I have a note here of the suggestion he made on Committee Stage and I see he has not, in fact, put that into his amendment on this Report Stage.  I am not faulting him.  I saw some of his amendments late last night and the rest only this morning.  I was involved here and in the Seanad and it was a late hour before I received any amendments at all.  When the Deputy looks at the four situations I have outlined, I think he will see his particular amendment does not cover these four situations and the subsection must, therefore, be left as originally drafted.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister mean the first half of subsection (6) means that, if an asset is acquired which carries with it a liability, the net value is taken: that is, the liability <Col N="238" /> is deducted from the asset in arriving at the total value?  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>The Minister described four possible situations which he said were being covered by the subsection. With due respect to the Minister, I do not think they are being covered by the subsection at all.  That may have been the intention but that is not what is happening.  If one takes the first part of the subsection, it provides:</P>
      <P>An asset shall be treated as having been acquired free of any interest or right by way of security subsisting at the time of any acquisition of it...</P>
      <P>What does that mean?  It does not say where an asset is being acquired and there is no outstanding interest or right, which is situation No. 1 the Minister described; that is not covered at all.  It says it shall be treated as having been acquired free of any interest or right; that is, irrespective of whether there is an interest or right involved.  If there is an interest or right involved, why should it be treated as having been acquired free of that?  Of course, it should not, and the second part of the subsection says precisely that it will not be so regarded, directly contradicting the first sentence of the subsection.  That was the basis of my objection originally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt to point out that it is wrong to take the subsection only as far as the first comma?  You go right down to the semicolon and you then have the whole picture as to the manner in which the asset is to be treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part reads:</P>
      <P>An asset shall be treated as having been acquired free of any interest or right by way of security subsisting at the time of any acquisition of it, and as being disposed of free of any such interest or right subsisting at the time of the disposal;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one takes that portion of the subsection on its own it would seem to suggest that if, in fact, an asset is <Col N="239" /> subject to an interest or right and it is disposed of&mdash;in any disposal there is, of course, an acquisition and disposal&mdash;although there is an interest or right subsisting the treatment of the asset for the purpose of the acquisition and disposal is to regard it as being free of any such interest or right.  Can the Minister take any other meaning out of that, as far as the semicolon?  It seems to be demonstrably true that that is what it is saying.  That also is something which does not make sense.</P>
    <P>The second part of the subsection goes on to say what is, in my opinion, the correct position, that if there is an interest or charge subsisting, it is to be taken into account both for the purpose of acquisition and disposal and is to be added to the cost, the ordinary consideration.  That is what my amendment is saying: &ldquo;Where an asset is acquired subject to an interest or right.&rdquo;  Is it not saying &ldquo;if the asset is not subject to an interest or right, you do not do anything with it?&rdquo;  It reads:</P>
    <P>Where an asset is acquired subject to any interest or right by way of security subsisting at the time of its acquisition, the full amount of the liability thereby assumed by the person acquiring the asset shall form part of the consideration for the acquisition and disposal in addition to any other consideration.</P>
    <P>That, in effect, is saying what the second part of the subsection is saying, but omitting the first part which, with due respect to the Minister, I still contend, as I did on Committee Stage, is contradicting the first part of the subsection.</P>
    <P>The four situations outlined by the Minister may have been intended to be covered by the subsection but they are not.  The first case states:</P>
    <P>An asset shall be treated as having been acquired free of any interest or right ... and as being disposed of free of any such interest or right subsisting ...</P>
    <P>If words mean anything that says that even though there is an interest or <Col N="240" /> right subsisting, they are to be treated as being disposed of and acquired free of that interest or right.  Is that not what the first part of the subsection says?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall the four cases I gave.  The first part covers the first&mdash;the acquisition, free of charge and disposal free of charge&mdash;and the fourth&mdash;acquisition with a charge and disposal with a charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>An asset shall be treated as having been acquired free of any interest or right by way of security subsisting at the time ...</P>
      <P>That means there was an interest or charge subsisting.  That is not case No. 1 mentioned by the Minister.  He mentioned a case where there is not any such.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The second and third cases are covered by the rest of the subsection.  The second is acquisition free of charge and disposal with a charge, and the third is acquisition with a charge and disposal free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the theoretical breakdown of the possible cases there may be, and I agree with the breakdown. I suggest that that is not what the subsection is doing.  We will take the first case mentioned by the Minister&mdash;acquisition free of any interest or charge.  The first part reads &ldquo;an asset shall be treated as having been acquired free of any interest or right ...&rdquo;.  It will be &ldquo;treated&rdquo; that way.  It does not say that &ldquo;in a case where there is no interest or charge, it will be treated as having no interest or charge.&rdquo;  The existing wording suggests that it will be treated in that way, even if there is an interest or charge subsisting.  Otherwise, what sense does it make to say it is to be treated in that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that while the type of cases that can be envisaged by the Minister is correct, the subsection does not deal with it and my amendment, <Col N="241" /> or something along those lines, covers the situation.  Where there is no outstanding charge either on the acquisition or the disposal, no special provision is necessary.  Where there is an outstanding charge on the acquisition, it is necessary to provide that if a liability is taken over it will be part of the consideration or, alternatively, if an outstanding charge is part of the disposal, that will be deemed to be part of the consideration.  My amendment is doing that.</P>
    <P>I also suggest that the subsection as it stands is that&mdash;if one can make any sense of it at all and analyses it &mdash;amounts to a contradiction between the first and the second part of the subsection.  I hope the Minister will see that while the analysis of the possible cases that can arise which he has given is correct, there is not anything in the subsection which adds up to treatment of the four possible cases in the way he suggested.  On the contrary, the effect of the use of the word <Col N="242" />&ldquo;treated&rdquo; in the first line is to suggest something artificial.  In other words, where there is an interest or charge we are to treat the matter as if such did not exist.  That is not what the Minister is trying to do, as is made clear in the second part of the subsection.</P>
    <P>In my view, my amendment covers the position the Minister is trying to cover but, as I said earlier, if it does not, the Minister should not leave subsection (6) as it stands because, if he does, he can be certain it will lead to litigation and uncertainty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 12, after line 3, to add the following :</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and provided also that whenever a disposal <i>inter vivos</i> results in a liability both to Capital Gains Tax and to Gift Tax, only such one of those taxes as imposes the higher amount of tax shall be chargeable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that this point was raised also on Committee Stage. It was pointed out that in the Government's White Paper it was specifically set out that both capital gains tax and gift tax would not be applied at the same time.  Subsequently, when the Bills emerged, it appeared that that arrangement was gone back on and that in fact both taxes would be applied to the one transaction.</P>
      <P>We had lengthy discussion on this matter on Committee Stage.  What seemed to emerge eventually was that the reason for this was that, unless it was provided that both would apply, the Minister feared there would be avoidance loopholes which could defeat the object of the exercise.  We went into some detail in pointing out the difficulties and, in some cases, hardships that could arise by the application of both taxes to the one transaction, but the Minister felt he could not depart from this because of the loopholes he said would be created even though the White Paper had said that only one of the taxes would be applied.</P>
      <P>On the 18th February last in this House, as reported at columns 723 and 724, as we came to the end of the discussion, I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we adjourned I was suggesting to the Minister that he might consider, in relation to this amendment, an alternative by which there would be applied either capital gains tax or capital acquisitions tax to one transaction, whichever was the higher.  Would the Minister give some further consideration to this or consider some variant to it? If he did he would find there would not be avoidance in the sense that whichever was going to yield the greater amount to the Exchequer would be the tax applied. At the same time he would maintain the principle adumbrated in the White Paper of not applying <Col N="245" /> both taxes to the one transaction. I appreciate that one tax is payable by one party and another by another but the Minister accepted in the White Paper that in such a case payment of one tax would be sufficient. If he gives some further consideration to something on the lines I have suggested he might be able to achieve what he originally proposed to achieve in the White Paper and at the same time close the loophole to which he has referred and which he has put forward as the main reason for rejecting this amendment and departing from the proposals in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>I have always shown willingness to consider the views of other people.  The fact that the legislation is different in some respects from the White Paper is an indication that I listened to the representations made to me.  What the Deputy has said in relation to this amendment will certainly be considered. If something can be done, without offending against the principles of the Bill and a fair and equitable taxation without avoidance facilities, I will be only too happy to do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendments do not deal with this matter.  Therefore, I put down this amendment and, as I have indicated, it is designed to do what the Government said they would do in the White Paper, that is, to apply either gift tax or capital gains tax, but not both.  But, since it also provides that one of them only will apply and the one which will apply is the one which will give the greatest yield to the Exchequer, then it should be a deterrent to any avoidance the Minister fears because, whatever way people want to manoeuvre the situation to avoid liability to tax, if the effect is that they will pay whichever is the higher tax, that would seem to me to be a fairly effective deterrent to any manoeuvring of the circumstances of a particular case.  I do think that, not alone because the Government said in the White Paper they would not apply both taxes, but from the point of view of equity and justice, <Col N="246" /> both taxes should not be applied at the one time to the one transaction.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this amendment affords the Minister the opportunity of achieving equity and justice, of protecting the Exchequer against avoidance and, as a result, improving this Bill and, to the same extent, also improving the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  Therefore, I would hope the Minister would not have any difficulty in accepting this amendment which I believe closes the loopholes he fears exist and, at the same time, does what the Government said originally they should do, and is being fair and equitable to the taxpayers concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill is a Bill only.  There is, as yet, no capital acquisitions tax. Therefore it would not be open to the House to adopt an amendment which assumes that a certain tax may be introduced at a later date.  If the Deputy feels strongly about this the appropriate way to deal with it would be to make some such provision in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  Far be it from me to urge him to put down an amendment, but he will accept that that would be the correct procedure.  We cannot at this stage anticipate what the House may or may not do in relation to capital acquisitions tax.  Therefore, if this issue is to be debated it will have to be on the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, on the principles, I want to point out that there are two different taxpayers.  The taxpayer in the capital gains tax is the person who makes the gain, the person who is disposing of the asset, and he pays the tax only <Col N="247" /> on the gain made between the time of acquisition and the time of disposal. Capital acquisitions tax will be paid by the beneficiary or the person who receives a gift from another. Then the beneficiary will pay the tax only when the gift exceeds extremely generous thresholds indeed.  The Government's undertaking, and the one which we are fulfilling, is to abolish death duties and replace them by a system of capital taxation confined to the really wealthy.  The reality of the situation is that capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax will be payable only by people who are extremely fortunate to be parting with or receiving very substantial sums of money.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is inappropriate, in those circumstances, that both the person disposing of an asset should pay capital gains tax and the person receiving a very substantial gift should pay capital acquisitions tax.  In the vast majority of cases there will be no question of both taxes being paid.  If people are in fortunate circumstances that liability arises I do not think it is inappropriate that both parties should pay.  If the donor decides or imposes a condition on conferring a gift on the other so that the beneficiary will pay the donor's capital gains tax the value of the gift will be reduced by the amount of capital gains tax if the donee pays on behalf of the donor.  To that extent there would be a reduction in the value of the gifts and, therefore, a reduction in the amount of capital acquisitions tax to be paid.</P>
    <P>All in all, bearing in mind that we are dealing here with very substantial transfers of property, I say, with respect, that in equity there is no need to accept the amendment and it would be contrary to the Government's intention to levy an appropriate amount of tax where substantial property disposals take place and, therefore, I recommend its rejection.</P>

      <P>On the technical point about where this amendment fits in, if the Minister confined himself to that he would have been taking a very narrow approach to the <Col N="248" /> substance of this Bill.  I take it what he really means is that if any such amendment were to be accepted or to be considered it should be deferred for consideration under the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  Is that what the Minister is saying?</P>

      <P>The Minister is saying from a technical point of view that the word &ldquo;gift&rdquo; is not defined in this Bill and to bring it in here would imply the importation of a new definition.  In technical law I accept the Minister's point on that but I am very glad he did not stand on it and went on to the other argument.</P>
      <P>I can see that there are two points of view here.  I am not saying that what the Minister has said is not without merit.  I do not want to anticipate a discussion on the other Bill but we cannot ignore it.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Lands, was deputising for him when I raised the question of <i>in pari materia</i> and I do not intend to delay the Minister or the House with that argument now.  The idea of the capital gains tax is that if anybody deals with property and assets in what is broadly classified as a capital transaction and if there are any monetary gains accruing in that, the State will get a rake off that. All this dressing up about sociology and all the rest of it is primarily designed to get money to run the State. The social effect of capital gains and these things is another matter.</P>
      <P>The first thing about capital gains is that in relation to any monetary gains resulting from business transactions, the buying and selling of property, which is technically called assets in this Bill, the State will take a proportion of it.  This was the principle but it specifically applied to buying and selling transactions.  Then, of necessity, in order to avoid evasion and to capture all the ways that monetary value can be measured, the necessary complications had to be introduced so that things would be deemed to be monetary gains when in fact they were not actually gains directly measured by an increase in price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> That does not get away from the fact that the fundamental approach to this Bill was that it was a tax on any profits made in the buying and selling of property.  That pretty well sums up the philosophy of this Bill we are discussing.  At the same time, the Minister is introducing two other Bills <i>in pari materia</i>.  I accede to the Minister's technical point but I am also glad that he gave me the opening to discuss the thing without going into any detail.  The wealth tax comes into this also.  The gift tax which will be applied is an additional tax.  In principle it is to supply the gap that is left where capital transactions occur which cannot be brought within the category of buying and selling because it is the nature of voluntary disposal, or, in the case of death, involuntary disposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taxing all transactions where property and benefit passes and this deals with the buying and selling side of the story.  The Capital Acquisitions Bill will deal with the voluntary gift transfers and with the question of succession on death. They are all part of the principle of taxing the transfer of capital where there is a benefit involved.  The Minister has pointed out that he is giving greater benefits in one case than the other, and I see the difficulty created for the Minister in that.  I understand the point he is making in this regard. But in between, covering both, there is a wealth tax.  If property passes in the category of buying and selling and there is a gain it is captured by this Bill and a tax is payable.  If it is in the nature of a gift, <i>inter vivos</i> or post-mortem, a tax will attach there with a difference in regard to reliefs. In either case when it comes to the threshold we are going to have the further liability of the wealth tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he would only get the wealthy and told us of the generous thresholds he was giving, not so much in the wealth tax, but there are thresholds.  The wealth tax will get the person if there is a capital gain, and the people who are likely to make capital gains are those who are likely to be caught by the wealth tax.  The people most likely to <Col N="250" /> be caught by all this legislation are a class which the Minister, from one point of view, said are well able to bear this.  We should also have regard to what they can bear and to reasonable equity in the matter.  We are now at the stage of piling it on unjustly, in the long run defeating any return which will ultimately accrue and with no great benefit to the community.  In fact, this will result in positive dangers to the community.  When considered from that point of view there is merit in Deputy Colley's amendment even though there is merit in the approach of the Minister. Would the Minister take Deputy Colley's point and see whether, in the totality of the situation, the statement in the White Paper might not have been the more equitable guide?  I know the Minister will have difficulties about anti-avoidance but he has not raised this yet and I do not want to throw him back on that defence.</P>
    <P>If there is a transaction there will be a wealth tax in between in both cases.  There will be a double tax affecting the same transaction, the passing of property in a certain case where the double tax will attach.  Capital gains tax will almost certainly be payable in the inflationary situation we are in, which may continue with the decline in money values, and we will have the gift tax.  It could happen that there would be a treble taxation, a capital gains tax, a gift tax or legacy duty and a wealth tax.</P>
    <P>If we are moving that far Left, and there is a good deal of argument for it, we are moving very far Left.  The move to the Left is getting out of control like in Italy and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be toying with his socialist philosophy here but I believe the horses are going to run away with him very quickly.  Somebody remarked last night, and I repeated it, that this House was becoming an irrelevancy; that the power was passing from this House and from the Government.  For this reason it is possible that we are wasting our time talking about this in the present economic situation.  If it is the Minister's intention to do this on <Col N="251" /> a socialist philosophy that is all right but I am taking it as a taxation measure.  If it is a taxation measure and if we are still in the context of the post-French revolutionary socialism there is an inequity here.  There is the loading of taxes on a particular quarter.  In some cases it is not just a case of double taxation; it is a treble taxation.  While I appreciate everything the Minister has said I am glad he did not stand on the technical point he could have stood on.  I appreciate that he did not attempt to stand on it.  I further see his difficulty with the reliefs under the capital acquisitions tax and the capital gains tax.  It nevertheless remains true that the transaction involves persons.  It is individuals who are involved in this, not corporate bodies.  Persons in this category referred to by the Minister are now to be subjected to a peculiar type of penal taxation in the sense that it is all loaded up.  I think we are going rather far here in infringement of principle.  I would commend again to the Minister, if not in this Bill, when it comes to the other Bill, a very serious consideration of the points made by Deputy Colley.  I said taxation.  I might almost say quadruple taxation.  There is, I should imagine, a taxing in most of these cases.  On the capital acquisition side, there is and <i>ad valorem</i> stamp duty.  The tax, therefore, on this transaction of buying and selling is not only a taxing of gains but a taxing of the whole transaction.  We have been taxing the whole transaction for years.  That is what stamp duty is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Ad valorem</i> stamp duty is just a convenient way of imposing a tax on commercial transactions according to the value of the transaction.  Indeed in practice it very often boils down to a tax on the market value of the property because the tax is <i>ad valorem.</i> It is a tax that is imposed in quite a straightforward way by the simple expedient that you have to bring the document of title to the appropriate office, get it stamped and pay the fee, the fee being graded to the value of the transaction.  That is what an <Col N="252" /><i>ad valorem</i> stamp means.  Let us not miss the point when we talk about stamp duty.  It is not like a postage stamp where you pay for the service. We buy a postage stamp and put it on a letter but we are really paying for the service of having the letter transmitted. A stamp on a deed or a stamp in regard to a transaction is not of the same nature.  It is a tax, a tax pure and simple, graded to the value, and you cannot use your title in court without a further tax penalty if you do not pay the tax.  There are some very nice indirect sanctions for it as the Minister, as a practising lawyer, must know.</P>
    <P>Let us take a transaction coming under this Bill where what we are talking about is significant.  There will be a tax which is called a stamp duty and then there will be capital gains tax.  It appears now that there will be another tax levied on this as well if it is a transaction for gift which may avoid the stamp.  One way of avoiding the stamp of course is gifts.  When the Minister makes a distinction between the gift tax which will come under the other Bill and the type of transaction that is going to attract a capital gain, he must remember that if the gift tax is free of the stamp duty and gets relief the other is paying the duty.  However, further detailed analysis would perhaps be out of order and I trust the Minister has got my point.  I repeat that the wealth tax comes into it.  These are all one sort of transaction.  Would the Minister not say that there is some substance in the pleas from this side of the House that would, at the very least, require careful consideration when the other two Bills in this code are being considered?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister ought to consider this question of double taxation liability&mdash; the capital gains tax and gift tax.  I appreciate that in family situations the Minister has made exceptions up to a figure.  I presume the Minister's object here is to prevent avoidance.  It is important that people should not feel that there is an injustice being done, that the Commissioners are trying to tax all over the place wherever <Col N="253" /> they can.  I did not hear the Minister on this amendment but there is some validity in what Deputy de Valera has been saying.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister will be able to complete these three Bills &mdash;Capital Gains, Wealth and Inheritance, before the adjournment.  It strikes me that it will create quite a difficult situation for people in many areas if one or two of these Bills is through and the other one is not.  For example, the Death Duties Bill is still, I think, in operation subject to the Gifts Tax Bill being passed.  I would like the Minister to indicate whether he can see a situation in which one or two of these Bills would be law and another one might not.  If that were so it certainly would create a very confusing situation for very many people. I agree particularly with the points being put by Deputy de Valera on the question of the application of two taxes at the same time, and possibly even three taxes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> If we had these Bills in their proper sequence at least we would know where we stand.  We on this side of the House know how the Bills should have been brought in.  The Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill should have been the first Bill before the House and probably we could deal with the Capital Gains Tax Bill more effectively then.  There was no necessity at all to introduce the Wealth Tax Bill at the time it was introduced. We will have plenty of time in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the whole capital taxation package has been mismanaged as regards its presentation to the House.  I see a lot of merit in Deputy Colley's amendment as regards the two types of taxation.  The Minister has already stated that the other Bill is before the House.  He is perfectly right in that, but whether we like it or not we are going to have a capital acquisitions tax, a gift tax. We have in this Bill a capital gains tax.  We will have to look at our whole philosophy in regard to the distribution of wealth in the country.  We are here dealing with a particular section of <Col N="254" /> people when the thresholds are taken into consideration.  We are dealing with people who have fairly substantial wealth.  If we are talking about this type of people their assets will be subject to capital acquisition tax, gift tax and capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>Situations can arise where parents may pass on substantial parts of their assets or all their assets to their sons. They could be in a considerable way in business and big employers.  The son may have to sell, through illhealth or for some other reason.  He certainly will be subject to capital acquisition tax but, if he has to sell outside the family circle, he will be subject to substantial capital gains tax. We could get a situation where it would be much better for the State for this type of property to transfer outside the family circle to a completely independent group.  In that situation it would be more beneficial to the State that the property would pass to outsiders who had good knowledge of this type of business.  We could arrive at a situation where, the person may be slow to sell because he was subject to capital acquisition tax and now, if he disposes of his property outside the family circle, he would certainly be subject to considerable capital gains tax.  This is the type of situation we would want to watch very carefully, that we do not inhibit the build-up of the economy by this type of taxation.</P>
    <P>If capital acquisition tax is effective over the £150,000 within the family circle and, the same assets could be subject to a capital gains, we may reach a situation where people will ask is it worth while generating any further wealth within the country?  It is only by building up wealth within the State that we can hope to provide a good standard of living for the people generally.  Only by building up this section of our economy can we hope to attain a proper social welfare system, an educational system and so on.</P>
    <P>We should direct our attention in this House to the creation of wealth. By the creation of wealth we will create employment.  Both here and in other countries I am afraid the attitudes are wrong.  We can see what <Col N="255" /> has happened in this country and in our neighbouring countries as a result of the same philosophy.  We must consider as regards capital acquisition and capital gains whether bigger units are more economic in manufacturing and all the rest.  Anyone in this country will only have to look at the car industry to know why cars are assembled much cheaper in England and other countries.  We know the huge plants and the automation that has developed in this industry.  I do not know if one would agree with the principle, but whether we like it or not, larger units can produce more cheaply.  That is a basic principle nobody can contradict.</P>
    <P>If our philosophy is that the State should take a substantial part of the wealth from this section of the community then the situation will evolve where everybody is a worker.  That may not cure our economic situation. I do not believe it will.  We must not try to break up big companies.  When I talk about big companies, I do not mean companies with massive shareholders, but there are companies that have substantial wealth with an organising director and a few other shareholders who control the major part of it.  We should not direct our attention towards breaking up that type of unit at all.  If we are to survive in this economic world, this is the type of company that will survive.  The three capital taxation Bills before the House would operate to the detriment of this type of company.</P>
    <P>What can anyone spend in this world?  Let him be a managing director owning £10 million.  Is not the bigger part of it reinvested for the benefit of the State, for the health of the employees, to give them a good standard of living and by and large the benefit through taxation, direct and indirect, will come back to the Exchequer to finance social welfare benefits, education and health within the State.</P>
    <P>It is on this basis that I will support Deputy Colley in this type of amendment.  There is the case I have already mentioned where a son has <Col N="256" /> acquired property from, say, his father.  He will have to pay substantial capital acquisition and gift tax and if, through no fault of his own, he is not capable of carrying it on, he will have to dispose of his asset shortly afterwards.  He will certainly be subject to capital gains tax.  This can happen.  The Minister should be very careful in the type of philosophy he is pursuing.  What we want is to expand our industrial arm.  We want also to expand our agricultural sector by more investment.  That is what we should be doing at this time when the economy is at its weakest point in the history of the State.  Penal type taxes should not be introduced at this time.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister seriously to consider Deputy Colley's amendment. I can see the Minister's point of view as regards avoidance but there is certainly a lot of substance in Deputy Colley's amendment, having regard to the sectors of people at whom the section is directed.  They may not be large in numbers but they are of vital importance to the economy, that is what matters.  They could be large employers, paying substantial taxes, naturally, on their company profits.  We should ensure that we do not discourage this type of community, that we encourage more of them into the country to invest their money to build up our industries to generate more employment.  That is what we should be at the moment. The approach has been negative here since Christmas, especially the approach to the economy.  The Bill that has been before the House certainly has not helped it in any degree. My view is shared by several other people outside the House and inside it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and provided also that whenever a disposal <i>inter vivos</i> results in a liability both to Capital Gains Tax and to Gift Tax, only such one of those taxes as imposes the higher amount of tax shall be chargeable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point the Minister made in reply was that there is no such thing as a gift tax.  May I refer to section 4 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill the <Col N="257" /> Second Stage of which has passed this House?  Section 4 says</P>
    <P>The capital acquisitions tax to be called gift tax and to be computed as hereinafter provided shall <i>et cetera</i> be charged, levied and paid.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve what this amendment seeks to achieve and to achieve what the Government set out in its White Paper that they were going to do, it was necessary for me to draft an amendment which would refer to gift tax.  The Minister, however, says there is no such thing as a gift tax because the Bill has not been passed by the House.  I can only say that if the Minister says that he is adopting the standards and techniques of a threecard-trick man, and his three cards are the Capital Gains Tax Bill, the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill and the Wealth Tax Bill and whenever it suits him he will juggle them around and say: &ldquo;It is not in that, and it is in that, and is not in the other one.&rdquo; Now, if the Minister chooses to introduce a package of taxation which, he says, is to replace death duties, and if he chooses to do it in the form of three separate Bills, it is simply not good enough, in my opinion, for him to plead in this House that we cannot have any regard to any of the other Bills.  The whole point of this amendment, and the whole point of the statement in the White Paper, was that both gift tax and capital gains would not be applied to the one transaction. That is what the Government said.  The only reason the Minister gave for departing from that provision of the White Paper was that not to do so would provide a loophole for avoidance.  It is of very considerable significance that in dealing with this amendment today the Minister did not rely on the avoidance argument at all because the amendment is so drafted as to ensure that it will not provide a loophole, that it will involve anybody who engages in a transaction that would be covered by this amendment in tax at the higher rate, and definitely at the higher rate; capital gains or gift tax, in relation to the particular transaction, that is the one that will have to be paid to the Exchequer, the one <Col N="258" /> paying the higher amount of tax.  So there is not any loophole for avoidance in this at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister then, in substitution for that argument, as advanced with great vehemence at the Committee Stage, fell back on two other arguments: firstly, that one of these taxes is payable by the donor and the other by the donee.  This, of course, is not something new.  This is something the Government had in contemplation when they issued their White Paper; they were aware of this fact and they were prepared to live with it.  There is no insuperable difficulty as far as the Minister is concerned in the fact that one tax is payable by one party and the other by another.</P>
    <P>The Minister then referred to the high thresholds in the capital acquisitions tax and, indeed, the points made in that regard by Deputy de Valera and Deputy Fitzpatrick are quite relevant.  I would, however, like to point out that in the case of transactions or gifts, even between some related persons, the thresholds provided in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill are quite low.  We are not just talking about cases where the consideration is over £150,000; we are talking about cases that are much smaller than that too.  But, in so far as we are talking about the large cases, the Minister has on a number of occasions told us about the terrible iniquity of the death duty system under Fianna Fáil whereby 55 per cent tax was payable.  He did not mention, of course, that that was in cases where the estates were valued at more than £200,000.  If the Minister were prepared to bleed so hard for cases above £200,000 it seems to me it is not open to him to talk about this benefiting only cases above £150,000.  That would not be true. This involves cases much smaller than that, even in transactions between people who are related.</P>
    <P>The real point of this amendment is one that was acknowledged by the Government in its White Paper, the inequity of applying both gift tax and capital gains tax to the one transaction. That was recognised by the Government in its White Paper and nothing <Col N="259" /> the Minister has said since has taken away from that inequity.  The only justification he has attempted to give that had any substance was that to apply this principle would give a loophole.  This amendment has been so designed as to close the loophole. I cannot see why the Minister would not accept it if he is concerned to avoid inequity.  The more one sees of the Minister's performance on a number of these matters the more one wonders whether he is really concerned with equity at all or whether he is not simply concerned to push through the measures as they have come up to him, in some case without regard to any of the consequences and, possibly, without consideration of or understanding of the consequences of what he is pushing through.</P>
    <P>In my view this is a very clear example that the Government itself is on record as recognising the inequity that would be involved in applying both taxes.  This amendment seeks to avoid that inequity and, at the same time, provides a method of closing the loophole of avoidance to which the Minister referred and provides the Exchequer with the maximum yield under whichever of the taxes is applied.  Yet the Minister refuses to accept it.  The refusal of the Minister to accept this amendment is indicative of how far he has gone even since the White Paper was produced.  He has advanced no convincing reason whatever for departing from the White Paper once the loophole of avoidance he talked about has been closed.  He has tacitly admitted it has been closed on this amendment because he did not rely on that argument today as he did before.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> All of this to me suggests that, since the publication of the White Paper, the Minister has gone very far along the road of not caring about the inequity or the consequences of what he is doing in this legislation. That is unfortunate, not only for the Minister in the longer term, but unfortunate for this country.  Sometimes there has to be inequity and one has to live with it.  This is not such a case.  The introduction of inequity into our system by the legislation we introduce is something that the Minister ought to be avoiding and, indeed, he ought to be ashamed of being responsible for introducing inequity deliberately when a method is suggested to him by which he does not have to do this and can still achieve his purposes.  However, the Minister has chosen to take that line. I have no doubt that he is wrong and, in accordance with the provisions of the Government's White Paper on Capital Taxation he is wrong also. We on this side of the House, have done our part as far as we could to close the loopholes and still avoid the inequity.</P>
    <P>The Minister refuses to accept that this should be done despite the Government's previous commitment on this specific point.  That is his business. It is he and his colleagues who will have to account for this and the consequences of the other things in which they are engaging.  We on this side of the House have done our part as far as we could.  We cannot do any more if the Minister persists in an attitude of that kind.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister have another look at this because it seems to me that the provisions of subsection (3) are far more realistic than those of subsection 1 (a)?  It might be advisable to apply the same principle to subsection (a) as is applied to subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he would certainly look at it.  He went on to say that he had just seen a spider descending from the ceiling.  I do not think that was <Col N="263" /> intended to be relevant to this subsection. This section endeavours to set the time at which there is deemed to be a disposal and acquisition of an asset.  The amendment I am moving seeks to determine that the date at which there is disposal and acquisition of an asset under a contract is the date on which any capital sum is received. Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section provides that:</P>
    <P>... under a contract, the time at which the disposal and acquisition is made is the time the contract is made, (and not, if different, the time at which the asset is conveyed or transferred) ...</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of subparagraphs (i) to (ix) of section 8 (2) (a), the time of disposal shall be the time when any capital sum is received.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that it seemed to me that provision was a far more realistic one than that in subsection (1) paragraph (a).</P>
    <P>In the case of a contract it is quite conceivable that a situation could arise in which a contract is entered into and, according to this subsection, the date the contract is made is the date on which the acquisition and disposal takes place.  Under another section of this Bill there is a provision that the capital gains tax due is assessed in respect of the financial year in respect of which the disposal and acquisition takes place.  It is not only conceivable but by no means uncommon that a contract may be made but the actual transaction may not be completed and the consideration of the capital sum involved may not be received for 18 months, two years, or more afterwards. Consequently it seems to me that this provision in subsection (1) paragraph (a) is quite unreal and quite artificial.  I can see no reason why we should have this unreal artificial provision in paragraph (a) as distinct from the realistic provision in subsection (3) which provides that the time of disposal shall be the time when the capital sum is received.  That is what really counts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> The Minister advanced some theory on Committee Stage about people entering into a contract which was unconditional and, before the completion of the contract, disposing of their rights under the contract to somebody else and thereby making a capital gain.  He seemed to imply that, by so doing, they would avoid liability for capital gains tax if, in fact, the provision were as recommended in this amendment.  If that is the Minister's contention, I think he is mistaken.  In such a case the person disposing of his interest in the contract will not actually make a capital gain until he receives the capital sum. He can have any transaction he likes on paper, on foot of contracts and disposal of his rights under contracts and sub-disposals, and so on, but, until he receives the capital sum he is not making a capital gain.  In reality it seem to me that the question of people avoiding liability in this way does not arise.</P>
    <P>There is also the factor that, under another section of the Bill, provision is made that liability for capital gains tax arises in the financial year in which the disposal occurs.  Under this provision you can have a situation where a disposal is deemed to occur on a particular date but where the capital sum, and therefore the gain, is not received for a considerable time afterwards.  It could be quite a long time.  This seems to me to be a totally artificial conception which it is not necessary to apply for the purposes of subsection (3).  But the Minister deems it essential to apply it for the purposes of subsection (1), particularly paragraph (a).  Unless the Minister can show, in a more convincing fashion than he did on Committee Stage, that this artificial concept is necessary, he should accept this amendment which is far more realistic and in line with the provisions of subsection (3).</P>

      <P>There is a very significant difference between subsection (1) and subsection (3).  It is that subsection (1) deals with both disposal and acquisitions, whereas subsection (3) deals only with disposals. <Col N="265" /> There are a number of practical problems which have to be looked at.  If the amendment were accepted it would give rise to a number of difficulties.  For instance, what would be the appropriate procedure where payment of a consideration was deliberately deferred to postpone payment of tax?  How would one fix the time, in a case where the consideration is paid by instalments?  There would also possibly, in fact almost inevitably, be conflict with the law of contract.  There could also be a conflict between vendor and purchaser as to the time of disposal.</P>

      <P>I shall come to that in a minute.  Subsection (1) (a) corresponds to the legal position under a contract&mdash;that ownership commences at the time when the contract is made or at the time fixed on account of the contract.  I am sure that, as a practitioner, Deputy Colley has advised purchasers of the risk they run in relation to property once the contract is signed; an interest is acquired from the moment of completion of contract. If the disposal were deemed to take place when the sale moneys are paid over, it could be argued that there was a conflict with the general law of contract.  One could have the situation in which a purchaser might claim that he acquired the asset at the date of the contract, while the vendor might maintain that he had not disposed of the asset until he received the sale moneys.  Clearly, the acquisition and disposal should occur at the one moment.</P>

      <P>He would have disposed of the asset.  If a person disposes of an asset, he should ensure prudently that he gets the consideration. Of course that is the invariable practice that a person does not dispose of the asset until consideration is received.  But we must guard against devices under which people would postpone receipt of consideration for tax avoidance purposes.  I would remind the House again of the essential difference between paragraph (1) (a) and subsection (3).  We deal with disposals and acquisitions in subsection (1) (a) but, in subsection (3), we are dealing with the case where moneys are received such as, say, under an insurance policy, compensation and the like, where an asset is not acquired by the person who pays the insurance or the compensation.  But we must fix the date at which the disposal takes place and, in such case, the disposal is deemed to take place on the date on which the capital sum is received.</P>

      <P>All I have got to say is that, to some extent, in the current situation&mdash;with reference to the Minister's budget yesterday&mdash;I feel we are wasting our time talking about a lot of this.  I find it very difficult. Perhaps it is a defeatist attitude, but I feel the horses are running away with us.  Whether it is taxation or social policy is behind the Minister here, we shall soon have a different pattern.  There will not be anybody in this category to be taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general standard of living of people who will not be caught by it will be well down.  We have seen it all happen before.  We will be moving to the longer wavelengths in the spectrum. We will be going down towards the longer wavelengths.  Certainly we will be leaving the violet and the blue, we will be going in the opposite direction. It is with a certain feeling of &ldquo;what is the use of talking about a lot of this now?&rdquo; that I approach it.  The Minister has done his share valiantly to shove us in this direction.  I do not think he could pull up himself now. If he cannot, we cannot.  However I suppose we might as well go through with the exercise, which is this: the Minister poses his argument on the basis that there may be tax evasion. My first question is how can there be tax evasion if it is tied to the passing of a capital sum?  It does not say the whole capital sum, any capital sum.  If the Minister has any doubt about a deposit, for that matter he could make a deposit a capital sum. There will be no capital gains until then.  That seems to me, as Deputy Colley pointed out, to be a matter of principle.  However I can see that the Minister could foresee that perhaps, for a temporary postponement, it might avoid the aggregation of tax liabilities in a particular year.  Whether that would be serious I do not know.  I can see that he may have a point there. But I will give him another point: does he think it will be beyond the ingenuity of lawyers and accountants to juggle more easily with a thing like a contract, a paper thing, than something that can be actually traced firmly <Col N="268" /> through a bank, like the passage of money?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware of what can be done with contracts?  If I was advocating the leaving of loopholes I would be inclined to accept the Minister's draft.  It would afford an interesting exercise in the law of contract and other matters because from the practical point of view what is going to matter is the passing of the sum of money.  If a man has enough interest in the matter to postpone the passing of the money, if the parties have enough interest to postpone the paying and reception of a sum of money, they have plenty of interest in avoiding making the contract at all within the concept of the contract which the Minister for the moment is so anxious to uphold.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether, from the point of view of tax avoidance or from the point of view of netting the revenue, the Minister may not be making a present to somebody in the very area that he wants to catch by the phrase he has here.  The administrative mind does not always see something, with all the experience that the Revenue Commissioners and the rest have.</P>
    <P>This is something new and it will take a long time to catch up on this whole code of taxation.  I suggest the Minister should have another look at this matter.  When the sum of money passes it is something that can be reasonably captured and is an external fact.  &ldquo;Contracts can come very near the thought of man that is untriable&rdquo;, as Coke said, &ldquo;for the devil himself knoweth them not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So much for the negative side but there is a positive element to this.  It is sometimes desirable that there will be, in a social sense, a contract.  I recollect some time ago in England there was a question of an industry closing down, indeed like we have at the moment here, thanks to the Minister, the Government and their policies, and naturally the workers in that industry wanted a rescue operation. Equally understandably, they were not able to command the resources immediately. Some persons said they were ready to come in, commercial entrepreneurs.  There was an immediate coming together of the people who were directly affected, namely the <Col N="269" /> people whose living depended on the industry.  These people were willing to take a commercial risk in the matter and to strike a bargain with the workers concerned.</P>
    <P>That was a situation which clearly demanded a contract.  It would not be a nice mutual understanding with one of these devices that can be operated between individuals that can never be caught, that is if you do not want to pass the money.  It would not have been sufficient in a case like that.  It is just such a case that this provision would block whereas, if it was on allfours with the rest of the principles in the Bill where, as Deputy Colley rightly pointed out there is a capital gains, there is no gain or loss until the money passes, where it might be much wiser to adhere to that.  In the long-term I suggest to the Minister that with these possibilities there might be a great deal more merit in Deputy Colley's amendment than he appears to appreciate.</P>
    <P>As I say, on tax avoidance, yes, I can see the Minister's and his advisers' fears.  The Minister is a lawyer and a number of us have had experience of law.  This is a taxation measure and as such will be always interpreted strictly in favour of the taxpayer.  Incidentally, when I was making the case <i>in pari materia,</i> this point was drummed into me as an excuse for suggesting that the three Bills were not <i>in pari materia.</i> I went on quietly to suggest&mdash;I think I am right&mdash;that that point may have validity from the point of view of the taxpayer but from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners it may not.  I wonder, if this is analysed carefully, if you will find&mdash;as you will find in a Bill of this kind anyway, which is really nobody's fault because it is impossible to plug every loophole in advance and to deal with it&mdash;substance in what the Minister is saying.  On the other side of the fence there may be bigger and better opportunities for doing precisely the same thing within the formula the Minister proposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to the Minister on this amendment that a capital gain is not made until you <Col N="270" /> have got the money.  I do not see how it could be otherwise.  The Minister has referred to section 10 (3), which introduces the disposal aspect.  That only relates, as the Minister said, to compensation, insurance, forfeiture and consideration and exploitation of assets.</P>
      <P>A contract can be made at a particular date and perhaps a deposit paid on it but that deposit is not a capital gain.  Capital gain cannot arise until the money has been received. In these days it is quite conceivable that there would be a considerable delay between the time a deposit is paid and the time the purchaser has managed to acquire the money to pay and the contract is completed.  Indeed, there are a couple of cases pending in court at the moment arising out of difficulties experienced by different developers. It seems to me the way it is phrased at the moment in section 10, (1) (a), that the tax on a capital gain could be payable before the money side of the transaction has been completed. That is the case for this amendment. I think it is a reasonable case.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's views on how evasion could arise because the contract is a valid document but the asset does not pass until it has been disposed of and handed over to the purchaser.  If my reading of subsection (1) (a) means that one would be liable for the capital gain before the asset has been transferred and the capital transaction wound up one could have situations where people who might not have any money at all may be called on to pay capital gains tax before they have received money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am not sure what this section means when it states that the time at which disposal and acquisition is made is the time the contract is made.  Does that mean when one puts a deposit down or when the final sum is paid?  We all know the normal transaction as regards auctions.  A deposit is paid and reading that section it looks that it is at that time the contract is made.  Perhaps I am wrong. The normal transaction to me in the <Col N="271" /> final contract is when one goes to a solicitor, pays the final amount due and signs the contract with the person selling.  That is when the final contract is made.  We all know that a considerable time can elapse from the time of purchase to the time when the final sum passes over.</P>
      <P>I have known several cases in this city where it took two to three months to make financial arrangements.  In a case recently a man practically lost his deposit by virtue of the fact that he failed to find the necessary finance. Can the Minister tell me that when the final transaction is made and the money passes to the seller that is the time that subsection (1) of this section covers?  I knew of a case within the past two years where a property was sold for £124,000.  The person purchasing the property failed to find the necessary finances; all he could manage was £100,000.</P>
      <P>The man selling that property drew up a contract that the remaining £24,000 could be paid over a threeyear period at £8,000 a year.  How would that type of situation be dealt with under this section?  Will there be a deferment of the capital gains of the £24,000 which was outstanding or will the seller be assessed on £124,000 even though he will not receive at least £8,000 of it for three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure this could happen a lot in the future where financing is difficult. I can see the Revenue Commissioners' point of view that we must try to tie up the Bill to ensure that there is no avoidance, but we must also make sure that we protect the taxpayer.  It would not take me a quarter of an hour to go to the premises concerned.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on that type of case where there was deferred payments in the contract of the £24,000 for three years at £8,000 a year.  I believe the disposal of that property should only come in for capital taxation on the £100,000 he received first, and there should be an apportionment of the capital gains on the remaining £24,000.  I believe that the final date of contract is when the final sum is <Col N="272" /> paid over not when a disposal is made. We all know that at auctions a deposit is paid and it is normally two or three months when the final transaction has passed over.  It would be unfair to bring in a capital gains at that early date.  The Minister should consider these points.</P>

      <P>The Minister is right in saying that there is provision in this Bill for payment of the capital gains tax by instalments, in certain circumstances, where the consideration is payable by instalments.  Of course, that is a good reason why he should not be advancing, as he did, the difficulties envisaged under this section if considerations were to be payable by instalments.  It is possible to cover that situation in order to determine the time at which the transaction is deemed to take place. In other words, when there is a disposal and an acquisition, and, correspondingly, to provide for payment of the tax by instalments where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that this amendment if accepted would be in conflict with the law of contract and, indeed, displayed a tender regard for the law of contract and other laws to ensure that they were not in any way breached by the provisions of this Bill.  I am sure he understood the hollowness of Deputy de Valera's laugh when he heard that one.  With due deference to the Minister, I do not think he stated the position under the law of contract fully in what he said.  He argued that under the law of contract the signing of a contract for the sale of an asset to be completed at a later date transferred the ownership in the asset.  He argued that a purchaser of premises who signs a contract is advised to insure the premises pending completion of the contract.  He is right in saying that he is so advised but the reason is that the purchaser or would-be purchaser has an interest in the property. He does not have the ownership.  The ownership, as between the vendor and the would-be purchaser, is vested in the vendor with certain rights of the <Col N="273" /> would-be purchaser until the transaction is completed; until, as the amendment says, a capital sum is received.</P>
    <P>The Minister also argued that if this amendment were to be accepted one could have the vendor saying that the disposal did not take place until he received the capital sum and the purchaser saying that the disposal took place when the contract was signed or <i>vice versa</i>.  In so far as one could have that argument at all one can have it under the section as drafted which determines one date and the amendment determines another date.  What operates is what is in the law, what the section would say.  There is no validity at all in that argument.</P>
    <P>The significant thing said on this by the Minister was that you could have people, if you accepted the amendment, deliberately postponing payment of the capital sum, presumably in order to ensure that they received it in a year in which they could claim losses against it or something like that. The Minister, in order to get over that difficulty, is prepared apparently to contemplate with equanimity the kind of situation referred to by me and by Deputy Brugha where somebody genuinely in a transaction finds himself being saddled with capital gains tax in respect of a gain which has not made and which he may not make for another year or more.  I do not know how the Minister feels such a thing justifiable.  Of course, he may argue that the Revenue Commissioners would not attempt to collect the tax in such cases, but if that is so he is saying that the Revenue Commissioners would be endeavouring to say in all such cases: &ldquo;This is a genuine transaction, this one is an attempt at avoidance.  Therefore, we will collect the tax here and we will not collect it there.&rdquo;  In order to do that they would have to know whether the man concerned was going to claim a lot of losses in that year or the next year. The whole thing is impossible.  It seems to me that the Minister has not given adequate thought to the consequences of the provisions of subsection (1) paragraph (a), which will create not only injustices but uncertainty.  What you are going to have is a situation in <Col N="274" /> which, according to this subsection, there is a determination of the time at which a disposal took place and an acquisition took place in reference to the date of the contract followed by considerable uncertainty for a long period during which it cannot be said with any confidence that, in fact, a disposal or an acquisition has taken place as evidenced by the fact that the contract could break down altogether, because of some dispute or other.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that if it breaks down the gain does not arise and, therefore, there is no question of tax being paid.  But, nevertheless, according to this subsection in a situation where ultimately the contract breaks down and no transaction takes place, there is deemed to have been a disposal and acquisition of the assets on the day the contract was made.  It seems that this concept is so artificial that it must lead to considerable difficulty. The only reason advanced for it is the one the Minister gave which by implication seems to mean that people could manoeuvre the date of receipt of the capital moneys in order to get it in a year in which they could have a smaller liability either because they had no other gains or because they had losses to set off against it. That is laudable enough as an ambition on the part of the Minister but it does not justify the creation of this totally artificial situation and, far more serious, the creation of a situation in which people are liable for capital gains tax on a gain which they have not made at all and which they may never make.  According to this, the Revenue Commissioners can, in a particular year, assess a person on capital gains tax on the basis of a contract made and charge him again even though he has not received the money. I do not think there is any justification for that kind of result coming from any efforts at anti-avoidance.  It is difficult to know how far people can succeed in trying this kind of anti-avoidance but if they did and got away with it that certainly is unsatisfactory. There is no justification for producing the kind of situation I have described where people can be made liable for capital gains tax on a gain they have not made and which ultimately <Col N="275" /> they may never make and the Revenue Commissioners may have to refund the money.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that this would not happen and that the Revenue Commissioners will only assess the tax when the money is actually received but that they will assess it in relation to the year in which they contract was made.  Even if that were to be so, and the Bill does not say it, what the Bill says is that the liability arises in relation to the acquisition and disposal which, according to this subsection, occurs on the date of the contract.</P>
    <P>If that happens in a particular financial year that is the year in which the liability for tax arises.  I do not think it is open to argue that this will not happen because this is what the Bill says will happen.  If this happens it cannot be said that the Revenue Commissioners will not do that.  If they will not do it the Bill should say what they will do.  What they should do is to have a degree of certainty by saying that when the capital sum was received that is the date on which the disposal and acquisition takes place.  We all know that is actually the date on which it happens.  That is the date which determines liability, and as regards instalments there is no great difficulty for the Minister even providing that in the event of payment by instalments &mdash;there are various possibilities but one obvious one is that the thing is deemed to take place in the year when the first instalment is paid.  There are possible variations on that theme but there is no insuperable difficulty.  Non-acceptance of this amendment will lead to uncertainty and in some cases to considerable injustice.  We have drawn the Minister's attention to this on Committee Stage and again now.  In my view he has not advanced one cogent reason for non-acceptance of this amendment.</P>

    <P>I do not know what exactly the Minister had in mind there but I took it from that that he intended to bring in some kind of amendment to deal with the situation, but he has not done so. It seemed from the discussion on Committee Stage that the Minister accepted that the words in brackets were going to create problems because this paragraph purports to determine the date on which an acquisition and disposal takes place in relation to the compulsory purchase of property.  It says that that date will mean: &ldquo;the time at which the compensation for the acquisition is agreed or otherwise determined&rdquo; variations on appeal being discharged for this purpose or if earlier, the time the authority entered on the land in pursuance of their powers.

Perhaps, if the Minister were to explain it now, it might obviate the necessity for the amendment I am putting forward.  This is dealt with in column 747 of the Official Report for 18th February.  I quote the question I asked:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> Paragraph (c) of subsection 1 deals with the situation in the event of compulsory acquisition.  Lines 19 and 20&mdash;they are of course in the earlier version of the Bill&mdash;carry the words in brackets, &ldquo;variations on appeal being disregarded for this purpose&rdquo;.  I want the Minister to clarify whether this subparagraph determines only the time of disposal. If there were variations on appeal in the amount of the compensation would these be taken into account in computing the gain or loss or, since the date of disposal is the date on which the compensation is agreed, and disregarding subsequent variations, is the gain based on the figure originally agreed?</P>
    <P>In other words, if this is determining the date on which the disposal takes place and doing nothing else, one could understand the position, but does it follow from the words in brackets that if the disposal is deemed to take place on a date when the compensation is determined and then subsequently on appeal that figure for compensation is altered, does that altered figure affect the amount of the capital gains tax assessed and if it does is it deemed to happen on one day but the capital gains tax is to be assessed in relation to a figure fixed on another day?</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm an order which was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  The order was made on the recommendation of the Restrictive Practices Commission which was contained in their report of a special review carried out into the supply and distribution of motor spirits.  The report and order were presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas on 18th June, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> A public inquiry was held by the Restrictive Practices Commission into the supply and distribution of motor spirit in 1970.  The inquiry was held at the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce following representations made to him by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry that the growth in the number of motor spirit retail outlets should be curbed.</P>
    <P>In the report of the inquiry the Restrictive Practices Commission said that the number of company-owned outlets had been increasing unduly and the percentage of total sales of motor spirit through these outlets had increased substantially.  The commission felt that if this trend was to continue unchecked the petrol companies would gain substantial control over retail distribution.  Such control would be likely to reduce competition, facilitate restrictive practices such as market sharing and price fixing, and extend the economic power of the multi-national oil companies.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that petrol companies should not open any new company-owned retail outlets for a period of three years.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce accepted the recommendation of the Restrictive Practices Commission and on the 15th June, 1972 made the Restrictive Trade Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1972. Article 3 of that order prohibits oil companies from opening new company-owned petrol stations for three years ending on the 18th July, 1975. However, there were three exceptions to the prohibition.  The first exception was a transitional one applied to certain retail stations which were under construction when the 1972 order was made.  The other two allowed a company-owned retail outlet to be opened within a mile of one which had closed down (a) because of compulsory purchase by a local authority or (b) because of loss of trade, due to road diversion.  The Minister undertook at the time to ask the Restrictive Practices Commission to review the operation of the prohibition before it expired on the completion of its three year period of application.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> The Restrictive Practices Commission carried out the review last March. The review took the form of a series of private hearings which were attended by representatives of seven oil companies, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and the Irish Petrol Retailers' Association.  The report of this review now shows that the order had been reasonably effective.  Although the number of independent outlets continued to decrease in 1974, the number of company-owned outlets which had previously been increasing also decreased.  In addition, while sales by independents continued to increase, sales through company-owned outlets, which had increased fairly substantially in previous years, fell in 1974. The commission are satisfied, therefore, that the prohibition is curbing the growth in the number of company-owned stations and in the oil companies' share of retail sales.  The commission recognises that the present state of uncertainty in the oil industry makes it unlikely that the oil companies would try to increase the number of company-owned outlets even if the prohibition were lifted.  But they feel that this position would not hold good in the event of a return to normal conditions in the oil industry. They consider, therefore, that the prohibition should be extended for a further period.</P>
    <P>The oil companies, quite naturally, would not welcome any continuation of the prohibition, but in the present state of the industry they would not be opposed to an extension for a further two years.  The petrol retailers, also quite naturally, wanted an extension for as long as possible.  The commission felt that the extension should be for a period of three years and they recommended accordingly.</P>
    <P>The report also states that a number of oil companies were critical of the &ldquo;one mile limit&rdquo; for the replacement of company-owned stations which were closed in circumstances defined in the original order.  They suggested that the limit should be increased or removed altogether.  The commission pointed out that the purpose of the exceptions was to facilitate <Col N="280" /> a company to retain the business it had in a particular area which it could lose because of traffic diversion resulting from the construction of a new road near its existing outlet or because of the compulsory acquisition of its existing outlet by a local authority. They felt if there was no limit the exceptions might be abused, but bearing in mind the difficulty of acquiring sites within a mile radius and of obtaining planning permission they considered that it would be reasonable to extend the limit from one to three miles and they recommended accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Minister in making the order gives effect to the commission's recommendations relating both to the extension of the period of prohibition and the &ldquo;mile limit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The commission pointed out in their report that during the hearings witnesses raised matters which had an indirect bearing on the operation of the 1972 order.  These included the effect of increasing costs, petrol outlets in new suburbs or satellite towns, the effect of various types of agreements and the significance of promotional schemes and hours of trading. The terms of reference of the review precluded the commission from investigating these matters in detail, but they recognise that they have a bearing on the operation of the order and they consider that they warrant more extensive investigation. They recommended that they should review these matters before the new extended period of prohibition expires, and the Minister has accepted this recommendation.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the prohibition on the opening of new company-owned outlets could preclude new retail chains from opening up for business in Ireland in competition with the major oil companies which are already dominant in the market.  I accept that the continuation of the prohibition could have the effect of preventing the entry of a new competitor to the market, but I would point out that the Minister has the power to revoke or amend the order and would be prepared to do this at any time that it appeared desirable in <Col N="281" /> the interests of promoting competition.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, provides that orders of this kind shall not have effect unless they are confirmed by Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the Dáil is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the order concerned. With a Bill of this kind the order which it is proposed to confirm may not be amended by the Oireachtas but must be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters with which the order deals have been the subject of a detailed special review by the Restrictive Practices Commission and their report, which was presented to this House, sets out the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the order.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In general we support this Bill continuing the order made three years ago while I was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is a little unfortunate, however, that circumstances are such that the order cannot be amended but must be accepted <i>in toto</i>.  As I see it, there is overall necessity for the continuation of this order from the point of view of prohibition.  I have reservations in connection with the extension of the restriction from the one mile originally imposed to three miles.  I have to confess that I am not <i>au fait</i> with the latest report from the Restrictive Practices Commission in this regard.  I had a copy of the order circulated to me.  Maybe I had a copy of the commission's report, but it seems to have escaped my attention. I had intended referring to subsection (2) of section 8 of the Restrictive Practices Act, which is quoted in the order, and which lays down specifically that the amendment of this order can be made by the Minister, having considered the report of the commission and after consultation with any other Minister concerned. It now appears that the Parliamentary Secretary has covered in his opening statement a matter to which I intended to refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to confirm an order made by me as Minister <Col N="282" /> for Industry and Commerce, an order subject to review at the end of the three-year period.  I, as Minister at the time, undertook to ask the Restrictive Practices Commission to review the operation of the order before the three-year period expired.  I am not surprised at the outcome of that review. I am fully in agreement with the purpose of this order.</P>
    <P>One of the problems we have, and I think it is no harm to spell it out at this stage, is the abuse of privilege by a number of companies which have been allowed to put up their own company stations.  If there are difficulties they are not related to the various oil companies not being, able to have a sufficiency of their own controlled outlets, and what prompted me to make the order three years ago was the fact that companies were abusing the privilege they had.  This was the view also of the Restrictive Practices Commission at the time.</P>
    <P>We have the situation where there is consistent bullying by the petrol companies of the operators or managers who handle their various outlets. The initial introduction of a manager to an outlet is always very pleasant; the man who takes up the appointment as manager of a company-owned outlet has the impression that he will get a good livelihood out of it, and he will naturally try and sell as much petrol as he can.  But the demands for sales keep increasing and the sales pressure of the company very often makes it impossible for him to continue to operate.  I have heard many complaints about that, both as Minister for Industry and Commerce and subsequently as Deputy, and I would like to be able to find or recommend to the Minister some formula whereby this prohibition order could be extended so that only private or individual filling stations could be erected anywhere.  The case made was as to who would provide in isolated areas petrol stations to cater for the growing population needing these facilities.  There is nothing to stop any young entrepreneur from going ahead, getting the rights from a petrol company and erecting his own station.</P>
    <P>I am wondering how genuine the figures quoted by the Parliamentary <Col N="283" /> Secretary are in regard to sales.  He said that the Restrictive Practices Commission Report of the review shows the order to have been reasonably effective.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Although the number of independent outlets continued to decrease in 1974, the number of company-owned outlets which had previously been increasing also decreased. In addition, while sales by independents continued to increase, sales through company-owned outlets, which had increased fairly substantially in previous years, fell in 1974.  The Commission are satisfied, therefore, that the prohibition is curbing the growth in the number of company-owned stations and in the oil companies' share of retail sales.</P>
    <P>That aspect appeals to me.  I am extremely pleased to learn that during last year, when there was a difficulty in procuring petrol, and being mindful of the fact that even during times of scarcity companies channelled most of their supplies into company-owned stations, the fact remains that the sales by company-owned stations fell during 1974.  I am afraid there is a peculiar reason for that.  It was not necessary for the big companies, because of the scarcity of petrol, to offer their famous Green Shield stamps.  Now, in 1975, we have them again building up pressure on the individual manager to try to achieve certain targets, now that petrol has become available again.  I think the figures will change in 1975.  I know there is this undue pressure to achieve targets by companies in regard to their company-owned stations and, in the achieving of targets, the managers are forced to use trading stamps.</P>
    <P>I was interested to note the Parliamentary Secretary say that during the hearing a number of witnesses had raised matters which had an indirect bearing on the operation of the 1972 order.  I am at a disadvantage because I have not read this report.  He said that the matters raised included the effects of increasing costs, petrol outlets in new suburbs or satellite towns and the effect of various types of <Col N="284" /> agreements and the significance of promotional schemes and hours of trading.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the promotional schemes, because I feel that the sooner the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;who unfortunately is not handling this, he has been doing it through his Parliamentary Secretary &mdash;introduces the regulations he has threatened to deal with trading stamps the better.</P>
    <P>I put it on the record before and I do not mind putting it on the record again, that it was always my intention to outlaw trading stamps but we cannot get the present Minister to commit himself to that.  I am waiting for the legislative measures to see what way it could be improved, to try to go as far as we can towards the outlawing of those stamps.  I have no doubt that it must have figured in the contributions of witnesses at the hearing to which the report referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the Restrictive Practices Commission recommended that they should review these matters before the next extended period of prohibition expired and the Minister has accepted this recommendation. I am for this.  I hope this review takes place as soon as possible. It should not be left over until the end of the extended period.</P>
    <P>I have a clear recollection of sponsoring this Restrictive Practices Bill through this House three years ago when my opposite number at that time, Deputy Donegan, said quite clearly and categorically that he fully accepted and supported the measure. His only fear, which I shared, was that some companies were rushing to beat the order.  There was the problem that while the order is made it is not law until the Bill is passed.  I made the order, I think, on the 15th June. The Bill had not gone to the Seanad by the 15th July, but it did very shortly after that.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling, and so do other Deputies on this side of the House, that there was a rush to beat the order.  Deputy Donegan spoke about this in relation to a couple of incidents. That order, technically, would have expired on the 14th June this <Col N="285" /> year.  I will be asking the Parliamentary Secretary on Committee Stage to try to clear up some little detailed points for me because as Minister I found myself in difficulties in this regard exactly three years ago.</P>
    <P>This order was made on the 17th June by date three years and two days later than the previous order.  We now have the Confirmation Bill.  I wonder if the Minister for Industry and Commerce is leaving it too late to make this continuance order, or has he opened an escape hatch for some of the companies in this regard? Two or three days a week or a month is hardly sufficient time to allow something to be slipped across the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I remember giving an assurance in this House to Deputy Donegan, and Deputy Esmonde (Senior), that companies which had not, within a month of my making the order on the 15th June&mdash;and that month was considered to expire on the 13th July&mdash;their petrol station finished to ground level could not go ahead.  I made that statement in this House, fully believing that it was correct.  I am not too sure of this now and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to clear it up for me.  My understanding was that certain stations finished and were given permission for finishing subsequent to that date.  I want to say categorically, that as the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, if it did happen, it was without any consultation with me.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points which have been referred to, specifically the extension from one to three miles. The Parliamentary Secretary says that the commission report stated that a number of oil companies were critical of the one mile limit for the replacement of company-owned stations which were closed in circumstances defined in the original order.  The companies asked for an extended limit, I presume with a view to being able to erect a replacement station anywhere for the one that was being closed or taken over by a local authority.</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong to specifically oppose the Bill on the basis of this extension.  We have no intention <Col N="286" /> of doing that.  In my view, petrol companies have not been placed at any serious disadvantage in relation to the by-passing of roads or to the local authority taking over or closing a road.  The one mile limit is sufficient for them to find an alternative.  It should not have been necessary to make the amendment.  Even if the Restrictive Practices Commission recommended it, the Minister need not have made the necessary amendment and built it into the order.</P>
    <P>This is the type of Bill where niggling things can be teased out easier at Committee Stage.  I will have other observations to make at Committee Stage.  Naturally we favour the measure but I would prefer if the restrictions built into the original order three years ago had been maintained. I disagree with the extension from one mile to three miles, but in view of the fact that there is not legally any way in which an amendment can be made to the order, we are in favour of the continuation of this order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to commend the Minister for extending the scope of this order for a further three years and also to commend the previous speaker who in his capacity as Minister at that time, found it necessary to introduce this order.  Normally speaking, I might not become aware of an order such as this, because I have very little to do with petrol sales and distribution other than to buy it, but I became very conscious of it, from a specific case within my own area which I hope to mention.  I would like to commend both the Minister and the ex-Minister for this and feel that there is a need for it.  The reasons that prompted the previous Minister to introduce legislation like this still hold good today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the need might not now be as great, the proliferation of new petrol outlets is unlikely with the climate in the motor industry and in the oil situation today.  It is necessary to ensure that these matters will be tightened up and that there will be no danger that multi-national oil companies will take advantage of any let up on our part here and have a <Col N="287" /> monopoly of oil distribution.  I realise that the Minister has been in consultation with the Irish motor industry and I am informed that they have given him a very comprehensive report and that he has acted on it.</P>
    <P>The need for this order is to prevent a few oil companies operating in Ireland from reaching a situation where they can, by putting on different types of pressure which they have at their disposal, oust ordinary people from distribution and monopolise it. In many ways at the moment we have a monopoly in the grocery trade, and while this may be good and while some of the benefits of cut-prices may be passed on to the consumer, I feel confident that the few firms involved in the oil trade would be much more likely to meet one another's wishes rather than to endeavour to under cut one another and in that way provide keener prices for the consumer.</P>
    <P>There were three exceptions to the Prohibition Order of 18th June, 1975. The Minister said: &ldquo;The first exception was a transitional one applying to certain retail stations which were under construction when the 1972 order was made.&rdquo;  The particular station I had in mind which was under construction at that time&mdash; there were only two of them in Ireland; the Minister for Defence will be aware of the other&mdash;was a station in Droichead Nua which had originally been refused planning permission by the county council.  It was appealed to the Minister and refused.  There were 35 objectors in the locality.  A subsequent quietly inserted application to the county council was passed and permission was granted for this station on a new road near a very dangerous junction as you leave Droichead Nua. This station was not completed at the deadline date.  I visited the site at that date and I am aware that photographic evidence exists to show that it was not completed to ground level. This was forwarded to the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I believe that if sewers had not been filled and completely laid, and if the ground level had not been brought up <Col N="288" /> to the level of the pumps, and if the area had not been &ldquo;tarmaced&rdquo;, that site would not have been completed to ground level.  Even though a rush had been made to meet the deadline, the deadline had not been met.  This outlet was not completed in time and lay there for quite a long time in an unfinished state.  Eventually, not long ago, it opened up under a private name.  I wish to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he has within the Department machinery to prevent some front man from acting on a company's behalf.  This can be done and may well have been done in this case.</P>
    <P>I hope the extension of this order will ensure that people will not be allowed to act in this manner.  It could well be that this man is genuine. It could well be proved that he is only a front man for the company. It was noticed by other suppliers in the area that, during the time of the petrol shortage, this man had plenty of petrol for all and sundry and did not abide by the hours other petrol suppliers decided on in the hope that they would meet the requirements of the area, and try not to disappoint their customers.  He played a lone hand.  Possibly he reaped the fruit of that by gaining more customers later on.  Two petrol filling stations within 200 yards of this station have since closed down and this one is flourishing.</P>
    <P>Sales by independent outlets have continued to increase and company-owned outlets' sales have decreased during 1974.  That was the purpose of the order and I am glad to see it accomplished its purpose.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would assure us that the open hatch referred to by Deputy Lalor by allowing this order to run for three years and two days will not allow people to take advantage of this and to open up outlets in contravention of our wishes.</P>
    <P>It is most unlikely, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, that there will be a big rush towards opening up new outlets for retail sales at the moment.  We realise that the motor trade in many areas is bad and we hope it will soon pick up.  That would be no reason for opening the door <Col N="289" /> for anyone, by not extending this period.  The reason for the order is that individual Irish people engaged in this trade are protected.  Protection is needed very badly against the multi-national oil companies.  I feel dubious about the extension of the one-mile limit to three miles.  It has been suggested that the limit should be increased or removed altogether.  The final decision the Parliamentary Secretary has presented us with here is that the one-mile limit should be extended to three.  It is regrettable that we are now faced with something on a take it or leave it basis, that if we do not accept the order, we cannot have it changed.  I understand that is the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity because I would have liked to discuss that at more length.  We cannot have a change now.  I realise that if a road is being changed or realigned a person who has an outlet at a geographically convenient place may find himself cut off and placed at a distinct disadvantage. If you confine it to within a mile of that you are bringing the sites down to a very small number.  Possibly those who are approached in an effort to procure a site would up their prices accordingly.  Maybe three miles would give a little more room to manoeuvre. I am not too keen on extending it because we have guidelines laid down already by the Minister for Local Government as to where petrol stations should be sited.  It is generally accepted that they cannot be sited on the open road and that they should be sited on the outskirts of towns within a 30-mile limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must bear in mind also that, in Ireland, we have more outlets for petrol per mile and per head of population than do other European countries.  Like Deputy Lalor I feel that we could well have stated the limit and let those who have to seek renewal provide alternative stations and site themselves within that limit.  I wonder what would have been the position had this matter been raised and witnesses given evidence to this effect in new suburbs or satellite towns.  I have become aware, particularly <Col N="290" /> in a town like Leixlip which has mushroomed in a few years, that the amount of outlets available there are not capable of dealing with the demand at all.  Many motorists in Leixlip have to go elsewhere.  Is there room for a new outlet&mdash;not a company owned one?  This does not affect a new supplier in a private capacity, of which I am glad, so my worries are eliminated in that respect.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that the order could have a counter effect to what was intended; that this order, when it would deter existing oil companies from providing further outlets, might also discourage the setting up of new retail chains here.  They would be welcomed into the club, provided they provided competition.  The Minister has taken the correct attitude, that the greater good is what will weigh. I feel that the greater good is the making of this order.  Again, I regret that we must accept it <i>in toto,</i> that it cannot be changed but I suppose that is the nature of orders.</P>
    <P>I should like confirmation from the Parliamentary Secretary that he has the power, within his Department, to ensure that when companies find themselves in a position that they cannot extend, they will not be able to use an agent or front-man to do their dirty work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to offer some remarks on this matter and point out that page 5 of the Minister's brief inhibits one somewhat when one reads with a Bill of this kind that the order which it is proposed to concern may not be amended by the Oireachtas.  It must be accepted or rejected.</P>
      <P>While that may have been all right say three years ago regarding an order of this type the whole petrol supply scene has changed since then. I feel that the time is opportune for the Government to review the whole matter of distribution of petrol and oils.  We realise, from the past year or so, how vital is the distribution of petrol to our people, never more so than during a recent strike when one had to traipse the city looking for petrol, when we saw also how vital services were affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> That is just one aspect of the whole chain of events which we must ensure are safeguarded so that petrol supplies to people who need them will not be restricted in any way. Therefore, we must acknowledge generously that the system under which petrol stations are granted permission is the best.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power mentioned one point which I regard as very serious indeed: are we sure that we have the proper machinery to ensure that the provisions of this order are being implemented?  One does not need much imagination to see that it would be quite easy for people to get round this order.  When Daniel O'Connell said he could drive a coach-and-four through any statute, it would be very easy today for a person to drive a very large limousine through this Order.  The Government must review the whole matter, firstly, to acertain if the system we have at present is the best for ensuring the most equitable distribution of petrol to the people who need it; secondly, have we the machinery to ensure that even this order, if found to be defective, could be amended, in view of recent happenings in the oil world; thirdly, what happens when we extract oil from our own seas?</P>
    <P>Supposing the company developing oil resources wants to set up new stations, can they do so, or are they restricted under this order?  The Government might have foreseen that happening. Very shortly we hope we will be extracting from our own seas oil, gas and so on.  Therefore, a new picture emerges here and we shall have to make provision for the new companies which will be formed.  One could foresee great competition, even prejudice, against the new oil from our seas, that some old-established people might resent such new competition. There is a whole new phase here.  The Government should review this matter very shortly and make provision for the sale of native petrol, if I may call it such, that is, petrol taken from our seas.  As far as I can see it would not be covered under this order.  There might well be refusal of <Col N="292" /> a licence to a new oil company to set up filling stations because they did not exist when the order was first passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might well convey to the Government Members' anxiety on the up-dating of legislation regarding the distribution and sale of petrol, and make special provisions for their sale and distribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a few brief remarks on this order.  I regret it is an order which cannot be amended.  I welcome it.  I support the case made by Deputy Moore about a complete new look, in view of the fact that we have oil off our shores and other companies may come along.  A new look is needed at the whole question of distribution of oil.  It is important also to curtail oil companies' activities as far as the setting up of stations in competition with private people who have been in the petrol business for a long time is concerned.  During the petrol scarcity I had occasion at least twice to go to the Minister with regard to companies refusing to supply the quota they should have been giving to private people with their own pumps.  The only way you could get petrol was at the stations which were owned by the petrol companies. We know they supplied in some cases double the amount of petrol which they usually gave out.  Therefore, it has been proved, beyond doubt, that if they were giving the required quotas to the people who had the private pumps they could not have all this petrol.  The queues were nearly half-a-mile long outside all their stations. It was felt that these companies were supplying the petrol to their own stations at the expense of the people who owned private pumps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were also companies during the past few years who warned people with smaller tanks they would not supply them.  I would like the Order to ensure that in the case of people who are in the business and provide a good service, even though their tanks may not be all that large, the companies will continue to supply them.  This is of vital importance.  If the multi-national oil companies <Col N="293" /> are allowed to take over the distribution of petrol in the country and set up petrol stations everywhere, it will be to the detriment of the people who have been in the business.</P>
    <P>I had complaints during the petrol crisis that the private individual did not get a fair deal.  This was proved beyond yea or nay.  I hope the order will ensure that nothing like this will happen again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore is right about a new look.  In the past we had no hope of any oil being found off our shores. Let us hope there is, and that new companies will be formed and that this will not be a closed shop.  This order is very necessary and I welcome it.  I hope that if a crisis occurs again that under this order people in the business outside of the companies will get a fair deal, which I believe they did not get the last time.</P>

      <P>Tá beagán le rá agam i dtaobh an Bhille seo.  I wish to pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor in office for seeking the extension of the 1972 order.  It is significant that since his departure no further step forward has been made in this direction.  While I welcome the extension of this order as achieving something in relation to the retail petrol situation I cannot be convinced of the reasons why the limit is being extended from one mile to three.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will spell out in detail why this is necessary.  I do not see the need for it.  If it were open to us to do so I would propose an amendment to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many problems facing the people that we should have primary concern for.  These are the independent retailers.  Whether we have a Restrictive Practices Order or a prevention of restrictive practices or whatever we might term it, no matter how many of these we have, these independent outlets are, to a large extent, in the hands of the multi-national oil companies.  There are schemes which will cost them a certain amount of money, schemes they are compelled to involve themselves in.  They are for the most part independents <Col N="294" /> who are trying to earn a livelihood with one or two employees or maybe family operations.  Some more of them are combined with grocery shops, spirit stores and so on. These people, whether or not they like it, whether or not it is economically advisable for them to do so, are compelled by the companies&mdash;if they refuse to comply there are many means that can be used to get them to do so&mdash;to toe the line to the companies' needs.</P>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary why no further legislation or orders have been introduced in regard to trading stamps?  In my opinion the franchise of the trading stamps is being operated in a discriminating way, certainly one that needs closer examination.  I understood the Minister for Industry and Commerce promised the introduction of legislation to effectively control the abuses that are being perpetuated by what I would describe as discriminating practices in the issue of trading stamps.  Trading stamps are desirable from a public point of view.  They are very desirable in many fields.  In many country towns there is a company-owned outlet in a position to avail of these trading stamps at expense to himself admittedly, but normally to the detriment of his competitor who, because of the franchise system as it works, cannot, even if he so wishes, get those trading stamps. There are controls that the companies have been imposing on the independent outlets regarding trading hours. It is significant that in the May issue of the National Prices Commission this whole subject was gone into in great detail.  The most significant point made on it was that retail sales for petrol were expected to be the same for 1975 as they had been for 1974. This means that it is a business that is stagnant.  I ask why?  At the entrance to Cork city there are three stations within a few hundred yards of each other, all company owned, and I notice another one being erected, again company owned.  That is four within a few hundred yards. How does that station come within the scope of the present restrictions?</P>

      <P>The hours of opening of that service which is being provided by the independents is another important matter. It is the livelihood of these people. They are trying to cater for their own local areas, whether they be urban or rural, in a reasonable sort of way.  The companies demanded that they stay open for longer hours. They kept their own stations open for longer hours, thus imposing additional hardships on them.  According to the National Prices Commission Report No. 39, April, 1975, the table on page 123, shows that there are 106 wholesale stations with a company manager in them.  There are 387 with tenants, that is a total of approximately 490 stations.  They are catering for 35 per cent of the nation's business.  They are only 11 per cent of the total number of stations.  On the other hand, there are 89 per cent owned by independents, 3,841 catering for 65 per cent. Obviously, the cream of this business is that operated through the wholesaler or through their tenants.  The independents in various areas by location, by size of enterprise, by effort made are catering for a far less throughout on an individual or an average basis within their own outlets. This is why the independents deserve to be looked after to a greater extent.  The Parliamentary Secretary and his Department are not taking steps fast enough.  They are merely doing what was done by Deputy Lalor in 1972 and the need was there then.  The reason why so many independent outlets closed in 1974 is an economic one.  If we accept the situation I have outlined, that there is no increase this year, we will have a similar situation arising.  I would go further and say that the multi-national companies need to be protected against themselves, but certainly against the measures they can take against the independents because <Col N="296" /> they are completely in their hands.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the three-mile extension has been given instead of the one mile.  If we are to endeavour to give a decent livelihood to these independents and make it worth their while to provide the service they are providing for the community more stringent measures should be taken to ensure this.  We have had a recent merger or take-over by one of the multi-nationals in the Cork area and as a result a distribution company was deprived of its supplies by the new multi-national company taking over. Ten or 12 jobs were put in jeopardy and would still be in jeopardy but for the actions of the parent company to that distribution company, even at a loss, to keep the operation going.</P>
      <P>There are implications behind what I am saying, and I cannot spell them out as clearly in the House as I would like to, but I would be critical of the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary if they could not ensure control in those situations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>For Deputy Esmonde's information the details are with the Department of Industry and Commerce.  There was a promise before the take-over or the merger that supplies would be maintained but this was not done for other reasons. Admittedly, it was a hit-back by the multi-nationals.  I am trying to point out the power that these people can and will wield in order to achieve a hit-back at a company who may be doing them harm in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> We must accept that it is one of the problems we have with our multi-national companies.  It is working against competitiveness.  I have had a lot of experience in dealing, from that side of the fence with oil companies. I can tell the House that if one had a worth-while contract for substantial gallonage there is no fear of the price one has from that company being beaten by any other company.</P>
    <P>If we take it that 89 per cent of the independents, or 3,841 stations, are depending on 65 per cent of the petrol sold, it points to these people having difficulties.  In my opinion the oil companies are trying to expand and control as much as they can of the retail outlets as well.  The Minister, and his Parliamentary Secretary, have an obligation not only to extend what was introduced by Deputy Lalor in 1972 but to go further to control the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the welcome given to this legislation.  As expected, it is not a partisan measure and it was treated as such.  To put the matter in perspective, in 1973, 86 million gallons of petrol were distributed through company-owned stations, and in 1974 that was down to 81 million gallons, roughly&mdash;I am quoting from the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission. The equivalent figures for independent dealers is 140 million gallons in 1973, and 147 million gallons in 1974.  There has been a concrete rise in the dealer distribution and a decline in company-owned station distribution volume.  I can assure the House that the examiner of restrictive practices will keep a careful eye on the developments over the coming year or so.  It would seem that the trend disclosed there is being reversed. Action can be taken at any time and the figures will be available to substantiate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Lalor, Fitzgerald and others referred to the extension of the permission to replace company-owned stations within a three-mile limit of a station which was closed due to compulsory acquisition or road <Col N="298" /> widening.  I should like to stress that it is necessary for that station to be closed before this allowance comes into being.  It is not a question of allowing them another station within three miles of the existing station. The other station must be closed before that can happen.  Deputies will realise that the strictures of the planning laws in relation to petrol stations can be such which require certain matters in relation to visibility on either side from a road point of view. It might not be possible for a company to obtain a suitable site within the strict mile of where the other station was closed, particularly if the other station was closed by virtue of certain road-widening arrangements. Therefore, it is equitable to allow this change to the three-mile limit. The three-mile limit was recommended to me by the Restrictive Practices Commission; it was not an issue of the Minister.  Needless to say the operation of a three-mile limit as against the one-mile limit will fall within the ambit of the review of the new order which will take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that in fact this could accommodate the type of thing I mentioned about Cork, of a fourth company station&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be coming to a Committee Stage discussion, and perhaps the Deputy would like to put a question to me then.  If the Deputy gives me the precise details of this fourth company-owned station he referred to I will have it investigated.</P>
      <P>It is always open to people who have a fear about the application of this order to refer it either to me or direct to the examiner for restrictive practices who will have the matter investigated very quickly.  We have an efficient system in this respect which I think we all can be pleased with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Power raised the question of front men operating in such a way as to allow separate company-owned control of the station while technically complying with the provisions of the order.  I would refer him, in this respect, to article 4 of the existing order which defines this question very precisely and I think he will find that the <Col N="299" /> definition there is very comprehensive and should cover most situations.  It is the words on the paper which constitute the law of the land and stand to be interpreted by the courts.  I could read the definition but I think it would be so long and laborious that it would be unnecessary but if the Deputy is unhappy with the wording of the order in any respect I will gladly look at it again.</P>
    <P>Deputies Lalor and Power raised the question of the treatment of managers of company-owned stations by the companies themselves.  This does not come within the terms of this order.  But this general question is being examined very actively in the Department at present and if it appears appropriate I can ask the examiner of restrictive practices to look into the matter.  I think Deputy Power is satisfied with the situation in the sense that an independent retailer could open up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor asked that the review of the operation of this order which encompassed matters other than the strict question of company-owned stations, such as the effective increase in cost, petrol outlets, the effect of various types of agreements and the significance of promotional schemes and hours of trading should take place right away.  I am well disposed towards that suggestion and I will see if it is possible to have the Restrictive Practices Commission look at those matters rather sooner than the final date before the expiry of the order now being approved by the House.</P>
    <P>In relation to trading stamps Deputies are aware it has been decided to introduce secondary legislation to control this practice in the advent of consumer protection legislation.  I think we in the House will have an opportunity of debating that matter therefore in greater detail on another occasion.</P>

However, I would say that while the interests of independent retailers are of great importance in themselves and also of great benefit to the consumer because they ensure competition between independent retailers and company-owned directors, in the final analysis there is, of course, the interests of the consumer which must be paramount and the House in general must look at that aspect of the matter as well to ensure that any constraints introduced which may be justified should not in any way deleteriously affect the interests of the petrol consumer.  This, of course, is a consideration which I will have to take into account in dealing with representations which may be made to me.  I thank the House for the generous welcome which they have given to the first Bill which I have had the pleasure of introducing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in his reply to the discussion gave us the details of the sales by company stations on the one hand showing a drop of 7,000,000 gallons in sales from 1973 to 1974 and a corresponding increase of roughly 7,000,000 gallons by the independents. It would appear that sales of petrol in 1973 and 1974 were exactly the same.  The independents sold 7,000,000 gallons more, the company stations sold 7,000,000 gallons less.  He did say that the examiner of restrictive practices was keeping a close eye on this trend and if there was any reversal of the figure the examiner would take action.  I wonder what sort of action the examiner can take if there is a reversal because we have the situation as far as I can see that we are making an order for a three-year period. I take it from our discussion that for this particular part of Industry and Commerce the Parliamentary Secretary is operating the delegated powers here.  I cannot understand what sort of positive action the examiner or the Parliamentary Secretary can take if there is a reversal of that position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just wondering what was at the back of that statement. In the very same way the Parliamentary Secretary said that if things were not working out he would look at the order again if necessary.  The order <Col N="302" /> will be applicable for three years.  I accept that being so.  He does build in that if a new competition were to develop, if a new company arrived, he would look at that new situation.  That is a problem which I had to contend with three years ago because the same possibility was stressed at that stage that some new person could come in. Despite that, I felt at the time that it was a good thing to make the order on the recommendation of the Restrictive Practices Commission and I have no reason to believe that the Restrictive Practices Commission are not right in this instance.</P>
      <P>I have not had the opportunity in the short time since we started of looking through the recommendations of the Restrictive Practices Commission.  I cannot see why there should be this insistence upon the extension of three miles.  We will let that go because it is in the order but the Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to a query by Deputy Power, made reference to article 5.</P>
      <P>It is not referred to in his speech &mdash;naturally.  There is no amendment to it.  It is article 5 of the principal order.  I placed a lot of reliance on article 5 and hoped at the time to use article 5 to deal with the type of complaints that were flooding in from the people I spoke about on Second Stage&mdash;the managers or company owners, the people who were running company-owned stations. Deputy Fitzgerald referred to figures and the falling off in the number of independents.  Economically they are being pushed out solely because of the failure to achieve a certain turnover of petrol.  There is no doubt that we have the situation whereby a number of the companies have refused orders to the old one-man filling stations that could accommodate only 1,000 gallons of petrol. Those people are being squeezed out. I had hoped at the time of making that order to be able to look at those complaints as against article 5 of the order.  There should be no differentiation in the treatment given to one dealer as against another.  We had the agreement and the question of the tie-in and the arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> Deputy Callanan spoke about peculiarities that existed at the time when petrol was short and the conclusion&mdash; and certainly it was a logical one&mdash; that the station most likely to have petrol at that time was the company-owned station.  I am just wondering if article 5 of the order was specifically adhered to and whether the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department have any way of ensuring that this is so.</P>
    <P>In article 3 of the new order of 17th June, 1975, he substitutes six miles for three miles in paragraph (1) of the original order and substitutes three miles for one mile in paragraph (3) (b) of article 3 and substitutes three miles for one mile in paragraph (4) (c) Peculiarly enough, in the table there is a further amendment and I cannot understand why the amendment covered in (d) of the table was not incorporated in the amendment in paragraph 3.  I know I am being ambiguous in the way I am presenting it.  If we could tease it out I would be very pleased.  There is a change of three miles in the table that is not included in paragraph 3 of the order and I cannot understand the reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not make any comment on the representations I made in regard to private petrol stations having small tanks.  There is a bias towards regular customers.  Like myself, motorists tend to call at stations where they are accustomed to getting their supply.  If companies want to bring custom to their own station&mdash;there may be a slowness in delivery to other stations.  Will this order ensure that people will not have to be telephoning for deliveries and be out of petrol often?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that complaints have been made and that people with small tanks are out of petrol and so are the ordinary road users.  A motorist might want to give custom to a man but if he has not <Col N="304" /> got petrol at all times and if the company owned station has it, obviously it will get the custom.  They have power to change the trend which the Parliamentary Secretary has referred to by using discretion about the distribution of petrol.  If the small station has not got petrol at all times the customers will cease to call.</P>

      <P>It would appear to me, even by what the Parliamentary Secretary said, that developments have taken place in petrol sales and petrol sales outlets since 1972, when this order was first introduced by Deputy Lalor, at a period when problems did exist. Problems have grown because of the oil situation and they have grown for petrol retailers since then.  The point made by Deputy Callanan is a common one in rural areas.  It illustrates more clearly what I said earlier with regard to the means available to the multi-national companies to use their own type of restrictive practices, that they have many ways of saying they are not restrictive practices but they are getting around it.  This is why I am critical of the Parliamentary Secretary and his Minister that further steps have not been taken in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to ask whether or not we can expect the promised legislation controlling the franchise on trading stamps and the operation of trading stamps generally.  I think there is a tie between them.  If I <Col N="305" /> may, with the Ceann Comhairle's permission, quote figures from the National Prices Report, the average throughput of the 106 company managed stations is 236.2 thousand gallons.  In the case of the tenants of those companies, of which there are 387, the throughput is 139.9 thousand gallons.  Yet in the case of the 3,841 independent stations the throughput is only 37.3 thousand gallons.  This of course, means that there are very many independent stations that are absolutely uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to be instrumental in making them economic.  There are things that I would expect him to do; there are very many things that are considered impossible also and there is no point in saying that all these can be made economic.  First of all, the companies have prime sites.  For the most part, as can be seen from the table, they are in urban or semi-urban areas, suburban as well.  This applies both in the case of the tenants and in the case of the company operated by management.  For the other part there are the independents.</P>
    <P>We must be more concerned about it.  There should be something in addition to this measure which is only a continuation of something that was introduced in 1972, in the circumstances that operated at that time. In view of the developments over three years, has the Department any further legislation being prepared or ready to introduce just to prove that the Government are concerned about people, to prove that they are concerned about the impossible position of the independent?  The independent has a problem in the area mentioned by Deputy Callanan, just as he has as an independent competing against the power and strength of a companyoperated station in an urban area.</P>

      <P>The situation is that a complaint has been made that oil companies may propose in some cases to discontinue to supply certain small uneconomic stations.  But the oil company when these complaints were brought forward by the Department has given an assurance that in any case where it is proposed to terminate supplies the Examiner of Restrictive Practices will be given an opportunity of making a full examination in each case before a final decision is made. I should say that we are here dealing with section 3 only of the original order because it alone was the one which required to be renewed after three years.</P>

      <P>In relation to Deputy Fitzgerald's point about prime stations, the situation is that in the years between 1972 and 1974 the share of business going through independent dealers has increased while the share of business going through companyowned stations has decreased.  That is a trend that is continuing.  If, as Deputy Fitzgerald says, the companyowned stations acquired prime sites and so forth and so on they acquired them prior to 1972 and if the 1972 order was not brought in in time that may be the reason for those companies having those prime sites but since then, I am glad to say, the trend which Deputy Fitzgerald rightly expressed concern about is being reversed and I have given the undertaking that we will try to ensure that that will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen reports of the statement referred to.  It would seem that the main tenor of the statement was to confirm the importance of planned development of farms which is, of course, a fundamental aim of the farm modernisation scheme. The statement also emphasised the value of the scheme not only to farmers but also to advisers in bringing them into contact with many more farmers and giving them the opportunity to work more closely with them. The statement did suggest that too many farmers tended to regard the scheme as a somewhat cumbersome means of getting grants and failed to appreciate the importance of proper planning.  This is a criticism which, I am confident, will quickly disappear as farmers get more experience of the scheme.</P>

      <P>At the recent meeting in Dublin of EEC Ministers for Agriculture, I proposed to my colleagues that the time would now be opportune for a review of the farm modernisation directive in the light of experience in its operation.  The intention is that the Commission will now undertake such a review and will present a report to the Council of Ministers in due course.  At that stage the council will have the opportunity to consider changes in the directive in the context of the Commission's report. The farm modernisation scheme has already been the subject of debate in the Dáil and Seanad and I expect that there will be further opportunities to discuss it before the results of the Commission's review are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The commercial demand for milk and milk products for human and animal consumption has been adversely affected by the world trade recession, by higher prices on domestic markets and in some cases by a lower cost of competing foods and feedingstuffs.  This is particularly so in the case of individual products such as skim milk powder and to a certain extent, cheese.</P>
      <P>Naturally, this is an unwelcome trend in so far as milk exporting countries are concerned.  Nevertheless, I am convinced that the situation is a temporary one which will rectify itself within a relatively short space of time.  I am confident that, in the meantime, the excellence of our own dairy products and of the arrangements which exist for marketing them will stand us in good stead and will necessitate our having only minimal recourse to sales into intervention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows. I recently set up a review body to examine the operation of the beef intervention and cattle slaughter premium systems, with particular reference to the effect of the systems operated in supporting the prices of cattle at the different stages of production.  I would hope to have the review body's report before the end of July.  There are, of course, obvious difficulties about establishing floor prices for such a diverse category as store cattle, but I will be assessing the whole problem when I have the report of the review body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he would consider again the expedient adopted by the Italian Government in the last price review of February in Brussels, namely the acceptance&mdash;instead of an increased intervention price for beef&mdash;of a subsidy on calves having to be paid on their birth and the other half at the end of 12 months, making a total of £25?  Would the Minister again seek an adjustment for this country, in view of the fact that the balance with regard to the breeding of cattle and the returns therefrom are very much upset, and that any rewards there are from the production of cattle are not getting back to the primary producers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy I have given considerable thought to this.  It would be a very easy scheme to administer.  I think that is one of the reasons why the Italian Minister sought and was allowed this.  There are other reasons also why he got it&mdash;Italy had <Col N="325" /> always a number of special concessions. They had to surrender everything else in order to get this, including intervention and slaughter premiums. Mind you, very serious consideration would have to be given to a change that would include surrendering the slaughter and intervention premiums because of our dependence on the British market and what we get from that market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <P>Because of the fact that we have had a month's strike and an extraordinarily dry season, would not the Minister agree that breeders of small cattle may be in trouble again at the end of this year?  Would not he consider doing something for them, if they get a second year?  Because of the prolonged dry spell we have been experiencing, there will not be available much feeding next winter; bearing in mind also the fact that beef was held up for a month owing to the strike&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In my part of the country they were sold for £13 each and were worth £18.  Good ewes are being sold at £8 now.  Sheep have to be sold at give-away prices at the moment.

      <P>I have a note here that there are a number of people who appear to be under the impression that there are funds going abegging in FEOGA for road improvement and development.  This is probably due to the fact that farm roads have been grant aided in other member States under the FEOGA project scheme.  The position about this scheme is that any project which meets the general objective of improving structural efficiency in agriculture and satisfies the specific conditions of the scheme is eligible for grant aid under it.  The funds for the scheme are limited and it is solely a matter for the Commission to decide which priority projects are to receive grant aid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Community's current negotiations with certain countries in the Mediterranean Basin, including the Maghreb countries, the Council of Ministers, in the course of their meeting on 23rd and 24th June, took a number of decisions finalising certain measures relating to the organisation of the markets for a number of agricultural products on which concessions are envisaged for the Mediterranean countries concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The products involved are processed fruit and vegetables, certain fresh citrus and other fruit and wine.  The principal measures decided on for processed fruit and vegetables involve the removal of quantitative restrictions on trade with third countries, special import arrangements for a number of sensitive products and a premium for the processing of Community oranges. In the case of fresh fruit the measures include the strengthening of the reference price system in relation to imports of citrus fruit, an increase in the marketing premiums for Community oranges and its extension to lemons.  In the wine sector also the reference price system is being strengthened in relation to imports and special distillation facilities are <Col N="336" /> being provided to deal with surpluses which may arise from the more liberal import regime for Maghreb wine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the comments the Deputy has made are not correct.  What happened in this case was that the Council of Foreign Ministers made a decision in relation to an agreement with the Maghreb countries but the real problems in arriving at such an agreement were handed over to the Council of Ministers for Agriculture because two countries, particularly Italy, were seriously affected.  The products under discussion, and which form part of this agreement, were grown in the poorer parts of Italy.  If there is to be access for these products from the Mediterranean countries, naturally there would be Italian resistance to this unless they get some form of compensation for the producers adversely affected.  The President of the Council of Foreign Ministers came down to impress the urgency of reaching agreement. Views were expressed by a number of Ministers at the meeting of the Council of Ministers for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on the Committee Stage of the Planning Bill last Wednesday night, 25th June, 1975, Deputy Molloy accused me of being involved with a builder named Farrelly or Farrell and stated that I sent cheques regularly to this man but that after he, Deputy Molloy, had raised the matter in the Dáil on a previous occasion I had changed the bank account from which the cheques were issued.  I wish to make it clear that both statements are untrue and <Col N="344" /> without foundation and I ask Deputy Molloy to withdraw his allegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I take it you are allowing me to reply. I wish to quote from the Official Report&mdash;Volume 276, No. 10&mdash;of 12th December, 1974.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: Tell us about the cheque to Farrell.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: My what?</P>
      <P>Mr. Cunningham: Does the Minister not understand plain English?</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: Your bank draft to Farrell.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: Sorry, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. Cunningham: The Minister's assistance to a building contractor.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: Would Deputy Molloy repeat statements like this outside this House?  I have not issued any cheque&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: Think about that one.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: I have not issued any cheque to any building contractor named Farrell, or to anybody else named Farrell.  I did not follow the Deputy's line&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: Or anybody else who is a building contractor?</P>
      <P>
        <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
      </P>
      <P>An Ceann Comhairle: Question No. 95.</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: And the Minister never rezoned land for him?</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: No, I did not.</P>
      <P>Mr. Cunningham: Good agricultural land.</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: Or his agent?</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: No.</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: Ask Mr. Sharkey, the county manager.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: I am sorry, a Cheann Comhairle, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: What about the 35 acres in north County Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> What about Waterford?  What about Circular Road in Galway?</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, a builder named Robert Farrelly, Rockfield Road, Kells, County Meath, had an account in the Northern Bank in Kells to which a cheque issued, the amount often as big as £600 or £700 from the account of Deputy Tully, the Minister for Local Government, in a Drogheda bank.  This cheque issued every Thursday to Farrelly's account for payment of staff, signed personally by Deputy Tully.</P>
    <P>Some time after I raised this matter in the Dáil on 12th December Mr. Farrelly's account was changed.  I think it was in April, 1975.  The account to which the money was being sent was changed to the Ulster Bank in Athboy, County Meath.</P>
    <P>During the course of that question and answer session which I have quoted I made reference to the change in the zoning of land.  Mr. Robert Farrelly is a building contractor who builds houses on speculation.  Mr. Farrelly was granted permission by Deputy Tully.  The area for which the permission was sought and granted had been zoned by Dublin County Council as agricultural.  This zoning was ignored in the decision that issued from the Minister.  The land in question is at The Naul, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>The permission to which I was specifically referring in that question was issued subsequently and Mr. Farrelly was granted permission for houses at Rockfield Road, Kells.  At a December meeting of the Meath County Council, Councillor Hynes congratulated the Minister on granting planning permission to Mr. Farrelly and the manager's reaction to that statement was an aghast &ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Following the Minister's denial of issuing permission to Farrelly I inquired from the Department if planning permission had been applied for and had been decided.  I was informed that no decision had issued in that particular case but I have since been informed that the permission issued subsequently, approximately two months later.</P>
    <P>The Mr. Farrelly in question is <Col N="346" /> having an official opening of the Rockfield Estate, Kells within the next two weeks.  The opening is to be carried out by Deputy Tully.  Invitations have already been extended to the purchasers of those houses to attend and to partake of whatever refreshments are being offered.</P>
    <P>My allegation is merely that the Minister has an involvement with a builder named Robert Farrelly, Rockfield Road, Kells, County Meath which I deem to be in conflict with the office he holds as Minister for Local Government. In view of his statement today I would ask, through you, a Cheann Comhairle, in order to clear up this matter that the Minister should agree to a police investigation into his bank accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be only too glad to have a police investigation into my bank accounts immediately.  I have one bank account in the Allied Irish Bank in Balbriggan.  I never had nor have I now a bank account in a bank either in Drogheda or in Athboy. There is absolutely no truth whatever in the statement.  I assume that Deputy Molloy has been misinformed by somebody who obviously has been doing some investigation but certainly not into my account because I would not be in a position to send £600 or £700 to anybody at the end of each month apart from the fact that I have no bank account there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be prepared to have the matter investigated immediately.  I would also ask, Sir, that you would refer the whole matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The only permission I know of that Deputy Molloy is referring to is, in fact, one in Kells.  I know of Robert Farrell in Kells.  I am opening a housing scheme for him, Farrell Homes, within the next fortnight.  He applied for planning permission to Meath County Council, was refused by the Council, appealed to me or to the Minister for Local Government for permission.  Kells Urban Council, consisting of four Fianna Fáil, two Fine Gael, two Labour and one Independent councillors, unanimously passed a resolution which they passed on to me requesting me to give planning <Col N="347" /> permission to Farrell Homes for the estate in Kells.  Planning permission was given subsequently.  There is nothing wrong with the permission, nothing wrong with any permissions I have given.  I stand over them.  I do not know anything about the one that Deputy Molloy has referred to but I would be only too glad to have any investigation which is required and, Sir, I would ask that you would have the matter investigated immediately by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I would ask that when the decision is brought before the House Deputy Molloy will have the good grace to apologise or, alternatively, will repeat what he said here outside the House, as I asked him last week, and if he does then I shall be glad to deal with him.  Thank you.</P>

If there were variations on appeal in the amount of the compensation would these be taken into account in computing the gain or loss or, since the date of disposal is the date on which the compensation is agreed, and disregarding subsequent variations, is the gain based on the figure originally agreed?</P>
      <P>In other words, if this section is merely determining the date of the decision as to when there was disposal and acquisition it may be that the words in brackets which I propose to delete are not causing any difficulty.  If, however, the determination of that date can affect the amount of capital gains tax being charged then I think the amendment is necessary in so far as you can have a situation in which a figure for compensation in compulsory purchase proceedings was determined, we will say, by an arbitrator and you could subsequently have an appeal as a result of which that figure was varied. As I read the section it says that the date of determination by the arbitrator is the date of disposal and acquisition of the property.  If that is all it says I do not think there is any problem, but if as a result of that date being taken as the date of disposal and acquisition the value of the property on that date, in other words the value fixed by the arbitrator&mdash;at least, that would be the normal proceeding&mdash;is the one that is then used to assess capital gains tax, it would seem to me that the words in brackets should be deleted because you could have a different value arising on the result of the appeal and capital gains tax could be assessed on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that in most cases the figure fixed on the appeal might be higher <Col N="350" /> than the original figure and therefore benefit the taxpayer but I do not think that this is, strictly speaking, very relevant.  What is relevant is that there be a clear machinery laid down whereby the amount of tax to be levied is certain, that there is no ambiguity attaching to the method by which it could be done and for that reason it should be quite clear that the date on which the disposal and acquisition is deemed to take place, if it has any relevance to the amount of the compensation eventually fixed for the purpose of assessing the tax, should be the date on which the final determination of the amount of compensation is made.</P>

      <P>If the date was to be the date recommended by Deputy Colley it would be open to a liable party to engage in procedural delay so as to bring about a date which might suit his own convenience more than the earlier date.  We are providing that the sum is varied after first determination by some appeal procedure or otherwise.  The time of disposal remains unchanged even though the amount of the consideration might be changed.  An example would be where compensation is determined by a court of first instance and then varied on appeal to a higher court.  In such a case the appropriate timing of the disposal would be the determination of the value in the court of first instance.</P>

      <P>The words &ldquo;otherwise determined&rdquo; are used and the reference is to compulsory acquisition.  I take it what the Minister has in mind is the acquisition of land either by a local authority or by the Land Commission.  If he stuck to the word &ldquo;agreed&rdquo; I would ask whether the phrase in parenthesis, which is sought to be struck out by Deputy Colley, has any meaning at all.  After the word &ldquo;agreed&rdquo; you have &ldquo;or otherwise determined&rdquo;. &ldquo;Otherwise determined&rdquo; in opposition to the word &ldquo;agreed&rdquo; simply means that the court, the arbitrator or someone has determined and it seems <Col N="352" /> to me, therefore, that what is most likely to happen is that the court of first instance, so to speak, whether the Land Commission or the local authority through some machinery or other, determines and then a price is fixed.  It seems to me the Minister is attaching gains to that.  The very phrase visualises an appeal.  It could be an appeal to the Appeal Commissioners where the price would be revised.  It could be an appeal reopening the whole matter on a point of law.  I am at a loss to know why this phrase is put in because the compensation is not really determined until after the appeal and, if you go on the first instance, it is as likely to hit the Revenue as it is to hit the taxpayer because in many cases of appeal what happens is the price originally determined is confirmed or else the variation is in favour of the appellant. If it is in favour of the appellant then the price goes up and the Revenue lose.  I have a feeling that there is some purpose behind this phrase which we have not quite grasped.  I am not accusing anyone of hiding anything.</P>

      <P>Then what does the phrase &ldquo;variations on appeal&rdquo; mean?  I am sure the Acting Chairman will not object to the answer to that: &ldquo;variations on appeal being disregarded for this purpose&rdquo; can only mean a revision on appeal and, therefore, it is not the appeal price; it is some original price that is concerned. Take a concrete case: if the court of first instance, the tribunal or the authority fix the price at £100,000 and capital gains attaches to the person for whom there is a disposal then if, on appeal, the appeal tribunal, or whatever it is, awards £150,000 there is an extra £50,000 which seems to me to be a present under the section from the Revenue Commissioners.  <i>Timeo danaos et dona ferentes:</i> I would like to know the purpose of this parenthesis.

      <P>While what the Minister says in one sense makes the meaning of the words in brackets more tolerable, at the same time I think he is doing here the same thing as he was doing in a previous amendment to which we referred.  What he is doing is saying we deem the date of disposal and acquisition to be under this section a particular date&mdash;in this case the date of first ascertaining the figure for compensation in compulsory purchase. That is the date of disposal and acquisition. We go on then and, if there is a variation on appeal subsequently, and it could be a very long time subsequently, and if, as a result, which is the normal thing, the figure of compensation is increased the Revenue Commissioners will assess capital gains tax on the increased figure, not on the figure fixed on the date on which there is deemed to be disposal and acquisition. That is what the Minister says is intended, but it seems to me that that is not what should be done and it is not what the Bill says should be done because, if the disposal and acquisition take place on a particular date, then under other sections it is clear that liability to capital gains tax arises in that financial year and can only be assessed on the first figure.  But a revised figure might emerge as a result of court proceedings or a further hearing by an arbitrator and it might be a couple of years later that the revised figure on which the Minister says the tax will be based will be available.  It will not be available in most cases in the financial year in which the disposal and acquisition is deemed to take place.  Therefore, if the provisions of the Bill are to be followed, as they should be, the Revenue Commissioners would be obliged to collect capital gains tax on a figure which is subsequently going to be changed, most importantly, on a figure which has not been received by the owner of the property being compulsorily acquired. This is the aspect that worries me most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar situation arose on another <Col N="354" /> amendment and the Minister's justification in each case appears to be that if he does not do it, people could string out the date so that it would fall in the time that would suit them.  As I pointed out before, that may be a laudable ambition, but it is not sufficient to justify a situation in which, under this Bill as it stands, people will become liable for capital gains tax before they have received the gain.  In my view, it is not right for the Minister to say that that is not his intention, nor that that is what the Revenue Commissioners will do, because the Bill says what they are to do.  While it would be unreasonable, and the Minister freely concedes it, for the Revenue Commissioners to seek to obtain tax on a gain which the taxpayer has not got, that is what the Bill obliges them to do.</P>
    <P>I do not regard that as a satisfactory approach in this or in any other matter, in the Bill.  We have done our best to try to get some reality and clarity into these provisions.  We raised it on Committee Stage and we raise it again now by way of amendment, but the Minister is adamant. He wants to hold on to the words and try to operate this procedure on a basis which is clearly inequitable and without reality.  If he chooses to do that there is not very much we could do, except to have drawn attention to the problem.  The Minister, with his eyes open, is deciding to do it in a way which, if the Bill is to be enforced as drafted, will produce the inequities of capital gains tax being sought from a taxpayer who has not made a gain.  We do not go along with that, but apparently the Minister does.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 13, lines 33 and 34, to delete &ldquo;or may&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was also referred to on the Committee Stage.  The point at issue is that section 12 (7) provides that no relief will be given in respect of a loss sustained under this capital gains tax legislation if, and so far as, relief has been or may be given in respect of it under the Income Tax Acts.  The provisions that <Col N="355" /> the taxpayer should not get relief in respect of losses twice is obviously clear, and there can be no dispute about it.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that relief can be got under the capital gains tax legislation if it has not been got under the Income Tax Acts, as distinct from the provision here that it cannot be given under the capital gains tax legislation if it has been or may be given under the Income Tax Acts.  In other words, there may be some entitlement to relief under the Income Tax Acts but it has not been given.  It may not even have been sought or claimed because the taxpayer might not have been aware that he was entitled to claim under the Income Tax Acts.  Nevertheless, under this provision as it stands, no relief can be given under the capital gains tax legislation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that if relief has been given under the Income Tax Acts it cannot be given under the capital gains tax legislation.  Alternatively, if it is available under the Income Tax Acts but is not given, it may be given under the capital gains tax legislation.</P>
    <P>I referred to this on 13th May as was reported at column 1656 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I have indicated the circumstances in which considerable hardship could ensue.  I do not believe it is impossible to devise a method of re-wording subsection (7)&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I must admit that what I am saying here refers to this and the next amendment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;in order to ensure that some relief can be given in cases of the kind I have indicated.  I assume the Minister's general attitude is that he would not object to a relieving provision of this kind provided it would not be abused.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I will certainly further consider the arguments put forward by Deputy Colley but I am sure he will accept that the only point where one can be certain that a person will not <Col N="356" /> make a future capital gain is on death.</P>
    <P>The point refers to the next amendment rather than to this one.  The point in this amendment is simply to ensure that if relief had not been given under the income tax code, it may be given under the capital gains tax code.  That seems a reasonably straightforward proposition and I would ask the Minister to consider the arguments made on the last stage and today.  He did not deal with this in any detail on Committee Stage and perhaps he will do so now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we agree on that we must leave the section as it is and not delete the words.  The effect of the exclusion which Deputy Colley seeks would be that any gain on an asset chargeable to income tax could in certain circumstances be involved in a capital gains situation.  For instance, with assets which might in certain circumstances be capital&mdash;land&mdash;it might be to the benefit of the taxpayer to endeavour to take the asset outside the income tax range and have it regarded as capital asset in order to get relief for a loss.  This would occur, for instance, where there was no income and there would be no likelihood of a future income to set the income tax loss against.  It would be to the advantage of the taxpayer to swing the loss over from the income tax area to the capital gains area.  To prevent this happening, it is provided that so far as relief has been, or may be, given in respect of these losses under the Income Tax Acts, it shall not be given against capital gains.</P>
      <P>The use of the phrase makes it perfectly clear that this device is not available.  If we were able to delete the words &ldquo;or may&rdquo; we would be leaving an area of uncertainty, if not providing actual temptation to people to adjust their assets situation so that it could be transferred from the income tax area to the capital gains area.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be somewhat blinded in what he is doing here by his concern to ensure that a taxpayer will not get away with something. It seems to me that, if a taxpayer has no income, or will have no income, the only relief he can claim would be against capital gains tax in respect of losses.  The most that can be worth to him is 26 per cent.  In effect the Minister is saying: &ldquo;If you are in a position where you have made a capital gain and have had capital losses but you have no income, or you will have no income, that is too bad really.  You may have had losses you could have claimed under the Income Tax Acts but, because you have no income, you can forget about that.  You will not get the benefit of it, nor will we allow you to claim it under the capital gains tax code, although otherwise it would <Col N="358" /> have been available under the capital gains tax code.&rdquo;  That does not seem to me to be the right approach.</P>
      <P>It is an approach which is coloured by a particular view of a possible abuse situation which I would think would be extremely rare.  A case in which that kind of person will be caught is not only rare but, if he applies his ingenuity, he will see it does not happen to him.  One could visualise a situation in which a person who is genuine will be caught although that will be fairly rare too. The person who will be genuinely caught under this is not the person the Minister is trying to get at.  He is the one who will suffer.  We have drawn the Minister's attention to this and, if he persists in going ahead with it, we cannot stop him.  We have pointed out to him what the consequences are.  If that is what he wants to do that is what he will do.  The responsibility for doing this is on the Minister's shoulders and those on his side of the House, not on this side.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 13, after line 34, to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) Provided however that the Revenue Commissioners on application to them may allow a person to carry forward capital losses against capital gains which may or have already accured to him, if, in their opinion the request is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I referred to this amendment obliquely before.  It was raised on the Committee Stage discussion on this section.  If I may quote from what I said on 13th May, 1975, as reported at columns 1654-1655 of the Official Report I can set out fairly succinctly what is involved in this amendment.  I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not clear under this arrangement that a person may be taxed on gains and, within a short time afterwards, may suffer serious capital losses?  For instance, on a forced disposal of an asset.  Is there not a case <Col N="359" /> for saying that there should be provision to carry back losses for at least two years preceding the assessment? Effectively, capital gains tax is, by its nature, a long-term tax rather than an annual tax although it is treated here in a year of assessment. I suggest to the Minister that there could be cases of considerable hardship where a person has become liable to a tax on a gain and has paid it but soon after suffers serious capital losses.  As I understand the subsection in those circumstances such a person may not get any benefit in respect of those losses unless, at some time in the future, he manages to bring about a capital gain which may never happen.  Difficult circumstances can arise and I wonder whether it is essential, from the Minister's point of view, to restrict the carrying back of losses entirely as is done in this subsection?</P>
    <P>The Minister in replying to my summarising of the position said he would certainly consider the arguments put forward.  He added:</P>
    <P>I am sure he will accept that the only point where one can be certain that a person will not make a future capital gain is on death.</P>
    <P>This amendment is quite limited.  It says: &ldquo;Provided however that the Revenue Commissioners on application to them may allow a person to carry forward capital losses against capital gains...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister is right.  It should be &ldquo;carry back&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;carry forward&rdquo;.  The Minister made a passing reference this morning to the very understandable fact that he did not have much opportunity to study my amendments because they were put in yesterday afternoon and last night and he was otherwise engaged. From my point of view the <Col N="360" /> position has been that I have been engaged in this House on the Capital Gains Tax Bill Committee Stage followed immediately by the Committee Stage of the Wealth Tax, followed immediately by the budget.  The Minister was otherwise engaged and another Minister handled the Wealth Tax Bill.  The Minister has available to him the resources of the Civil Service. Those resources are not available to me.  I was obliged to await the Minister's own amendments to see what amendments, if any, I wanted to put down.  The time available to me to do this was rather short.  It has happened&mdash;and it may happen again in some later amendments&mdash;that there are one or two words in my amendments which should not be there.  I am saying that in parentheses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite right in saying it should be &ldquo;carry back&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;carry forward&rdquo; in the amendment.  Reading it as it should be written the amendment would read: &ldquo;Provided however that the Revenue Commissioners on application to them may allow a person to carry back capital losses against capital gains which may or have already accrued to him, if, in their opinion the request is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case.&rdquo;  That last phrase is crucial to this matter.  I admit freely that it raises objections, in the sense that it gives very considerable discretion to the Revenue Commissioners.  On the other hand, it recognises the difficulty the Minister faces&mdash;that this kind of provision might be open to abuse and to being used for the purpose of avoiding liability to capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that cases of serious hardship can arise in the circumstances I have outlined.  I am not speaking here&mdash;as the Minister was indicating on the last amendment&mdash; about somebody virtually making his living on capital gains.  I am speaking of somebody who has a capital gain, pays tax on it, subsequently suffers <Col N="361" /> capital losses and, because he is not in this line of business, may never again have a capital gain.  In those circumstances there can be hardship.  It seemed to me that to give the Revenue Commissioners power, where they belive it is reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, to allow the carry forward of losses was probably the only practical approach to this problem, where there can be genuine cases of hardship but where also there can be danger of abuse.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if one is endeavouring to meet the cases of hardship but prevent abuse one is going in the right direction in meeting those difficulties by my amendment, subject to the changing of the word &ldquo;forward&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;back&rdquo;.  Giving this discretion to the Revenue Commissioners fairly effectively closes the loophole that would lead to abuse and that would, at the same time, provide the possibility that the genuine case of hardship could be relieved.  Therefore, subject to that change in wording from &ldquo;forward&rdquo; to &ldquo;back&rdquo; the Minister would find is possible to accept this amendment.</P>

He makes a very fundamental suggestion here which, if acceptable under the capital gains code, for similar reasons, would have to be allowed under the income tax code with very great complexities and difficulties as a consequence.</P>
      <P>The concept of carry-back of losses obviously is very much wider than capital gains alone.  Were we to allow it under either or both codes we would never reach finality in assessing liability to tax.  The only situation in which carry-back of allowable losses is provided is in respect of death.  The reason it is allowed in respect of death is that, obviously, death means the termination of the possibility of making any future capital gain; one cannot take one's money with one; one cannot take one's assets to another place; one cannot make capital gains, nor suffer losses.</P>

      <P>It will be much cheaper to live and much cheaper to die in future.  That must be a considerable relief to people lucky enough to be affected by any of these taxes.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in the income tax code, losses can be carried back only on the termination of a business.  Therefore, in relation to capital gains and losses, losses can be carried back only on the termination of the business of living. There is no other way in which we can treat them.  I am sure Deputies would accept that were we to allow losses to be carried back for capital gains tax purposes, there would be a demand which could not be resisted to apply the same principle to income tax.</P>

      <P>It would be of great strength to me to know that I could quote Deputy Colley if people made such representations to me because I am quite certain representations would be made instantly once the principle was to be yielded under the capital gains tax code.  Also it would leave the way wide open to abuses, to avoidance devices of one kind or another, to artificial construction of losses.  It seems to me to be unworkable and undersirable.  I should like to point out that there is no limit to the carry-forward of losses in a person's lifetime.  As long as one lives there is always the possibility&mdash;and, in most cases, the probability&mdash;of the making of further gains.  Therefore, past losses can be written off against such further gains but no hardship can arise.  If death should intervene before the making of the gain and so get relief for a loss incurred already, then we can go back three years to set off the losses against gains.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, in the Bill, we have achieved a code which is reasonable and workable.  To accept the amendment would be to create a great deal of confusion, to open the way to abuse and to provide an escape which in the overwhelming experience of people would not be necessary because the losses can be carried forward indefinitely against all future gains.  That is what is really significant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put forward two arguments against this amendment.  The first is that he says that acceptance of the principle of the carry-back of losses in relation to capital gains tax would lead, inevitably, to its having to be conceded in the income tax code.  I indicated, in an interjection, that I do not agree at all with that proposition.</P>
      <P>I shall now elaborate a little on that objection.  The capital gains tax code, of its nature, is a long-term tax. Although it is treated here on the basis of a year of assessment, like income tax, in fact it is a long-term tax.  There are many people who never in their lives will have a capital gain, or a capital loss in terms of what we are talking about here.  There are many people also who will have perhaps one or two such instances in their whole lives, whereas the great majority of people have an income.</P>
      <P>That is one of the fundamental differences between the two codes. Secondly, in so far as the person sustains a capital loss and is not allowed then to carry it back, if he is one of those people who probably will never again have a capital gain, that is just a permanent loss as far as he is concerned. If he happens to be one of those people who is engaged in transactions which regularly produce gains or losses he does not have a problem at all as he can carry this all the way. If he is one of the people who will not have a capital gain ever again it is a loss for him forever.  It is written off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot carry gains forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If he will never have a gain in the future then if he sustains a loss it is a write-off as far as he is concerned.  If he does not have a gain in the future he has nothing to write it off against.  I believe that is not the kind of man the Minister should be trying to penalise in this legislation, and it is not the kind of <Col N="365" /> man who should be asked to bear this kind of loss simply because he is a person who sustains a capital loss and never again will have a capital gain. He should not be put in a category which will penalise him far more than the person who is engaged in speculation in property and so on.  He will not have this problem at all.</P>
      <P>Fundamentally, there is a distinct difference between the income tax code and the capital gains code.  A further argument in that regard is that while a man may never have a capital gain again it is a most unusual person who will never have an income again.  The Minister referred to such people earlier and clearly he visualised people who had considerable wealth and perhaps, in effect, would derive their income from capital gains.  Such persons are rare enough but they are not the kind of people we need be so concerned about.</P>
      <P>The people who will have no income in the genuine sense and who will have no capital gains or anything else do not really exist, because if they have no income and they have nothing else they will die of starvation. As far as the Minister is concerned the argument of such close similarity between the income tax code and the capital gains tax code, that one would have to allow the same provision for carry-back of losses in income tax as in capital gains, just does not stand up.  I do not think it has any real validity.</P>
      <P>That was the first argument the Minister made.  The second one was that to allow this would mean that the whole system was open to abuse. The Minister did not elaborate, as I thought he would, on the difficulties that perhaps might face the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with this if this amendment were accepted.  He drew attention to the fact that the allowance of carry-back of capital loss could only arise if the amendment were accepted, if a request were made to the Revenue Commissioners and if in their opinion the request was reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> There could be some difficulty for the Revenue Commissioners in administering that.  Nevertheless it is not true to say that with such a provision it is wide open to abuse, as the Minister suggested.  After all it is totally under the control of the Revenue Commissioners.  If they consider that the request is unreasonable they do not have to grant it.  That is what the amendment says.  On both grounds advanced by the Minister, that of the inevitability of conceding this in regard to income tax and the danger of abuse, I do not think there is any real validity in the arguments he puts forward for the reasons I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I believe failure to accept this amendment can mean serious hardship for those who cannot afford it, not to people engaging in speculation, deals or things that will leave them liable to capital gains tax and in a position to obtain capital losses and to claim them.  They are not the kind of people who will be affected by this. The people who will be affected are the kind of people I described where serious hardship can arise.  This amendment has sought fairly to meet the situation of avoiding that hardship without providing an opening for abuse by placing the whole thing under the control of the Revenue Commissioners at their discretion.</P>
    <P>I must say, that being so, that I feel it is unreasonable of the Minister to refuse to accept this proposition, to which we referred on Committee Stage, and to which his attention was drawn.  He has had the opportunity to think about it since then and he has also had the opportunity to think about it again since this amendment was put down.  It is unfortunate that he refuses to accept it.  I believe hardship will be suffered as a result of his refusal.  I can only say again that we have tried to do what we believe to be right, and the consequences of failing to do that rest on the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 14, to delete lines 48 to 50 inclusive, and to substitute &ldquo;for a consideration equal to their market value at the date of death; but&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this section ensure that an asset passing to a legatee on the decease of another person is to be deemed to be taken by the legatee at the value at which the deceased acquired it.  I gave an example of what can happen in this case on the Committee Stage and it is no harm to give it again.  A farmer purchases a farm and farms it for 40 years.  Then in his will he leaves it to his nephew.  On his death, the nephew takes and farms it for another 30 years and then the nephew disposes of it.  In that case the gain accruing to the nephew is deemed to be the price at which he disposed of it, less the price at which the farmer originally purchased it 70 years previously.  This, of course, is a totally artificial gain and can lead to a liability altogether out of proportion to what anybody would visualise accruing under capital gains tax legislation. It can effectively eliminate and negative the reliefs which are provided in some other sections in regard to the disposal of a property on retirement, that is of a farm or business.  In my view it is a major defect in this Bill that it can produce a situation of the kind I have described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I raised this on the Committee Stage the Minister said he had not closed his mind to the suggestion which I put forward and that he would be prepared to have a look at it between then and the Report Stage.  Since he has no amendment in to deal with the matter I am assuming that he has decided not to do anything about it. If he has decided not to do anything about it I think it is a serious matter and that it will leave this Capital Gains Tax Bill very defective, defective in a way that will affect many people who would not have expected to be affected by it, certainly to any major degree, and it will affect people who are not of the kind that ought to be affected by capital gains tax legislation.  I have repeatedly made clear my view that <Col N="370" /> capital gains tax legislation ought primarily to be directed at what is commonly called a speculator.  I do not accept the proposition involved in this section which I am seeking to cure in this amendment that a value which is built up in a business or in a farm over many years ought to be subjected to capital gains tax.  In the example I have given quite clearly what is going to happen is that capital gains tax will be applied to a gain which is deemed to have accrued over a period of 70 years simply because the Minister feels that there may be an opportunity for some people to escape liability or reduce their liability under capital gains tax if he does not do it this way.  This is another example of the innocent being punished for what I might call the sins of the guilty though those two terms &ldquo;sins&rdquo; and &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; in this context are going too far.  In effect the people who are really going to be penalised, who are really going to suffer, are those who have over the years by hard work built up either a farm or a business.  The amendment I am proposing is to provide that:</P>
    <P>the assets of which a deceased person was competent to dispose shall be deemed to be acquired on his death by the personal representatives or other person on whom they devolve for a consideration equal to their market value at the date of death.</P>
    <P>That is that the legatee, the nephew in the case I mentioned, would be deemed to acquire the farm at its value on the date he received it and then if 30 years later he were to dispose of it the gain which he was deemed to have made would be calculated from the date of its value at the time he acquired it until the date of disposal and whatever figure at which he disposed of it at that date.  This, adding on to that value the value of the asset as it has increased over a lengthy period back to its date of acquisition by the deceased person, is producing what I can only regard as an artificial situation.  It is worse than artificial and it is worse than simply distorting so that you get a liability for capital gains tax out of proportion as I have indicated.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair to people who, as I said, have built up a business or <Col N="371" /> a farm over many years.  This is not the kind of thing that will trouble what is generally called the speculator who is in and out for a fairly quick profit.  This will not trouble him at all but it will trouble the genuine case of the farm or business of the kind I have described.</P>
    <P>I admit that to take 40 years occupation in the example I have given by the farmer and then 30 years by the nephew, may be a bit extreme but it is certainly not unknown and not uncommon.  Even if the periods involved were much shorter the principle is the same, that in the case where the nephew disposes of the farm the increase in value of that farm over 70 years is deemed to be his gain.</P>
    <P>I do not think that that proposition really can be justified as fair and reasonable and I do not think that a danger of abuse can justify that kind of treatment of the genuine case.  If the Minister really wanted to cover the genuine case and prevent abuse he could have brought in an amendment which would in some way limit the operation of the kind of provisions that I am seeking in this amendment. He did not do that.  So we can only assume that the Minister thinks that in the situation I have described where the farmer farms for 40 years, leaves the farm to his nephew who farms for 30 years and then disposes of it, it is a reasonable proposition that he is deemed to have a gain over the period of 70 years.  I do not think it is a reasonable proposition and for that reason I am putting forward this amendment designed in a case like that or in the case of a business to ensure that you will not get that kind of artificial distorted, and in my view unjust result from the application of the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will not take it amiss from me when I ask this question: Has the Minister really had time to examine this Stage of the Bill himself?  I know that during the Committee Stage he was genuinely anxious to make the best of the Bill and he did on a number <Col N="372" /> of occasions undertake to look into points.  I have this amount of sympathy with the Minister.  I have the feeling that he just has not been able to reach on it and that he is now in the position of, so to speak, having to talk to his brief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interject to say that it would be very understandable if he did find himself in that position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am trying to say to the Minister.  It would be most understandable.  It shows the problem of making this House operate.  What I am saying to the Minister is, if this is his position I do not want to tax him with what I believe to be his genuine efforts on Committee Stage to meet the points that were made but I do find that on this Stage he is in a different position. Having made that remark, we should try as hard as possible to help the Minister to get into a position of command on the Bill again.</P>
      <P>If I understand the matter aright, the Minister did appreciate the point which Deputy Colley and we are making and he had a certain amount of sympathy with it.  Deputy Colley mentioned an extreme case but you can take a case that is less extreme.  Supposing that the Act had come into force, say, in the year 1960, approximately 14 years before what I may call the base date now.  If somebody reviews that period up to say, the time the present Minister took office he will find that it was regarded as a pretty normal period in economics, that there was a very big inflation in the value of land and, therefore, if you were to take a period like that, not the present situation at all, you would find that if somebody had acquired lands by purchase and then by death the lands devolved in that period and finally you come to the position where the nephew got the lands, automatically, without any element except the normal working of economics, there has been a gain that is going to be charged against exactly the type of person for whom the protections that the Minister has provided in other Bills have been built in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely there is a basic contradiction in the whole approach to this capital <Col N="373" /> taxation.  It is all very well from the administrative point of view.  An administrator sitting at a desk thinking out this thing in cold figures and thinking in particular of a class will not appreciate the point that I am bringing out here and that Deputy Colley has brought out, but it is very much a point for the Minister to appreciate and to care for.</P>
    <P>So much for normality, but what have you got at the present moment? We have a situation that everybody is talking about where there is absolute rank inflation meaning complete depreciation of money values and a great increase in nominal price, and market value in nominal price.  Over a much shorter period of time than the 10 or 15 years that I spoke of, let alone the 70 years that Deputy Colley mentioned, you can have significant impost on the very type of person who is singled out, and rightly singled out, by the Minister in other Bills and elsewhere for relief. This appears to me to show a contradiction in thought and to be leading to a form of confusion which will not help the community.</P>
    <P>I raise again the question of clear thinking on this matter as to whether we are after revenue or whether it is social policy that is dictating this code of taxation.  We seem to swing from one to the other as suits our arguments in the course of this debate, and I am not singling out the Minister in that. Perhaps I have done it myself.  This is a clear instance, and we have had many, where we should ask ourselves what are we after in this section.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, on that, I should say going beyond the terms of the whole code.  Is the Minister looking for money?  If he is then obviously he will get it wherever he can.  If he is looking for money he will have very little sympathy with the taxpayer and he will take the money wherever he can get it.  Here is a most iniquitous bit of taxation.  If the whole object of this exercise is simply to bolster up the Exchequer, which is now running out of funds, that is one thing, but, if we are serious about the social aspect of it then this provision is ineffective. I think the Minister recognised that on the Committee Stage.  I <Col N="374" /> am not taxing him with this for the reason stated at the outset, but Deputy Colley has given an indication as to how that particular deficiency can be remedied.  If one wants to get a good rake-off and provide for the future then obviously one should have as long a term as possible because then inflation and changing money values will work for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister being primarily guided by the need to get in money? If he is, well and good.  All I can say is that we object to going that far. If the Minister has a feeling, and he has made genuine efforts to show it in other places in this code, for the type of case Deputy Colley outlined, then he should either accept Deputy Colley's amendment or bring in something in the nature of a limitation which would ensure that the accrual gained would not get completely out of proportion because of the length of time over which the gain was accruing and because it accrued, shall I say, through the ordinary normal operation of monetary factors.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the Minister.  What he is anxious to do in this Bill is to get at the person commonly described as a speculator.  I do not like the word because it has now acquired a pejorative connotation which suggests something not quite above board.  But there is much legitimate business done, part of which may be of great benefit to the community, in which legitimate gains are made in the short term through transactions in buying and selling.  It is these that are the object of attention in this Bill.  If that is what is involved, well and good, but then why not tie it to market values, as Deputy Colley suggests, over a reasonable period of years?</P>
    <P>This amendment merits more serious attention than we might at first sight be prepared to give it.  Deputy Colley's case may be, as he said himself, somewhat extreme, but the more moderate intermediate cases I have given would be commonplace.  In any event I do not think we are getting after the right people and, as Deputy Colley said, this does not do a <Col N="375" /> thing to stop me buying and selling. There is nothing to stop this brokerage business, if you like to call it that, this buying and selling at a profit. Call it speculation or whatever you like, it is not involved in this section.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that might be said on the other side, and it is understandable. Naturally we have taken the base in April, 1974, or thereabouts. One is tempted at this stage to say: &ldquo;Look, that is in the past. There would be no serious problem for the next five or six years because time cannot run any faster and no excessive gains will accrue over five or six years and there will always be time to mend the situation.&rdquo;  I cannot accept that argument.  Often things are established in a statute and once they are established they are quoted as precedents.  The quick answer to objections is that this was done before in this, that or the other Bill, and this type of provision will be invoked in the future.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the argument that seven years would have to elapse, that argument can be made and, on the wording of the section, the period could go back the whole way.  The Minister is in a great hurry to get this Bill passed and we have agreed to give it to him by a certain date.  I do not think we would object if the Minister wanted an opportunity of having another look at this.  He has had to do a great deal of travelling in the course of his duties.  Yesterday he had the courtesy to come in here and explain why he had to be elsewhere. We have sympathy with him.  Now he might not accept the exact wording of Deputy Colley's amendment, but I have a feeling that, given the time, he would do something and I should like to think it is not too late to do something in this regard.  A manifest injustice can easily arise in this particular case where the Minister has been careful to try to protect and where he has been anxious to take credit for his solicitude in that protection. On the other hand, the case he is so insistent on catching will not be affected by this and, for these reasons, I would urge the Minister to <Col N="376" /> have another think about this whole matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view there is a great deal of justice in Deputy Colley's amendment.  I was surprised that the Minister had not done something about this before the Report Stage. We want to get at the &ldquo;jobber&rdquo; as he is called in my area but you will probably call him a speculator.  It is very unfair to put him in the same category as the man who bought a parcel of worthless land at a low sum, reclaimed it, drained it, took the rocks off it and gave his years of sweat and labour to it.  The same applies to the businessman.  There is a man living near me who bought a bankrupt business and built it into one of the biggest businesses in the area.  He did this through hard work.</P>
      <P>As Deputy de Valera said there is nothing illegal about buying and selling. Through the years some men have gone to market in the morning to buy a beast and sold it later in the day at a profit.  There is nothing wrong with that.  If I were a Minister introducing a capital gains tax, I would be trying to catch the man who got the money very handy.  I would like the Minister to change the Act so that those two types of people&mdash;the speculator and the farmer or businessman&mdash;would not be put in the same class.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I shall show how this amendment, if accepted, would lead to an unjustifiable situation right away if it came into operation as Deputy Colley proposes.</P>
      <P>The object of treating death as not being an occasion of charge for capital gains tax, together with the very high exemptions which will exist for capital acquisitions tax in the case of transfers within the family&mdash;which are the kind of transfers we as a Government undertook to protect&mdash;is to encourage the retention of moderately sized businesses and farms within the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The tax is being deferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the objective, <Col N="378" /> Deputy de Valera wanted to know whether this was a tax collecting Bill or if it was endeavouring to bring about social improvements.  It is doing both.  We have always declared that to be the intention.  That has been the thinking behind all capital taxation in other countries as well as here.  It was the argument advanced for the introduction of death duties.</P>
      <P>One would be foolish to look at capital taxation as a revenue collector. It could be made so, but the more effective it might be in that way the more unjust socially it might be.  The more efficient it is in bringing about social justice and wise ownership, or generates the transfer of wealth, the less effective it will be as a tax collector.</P>
      <P>The adoption of market value for capital gains tax, as suggested by Deputy Colley, would enable a legatee to sell the property he received soon after the death of a donor with no tax being charged.  This would clearly defeat the object of the Bill.  The use of the testator's base cost prevents the tax being avoided and discourages the sale of the property outside the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No charge to capital gains tax will arise unless, and until, there is a disposal outside the family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This treatment is obviously a lot more favourable than the treatment to which people were subjected, and would continue to be subjected, under the estate duty code if we had not abolished it.  There will be no charge to capital gains tax until there is a disposal, whether it is in 1975, 1980 or 2045.  The only charge then will be 26 per cent of the capital gain.  There will be, at the point of charge, funds available to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the very high exemption thresholds for capital acquisitions tax, <Col N="379" /> there will be very few cases where both capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax will arise.  Clearly there will be no hardship where this might arise because of the substantial property holdings involved.  The reason why the deceased's cost has been taken is because the capital acquisitions tax limits will be very high.  The policy behind the high exemption limits for capital acquisition tax and the absence of a charge on death for capital gains tax, is to preserve the family business or farm unit and to avoid, as has happened in the past under the estate duty code, the imposition of a tax at a time when there were no funds to meet it.  There will be no charge for capital gains until the money is received on a disposal and, therefore, it is no hardship to collect the tax at the time when the taxpayer is in a position to pay the tax because of the receipt of consideration.</P>
    <P>To take the market value of the asset at death as the base value for a future disposal would enable a member of the family who has obtained £150,000 in an inheritance to sell the asset immediately afterwards with a charge neither to capital gains tax nor to capital acquisitions tax.  The provision that in such a case the base cost to be taken as the deceased's cost ensures that there is a charge.  I consider that this is equitable.</P>
    <P>What would be the precise position if the legatee were to get an inheritance of £150,000, sell it immediately, and become subject to capital gains tax? Deputy Colley says we should take £150,000 as the base and the person will be free to sell and no liability to tax will arise.  We say that would not be equitable.  The purpose of the exemptions is to keep property within families so that they are not forced to sell.  If they maintain the property in that way for the family benefit liability to tax does not arise.</P>
    <P>Supposing the legatee, on receipt of the gift of £150,000, were to sell it under the Bill which we consider should not be amended, he will still be left with at least £110,000, that is, <Col N="380" /> assuming the whole £150,000 represents a capital gain.  That is a more favourable position for the legatee than he would have been in under estate duty.</P>

      <P>It is pretty certain that it would be in virtually any situation. That leaves the legatee in a comparatively fortunate position.  It would not be justifiable to allow that person total exemption.  It has been suggested that there might be some hardship in the case of a legacy to a stranger because the exemption limit for capital acquisitions tax is much lower.  I agree that the burden of tax would be greater if the gift were made to a stranger, but our concern has been to prevent the breaking up of family business units, family farms, and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase from £350,000 to £850,000 the amount of grant moneys which the Industrial Development Authority may make available, without the prior approval of the Government, for (i) an industrial undertaking towards the cost of fixed assets purchased or leased for the re-equipment, modernisation, improvement or expansion of the undertaking; or (ii) an industrial undertaking towards the cost of fixed assets purchased or leased for new industrial projects.</P>
      <P>The present grant limits of £350,000 which the Industrial Development Authority may make available for both purposes, without reference to the Government, were fixed by the Industrial Development Act, 1969. Since then all costs associated with the setting up of and expansion of industrial undertakings&mdash;plant, machinery, building costs, sites, and so on&mdash; have increased considerably.  A further factor which has resulted in an increase in the number of cases affected by the statutory limits is the fact that the limits relate to the aggregate sums paid to an industrial undertaking, and a number of undertakings would, of course, have submitted several proposals to the Authority over a period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result has been that the number of cases which have had to be referred to the Government in recent years because of the size of the grant proposed has grown considerably.  The <Col N="382" /> number of such cases in 1971 was seven; in 1974 it was 33; and this year the number of such cases seems likely to be higher.  The processing of so many cases at official level for submission to the Government prolongs the period of negotiation with the promoters concerned and delays the creation of potential new jobs.  It also creates the danger of losing some worthwhile projects.</P>
    <P>It is accordingly proposed to increase to £850,000 the amount of grant moneys for both purposes which the Industrial Development Authority may make in respect of a particular industrial undertaking without reference to the Government.  This will facilitate the negotiation of industrial projects under the industrial grants programme and will also reduce the demand on the Government's time resulting from the submission to them of many projects which are no greater in size or importance than projects which earlier would have involved grants of less than £350,000 and would not have been subject to the requirement regarding Government approval.</P>
    <P>Work has at present reached an advanced stage on more comprehensive legislation in connection with industrial development activities, and I propose to introduce a Bill dealing with these more detailed provisions either during the present session or at an early stage in the next session.  This will afford Members an opportunity for a full-scale debate on the industrial development programme.  In these circumstances I would ask the House to facilitate the passage of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend this Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have no intention of impeding the progress of this Bill.  We are prepared to facilitate the Minister in making the necessary change, which is another consequence of inflation. The explanation given by the Minister was very logical.  The costs of the things which qualify for grant purposes have increased dramatically over the past two years.  The amount which was originally brought before the Government for decision could <Col N="383" /> hardly be held to be relevant now.  It is logical to make this increase particularly if it facilitates the more expeditious handling of negotiations and the final decision-making in getting projects off the ground.</P>
      <P>The last paragraph of the Minister's statement seems to suggest that a full dress debate might be postponed until another date when other legislation might be introduced.  But it is relevant and appropriate that one say something at this stage about the whole question of incentives to industrial development here without going into any detail or unduly holding up the House or the passage of the Bill before us.  At the outset, let me say that the Industrial Development Authority have the blessing of everybody in public life here and indeed also in commercial business life for their handling of the various proposals put before them time and again in relation to industrial development.  I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the personnel who have processed so many applications, out of which a small percentage only survives.  The volume of work involved is very large indeed and requires a great deal of expert handling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without anticipating what the Minister may have in mind in forthcoming legislation in connection with a major overhaul of industrial development regulations and legislation, I should like to know if the principle of the free gift type of grant is being considered at this juncture of our development as being still the most suitable incentive to industrial development. As have most Members of this House, I had occasion to deal with people who, in the initial stages, came here with ideas, leading ultimately to suggestions and, sometimes, culminating in projects resulting in decent employment.  I have found many people amazed that the type of incentive given is an all-out, free gift with practically no strings attached. Indeed, I was impressed by some Americans who suggested to me, on one occasion, that State participation by way of equity, putting in a director, might be a better incentive to <Col N="384" /> industrial development, in that, it would ensure that the State stayed with the project, thereby giving to some extent a guarantee or reasonable assurance of its continued success. The likelihood of projects being set up without the creation of any really important fixed asset, exploring the market for a time, then folding their tent and disappearing in the night, is more likely to occur under the present system of grant incentive being offered.  That is why I posed the question as to whether the Minister had given serious consideration to changing the whole principle; whether it should be some form of participation by the State; whether all or some of the grant should be subscribed by way of State equity in particular projects.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the record has been one of success; one might say, tremendous success.  But we have had our share of failures which, perhaps, have been highlighted out of all proportion. But it was the means by which development was got going here in any reasonable way and without which perhaps we would have made little progress in that important field of industrial development.</P>
    <P>We set out to develop the industrial arm of the country without any tradition of industrial development, which meant we had little &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; in relation to many industries and we had not a lot of spare capital for investment in them.  While there was capital for industrial development and projects here, confidence had to be built up.  Without going back on that ground covered so frequently here, the tariff wall to preserve the home market was the first means of establishing confidence in local investment.  As the Minister and the House know, at the time it was necessary to have more than 50 per cent native capital in any industrial concern.  That was to ensure that we kept a grip on our own development, industry and investment. After a time a broader view of this was taken and legislation permitted the investment of outside capital to any extent necessary so long as it created the type of development suitable to our economy and created employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> There are four essential components of the broad principle of development, whether by foreigners or local entrepreneurs. that is, we must have a product with marketing availability; there must exist the capital with which to set it going and there must be the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; to produce it.  Those four essential ingredients are usually carefully screened by the IDA in any proposals. I often wonder whether we have done enough in the provision of those four essential ingredients for industry, in all the different ancillary groups that exist within the country in relation to development generally; whether there is proper co-ordination between all the bodies concerned in order to bring about, first of all &ldquo;knowhow&rdquo; and, secondly, market research in ascertaining what project would best be suited to development here, not yet established and that might attract investment also.  We have the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, Coras Trachtála, the export board, AnCO the training authority, the National Economic and Social Council and quite a few other bodies.</P>
    <P>I was not always satisfied that they properly co-ordinated different efforts to ensure that the best possible drive was put into the establishment and expansion of our industrial development. There is some liaison between most of them working in water-tight compartments, co-operating only when they are called upon, at particular levels of development, to take part in what they are supposed to be doing. I should like to see a co-ordinating body, comprised of representatives of all those different organisations, sitting down, at regular intervals, and discussing the progress we are making in our whole programme of industrial development.  Indeed, such a body could do a lot in examining the whole scene with regard to the rather familiar phenomenon of &ldquo;stop, go&rdquo; economy.  With careful anticipation, very often we could ward off some of the disasters that occur when the economy goes into a spin or recession.</P>
    <P>I visualise the IDA having an even more important role to play in industrial development than they have at the present time.  If we decide to have State participation and industrial democracy <Col N="386" /> of one kind or another, giving worker participation, what are we doing to train personnel suitable to go in and sit on the board or take part in the working of industrial concerns generally?  Are the Irish Management Institute aware of the role they might usefully play in this respect?  AnCO and the National Manpower Service, which are responsible for the placement of people in jobs, should have accumulated information which would pinpoint the areas in which industry might be developed.</P>
    <P>It is not the role of the IDA to identify the areas to which particular industry might be sent, although they might have to take on this role in the future.  Sometimes contacts are made with the IDA by some organisation who wish to establish industry here and they have an open mind as to where they might go.  Some advice must be given in that case as to where such an industry might go, taking into account all the relevant factors such as those problems thrown up by our growing concern with the environment and I hope the areas where industry is most required.  I have always had a bee in my bonnet about the original idea of the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>

      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy, but lest his approach to the Bill might be taken as a headline to others I should remind him that the scope of the Bill is extremely restricted.  It refers to the granting of powers to the IDA to increase by £500,000 money which they can make available at the moment.  I hope, rather than look on this as an occasion for a general or a comprehensive discussion on industry generally, we might not broaden the scope of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the IDA are as alive to the importance of what I have been suggesting with regard to co-ordinating other services.  Incentive to industrial development is quite important.  The incentive given by the IDA is rather generous when taken in conjunction with the tax-free holiday and the training grants that may be given to accepted projects There are other incentives which over the years have become equally attractive.  I refer to the availability of manpower, a properly trained manpower service, infrastructure, which so far as the undeveloped areas are concerned is the first essential.  This enables people to get to areas and get out of them and also to transport their goods in competition with those which are located close to suitable ports of entry and export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see the Industrial Development Authority in conjunction with existing bodies develop along those lines and being a major incentive <Col N="388" /> to the attraction of industry to the West of Ireland.  I would like to see a better telephone service being provided. I have been trying since lunchtime today to dial Ballyshannon in County Donegal and I have been unable to get it.  That is an everyday experience of Deputies in this House with regard to long-distance calls.  A good telephone service is as important to an industrialist who intends to come here, as is the provision we are now making to allow the IDA to extend the amount of money which they can give without having to go to the Government for approval.</P>
    <P>When I was a Member of the Government I was often amazed, when those proposals frequently came before us for approval, at the huge amounts of money which we sometimes had to give to important projects which had not such a great labour content.  They were capital intensive projects producing goods where perhaps the most acceptable part was the high export potential. They were in a position to make a great contribution to our balance of payments and to our export figures generally.</P>
    <P>These are different considerations which the IDA have to take into consideration in arriving at decisions.  As the Minister has suggested, there will be other opportunities of dealing with these matters, but when it comes to debating his Estimate we will be more concerned with the state of the economy rather than with detailed matters relating to the IDA.  I do not propose delaying the House much longer but I take this opportunity of suggesting to the Minister that in his announcement that legislation of a more comprehensive type is to be introduced in the near future, probably before the end of this session which is likely to go on until Christmas, it will be too late to make the suggestions I have been trying to make as to what I would like to see the Minister having examined.</P>
    <P>This important body deals with an aspect of our economy which has contributed more to our overall expansion, our progress and the improvement in our standards of living than any other institution in the State.  I <Col N="389" /> welcome the change if it is in the interest of more expeditious handling of proposals.  I assure the Minister that we will not impede its progress through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill inasmuch as it increases the amount of money that can be allocated to the small industries without the necessary sanction of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I should like to reflect on the activities of the IDA in my region through its agents, SFADCo. I come from the mid-western region, Limerick, North Tipperary and Clare, and from the outset of regional development it was apparent that the policy of the IDA was to develop the core of the region which has down through the years been developed to the detriment of the outer fringes.  The stage has now been reached when the IDA should decide that all the towns in the region are as important for development of industry and the people concerned as Shannon, Ennis and the city of Limerick.  In spite of the praises of the IDA by Deputy Brennan, I am not satisfied with the activities of that body in relation to my constituency.</P>
      <P>I compliment the officers of SFADCo and the county development team who at all times have done everything possible to procure industries for our area but, unfortunately, the last word rests with the IDA.  I am alarmed at the situation in North Tipperary and I hope the Minister will view it in the same light when he hears details of grants and the location of industries in Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary. In the three-year period ending December, 1974, out of a total grant allocation for new industries of £37,750,000 my constituency received only £41,000, the lowest in the country.  It was the second lowest as regards aid for small industries.  This situation must change.  I am sure other small regions suffer in a similar way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The job target, as outlined by SFADCo, for my region for 1973-77 was 660 jobs but as yet only 86 have been procured.  In my town there is a big unemployment list and we have 100 acres available for industrial development. In the period ending <Col N="390" /> December, 1974, 25 major industries were sited in the mid-eastern region but none were sited in North Tipperary. I am concerned about this. When one looks at the effect of industrial development within the region one can see where one county has benefited from centralisation of development to the detriment of the other county which is the weaker and, apparently, the poor relation of the region.  In the period 1961-66, 8.3 per cent emigrated from my area and 6.3 per cent from Clare.  In the 1966-71 period Clare reduced its figure for emigration to 1.5 per cent while North Tipperary reduced to 6.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is time the IDA considered North Tipperary as being in urgent need of heavy and small industry.  We may have the name of being the premier county but in 1975 the IDA and SFADCo should make a breakthrough there.  It is apparent that our partners in the mid-eastern region are succeeding in attracting new industries at a greater rate than we are and, as a result, new jobs in manufacturing industries are being created.  No one can take credit for the big mining development outside my town because the materials were there but now, six years after the Canadians arrived, this industry which gives employment to 600 people is being phased out. This must be viewed with alarm.  It will take a long time to substitute such a big industry.  I appeal to the Minister that when siting industries in 1975-76 the question of overlooking of North Tipperary and making it the poor relation of the region in the past will be taken into consideration.  This should be conveyed to the IDA.  I have no complaints with SFADCo but, unfortunately, they do not provide the industries.  I hope the Minister will be able to provide the jobs needed in North Tipperary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a necessary and correct step.  I support Deputy Brennan's remarks about co-ordination of the efforts of the various statutory bodies as regards industrial development.  I appreciate that the Minister has promised to give us an opportunity soon of discussing <Col N="391" /> this at greater length when he introduces new legislation.  In the meantime I suggest that a number of things can be done.  We should have a greater degree of co-ordination between the IDA, An Foras Forbartha and the other statutory bodies which have a bearing on industrial development. I sympathise with Deputy John Ryan in his problem and I appreciate his concern for his area.  I expect most rural Deputies have the same complaint.</P>
      <P>I represent an urban area, southeast Dublin, and I make a plea to the Minister in relation to that area.  While we should decentralise our industries and a greater part of our commerce, I should like to point out that in the greater Dublin area one-third of our population live and we have one-third of the unemployed.  I should like to do away with this facade of affluence which people have in regard to Dublin. There is a pathetic situation of unemployment in the greater Dublin area.  In his efforts to attract more industry the Minister should seek the advice of a sociologist on the problem in Dublin.  We are building up a content of people who, because they have been unemployed for so long, may not fit into a new scheme.  This may apply to other large urban areas also.  When establishing an industry the Minister should have regard to the sociological problems.</P>
      <P>By ensuring that the State bodies are used for the purpose for which they were established the Minister can see to it that they make a contribution to his efforts to make our country more prosperous.  Between now and the time when he introduces the new legislation the Minister should have regard to the pressing problems of the large urban areas.  I want to draw his attention to the fact that in this city we have great social problems many of which are due to the fact that we have a big number of unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. A lot of criticism has been directed at the IDA but in my view they have been doing a great job.  However, some of the projects introduced here <Col N="392" /> did not give the employment they should have had for the amount of capital involved.  I am not saying it was the fault of the IDA.  I believe there were other factors involved also. Where there is a sum of £100,000 involved it is not right that a company should come in and employ only 10 or 12 juveniles.</P>
      <P>My area has about the highest rate of emigration in the country.  We have been trying for a number of years to get Offaly made a designated area. For various reasons that does not seem to be on and we must accept those reasons.  I would like to see the rate of grant increased for the counties of Laois and Offaly.  In Offaly, particularly in south Offaly, we are going through a very bad time at present. Some of our industries have suffered from the effects of cheap imports.  We have not been getting a fair share of the industrial projects that have been coming into the country.  I do not know why.  We have workers who are among the finest in the country.  Perhaps it is considered that because we have the ESB and Bord na Móna we are all right but at present they provide mainly seasonal employment.</P>
      <P>Another drawback we have in Offaly is a shortage of telephones. The managing director of the Edenderry Shoe Company wrote to me recently to tell me that they lost an export order because of a delay in the provision of a telephone.</P>
      <P>We should get a bigger slice of the cake than we are getting.  Nobody can say that I am greedy when I say that we are entitled to special attention. Recently the Minister met a deputation from the Offaly development team and I think it can be said that we put up a very reasonable case. As the Minister knows the firm of Salts in Tullamore is going through a very difficult time.  There are about 380 people employed in that industry. If it does not get immediate help there will be another 380 people on the dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An industry which has been giving employment for 30 years or more is entitled to some kind of special attention from the IDA.  I am all in favour of new companies coming in and being <Col N="393" /> helped but some of them have been failures.  They were here only for a couple of years when they collapsed. Some of them in my constituency did not live up to expectations.  The IDA have an advance factory in Clara which has been idle for about two years.  We seem to be unable to attract anybody to it.  In Birr an advance factory has been completed and as far as I know nobody has yet taken it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that when companies we have had here down the years are in difficulty they should get aid.  I do not think we should pour our money into companies for which there is no hope.  If it is only to tide them over for six months or a year it is no use.  One might as well meet the trouble today as tomorrow. However, when a company is checked out and found to be capable of being made viable it should be helped out. There may be legal difficulties involved but I believe that where a large sum is given to a company by the IDA the IDA should at least have a director on the board.</P>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill. I hope the Minister will pass on to the IDA my remarks in regard to the constituency which I represent.  If it could take on a major promotion in the constituency and see if an improvement could be brought about, in view of the employment situation, I would appreciate that very much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes without saying that the Bill is necessary.  A limit of £350,000 has been the cut-off point at which the Government rather than the IDA must make the decision. That figure is too low.  It stems from the Industrial Development Act, 1969, and we know what has been happening in the world since then as far as inflation is concerned.  A cut-off point was necessary unless we were to reach the ludicrous situation of the Cabinet having before it for a very high proportion of its time <Col N="394" /> a great many industrial projects, some of which might have been timewasting. I agree with the principle that very large projects should come before the Government for final approval.  I say that for a number of reasons.  One is the fact that industrial development is the greatest single factor changing the face of the country.  The spin-off from industry affects population trends and opportunities. The services sector is a spin-off from industry and has a bearing on the achievement of regional balance in the distribution of jobs.  These considerations apply particularly in the case of very large projects where the Cabinet might be involved in the ultimate decision.</P>
      <P>The reservation I have about the Bill is in regard to the stepping up from £350,000 to £850,000.  I wonder if we are not pushing it a little further than is necessary or desirable.  This is a small country in comparison with our partners in the EEC.  We have a population of about three million.  I am against the principle of the Cabinet losing its grip on what is happening. Are we pushing it a little too much in increasing the cut-off point from £350,000 to £850,000?</P>
      <P>The Minister makes the point that the IDA make, that there is the danger of losing projects if they must go before the Cabinet.  I doubt the validity of this argument.  In the past while, in theory, large projects had to go before the Cabinet, in practice the advice tendered by the IDA has been accepted.  I am not privy to Cabinet secrets but that does seem to have been the position, that recommendations by the IDA were accepted by successive Governments.  Otherwise, the Cabinet might have been placing themselves in the difficult position of deciding in technical areas which might be beyond their individual competence.  I would not accept the argument about the danger of losing projects if they must go before the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vitally necessary to have adequate democratic control.  We have been concerned in the House recently about adequate control of semi-State bodies.  The Minister for the Public Service is on record as saying that it <Col N="395" /> is his intention to introduce legislation which will have some effect in this area.  It will be very difficult to do it while in theory it is desirable.  The House has a limited number of members and we are finding it difficult to have a quorum in the existing small number of committees that we have. I am against getting away from control. This is why I have the single reservation about this stepping up to a level which is a bit higher than I personally would be happy about.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that comprehensive legislation is proposed in connection with industrial development activities and that we may expect a Bill very soon.  I should like to take the opportunity when that legislation is introduced of contributing at greater length.  I do not know what the intentions of the Minister are.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan and some others were constructive in their speeches and made certain suggestions.  There are one or two that I should like to make. Deputy Brennan suggested that there should be better co-ordination in the industrial development programme.  I agree with him.  We have at times seen semi-State bodies acting at a tangent to one another.  This is less than desirable. There should be co-ordination. There are more bodies involved in industrial development than the IDA.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give some thought to the need to have greater representation of the commercial community on certain boards and in policy-making where industrial development is concerned.  While there is a semi-State body in charge of this policy the section of the community which has the greatest common interest with foreign industrialists is the commercial community, including businessmen, industrialists, accountants, management.  We have not had sufficient regard to the contribution such people might make to industrial development policy.  Some of us were involved when in Opposition in the development of policy documents which suggested a closer link in this area.  These people could bring their own skill to the deliberations and their involvement would give the business community a better sense of what is <Col N="396" /> happening in the industrial world outside the country.  In other countries there is infinitely greater involvement of the commercial community in policy making than there is here.  Profound thought should be given to the question of involving the business community in the industrial development programme.</P>
    <P>When the county development team system was introduced it worked very well.  It was a very good idea.  The appointment of the county development officers was an excellent thing because it brought a development role for the first time into the county councils.  The county development committee was a good idea.  An improvement or refinement can be made. Participation in such committees is confined to the senior executive of the local authority, the county development officer and the chairman of the county council.  There is room for participation at local level by the business community, trade union representatives and representatives of the agricultural community.  I am very keen on this type of involvement.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is practicable to have such involvement at the level of deciding whether or not projects will go forward to the IDA small industries sector for grants.  I do not think that people outside the Civil Service and local authority employees would be involved in that area but there is scope and it is something that is desirable and to which the public would be responsive.</P>
    <P>I thank you for your latitude in allowing me to roam a little.  I should like to refer to the position in Mayo where the Industrial Development Authority is on the point of building a 20,000 sq. foot advance factory in Westport.  It is most welcome.  There is no problem, such as there was in the past, where water is concerned because a scheme costing a few hundred thousand pounds will be completed shortly.  I am glad the IDA are looking for land in the vicinity of the town for further major development. The needs are great.  It is a town with an industrial tradition since the 1930s.  The population has been practically static for a very long time. <Col N="397" /> The town is in the centre of a hinterland which is one of the poorest in the country.  In the last census of population this was one of two rural districts which suffered the greatest loss in population.  While the town itself is prosperous there is need for industrial development to provide employment for the people living in the hinterland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bill the sums the IDA can allocate will be increased from £350,000 to £850,000. The IDA is an autonomous body and requires considerable latitude in the exercise of its judgment.  I believe the elected members of this House and the elected Government of this country are in the final analysis the people responsible to the taxpayers from the point of view of money paid out. There is a great responsibility on us to ensure that industrial development is carried out in a fair and equitable manner and that the money spent is spent to the best possible advantage. I welcome the setting up of a committee to investigate the operations of State and semi-State bodies.  However, it is highly important that all important decisions in relation to industrial development should be taken by the Government.</P>
      <P>I represent two midland counties, Laois and Offaly.  We suffer from certain natural disadvantages.  Other counties have the advantage of being near Dublin and having an excellent transport system.  That is the situation on the east coast.  Further south oil and natural gas have been discovered. I congratulate the Minister on opening three IDA factories in my constituency some 12 months ago.  The midlands were heavily dependent on the textile industry and, as everyone knows, this industry is going through a very lean period.  The situation is very difficult.  I hope it will improve. We have lost the worsted mills in Portlaoise and large numbers have received redundancy notices in Tullamore. The situation is similar in other towns in the midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a considerable drop in agricultural employment in midland counties.  These counties were heavily dependent on agriculture. <Col N="398" /> They are also heavily dependent on Bord na Móna where employment is concerned.  According to a report, the life span of our bogs is approximately 20 years.  This is very worrying.  It will be appreciated how serious the situation is.  Special steps will have to be taken to provide alternative employment in the midlands.  Every Deputy has the interests of his own area at heart, and I am taking this opportunity of making the Minister fully aware of what the position is in the midlands generally because an all-out effort will have to be made to provide employment in these counties.  According to the Ross Report in 1961, incomes per head of the population in Offaly were the lowest in the country. They said that our average income was one of the lowest and this very serious trend has unfortunately continued.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill.  In the interest of this county being fairly treated with regard to industrial development, it is very important to bear in mind the natural disadvantages I have outlined in the Midland counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past 12 to 15 years, from an industrial point of view, those counties have fallen steadily behind the rest of the country.  Many reports which have been issued would substantiate that statement.  A report issued by the Midland Regional Development Association, comprising five counties&mdash;Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath and Roscommon&mdash;shows <Col N="399" /> there has been a drop in population in that same period.  It devolves on the members of this House to ensure that these counties are equitably treated.  At present, the balance for these counties should be redressed and we should bear this in mind.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority are doing excellent work.  Because of the world economic situation at present, their task is very difficult. Nevertheless the Authority have done a very good job.  If I hear of a company in financial or other difficulties I communicate with the Industrial Development Authority and, if they can, they will help solve the problem. The Authority should be given further help and powers because their powers are very limited at the moment.  The time has come when we can be oversensitive about starting new industries. We have been making too much effort to attract new industries while not taking sufficient steps to ensure that our existing industries are being properly looked after.</P>
    <P>As a representative of Laois-Offaly, I must say that the Minister showed his good will to our constituency when he opened the three advance factories there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill because eventually it means that we will give the Industrial Development Authority a chance to process new industries and thus speed up the possibility of introducing new industries into the country.  This is a very welcome gesture.  We owe a great deal to the IDA for their wonderful work. The men in charge are of the highest integrity and have done a tremendous job to attract new industries.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the line taken by my colleague who more or less suggested that the Government should have a bigger say in matters relating to industry.  If we give the IDA the encouragement they deserve, they will do the job we want them to do and for which they were set up, independently of any political interference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be more trouble in the case of established businesses getting grants than for new industries. Sometimes established industries find <Col N="400" /> it hard to convince the bodies concerned that help is necessary.  The Minister might take a look at this area. Long-established industries who have been doing very good jobs should be protected and encouraged to continue their work, giving employment.</P>
    <P>The county development teams and the regional development boards have been doing an excellent job.  In relation to the regional development boards there is an anomaly inasmuch as they sit down and look at a region and try to help but they have no real standing. Here again their efforts could be combined with those of the county development teams and the IDA in trying to bring new industries into different areas.</P>
    <P>In the last paragraph of his speech the Minister said that he intends to introduce comprehensive legislation in connection with industrial development activities.  This is also very welcome.</P>
    <P>May I make a suggestion?  We should develop our natural resources. I am not talking about gas and oil. I know they are important.  A great deal of research is necessary in the western counties with a view to establishing industries like fish farming which could be developed in such a way that farmers could supplement their own earnings.  This could be done at a comparatively low cost in relation to the money spent on other industry. It would ensure constant employment. If we had such an industry at present we would not have large dole queues in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>My own area is neglected from the point of view of industry, particularly in the Westport area.  The IDA carried out a survey and made a list of small towns in which it might be possible to have projects started, but nothing has happened.  Like Deputy Staunton, I am disappointed that in Westport where there is such a great business tradition, and where business people established industry in the 1930s when there were no Government grants, nothing positive has happened in the past few years.  I hope the Minister will try to ensure that the advance factory which is about to be built will not have to wait too long for an industry <Col N="401" /> which will be of use to the area. I hope that later on we will have an opportunity of going into more detail on industrial development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this Bill.  I should like to pay tribute to the IDA officials on the job they have been doing.  The officials in the offices of the IDA, the RDB people and the county development teams have played a very important role in the development of industry and the creation of employment in many areas. Like many of the other State agencies with which they are connected the IDA are now having a very difficult time. They are not reaching the target they expected to reach in the number of jobs created.  The major problem is that even the targets projected by them are no longer adequate.  This places added responsibility and a more severe work load on the IDA officials.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say he intends to introduce more comprehensive legislation.  It should have been introduced long before now.  I admire the Minister in many respects. I think he is sincere and a hard worker.  Perhaps he has been spending too much of his time on the projected developments off our coast.  Perhaps it was necessary for him to devote so much time to them, but it is also important that in the short-term industry should go on apace.  I am afraid it has slowed down.  Industry is facing a situation which has not arisen here before.  We claim that the slowing down in the development of industry has much to do with Government policy.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the creation of jobs by the IDA.  It does not appear possible that they will achieve this year's targets.  A number of speakers referred to problems in their own areas.  We can claim that reasonable progress was made by the IDA in the southern region of my county in the provision of industry and the creation of jobs.  Recently the fall off there was substantial in existing industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> The introduction of comprehensive legislation by the Minister is urgent. I cannot anticipate what will be in that legislation.  I would like to see legislation involving the position of the IDA, the ICC, Fóir Teoranta, involving the production of new industry and the protection of existing industry with greater State involvement. I know I would be outside the scope of the Bill if I went into more detail but I am sure the Minister has an idea of what I mean about State investment in existing industries. There should be involvement of management and actual participation in return for financial assistance.  I am not happy with the present arrangement whereby people are appointed to the board.</P>
    <P>The IDA are co-operating more and more with AnCO.  I was very glad to hear an announcement recently about a new industry in the Cork area.  There should be close liaison between them.  We were told by a Minister yesterday, and also by a Parliamentary Secretary, about the substantial amounts of money being spent by the Government on training and retraining programmes.  What they did not say was that most of this money was coming from the European Social Fund.  We should welcome it and we should be delighted to get it, but it must be pointed out that the Government cannot claim credit for it.</P>
    <P>While the utmost co-operation is necessary between the IDA and AnCO, it is a matter of grave concern to learn that there are difficulties within the industrial training authority. I will not go into the details and I will not take sides in those difficulties.  We must express our disappointment that this seems to be a continuing problem within the Department of Labour.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I want to say that we wish to assist in every way the facilities being afforded the Industrial Development Authority.  But we are also adamant that, to meet present needs, its operation must be geared up and updated.  There is no point in saying that what was good enough two-and-a-half or three years ago, in the climate of that time, is adequate today.</P>
      <P>We have an on-going problem&mdash; growing unemployment.  We have more need of jobs.  Therefore, we have more need of industry.  Can we be told in this House how many countries the Minister and his IDA team toured to attract industry which would provide employment and how effective had been those trips?  Surely at a time like this it is important that the world be toured, that every effort be made.  That is why I was critical earlier of over-emphasis on future developments, important though they may be.  Our people need employment at present and they can have it only if industry is created.  Our school leavers have no opportunity of employment.</P>

      <P>I think I had concluded my remarks of substance and, having given further consideration to the matter during the break, I would not consider I would be justified in accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to what I have already argued, I would ask the House to remember that bequests in the form of assets, such as a private house, the wasting asset, moveable assets worth less than £2,000 and Government loans and securities may be made without any future liability to capital gains tax on disposal.  When one considers <Col N="404" /> these exemptions, together with the already high thresholds of exemption from capital acquisitions tax, it will be seen that there will be very few cases indeed where the kind of hardship to which Deputy Colley referred would arise.</P>
    <P>I do not think it wrong that we should legislate now for the short term.  I do not accept Deputy de Valera's view that whatever we do now will not be changed for 20, 50 or 70 years.  Were I Minister for Finance at the turn of the century I would contemplate having a look at the matter again and, in the light of that, consider whether any changes should be made, as it might be thought that the man who introduced it might be more resistant to change than others.  I am confident that future legislators will look at the situation to ensure that the kind of situation which Deputy Colley has rather graphically and in a rather exaggerated way set out would not arise.</P>

If, ultimately, he or his <Col N="405" /> children decided to get out of that activity, I do not think it unreasonable that they be asked to pay capital gains tax.  They would still retain the net 74 per cent of the capital gain, plus the original value, which would be quite a considerable gift to have acquired.</P>

      <P>The Minister thinks there is something to be looked at by future Ministers.  That will make farmers feel very uneasy because, if a farm is worked by a son who inherited it on the death of his father, and he continues to improve and develop it, thereby enhancing its value, the value is automatically increased. Must he then suffer in, say, ten to 15 years' time by having very heavy capital gains tax slapped on him if he decides to sell the farm, or if his wife, becoming a widow on his death, decides to dispose of it for a number of reasons?  This is a ridiculous situation.  It is ridiculous to have this in a comprehensive Bill and leave it to a future Minister to remedy that inequity say, ten years hence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might examine the points made by Deputy Colley.  In the case of inheritance tax, if it is a nephew involved in a farm or business the threshold is quite low. I think the Minister spoke about this himself and said not many cases would arise, but it is conceivable that <Col N="406" /> both capital gains tax and inheritance tax could be applied.  Certainly I agree with the Minister when he said that in the case of a direct descendant gift or inheritance tax would not apply because of the threshold.  But the threshold covers direct descendants only.  It does not cover what happens quite frequently here, particularly in rural areas, where there are so many bachelor farmers.</P>
      <P>The other point occurring to me here, and which seems relevant in relation to the sort of example given by Deputy Colley, over a period of years, is the effect of inflation.  If inflation is not to be taken into account it seems to me, with the automatic loss in the value of money, people in that category will become taxable anyway whether the value or quality of the farm or business improves. This, it seems to me, places the State somewhat in the position of having a vested interest in inflation and is an aspect to which I think the Minister should have some regard, because it seems rather unjust that simply by the devaluation of money a person will become liable to capital gains tax if he finds himself in the position of wanting to or having to sell an inheritance.  This tax will come into operation simply because the value of money depreciated, as it has been doing very significantly over the last few years.</P>
      <P>It seems to me from that point of view and also from the possibility of two taxes coming in that Deputy Colley's amendment is worth considering. The Minister should consider it on the basis of what Deputy Colley suggested, that market value at the date of death would at least help where a family business or a family farm is concerned to make the thing more equitable from a family point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I would like to support Deputy Colley in this amendment. Throughout the country today there are many people confused with regard to the taxation package.  The abolition of death duties was welcomed throughout the country but the majority of property holders have not <Col N="407" /> grasped the full significance of the three Bills before the House.  I refer particularly to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill and the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  The majority of those people, when we talk about thresholds, are under the impression that this is an exemption which will last for all time, but this is not true.  The thresholds exist only as long as you keep the property within the family. Once you dispose of it outside the family circle you become liable to the same level of taxation as any other individual.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley's amendment is one of the most important ones we have in the Schedule.  It states that the market value is the price which should be taken into consideration.  Deputy Colley quoted cases where property can pass from a father to a son who can pass it on to his son and a generation can pass.  The Minister has said: &ldquo;We will leave it to a future Minister for Finance to resolve this problem.&rdquo;  I can see a problem in relation to this arising in five years' time. I believe if a person comes into property and in two years' time he disposes of it it should be at the market value on that date, not when he received the property.  I am quite convinced that this amendment should be written into the Bill now.  If a man passes his property on to his son or his nephew any day after April, 1974 and he feels like disposing of it in 1984 outside the family circle it should be valued at the market value at that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if a father passes a rundown business or a rundown farm, which he probably acquired at a very low value, to his son or his nephew it would be a very great disincentive to that young person to build up that business or farm if it is the market value at the time he originally received the property which is taken into account.  It is a good thing for people to plough back profits into farms or business concerns as this creates more employment.  We should try to encourage people to plough back profits into their business concerns, and not build something into this Bill which will discourage <Col N="408" /> them.  I believe the way this Bill is worded it is a disincentive to expansion.  It is fundamentally wrong if you have to trace the value of the property back to 1974 and the property is passed to the man's son in 1980.  We will have to go through the procedure of trying to find when the business or farm was purchased.  There will be anomalies in this in 100 years' time.  It is the market value at the time the property passes to the son, daughter, nephew, niece, son-in-law or daughter-in-law which should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>As regards thresholds this is only a deferment if you want to dispose of your property.  The Minister stated earlier today that this is designed particularly to keep family concerns together. There are occasions in business and in land, which has not been properly worked, where it would be preferable if that land was put on the market and sold to some enterprising young man.  This can act in two ways. It can inhibit the transfer of property on to the public market, which is very desirable, and there is also a disincentive for people to plough back profits into a business or to work land to its fullest capacity.  You will often find there is not full output from a factory due to bad management or the man-aging director may be in poor health and has not the drive or the ability to get the full potential out of that business. If the business is passed from the father to the son this section could discourage him from putting that property on the market.  He could say that a considerable amount of money had been ploughed back into the business since he got it from his father.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Yes, over a long period, over 20 years.  Does the Minister think it would be possible for the Revenue Commissioners to do this?  Does he really think it is possible in the case of a man working a business or a farm, who does not look at the clock at 5 o'clock in the evening to knock off work and quite often burns the <Col N="409" /> midnight oil working in his business or making up his accounts?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister think it would be possible to assess the work of a farmer who spends eight to ten hours a day building up an asset?  Will the Revenue Commissioners be in a position to give an allowance for that type of work?  I do not think they will because it is impossible to assess that. The Revenue Commissioners will be able to do it on a short term basis. They will be able to assess input two or three years before an asset is sold.  It is possible that accounts would be available to be taken into consideration for capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>In the type of situation Deputy Colley mentioned this would not be possible.  It would not be possible to accumulate the accounts over a number of years to set them off against capital gains.  A type of psychology will grow up in people's minds: &ldquo;why should I expand my business?&rdquo; Why should a nephew who received property from an uncle expand when he knows that with the disposal of that property outside the family circle the Revenue Commissioners will go back to the valuation date when it was first purchased?  I cannot see that there would be any great evasion or that anyone would get away with any degree of capital gains tax if the market value on the date of sale was taken into consideration.  If that is not done, the type of situation I have warned about will develop. People will cease to expand their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a property was passed on to me by my father who had purchased it ten years previously, I would be hesitant about ploughing any capital into that business.  If I endeavoured to capitalise my assets, the value would not be taken as that which applied on the day I acquired it but on the date my father acquired it.  I cannot see any logic in that.  Of course, this will not apply to speculators because they do not keep property for any length of time.  They buy the property, develop it and within two or three years they capitalise their assets again. We never had any intention of trying to encourage speculators and on Committee <Col N="410" /> Stage we tabled an amendment which clearly indicated what we would do with speculators.  On the other hand, we gave an indication of the leniency we would show to people who had made a fair endeavour to build up the economy over a number of years.  We gave every encouragement to people to plough their money back.  It was the intention of that amendment to have the charge on a sliding scale after ten or 14 years.</P>
    <P>By encouraging people to plough their money back we felt we would be creating more employment.  That is the philosophy the Government should be following.  We should be encouraging people instead of taxing them.  The philosophy in this Bill is to tax people. Nobody can tell me that it is not a good thing to encourage people to build up their property or business. The Minister's proposals will have a detrimental effect on industry.  Many people do not realise the significance of certain sections of this Bill.  Many, when they see the thresholds in the Capital Acquisition Tax Bill and Capital Gains Tax Bill, are under the impression that they are exempt for all time.  They are not so exempt.  They will only be exempt when this remains within the family circle.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the Minister should not accept Deputy Colley's amendment.  If he did, he would be contributing in a small way to the economy.  The Minister should turn back from this policy because it will have a detrimental effect on the economic expansion of our country.  We should be pursuing the opposite approach and encouraging people at home and abroad to invest their assets here.  We should go all out to attract foreign assets, irrespective of where they are.  This Bill is discouraging the inflow of foreign capital and encouraging the outflow of capital.  The Minister will regret introducing his capital taxation package.  Surely he can see the depressed state of our economy and that there is no hope of generating the capital which is necessary.</P>
    <P>We have been pleading with the Minister since Christmas to do something about these Capital taxation measures but he refused to listen to <Col N="411" /> our plea.  Deputy Colley's amendment will not alter the structure of the Bill but it will ensure that people will be dealt with fairly.  It is not fair to tell the people that death duties have been abolished.  The Government were given credit for abolishing death duties but they should tell the people that they have replaced death duties by three taxation measures.  The Minister for Lands told this House that the wealth tax was replacing death duties without referring to the other Bills before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister for Lands should be fair and tell the people that while the Government have abolished death duties they have introduced three other capital taxation measures to replace them.  It should also be explained that the thresholds will only obtain when the property remains within the family circle.  It should be explained to people with property that when a person is disposing of a farm or business it will go back to the time his father purchased the property, not to the time when his father died and he acquired it.  If the Government want to be fair to people they should tell them exactly what is in the Bill. Bills of this nature are complicated and many people do not understand them.  The Minister should spell out exactly what is replacing death duties. I doubt very much if we will be any beter off with the total package than we were before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision.  One can imagine the disappointment of many people who will be disposing of their property outside of the family circle in ten or 15 years' time.  They will have to go back and find out the value of the property when it was purchased by their father.  The Minister said one can charge against capital input as an expense.  The Minister knows well that that would be rather difficult if one were to take time alone into consideration. The average person would never take into consideration time spent in work and endeavour put into <Col N="412" /> a property of his own.  On a farm a husband and wife may work until 10 o'clock at night.  That is the type of endeavour that cannot be measured in money.  That is the type of endeavour for which the Revenue Commissioners cannot give compensation.  The same applies to a business.  A businessman does not look at the clock and finish work at 5 o'clock.  He may often finish at 12 o'clock at night.  That has built up his assets and expanded his business and more than likely has created more jobs within that business. That is the type of person who should be encouraged.  Now such a person will say to himself: &ldquo;Why should I plough it back?  I might as well go out and play a game of golf at the weekend. I do not see any reason why I should make a great endeavour when if I want to dispose of my property in 15 years' time 26 per cent of it will be taken from me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we are to get anywhere as regards our economic expansion we should encourage work and endeavour.  If we do not do that by compensating people for expanding and developing, our economy will contract still further and we will have more unemployment. At present we need expertise in every field.  We need people who have courage to get out and expand business. It will never be done by excessive taxation unless we want to become a completely socialistic country.  If we do, let us say so.  If the Minister wants a socialist society he should tell us exactly what he has in mind.  To cloak it in this type of Bill is unfair.  I would ask the Minister to seriously reconsider Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister credit that probably what Deputy de Valera said is true and that the Minister, because of the various pressures on him and on his time in recent weeks, has not had an adequate opportunity to examine fully the arguments that were put forward in regard to a number of points on this Bill and specifically the points involved in this amendment as put forward at the Committee Stage.  I am giving the Minister that credit because I think he indicated on the Committee Stage <Col N="413" /> that he could see considerable validity in the points we were making.  In fact at column 1676 of the Official Report of 13th May, 1975, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I have not closed my mind to the suggestion contained in Deputy Colley's amendment.  I would be prepared to have a look at it between now and Report Stage.  However, it would be undesirable to allow the principle involved to be applied extensively.  This could lead to a situation in which there would be holders of substantial wealth who would never be called on to pay tax.</P>
      <P>It seems to me reasonable to conclude from those remarks of the Minister that what he contemplated was that it would be possible to deal with the worst of the situation arising under the section as outlined from this side of the House but that he would contemplate putting certain limitations on the relief that would be given.  In fact, he has no amendment in to do any such thing.  We therefore have to treat the matter as we find it, but I am prefacing my concluding remarks by saying that I am giving the Minister the benefit of the doubt that in fact he did not get an adequate opportunity to examine this fully.  That is very unfortunate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so the Minister is in a worse position than I thought he was because we have got the very grave anomalies and injustices that are arising under this provision whereby if people obtain property under a will when they dispose of it in due course they are going to be assessed to capital gains tax on the alleged gain arising not from the time they acquired it but from the time the deceased person acquired it.  This is so demonstrably unreasonable that if the Minister supports it, having considered <Col N="414" /> the whole position, his position is, to put it mildly, untenable.  The fact is that this kind of proposition is totally wrong, and it is aggravated by the fact that the Minister has refused point blank to provide in this Bill for provision against inflation.  Therefore, the whole accumulation of alleged gain over many years is of course going to be an artificial gain related to inflation and yet the Minister proposes to tax that gain at 26 per cent and to apply that, not to people who are engaged in speculation, but to people who are engaged in farming and business which by nature of the section must be the kind of situation in which they have engaged over many years.  It is the kind of person who, in my view, should not be affected at all by capital gains tax who is really going to be hit by this section as it stands.</P>
      <P>There is a rather ominous mentality revealed in this section and in the Minister's attempted justification of it.  The Minister has on a number of occasions boasted in this House and outside it that he was abolishing death duties and he has quoted quite substantial exemption limits and thresholds but what he actually is saying to justify his action is: &ldquo;If I accept your amendment, then people will be enabled to inherit property below the threshold limit for the capital acquisition tax and pay nothing.&rdquo;  What he is saying is: &ldquo;I am going to impose a form of death duty in a case like this.&rdquo;  That is, in effect, what he is saying.  He has actually used the argument&mdash;he used it today but used it on the last occasion too&mdash;in case there is any doubt I will quote him. At column 1676 of the Official Report for 13th May, 1975, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a legatee were to be treated as acquiring the asset for capital gains tax purposes at its market value, he could dispose of it immediately or very soon after acquisition and escape capital gains tax while, at the same time, because of the very high exemption thresholds which are afforded in the capital acquisition tax he might not be charged to any capital acquisition tax.  This <Col N="415" /> is particularly relevant in the case of transfers on death by parents to their children where the threshold of exemption in respect of each child is £150,000.  The possibility of a charge to capital gains tax on a disposal is intended to ensure that tax is payable at the time of liquidity.</P>
    <P>If we take first of all the case the Minister mentions, the passing by will of property by a parent to a child, the Minister has said that nobody will be affected by this except the very wealthy; there is an exemption of £150,000 in respect of each child.  That is what he said in connection with capital acquisition tax but what he is saying is: &ldquo;I am not going to let them away with that.  They are going to pay capital gains tax and going to pay it at a value assessed away back, not to when they acquired it but to when the parent acquired it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is, in my view, a situation, as called for by Deputy Fitzpatrick, where the public should be told clearly by the Minister just what he is doing. When he talks about applying these exemption limits&mdash;generous, he says, and they would be generous, particularly if he were allowing for inflation, which he is not&mdash;why does he not tell people at the same time that he is applying another form of death duty to those who are exempt as well as to those who are not by calculating capital gains tax at 26 per cent on an artificial gain calculated from a date not when the person acquired the property but when their parents acquired the property?</P>
    <P>I regard this as just sleight of hand and misleading the public to be pretending to abolish death duties in a case like that and then using the very argument that these people are being exempt from capital acquisition tax to say: &ldquo;We are going to apply capital gains tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact is that in the Government's While Paper it was said that this would not be done.  This is another instance where the Minister went back on what the White Paper said was going to be done.  The White Paper said: &ldquo;We will not apply capital <Col N="416" /> gains tax and capital acquisition tax to the one transaction&rdquo; but it is being done here and it is being done because the Minister says that otherwise people would avoid liability.  But, is that not the whole case the Minister has been making, that they are avoiding liability, that they are so much better off than they were under death duties, according to the Minister? But, when you look at the small print, how much better off are they? It is almost certainly true in many cases that people will be far worse off by reason of the small print the Minister is introducing in this way and unlike death duties calculated on the market value on the date of death, in this case it will be calculated on alleged gain accrued back over many years.</P>
    <P>That is the case where you apply the high exemption limit the Minister was talking about but, of course, the Minister knows, as we do, that there are very many other cases where there is no such exemption limit at all.  I referred to one of them, the case of the nephew or niece who has not been living on the farm, if we are dealing with a farm situation.  The limit there is £15,000.  So that in such a case the Minister would take this artificial value, alleged gain, going back over many years, make no allowance for inflation, apply capital gains tax to this alleged gain and then if the market value at the date of death is over £15,000 will also apply capital acquisition tax.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister thinks he can justify this kind of approach and, in particular, how he thinks he can justify it where he is clearly dealing, not with speculators, but with people who have built up a farm or business over many years, the very people who should not be subjected to capital gains tax.  They are the ones who are really being hit here and they are being hit because the Minister will not listen to the case being put forward.  We put it forward on Committee Stage and the Minister indicated that he could see considerable force in it.  He saw snags in dealing with it.  It seemed to me that if he were anxious to deal with the problem <Col N="417" /> he could certainly have done so. He did not do it.  We tried to give him the benefit of the doubt as to why he did not do it but he insists on telling us he did consider it fully and arrived at this decision.  If he did, shame on him to be guilty of such an imposition on people who have worked hard over the years to build up a business or farm and then to be subjected, not alone to a capital acquisition tax but to this underhand form of death duty which the Minister is introducing on a much worse scale than we ever had before.  It is unforgivable of the Minister to do this and even more unforgivable of him to do it in this way when most people do not know that he is applying a form of death duties in this way.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, in the interests of accuracy, honesty and truth, from now on to stop telling us in relation to any particular one of these capital Bills to look at the position under them as compared with death duties.  Would he tell us in all honesty to compare the total position?</P>
    <P>This whole operation that the Minister and his colleagues have been engaged in is a confidence trick on the people, pretending that they are abolishing <Col N="418" /> death duties when in fact, they are imposing a number of other taxes and, apart from what they have announced as in this case, a number of underhand forms of replacement of death duties, as the Minister is doing here.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister that we on this side of the House will have no part in that kind of underhand transaction he is trying to put through here.  He cannot say it happened inadvertently. His attention has been fully drawn to it on Committee Stage and now on Report Stage and he is persisting in doing it.  He is doing it. We are not.</P>

      <P>This was a drafting amendment.  I was notified today by the Ceann Comhairle's Office that this was out of order as it involves a potential charge upon the people.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if that is correct.  It all depends really on what the Minister means by the section, which is what we discussed on Committee Stage.  It would appear that the Chair is in a position to know what the section means.  I do not know and I do not think the Minister knew quite clearly when we discussed it on Committee Stage.  I am in some difficulty here, as the Chair will appreciate. Could some further information be given to elaborate on the statement you have made as to how assets which would otherwise be within the section would be taken out by virtue of this amendment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With due deference, I do not think that is correct.  That may appear to be the position on the basis that my amendment would omit <Col N="421" /> the words in the section &ldquo;assuming that all the assets were situated in the State ...&rdquo; I presume that is the basis for the reasoning.  That is the whole point of the amendment and the discussion we had on Committee Stage. What did that phrase mean?  Did it mean that we were to assume that this applied only to assets situated in the State, or did it mean competent to dispose of assets and if they were situated in the State?  This is a very technical point, I admit, but the whole purpose of the amendment was to try to elucidate the point which had been raised on Committee Stage.  I submit that a person can be competent to dispose of assets which are situate in and outside the State and the effect of my amendment relates to assets of which he could have disposed by his will, does not, in fact, bring in or exclude assets which were not brought in or excluded by the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>I am in some procedural difficulty in that under the Chair's ruling, we have not an amendment before us and, therefore, it is not in order to speak.  I am only too happy to assist in so far as I may be permitted to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision is designed to secure that if the deceased had assets in another country, they would be assumed to be in the State for the purpose of deciding on competency to dispose.  It could happen that foreign assets would be outside his competency to dispose because of the laws of succession in the country where the assets are situated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the amendment which has been ruled out of order, if I understand it right, those assets could not be deemed to be disposable under the will and the protection of section 14 would not extend to them.  There would be a charge, accordingly, to capital gains tax on their transmission on death.  The amendment, therefore, if it were allowed, would be more unfavourable in relation to any foreign assets, which are subject to special succession laws, than the provision <Col N="422" /> in the Bill.  The provision in the Bill thus ensures that while such foreign assets cannot be disposed of by the deceased by his will, by assuming they are in the State they are, for the purposes of section 14, taken away from any restriction of foreign law and will reach the heir at law or other legal successor as if he were the legatee under the will of the deceased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that.  What he has said has, in fact, clarified the point and has done what I sought to achieve by putting down the amendment.  I was concerned solely with the use of the word &ldquo;assuming&rdquo; and the ambiguity which arose from it.  What the Minister has said makes it quite clear what is intended to be achieved by the use of the word &ldquo;assuming&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises from a point raised by Deputy Colley on Committee Stage.

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 17, line 46, to delete &ldquo;Without prejudice to&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;Notwithstanding&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of drafting and trying to get clarity rather than a point of major substance.  On 13th May in the discussion in this House on Committee Stage I pointed out to the Minister the ambiguity that could arise by the use of the words &ldquo;Without prejudice to&rdquo;.  As reported at column 1729 of the Official Report I said:</P>
      <P>It is confusing and in substance what it is saying is that you have two contradictory provisions.  I believe it does not convey, in circumstances where the contradictions arise, that subsection (6) (b) will prevail.  That could be said quite clearly or more clearly.  I urge the Minister to have it looked at again to see if what is intended as described by him cannot be more clearly conveyed in the wording.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>I would agree to do that but my feeling at the moment is that the correct wording has been used.  It provides that subsection (6) (b) will not be overruled by this provision in section 12.</P>
      <P>I freely admit that this phrase &ldquo;Without prejudice to&rdquo; is used in some other section and I did not put down amendments to deal with it.  I did not feel it incumbent on me to go through the whole Bill and do that.  I felt that if the Minister accepted the idea he and the draftsmen would look after these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point at issue here is that two contradictory things are involved. The Minister means to convey that, <Col N="424" /> where such a contradiction arises in particular circumstances, subsection (6) (b) will prevail.  The use of the words &ldquo;Without prejudice to&rdquo; seems to me to be neutral in its effect and, therefore, not to ensure, as the Minister wishes to ensure, that in the particular circumstances subsection (6) (b) would prevail.  I have suggested that instead of that phrase we might use the word &ldquo;Notwithstanding&rdquo; which I suggest is somewhat less neutral.  I think the Minister will agree that he does not want the phrase used to be so neutral as not to make it clear that subsection (6) (b) would prevail in the appropriate circumstances.  My fear is that the phrase used in the Bill is so neutral as not to make that clear. The slightly different nuance in the use of the word &ldquo;Notwithstanding&rdquo; being slightly less neutral would convey what the Minister is trying to convey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opposite view.  I think the words &ldquo;Without prejudice to&rdquo; are better.  The danger of using the word &ldquo;Notwithstanding&rdquo; is that it may suggest some element of exclusion of subsection (6) (b).  The word &ldquo;Notwithstanding&rdquo; suggests a conflict between subsection 12 (b) and subsection (6) (b), whereas no conflict is intended.</P>
      <P>The treatment of income in subsection (6) (b) and the annuity in subsection 12 (b) is the same.  Each is treated as a separate settlement. Subsection (12) (b) extends the treatment in subsection (6) (b) to an annuity which is a charge on particular assets and, therefore, is, in substance, treated as a life interest in income of a separate settlement. There is really no conflict and the words &ldquo;Without prejudice to&rdquo; in circumstances of no conflict seem to be the right ones to use.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should give an illustration. There could be a fund in which A has a life interest in income but the fund is charged to provide an annuity to B.  Subsection (12) (b) would cover the annuity and subsection (6) (b) would continue to cover the balance of the fund even though part of the fund has been appropriated to the annuity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a nice little point of wording here.  I should not like to say how a court would interpret between the two words.  The Minister seems to say that &ldquo;Without prejudice to&rdquo; would mean that paragraph (b) would operate in its entirety. Although the Minister says there is no logical contradiction as to part, in the sense that there is a specific matter to be covered by subsection (12) (b).  If that is also to some extent captured by subsection (6) (b), then subsection (6) (b) might prevail over subsection (12) (b) in all circumstances. It is open to that interpretation. Deputy Colley's word &ldquo;Notwithstanding&rdquo; means that the narrow provision of subsection (12) (b) will rule in face of subsection (6) (b) and the residue will be caught by subsection (6) (b).  It is a nice point of argument. Taking the words alone, without going into the actual case, it seems to me that subsection 6 (b) covers a general situation.  Subsection 12 (b) is designed to cover the one and only&mdash;if you like, call it technically an &ldquo;exception&rdquo;, or an &ldquo;addition&rdquo; outside of subsection 6 (b).  Would the Minister agree if I go that far?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a generality in subsection 6 (b) to which there is, technically, an exception&mdash;but we will call it an addition&mdash;in subsection 12 (b).  What the Minister wants to do is safeguard the generality of subsection 6 (b) but to provide also, specifically and independently, for the addition in subsection 12 (b), but saving subsection 6 (b) for every other contingency.  I think Deputy Colley and the Minister are agreed so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let us consider the two forms of words.  The word &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo; in subsection 12 (b) goes only <Col N="426" /> so far as what is specifically said in subsection 12 (b) because the wording of subsection 6 (b) says&mdash;without qualification, for the purposes of subsection (5).  Therefore, whether one uses the words &ldquo;without prejudice to&rdquo; or &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo; the intention and possibly the effect&mdash;because we are walking on a knife edge here and Deputy Colley will not disagree with me when I say there is merit in the Minister's point of view also&mdash;in both cases is that subsection 12 (b) will operate only in the specific circumstances set out in that subsection and that every other case is ruled by subsection 6 (b).</P>
    <P>So far for common case.  Let us now take the two forms of wording in that context.  &ldquo;Without prejudice to&rdquo; could be interpreted as meaning that subsection 6 (b) overruled subsection 12 (b).  This is the type of submission I would make in court, if I had to, that subsection 12 (b)&mdash;if the words &ldquo;without prejudice to&rdquo; are used, as Deputy Colley said&mdash;is more than neutral. I might argue that the words &ldquo;without prejudice to&rdquo; are unqualifyingly putting subsection 6 (b) in the ruling position and, being in the ruling position, would overrule subsection 12 (b).  I am not saying that argument is as strong as I make it at present but I want to ensure that we understand what we are doing.  If that interpretation were to be in aid of the taxpayer&mdash;and this is a taxing statute&mdash;the court would seize on that interpretation, if it is available.  I am trying to say to the Minister that it is available and that the use of the words &ldquo;without prejudice to&rdquo;&mdash;if a taxpayer were in the position of involving subsection 6 (b) in his aid to overrule the disadvantage contained in the application of subsection 12 (b) to his case, the court might very well take the view and might even say, in a judgment: the words used are &ldquo;without prejudice to&rdquo;; it would be different were the word &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo; used.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I put it to the Minister that there is merit in what Deputy Colley says because the word &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo; means that subsection 6 (b) rules.  But, if one reads the two together in a legal sense, the provisions <Col N="427" /> of subsection 12 (b) will apply in the appropriate case, as provided in the section.  There is no doubt about that.  There is the technical danger&mdash; particularly when one is dealing with a taxing statute&mdash;in the case I have tried to suggest, though frankly, I cannot cite a probable case; I am speaking on the principle more than anything else&mdash;that if, perchance, a taxpayer wished to invoke that argument, then applying the canons of construction applicable to taxing statutes, the way out would be found in the words &ldquo;without prejudice to&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While fully appreciating what the Minister says, freely admitting that we are a little near hair-splitting, and I think Deputy Colley would not press it any further than it should be; approaching it from a judicial point of view and with that, admittedly, possible danger, the Minister has been so haunted with ghosts of evasion and so on on other occasions, perhaps a little haunting on this side of the House might not be any harm.  On balance, I would suggest that probably Deputy Colley has a point in his amendment.</P>

      <P>If the Chair and my colleagues will permit, I should like to pose this problem which I think may help to explain the use of the words &ldquo;without prejudice to&rdquo;.  I am sure it will be agreed that the two interests do not necessarily coincide in point of time.  The interest in subsection 6 (b) might terminate before that in subsection 12 (b).  Even though there would be no cessation of the interest in subsection 12 (b) there would be no cessation under subsection 6 (b) and, therefore, it should prevail.  The use of the words &ldquo;without prejudice to&rdquo; mean that it would prevail.  However, if we used the word &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo; it would be subsection 12 (b) and not subsection 6 (b) that would prevail in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>We draw attention to what I considered to be an ambiguity on Committee Stage.  The amendment I have put down is by no means the best I could do in the circumstances. Indeed, when one gets involved in the semantics, it is possible to say one could argue either way&mdash;in favour of what is in the section or what is in the amendment.  The real point I had in putting down the amendment was to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that that possible ambiguity existed.  In fact, I shall tell him I had a form of amendment almost prepared which was very much on the lines of what Deputy de Valera was saying and spelling out precisely what would happen.  Frankly, I came to the conclusion that the thing was getting so complex merely to remove the ambiguity involved in this matter I was not going to concern myself unduly with it, not being the parliamentary draftsman.  I put down the amendment merely to draw the attention of the Minister to it.  I have done that and, if the Minister is satisfied with the wording &ldquo;without prejudice to&rdquo;, as he has it, and if he thinks there is no ambiguity involved, I have done my duty and shall not press it any further.  All I want to say is that it is certainly possible to amend the subsection in a way that will leave no ambiguity whatever.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 17, line 60, after &ldquo;£500&rdquo; to add&mdash;&ldquo;provided that where, by virtue of section 13 (1), gains accruing to a married woman during a year of assessment, or part of a <Col N="429" /> year of assessment, are assessed on her husband he will not be chargeable to Capital Gains Tax if the amount on which he is chargeable for that year of assessment does not exceed £1,000, and provided further that, where, by virtue of section 13 (2) a husband and wife are separately assessed for capital gains tax in any year of assessment, the husband shall not be charged to capital gains tax if the amount on which he is chargeable for that year does not exceed £500 and the wife shall not be chargeable to capital gains tax if the amount on which she is so chargeable for that year does not exceed £500&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>You will be very glad to hear that the purpose of this amendment is, within the terms of this Bill, to give due recognition to the role of married women.  We referred to this matter on the Committee Stage.  I think the Minister will find that all the amendments we have down on Report Stage relate to matters which were referred to on Committee Stage and in respect of which the Minister indicated either agreement or willingness to consider the point further.  In regard to this point at column 1674 of the Official Report of 13th May, 1975 I am reported as saying:</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider again the point we made to him in regard to the allowance for the husband and wife in the light of the separate treatment of husband and wife in subsection (5)?</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I will.</P>
    <P>There is no amendment in from the Minister and, therefore, there is an amendment in from us.  The basic concept in the Capital Gains Tax Bill is that the husband and the wife are one person and that there is no regard to their being separate persons in so far as transactions between them are concerned.</P>
    <P>However, when we come to a very important matter dealt with in subsection (5), we find that that concept disappears, that is where the transaction involves trading assets.  When that happens the concept goes out the <Col N="430" /> window and the husband and wife are regarded as separate persons.  The practical consequences of them being regarded as one person is that whereas a single individual has an exemption from capital gains tax of up to £500 in any one year a married couple have an allowance of only £500.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister that this treatment of the married woman in this case is unfair to her and to her husband and is a continuation of the mentality revealed, I am afraid, in all of these capital taxation Bills of regarding the married woman as merely an appendage to her husband, having no separate existence whatever, unless something arises like trading assets.  That is important as it is a business and, therefore, you take a different approach there but otherwise a married woman, in effect, does not count in this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I know the Minister will say that this is because where trading assets are concerned that brings in an income tax consideration. I suggest to him that so far as there is an income tax consideration that should be left aside.  He argued very strongly on an earlier amendment that any allowances arising under the income tax code have to be kept totally out of the capital gains tax code.  I ask him to follow out that precept, forget the whole income tax code, look at the situation under this Bill, in relation to capital gains tax, and see the situation in which the single person has an allowance of £500 but the married couple have an allowance of only £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past this has been the general approach under all our statutes, but this is 1975 and we have come a considerable distance since the legislation dealing with income tax and other matters, which automatically placed the married woman in the category of non-existence for the purposes of the law.  I believe we have now reached the stage where we can, without any great risk to anybody, including the Exchequer, extend to a married couple an allowance which is the equivalent of that given to two single <Col N="431" /> people.  There is no great risk involved in this for the Exchequer.  There is an argument involved in it of the separate and independent status of the married woman, a recognition to which, I suggest, she is entitled at this late stage.  The Minister should not perpetuate in this legislation an attitude which has its roots in legislation going back a very long time.</P>
    <P>This is not justifiable in 1975 and, in particular, for a Government which, hollow though it may sound now, held themselves to be progressive and advanced in their social thinking. However hollow that may sound I imagine the Minister would like to try, if he could, to hold on to what little shred of that aura may remain attached to the Government.  There is no chance that he can do so if he persists in enacting legislation, which is modelled on and carries forward into 1975, attitudes to married women which should now be long behind us and which may have been generally acceptable many years ago when the legislation involved was being introduced but which is not acceptable today.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, urge the Minister very strongly to accept this amendment or if he does not like it, to substitute one of his own, but to achieve a situation in which a husband and a wife will have available to them an allowance which is the equivalent of that available to two single people.  I will not at this stage go into the details of the amendment which goes a little further than that.  It deals with a situation where they are being assessed together or assessed separately. That is the purpose of the amendment and I hope the Minister will not now refuse to accept that purpose and will not now refuse to accept the principle involved in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I must defend married women against the attack Deputy Colley wants to make on them.  I have provided in this legislation that a husband and a wife are to be given very favourable treatment in so far as transfers between them are not chargeable and the <Col N="432" /> losses of one may be set off against the gains of the other.  That is very favourable treatment.  The acceptance of Deputy Colley's amendment would do away with that.</P>

      <P>They would have to be treated as separate persons if they are to get separate allowances.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They will be paying less tax as a result of the generous and progressive outlook we have.  The Opposition would want us to treat them as separate persons, to consider that they were not joined together in holy and happy wedlock to share the advantages which we want to give them under which gifts from one to the other would not be chargeable and the losses of one could be set off against the gains of the other.  Is that a desirable thing or not?  If the Opposition think it is desirable they should not be pressing to introduce some amendments which would sever that particular unity which they have and which allows them these advantages which would not be available to single persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of unmarried persons is not analogous.  They have the £500 allowance but transfers between unmarried persons are chargeable and there cannot be any interchange of losses against gains.  They cannot <Col N="433" /> pool their incomes and capital gains for the purpose of the alternative charge as can be done in the case of husband and wife.  I cannot accept that there is anything illogical in what we are doing in the exception to joint treatment made in the proviso to subsection (5) of section 13.  That is a relieving provision to prevent double charge to income tax and capital gains tax.  It does not involve any departure from the principle of joint treatment which works to the advantage of each partner in marriage.  The gain under that treatment is much greater than the occasional gain that might be enjoyed by such married couples as constituted partners with separate capital of their own.  Such persons do not represent the majority of married persons, and I cannot relish the prospect of severing the benefit which husband and wife can enjoy under the Bill as drafted in order to get for the occasional capitalist married woman the advantage that Deputy Colley's amendment would seek to confer on the exception and in so doing imperil the majority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister breaks my heart when he says he has provided favourable treatment for man and wife.  He has created a situation where, as Deputy Colley said, the woman does not exist once she gets married.  We had this out with the Minister's colleague on the wealth tax.  The Minister for Lands referred to the fact that some European countries had unfair treatment which does not apply in the modern European community.  The countries applying unequal treatment introduced their legislation many years ago.  The Minister is introducing his legislation this year following our joining the European Community.  It is presumed that we subscribe to the general principles of that Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the Minister must not have benefited from his journeys to Europe as the Minister for Labour has because the latter Minister is strong on equal pay.  Let us assume that a wife has money.  We can have a situation where a married couple can have grown-up descendants over the age of 21 and each of them <Col N="434" /> could qualify for a capital gains threshold of £500 but the wife would not qualify for anything except splitting it with her husband.  If the Minister was introducing this legislation 20 or 30 years ago or prior to our joining the EEC there might be some justification for being conservative and backward-looking.  However, the legislation is being introduced in 1975 and we are presumed to be aspiring to the general principles of the European Community and of equality.  I do not see any justification for the Minister sticking to this backward principle that when two people get married the wife ceases to exist.</P>
    <P>It means that the Minister, when reflecting on this principle during his journeys in the past few weeks, must have been thinking of the tax revenue and not of the principle involved.  He has more information available to him than any Member as to what the difference would be in tax revenue but, nevertheless, in starting off on the wrong foot with fresh legislation the Minister is making a mistake.  There is no need to repeat what we said on the Wealth Tax Bill because it tends to be picked up by journalists.  It is ridiculous to have £500 for an individual and £500 for a man and wife. The best the Minister can do is to provide the very favourable treatment that they can have a plus and minus situation between them.  It is as well that the Minister went that far because he would be hearing a lot about it if he did not.</P>
    <P>In introducing this legislation the Minister is overlooking the economic principle that exchange and sale is good for business and, therefore, good for the community.  The Minister is wrong in the application of this flat rate of tax to all irrespective of whether they have put years of work into earning the capital or whether it is the easy speculator money which ought to be caught.  The Minister should be applying the principle of equality to people whether they are married or single.  He should be giving the benefit to the family which the Minister, like this side of the House, believes I am sure should have prior position in life here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I join with Deputy Colley and Deputy Brugha in supporting the amendment.  Right through the capital taxation Bills there is the same anomaly.  Last week we discussed with the Minister for Lands the anomaly that a married man and woman are entitled to £100,000, whereas two single people living together would be entitled to a threshold of £140,000. We find the same anomaly in this section.  Two single persons over 21 years of age would be entitled to £500 each.  If two people are fortunate enough to be married, for that happiness they are penalised; they can get the benefit of only £500.  Basically, that is wrong.</P>
      <P>There should be a new concept in regard to allowances where a man and wife are concerned.  We have reached the stage where the status of women is very important.  We have heard a great deal about it over the past few years.  Women have been gaining their independence and are looking for equality, and rightly so. This is Women's Year in which women have special pride of place. The Minister had an opportunity in new legislation of introducing a new concept in regard to allowances.  I see no reason why the Minister cannot accept Deputy Colley's amendment. It is disheartening for a married woman that her friends can get exemption of £500 each whereas she is not so entitled.  A woman could leave a farm where her two sisters are living and they would be entitled individually to an exemption of £500.  When she leaves that farm and joins her husband on another farm, together they are entitled to only £500.  Fundamentally, this is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, to prove his case, dragged in some red herrings.  At no time did we expect that the Minister would disallow the other privileges which are conferred on a married man and woman.  Naturally, we expect those to stand.  We are asking here for something additional.  This would involve a very minor charge on the Exchequer but it would be a gesture in the right direction, a new type of legislation, new thinking. Instead, we get the same restrictive <Col N="436" /> measures throughout these capital taxation Bills.  The Minister has gone out of his way on several occasions to ensure that every loophole is closed.  Rightly so.  That is what we are here for, to ensure that there are no loopholes whereby the legislation can be abused.  The Minister has an obligation and a duty to recognise that married people are entitled to exemption in their own right.  We have argued this in relation to the wealth tax.  It has been debated on this Bill. We debated it on Second Stage and on Committee Stage.  We firmly believe that what Deputy Colley is seeking here is fully justified.</P>
    <P>The amendment is not put down for the sake of putting down an amendment.  We are quite sincere in regard to it.  We believe it is right and proper that a man and woman living together would each be entitled to the £500 allowance.  Are there exemptions in other parts of the Bill in the case where a husband and wife are legally separated?  Could they claim the exemption?  It is probably in some section.  I can visualise a situation where a husband and wife are separated although not legally so.  Is there any provision in the Bill for exemption in that type of situation?</P>

      <P>If the Minister accepts the amendment he will be bringing modern thinking into legislation.  That is what the legislation is about, to keep up with the times.  We must move with European legislation.  As Deputy Brugha has said, the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Labour, Deputy O'Leary is moving with European legislation in regard to equal pay and other matters.  There is no reason why we should not lead the way, rather than follow others. The Bills that have come into the House over the past two or three years are mere photo-copies of the legislation in other European countries.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be very sympathetic to married women but I detect the legacies of the harem mentality here in this.  There are a couple of specific points in what the Minister said to be answered.  The question is in what order you have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I want to make a general observation.  In his reaction the Minister let drop the phrase &ldquo;capitalistic married women&rdquo;.  I told the Minister this morning that the horses were running away with him.  There may be very few capitalistic married women.  We may be moving very rapidly into an organised form of socialism where everybody will be brought to order, where everybody will contribute, where the standard of living will be lower, where there will be discipline.  The Minister's doctrinaire socialist approach has been bringing the wagon of State along that road, and I warned him this morning the horses may be running away with him.  That phrase of his was a revealing phrase, and I would advise the Minister to think over what he says and question what the consequences may be, because there are very many sincere people who may wish for a freer and more prosperous economy than can ever be achieved under this Government and not the chaotic disaster that is going to follow from this <Col N="438" /> Coalition.  It is a long time since there was a Blum coalition in France; it is a long time since there was the German set-up known as the Weimar Republic. Today we have a third disastrous coalition here and the Minister should be very careful about phrases like &ldquo;capitalist married women&rdquo;.  He may think they are emotive and politically attractive, but the situation is so serious now that people are cogitating seriously on such phrases and wondering seriously where the economy is going.  I suggest to the Minister that he should either be a little more forthright or else a little less facile of tongue.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about sums in the region of £500.  What is £500 in our present inflationary situation?  We spoke yesterday about the inflationary situation and I understand the Minister himself in another place talked about local inflation.  What is £500 from the point of view of wages and from the point of view of what is happening to the £ sterling or the Irish punt, however we measure it at the moment?  Thirty years ago £500 was a comfortable enough salary for someone pretty well placed in the public service.  To give an example, an Army commandant's pay was then £500.  Today £500 is one-third or a quarter at best of the annual salary of the lowest paid clerical worker in the State service.  When we talk about concessions and sums like £500 let us get our measures right.  The same £500 will be worth a great deal less in a short space of time.  Let the Minister do his sums.  He thinks he will achieve a great deal in this budget by reducing the rate of increase from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.  Now £500 reduced by 20 per cent is £400 and that is the value it will be by the time this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>In the light of what the Minister said a moment ago let us look at this amendment.  The Minister makes a gesture designed to oppose the sanctity of marriage and he has made certain provisions for interchange between husband and wife.  Full credit to him for that, but he then states that this amendment would be contrary to principle.  In section 13 (1) <Col N="439" /> we have the principle the Minister is talking about in regard to the unity of husband and wife, but that is breached immediately in subsection (2) which provides for an alternative. There is nothing rigid then about the principle because it is contradicted, and rightly so.  There is no quarrel with the Minister in that, but it is a spurious argument to suggest that acceptance of Deputy Colley's amendment would be a breach of principle and throw the two people concerned into separateness.  The Minister has done that already in subsection (2) and so his argument does not hold water.  Section 13 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this section, the amount of capital gains tax on chargeable gains accruing to a married woman in a year of assessment, or part of a year of assessment, during which she is a married woman living with her husband shall be assessed and charged on the husband and not otherwise, but this subsection shall not affect the amount of capital gains tax chargeable on the husband apart from this subsection nor result in the additional amount of capital gains tax charged on the husband by virtue of this subsection being different from the amount which would otherwise have remained chargeable on the married woman.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (2) provides:</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) shall not apply in relation to a husband and wife in any year of assessment if, before the 6th day of July in the year next following that year of assessment, an application is made by either the husband or wife that subsection (1) shall not apply, and such an application duly made shall have effect not only as respects the year of assessment for which it is made but also for any subsequent year of assessment:</P>
    <P>Provided that if the applicant gives, for any subsequent year of assessment, a notice withdrawing that application, the application shall not have effect with respect to the year <Col N="440" /> for which the notice is given or any subsequent year but such notice of withdrawal shall not be valid unless it is given before the 6th day of July in the year next following the year of assessment for which the notice is given.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister has hardly a debating point in the light of those two subsections when he tries to claim that Deputy Colley's amendment is a breach of principle, because he asks if there is a gain not exceeding £1,000 that £500 can be apportioned between the husband and the wife. On that argument, point one is that there is no breach of principle.  Point two has been made by Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Brugha.  This is an additional provision, without any prejudice to what the Minister has done already.  It will not prejudice in any way what the Minister is doing for husband and wife.  It is a little bit more, something that enables the husband and wife, living together as a unit, to get more benefit.  That is what it all boils down to.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about capitalistic married women, but there will not be many left.  This will not be a problem nor will it affect the revenue but it might affect the windfalls which could come to the so-called lower middle classes&mdash;the people who have been working hard to get their houses, to establish stability, who are living in a certain modicum of comfort which they have worked hard to get; people in jobs in the city, lower grade executives and many people in the public service; people who are good citizens and are interested in making their families good citizens.  Surely they are not begrudged a little windfall. On that basis, I strongly urge support for Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>
    <P>At the rate money is depreciating £1,000 is not worth a very great deal. All we are asking is that the Minister allow £500 for each, which they would get if they were single.  Somebody said that under another Act if they were two single people they would get more relief, £140 as against £100.  There is no contradiction in principle here.  It is being offered as an addition.  Do <Col N="441" /> not say we cannot afford it.  This is not for the capitalistic married woman.  As I said, I am interested in the occasional windfall which may come to the husband and wife in the lower middle income group who have reared their families.  This windfall need not exceed £1,000.  To our capitalistic friends £1,000 will not mean very much, especially at the rate money is depreciating.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to extend his generosity&mdash;and I refrain from appealing to him on any other grounds&mdash;on the basis of his protestations of interest in the married couple living, to use his words, &ldquo;in holy wedlock&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>But there is more, as the Minister seemed to recognise, in section 13. What about all this talk about equality for women?  What about all this talk about equal pay and equal rights?  Here is an opportunity for the Minister to demonstrate his sincerity. In this case generosity, like honesty, might be the best policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by the Minister earlier and by him again now, is that if he were to accept this amendment it would take away the benefits applying to husbands and wives in the Bill.  Of course, it would not do any such thing.  The Minister is saying that if he accepted that, he would take away the benefits in the Bill.  This amendment would be in addition to the other provisions of the Bill.  There is only one way the benefits could be taken away and that is if the Minister were to do so.  This amendment does not take them away. We are not proposing to take them away.  The Minister is threatening to take them away if this amendment is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="442" /> I do not want to get into a broader field but the Minister's attitude to this is somewhat reminiscent of something he said in his budget speech of taking things away if certain things did not happen.  Let us be clear about who will take away these rights.  Not us. We are not proposing that in this amendment.  We are saying that the Bill provides (a) a transfer of assets between husband and wife and is not subject to capital gains tax.  That is correct.  It also provides that losses incurred by a husband or wife may be set off against the gains of the other. We agree.  We are not suggesting that should be taken away, nor does the amendment so provide.</P>
    <P>What we are saying is that in addition to that there ought to be a provision such as we have in the amendment, to ensure that where the husband and wife are assessed together the amount of exemption they will get in any one year will be £1,000, the equivalent of that given to two single people.  Alternatively if they are assessed separately each of them should get the exemption of £500 given to single people.  We on this side of the House do not think such treatment would be too generous for married couples or for married women.  Apparently the Minister thinks it would be too generous because he says if he were to do this he would have to take away the other benefits.  I do not see why he would have to take them away.  I do not think it is too generous treatment for a married couple.  The Minister does.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier when proposing the amendment, the whole thinking in this Bill, and in the other measures on capital taxation, is so redolent of the attitude embodied in legislation passed in the earlier part of the century and, indeed, in the last century, as to be almost unbelievable. One could say this emerged because of the way the Bill was drafted, and that the parliamentary draftsman was following precedent in existing legislation, and that is how it crept in, but we heard what the Minister had to say on this amendment.  Lo and behold, out he came with his phrase about capitalistic married women.  The cat was out of the bag.  Whatever his <Col N="443" /> protestations the Minister is as great a&mdash;if I may use the phrase; it is part of the vernacular now&mdash;male chauvin-istic pig as there is available in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The only person in this House who wants to take away any of the rights of married women or married couples is the Minister.  Nobody on this side of the House has said or has proposed in an amendment that that should be done.  The only person who proposes this is the Minister. What we want to do is, in addition to the provisions of the Bill, to give this treatment I have outlined which would treat a married couple in the same way as single people.</P>
      <P>As I was saying, the Minister's general attitude in this matter came out in what he had to say.  The draftsman cannot be blamed because he was following precedent.  It is the Minister's thinking that we have in this Bill.  It is the Minister's thinking that we have in the Wealth Tax Bill where the same thing applies.  I wonder how many married women know just how far back sociologically speaking this Government are.  It is not a question of what the Minister says.  Nor is it a question of what the Minister for Labour says, and frequently he does make noises about the rights of women.  The real test is: what are the actions of the Government? What have they in their legislation in 1975, International Women's Year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What they have in their legislation is precisely the same attitude as was contained in, for instance, the original <Col N="444" /> Income Tax Acts or in earlier legislation from other countries which the Minister for Lands quoted here in connection with the Wealth Tax Bill in the same general area of the rights of married women.  Those attitudes may have been acceptable then.  They are simply not acceptable now.  There is no use in the Minister trying to bluff his way out by saying he is trying to save the rights of married women. Nobody is trying to take them away except the Minister.  Why we should not give this additional small benefit to married couples in general, and married women in particular, is beyond me.</P>
    <P>It is of some significance that the Minister did not contend that this would create a problem for the Exchequer. We do not know whether it would, although a number of speakers on this side of the House surmised that it would not create a problem.  The fact that the Minister did not make that point can reasonably be taken to mean that it would not, in fact, create a problem for the Exchequer.  As Deputy de Valera pointed out, because there is no provision in this Bill for inflation, the allowance we are talking about of £500 for the married woman or £1,000 for the married couple is really quite a small allowance and getting smaller by the week and by the day.</P>
    <P>As Deputy de Valera also pointed out, the people we want to see, and the general public want to see, paying capital gains tax are not people to whom an allowance of £500 or £1,000 in a year would mean anything.  What is involved here is the ordinary person who, as Deputy de Valera said, gets a windfall.  The Minister does not want him to get it.  I do not know why, considering that a financial problem does not seem to be involved.  The Minister is either activated by his Victorian approach to married women and their rights or, alternatively, he is so obsessed with the purely theoretical capital gains tax that he cannot let go of the idea that it should be applied to all alleged gains as he indicated in the White Paper when, for instance, he wanted to apply capital gains tax to alleged gains on the sale <Col N="445" /> of a private residence.  He dropped that afterwards, but it was against the principle of the Bill that he should drop it.  Apparently he feels this principle would be breached by giving this slight additional benefit to married couples and, in particular, by recognising the independent separate position of married women.</P>
    <P>Whether or not they are, in the Minister's words, capitalistic married women, they should in my view, as a matter of right, as individuals, as citizens, be entitled to equal treatment. The Minister refuses to give that.  He chooses to do this, not we. We want to give it to them.  The Minister refuses.  He threatens that if this were to be given, he would take away such benefits as they get in the Bill.  We do not threaten that.  We do not want that.  We do not propose it.  Our amendment does not propose it.  Only the Minister threatens to take them away.</P>
    <P>It all adds up to the fact that members of this Government may talk at <Col N="446" /> great length about their concern with the rights of women.  They may talk at even greater length about their progressive attitude but, when it comes to the crunch, as it does in this Bill, and in this amendment, we see what kind of Government they really are.  They are way back.  They have not even learned that in 1975, women, and in particular married women, have their rights of themselves, as individuals, as citizens.  This Government do not propose to give them those rights.  We have tried to give them to them but the Minister, and the troops he has behind him, will ensure that, as long as this Government are in office, women will not get those rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 20, to delete line 8.</P>
      <P>As in the case of a previous amendment in our name, this matter was also referred to during the Committee Stage discussion.  We are seeking here to delete from the list of items on which gains are not chargeable and losses are not allowable, land bonds. As I said, this matter was referred to on Committee Stage and the case for excluding land bonds was put with, I believe, considerable cogency by a number of Deputies.  At the end of the discussion, as reported at column 367 of the Official Report on 21st May last I said:</P>
      <P>The Minister is undertaking to have a look at the situation, is that correct?</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>Yes.</P>
      <P>Since, again, there is no amendment from the Minister on this matter we can only assume that he looked at the situation and decided not to do it. The section that is involved here is section 19 and it lists a number of items, including Government loans, stock issued by local authorities or harbour boards, stocks or debentures issued by various State bodies and it says, in respect of all of these, that they shall not be chargeable.  The list includes land bonds issued under the Land Purchase Acts.  The purpose of this amendment is to delete from the section the reference to &ldquo;land bonds under the Land Purchase Acts&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the face of it this might seem to be a peculiar omission, but the reality of the situation is that when land bonds are issued to people in payment of land taken from them by the Land Commission they are, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out on the Committee Stage, that very day considerably devalued.  As time passes thereafter they are devalued still further unless the holders happen to be fortunate enough to be involved in <Col N="449" /> the draw which takes place at certain intervals in respect of which land bonds are redeemed.  If people are not fortunate enough in that way they are given security which, as I said, on the day it is issued is considerably devalued and thereafter tends to be devalued still more.  That being the reality, there is no question of the great majority of holders of land bonds making any capital gains whatever in respect of them but there is the question, in respect of the holders of most of the land bonds, that they will sustain capital losses and because the land bonds are included in this section the holders of those land bonds will not be entitled to claim those losses against any capital gains they may make in respect of any other assets they may have.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, as I said, it might seem a rather odd proposition to exclude land bonds from this list, but I do not think it can be said of any other securities included in this section that the great majority of the holders of those securities can, with certainty, state now that at any time in the foreseeable future they will suffer capital losses and have no hope of a capital gain.  Where that is the reality it is perpetrating an injustice on the holders of land bonds.  To include them in this section knowing that the direct consequence of doing that is that one is depriving the holders of land bonds of the right to claim the losses they sustain on those land bonds as against any capital gains they may have from other assets is an injustice.</P>
    <P>The situation of land bonds is different from the other securities also in that they are not voluntarily acquired from the Land Commission as in the case of all the other securities mentioned in the section where there is a voluntary decision by the holder to purchase them at issue.  In the case of land bonds the holder of them is forced to take them very unwillingly, knowing that they are devalued immediately they are given to him in exchange for property which has a certain market value.  The moment a person is given these land bonds their value will be in the main.  10 to 15 per cent less on the day they are issued than the value of <Col N="450" /> the land.  Thereafter they go down in value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Land bonds issued recently&mdash;by that I mean in the last two months&mdash;were, on the day of issue worth considerably less than their par value.  Given a choice the people to whom the Land Commission issue the land bonds would not take them; they would take cash or some of the other securities mentioned in this section.  That is another fundamental difference between land bonds and the other securities listed in the section. Therefore, there is a strong case in equity why land bonds should be excluded from this section so as to enable the holders to claim in respect of the losses they are going to incur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two major reasons why land bonds differ from the other securities listed in the section.  What might on the face of it appear to be a somewhat strange proposal is not as strange as it seems.  The distinguishing marks between land bonds and the other securities listed in the section are the virtual certainty of loss and the fact that they are not taken voluntarily and for those reasons one is entitled to regard them differently from the other securities listed in the section.  That being so I suggest to the Minister that equity requires that he accept this amendment.  Acceptance of this amendment would not be a breach of any principle he might consider was involved in relation to the listing of what might be called, in general terms, State and semi-State and local authority securities.  The Minister need not have any worries on that score for the <Col N="451" /> reasons I mentioned, the distinguishing features of land bonds as distinct from the other securities.</P>
    <P>We have every cause for worrying if because of this section as drafted the Minister were to force people not only to take land bonds but to accept the capital losses involved without any hope of being able to set them off against any capital gains.  I am concerned at the fact that, this case having been made and the Minister having indicated on Committee Stage that he was prepared to give consideration to it, he has not produced an amendment to do what my amendment seeks to do. Despite that concern I am not without hope that the Minister will find it possible to accept the amendment because the reasons for its acceptance are compelling. Any reasons advanced against it to say the least, cannot be as compelling. I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully suggest that the amendment is out of order because the effect of it would be to impose a charge in certain circumstances. As I pointed out to the Deputy the experience in recent times has been contrary to what I know has been the usual experience in relation to land bonds.  Clearly they are Government securities and there is no justification for treating them in any different way from other Government paper.  The other point I made is one which is worthy of consideration.</P>

      <P>Land bonds certainly fall into a different category than any other type of public issue in the sense that they are not being bought by people initially.  This matter was discussed in the House and the Opposition did not agree with the principle of the type of land bond involved because the recipients of land bonds are in most cases in a position where the land is being taken from them compulsorily.  It is not a choice <Col N="453" /> of purchase or selection as far as they are concerned.  Land Bonds have tended to fall in value once they have been issued and this is a measure of injustice.  If there was a benefit to be gained by the holders of these bonds this benefit ought to be considered by the Minister.  He should bear in mind that they tend to fall on issue.</P>

      <P>Estimates of changes in the value of money are based on the consumer price index numbers which are calculated only in respect of mid-February, mid-May, mid-August and mid-November each year.  It is estimated on the basis of the index numbers that £1 at mid-May, 1975, would purchase the same quantum of goods and services at retail prices as 45.6 pence would have purchased at mid-May, 1968.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit due from 2nd June, 1975, was issued on 25th June, 1975, to the person concerned. Benefit was not payable in respect of the period of the claim prior to 2nd June, 1975, as the claimant had less than the minimum number of contributions in the contribution year governing that period of the claim.</P>

      <P>It was decided by a deciding officer that unemployment benefit was not payable on the claim made by the person concerned on 5th June, 1975, on the ground that the claimant did not satisfy the contribution condition which requires that not less than 26 employment contributions have been paid or credited in respect of him in the 1974 contribution year. Information which has come to hand indicates that the claimant may be entitled <Col N="342" /> to further credited contributions for the 1974 insurance year in respect of periods of training by An Chomhairle Oiliúna.  Inquiries in the matter are proceeding and it is hoped to have these concluded in a few days.  The claim for unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the results. The person concerned did not apply for a qualification certificate for unemployment assistance purposes although advised to do so.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed and is receiving retirement pension from my Department with effect from 25th July, 1974.  His position in regard to old age contributory pension has been examined, and it has been ascertained that on his insurance record he would qualify for this pension at the rate of £16.95 a week, which is the rate of retirement pension he is at present receiving.  It is, accordingly, of no advantage to him to transfer to old age contributory pension.</P>
