    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will extend the time limit for alterations to the draft register of electors from 15th January to 15th February, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is no necessity to have the time limits extended on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in some counties at least, and certainly in County Galway, the draft register was not circulated to elected members until shortly before Christmas and adequate time was not given to publicly elected representatives to have the register properly checked? I am sure the same must apply in other counties.  In those circumstances would he agree to the extension requested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that even though they were prepared in time in some cases they were not sent out until 10th December.  That was the latest date.  There is nothing I can do about it.  The regulations are laid down and 15th January is the date specified in the schedule to the regulations as the latest date for making claims.  The registration authorities must publish a list of claims on 23rd January.  The latest date for making claims to have corrections made in <Col N="1212" /> the list is 30th January.  County registrars must complete their adjudications on claims by 28th February. There is really nothing I can do about this.  I should like to tell the House that I am considering the issuing of a supplementary list before elections which will enable those who are late to be included in it.  I would ask the House to bear with me on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly this side of the House would welcome and support such a move, provided it is done in a proper administrative fashion. I would ask the Minister to check back for precedents, especially when the vote was granted to people of 18 years.  There was difficulty then in ensuring that the register was being compiled accurately and in a comprehensive fashion, and the registrars were asked to be lenient on the question of applying these dates, and were asked to accept late claims, and did in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been suggested to them.  Of course, despite the fact that the list has been made, the registrars can make additions to the list. I have suggested that they should do this.  If we get the new proposal passed through this House, it will solve the problem for quite a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will agree if it is brought forward soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general subject, would the Minister have a look at the question of whether the period now operated for the purpose of publishing and examining the draft registers is the most suitable, since Christmas comes right in the middle of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is not the most suitable.  By practice it is the one which was operated over the years.  If what I now propose doing is approved, it will solve all of those problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A review of the postal voting system in the light of experience gained at the local elections has been carried out in my Department. I hope to introduce legislation providing for extended postal voting facilities at national elections shortly taking into account the results of this review.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

In view of the fact that in some cases these grants have not been changed since 1970&mdash;some of them were later &mdash;and in view of increased labour costs and material costs, would he agree that a very strong case can be made for very substantial increases in all grants related to housing and water services?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 5 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notified local authorities in a circular letter of 30th December, 1974, that because of the necessity to make increased provision for priority services such as housing and sanitary services and the phasing out of the cost to ratepayers of the health services and housing subsidies, it is not possible to make any new grant allocations under the amenity grants scheme for the current year.  The increased provisions made in 1975 for priority services which are vital for the welfare of the community are a concrete indication of the concern of the Government for improving living and environmental standards.  It is of course open to local authorities using their own funds to continue carrying out or assisting voluntary groups in the carrying out of amenity works of the kind which were assisted <Col N="1216" /> under the grants scheme.  The ability of local authorities to finance amenity schemes out of their own resources has been strengthened by the very great increase in assistance to them.</P>
    <P>Sums of £239,483 and £296,415 respectively were expended by my Department on amenity grants in respect of the financial periods ending 31st March and 31st December, 1974.</P>
    <P>The allocations made to Cork County Council since the present amenity grants scheme was introduced on 1st April, 1972, are as follows: Year ending 31st March, 1973&mdash;£24,000, including a sum of £12,000 allocated in anticipation of the provision for 1973-74; Year ending 31st March, 1974&mdash;£8,000; 9 months ending 31st December, 1974&mdash;£14,000.</P>
    <P>An amount of £75,000 has been provided in my Department's Vote for 1975 to provide for the payment of balances of grants allocated and still outstanding at the end of 1974.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that nobody welcomed the Minister's decision to withdraw these amenity grants.  I cannot accept the points the Minister made as being reasons for this decision.  Would he not agree that this is a retrograde step in regard to community development, particularly in the case of local communities which are providing facilities?  In view of that, would the Minister, as a person involved and interested for many years in community work, agree that a little Government incentive, no matter how small, is a wonderful inducement to local communities to collect their own money to help provide facilities for the young and the old in any community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of the money available from the budget the allocation was made and it was found that if other services were to receive as much as possible it would not be possible to give grants for amenity schemes this year.  If Deputies want to make representations to have other schemes reduced so that amenity grants can be made available in their areas we shall consider that, but Deputies cannot have it both ways.  They cannot complain about taxation and say that it is <Col N="1217" /> too much and at the same time complain that they are not getting enough money for certain schemes.  The amount given to each area under the amenity grants scheme was so small over the years since it was first introduced that I do not think it will have the effect that has been mentioned here.  In any case, this is only a temporary lay-off and the scheme will possibly be resumed next year, I hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy please be brief as a number of other Deputies are offering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is obviously playing with words in the reply.  Would he not agree that communities that have prepared plans for such development work had come to expect an allocation from State funds which would help them and that it is these communities with plans prepared and ready to go ahead in the hope that they would be included in this year's scheme who are suffering most?  For that reason would the Minister agree that a year's or two years' notice should have been given to these communities before the decision was made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As Deputy Fitzgerald must know, there were more applications since the scheme began than there were grants available and many areas have applied for and would continue to apply for grants and would never get them.  It is unfair to say that areas were waiting for grants which they knew were coming because it is the local authority that decides on the grants to be given.  I have had deputations from various groups and I have had to tell them over the past two years that they would have to go back to their local authorities and they tell me that the local authorities would not give them grants because they did not think it was the right thing to do.  The amount available to each local authority, and therefore to each scheme, was very small and far more schemes were left out than got grants.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree, because there are communities that took the necessary steps even before those grants were introduced and they will now continue to take steps to improve their areas, grants or no grants.  The local authorities have the right to give the money if they want to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that certain county councils&mdash;and I mention Wicklow in this respect&mdash;had priority lists within their own areas and these lists were devised in consultation between local voluntary groups and local representatives who have a background knowledge of matters?  While the Minister might say that certain groups have been left out in our county, would the Minister not agree that these people felt that they were fairly close to the top of the list?  Could the Minister also repeat the total figure for the financial period in 1974?  Was it £300,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

The question of building a boundary wall was discussed and agreed by Wicklow County Council, subject to the owner of the Slievenamon house property agreeing to pay 50 per cent of the cost.  Wicklow County Council wrote to the owner of Slievenamon House but go no reply and, so far, no reply has been received to the council's proposal.  The NBA are not involved.

      <P>For Deputy Murphy's information, the position is that there were two objections to the order.  A public local inquiry was held on the 11th September, 1974.  The transcript of evidence given at the inquiry is not yet available.  As soon as it is available, I will have an order made.  I have asked that it be dealt with&mdash;as in the case of all CPOs&mdash;as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure Deputy Connolly that I was mixed up in a number of group schemes myself. I am aware of the difficulty being experienced with regard to bank overdrafts. But there are major things outstanding, such as the erection of a pump house and the installation of plumbing in 20 of the houses, the provision of valve chambers and so on.  There is no point in telling Deputy Connolly that grants will be paid soon because they cannot be paid until such things are completed.  There are 14 grants only withheld.  Therefore, I would ask Deputy Connolly to try to persuade the people who are running the scheme to have this work done so that the grants may be paid.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central)</i> asked the Minister for Local Government if he has any plans to encourage people to leave their cars on the outskirts of the city to ease traffic congestion in the centre of Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Several groups of people have been consulted at various times regarding traffic problems in Dublin <Col N="1237" /> but is it not the duty of the Department of Local Government to encourage Dublin Corporation to take some positive steps regarding the relief of traffic congestion in the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The elected representatives of Dublin Corporation have the right to do this.  Nobody knows better than they what should be done, having taken advice from the experts. Therefore, I think we should leave it to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will introduce a new statutory road sign for use primarily within housing estates to warn motorists to drive carefully and thereby prevent speeding on their part which constitutes a danger to the safety of children in such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that there is a prescribed traffic sign to indicate locations where there is a specific danger to children crossing the road, for example, where the road passes a school entrance.  I do not propose to prescribe a further sign as suggested by the Deputy.  The erection of such further signs would not necessarily enhance the safety of the areas concerned and might indeed lead to a false sense of security on the part of children and those responsible for their safety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Such proposals do not come before my Department. The provision of pedestrian crossings is a matter for the road authority concerned, acting at the request or with the consent of the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>The information requested in the first part of the question is set out in the form of a tabular statement which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report.  The information needed for the purposes of the second part of the question has not yet been received.  Provisional figures will be available in about a month's time.  If the Deputy wishes, I will arrange to have the provisional figures sent directly to him or alternatively he could repeat that part of his question later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The equipment of boiler plants for heating local authority premises is a matter for the individual local authorities.  I have, however, drawn the attention of all local authorities to the need for maximum economy in the use of oil and petroleum products and have requested that they should co-operate fully in the campaign for restraint in the use of such products.  It will be for the individual local authorities to decide what measures are feasible and desirable in each case.</P>

      <P>I would not have the authority to so insist but I have suggested that every effort be made to ensure a saving on oil and fuel products.  That should be sufficient in so far as local authorities are concerned. On the other hand, there is the question of the cost involved in changing to different types of plants. As a Deputy I protested some years ago regarding the change-over to oil but I did not get much encouragement from the then Government for my point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of cases where rate collectors have insisted on collecting rates from persons who were applicants for relief from rates under the rates waiver scheme before a decision was taken on their claims; and if such payments will be refunded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of a rates waiver scheme is a function of the local authority and therefore I would not have any information in individual cases.  It is open to the person concerned to raise any matters on which he has a complaint with the county manager for the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that there is a breach of the general terms of the scheme and, indeed, of the principle of the scheme for a person who has made application for a rates waiver to have his rates demanded by the rate collector and especially in respect of those cases in which the waiver was granted subsequently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been considering that.  Unfortunately, under the law the applicant is liable for his rates until such time as the waiver is granted to him.  The rate collector by law is bound to attempt to collect.  I agree with Deputy Brennan that the sensible thing where there is a strong possibility of a waiver being granted would be that collection be deferred.  I have taken up this matter, and the extension of the <Col N="1242" /> waiver to necessitous people who are not included, with the local authorities on a number of occasions. Some local authorities have been very reasonable about this and some have not.  Deputy Brennan should take this up with the local authorities and if he does not get any satisfaction perhaps he would give me particulars, although I do not know what I can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that where a decision has not been made until the last minute the rate collector could have brought that person to court in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I have asked local authorities to make an early decision on this.  The fault lies with the local authority officials who do not make their decision in time.  There is no reason why they should wait until the end of the year to make their decision.  I am asking them to make an early decision so that this cannot occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be a simple matter for the county secretary to issue each rate collector with the number of applicants under the waiver scheme in his area so that he would hold off until a decision is made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It would be far more desirable if the county secretary got the county manager to make an early decision.  It is only a day or two's work to decide who will be entitled to a waiver of rates early in the year and this will save everybody a lot of trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan) (for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much the inconvenience and loss caused by the unofficial strike action taken by certain engineering branch technicians in the Limerick area.  The action is in contravention of the national agreement and of the agreement on conciliation and arbitration to which the union is a party.  It has been, I understand, taken and continued against the advice and direction of the union.</P>
      <P>The staff concerned have received all the national agreement increases. On top of those they received an increase of 10 per cent partly on a productivity basis.  Their union immediately after made a further claim, the effect of which would be to move all the staff up one grade higher.  Concession of the claim would cost at least £1.5 million a year and add at least 15 per cent to the cost of the grades. The national agreement requires that such a claim could be accepted only if it could be met by way of greater productivity.</P>
      <P>The Department and the union have been engaged in a detailed examination to identify ways of increasing productivity which would be acceptable to the staff, and a stage had been reached where final negotiations could shortly begin.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the action taken by the maintenance staff in Limerick was intended to forestall those negotiations. Certainly it can only obstruct progress towards an equitable settlement, cause, as the Deputy has said, inconvenience and loss to the public, and place the jobs of the strikers and those of many other workers at risk. It may even endanger life.  The staff concerned should return immediately to work so as to enable their union to process their claim in accordance with the terms of the national agreement and of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Civil Service.</P>

For instance, for the last couple of days it has been impossible to make contact with ambulances or hospitals for urgent medical cases. Is he also aware that in today's paper it is reported that the strike has spread further west and further south in the mid-western region and also that the leader of the union has almost acknowledged the strike in his criticism of the Minister's statement that people had interfered with the technicians on the job?

      <P>From what the Deputy has said I take it he shares with me an anxiety to deplore the action which has so seriously jeopardised essential services and the whole quality of life in the regions affected. The Deputy is aware that the union in question has asked the strikers to return to work, that the strike is an unofficial one and that, contrary to any previous experience, the rate of fault and disruption in the mechanism of the phone service has been much greater since the discontinuance of the work in question.  In those circumstances the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was quite justified in drawing public attention to the fact that the service has been disrupted far beyond any normal experience.</P>

The equipment in question, most of it being automatic, is quite capable in normal circumstances of continuing without any serious disruption for months.

Action taken by the State to ensure at least a minimum of maintenance service has been obstructed and people engaged in that maintenance work, which would at least have provided essential services of the kind the Deputies opposite are seeking, have been frustrated by threats to them and indeed to their private homes. It is an intolerable situation and it is one that should not occur.  It is right that in this Parliament of the nation we on both sides of the House <Col N="1253" /> would join in making a plea to the people involved to return to work so that this matter can be negotiated in the fastest possible way.</P>

In those circumstances it is not open to the State to be in negotiation with people who are themselves not in good standing with their union, who are acting contrary to the wishes of their union, contrary to the provisions of the national wage agreement and contrary to the conciliation and arbitration scheme which is required to be respected by all parties to it.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I mentioned that the promise to abolish death duties was welcomed by farmers in particular.  When a man died at an early age and left a wife and young family the widow was obliged to borrow the money to pay the death duties or to sell a certain amount of the property to raise the money.  Wealthy people were able to avail of expert advice regarding the setting up of trust funds, thereby avoiding the payment of tax.  The replacement of the death duties by gift and acquisition taxes, which set out a liberal allowance of £150,000 per person, as well as the capital gains tax were well received by businessmen and industrialists and even by Fianna Fáil.  It was agreed that the &ldquo;quick sell&rdquo;, the person who bought a property, developed it and sold it quickly, should be taxed.</P>
      <P>Very few people will object to capital taxation on shares.  In most cases the business of buying shares was regarded as a &ldquo;nixer&rdquo;&mdash;the term in the building trade for work carried out after hours.  Prior to this Bill the speculator and the person who dealt in shares as a semi-permanent job did not pay any tax on the transactions even though it was part of their income.  In some cases they developed their dealings to such an extent that it became their main business.  One might have some sympathy for these people if they had tremendous knowledge of shares and their dealings but in the main it did not require much business acumen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out last night the person concerned might wish to back a shell company or a professional person might have knowledge of a take-over <Col N="1256" /> of a company.  There have been cases where some of the shares in the case of a shell company could be bought at 1 per cent and, in fact, I have seen them as low as .5 per cent.  The person who bought such shares did so for capital gains on which he was not obliged to pay tax.  This practice must be stopped.  This legislation will ensure that there is a more correct situation, that a person will buy shares and give a return on them.  Because of the collapse of stock exchanges throughout the world some of the shares that were 1 per cent now have a return of 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>Prior to this Bill the person who did not take any risk was not liable to tax. If any preferential treatment is given it should go to the businessman or the industrialist who takes a risk.  The man in the retail or manufacturing industry is entitled to a better return with a lower tax liability than the man who lies in bed, reads <i>The Financial Times</i> and then gives instructions regarding the purchase of shares.</P>
    <P>Most of the points raised on this Bill will be better discussed on Committee Stage.  The objections raised by Fianna Fáil were, first, that there should be a 50 per cent capital gains tax, reducing each year until it is nil at the end of a 15-year period.  I agree with Deputy Colley who said that in killing speculators there is a danger that we may kill enterprise in business. Fianna Fáil speakers mentioned that ill-health might force a person to sell and he would be caught for this tax.  Another point raised by Fianna Fáil was that compulsory purchase should not be liable to capital gains and they also said that where income tax is paid capital gains tax should not be levied.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the figure of 50 per cent capital gains tax.  The Minister was fair in his proposals, he was even liberal but we must have a lower capital gains tax than England to encourage money to come in and be invested here.  England have many very wealthy financial houses and we have only one or two so we must encourage them to come in here.  I believe the Minister is correct in including the CPO.  The corporation <Col N="1257" /> put a CPO order on a building and the interested parties try to fix the matter up through negotiations.  If they do not it means a loss of money and also it takes time to put the CPO into effect.  The price may be fixed at slightly above its value but if the person gets a fair bargain and reinvests his money he will not be caught very heavily.  If the CPO were to be left free of capital gains tax nobody would agree to anything.  People would make sure that a CPO was put on and that would mean they would get more money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right.  It was for that reason that I said because of the difficulties for local authorities you could not exempt them but I suggested there ought to be allowed to the person concerned the cost of a comparable property before you assessed his gains.</P>

      <P>I know in relation to farming it can work both ways.  I know a farmer on whose property a CPO was put.  Another person purchased his property.  That man went out and bought another farm and came into an area where planning was to take place.  He was able to sell that land at a big profit.  I can see the Deputy's point but generally the person gets a fair amount.  He will not sell if he does not.  If he is forced to get a CPO we will be in a worse position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the point mentioned by Deputy Colley that anybody who pays income tax should not pay capital gains.  The way this works out in practice is that you have a company dealing in property and if they are selling property they make capital gains.  As far as I know, that company are assessed for income tax and corporation profits tax and not capital gains.  If it is a company in the retail business where one of their businesses is sold off and a capital <Col N="1258" /> gains is made tax would be charged on that capital gains.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a point yesterday about a business which is held for ten years.  If a barman buys a small premises, develops it, sells it and buys a bigger one he is still investing all his money in that business.  If that takes ten years that person should be free of capital gains tax because he did not go into it to make capital gains.  He went in to work the business he knows and he should not be charged capital gains on it.</P>
    <P>A person who has to sell his business because of ill-health should not have to pay capital gains tax.  If there is a capital gains and he dies within a certain number of years whatever capital gains there was plus interest should be given to his widow or dependants.  The Minister said that he is against death duties.  I agree with him.  I am not as worried about the individual who has to sell his property because of death duties as about the people who have worked for years in a business, who have now reached 50 years of age and who are put out of work.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>...gifts are to be treated as disposals for the purpose of the capital gains tax.  It has been necessary to treat gifts in this way as otherwise gift arrangements could be fabricated to avoid capital gains tax. Under section 9 of the Bill, however, it is provided that disposals of assets by way of gift prior to the date of publication of the Bill viz. 20th December, 1974, will not give rise to chargeable gains or allowable losses.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a way being found of closing that gap.  In farming and business the sooner a person can pass on his property or business to one of his family the better.  It is wrong to bring the gift tax under capital gains. Gift tax should be the same as acquisition tax so that it is not judged as a change of ownership.  I cannot see why that gap cannot be closed up.</P>
    <P>I believe there should be no capital gains tax after ten years.  If that matter is cleared up as well as the other matters which I have mentioned, I <Col N="1259" /> believe this Bill will be acceptable to everybody.  There may be some small matters which can be cleared up on Committee Stage.  Before this Bill was introduced speculators and share dealers got preferential treatment over business people.  They are now on a par.  I hope the Minister will accept what I said in relation to gift tax and a ten year period.  If a person has a public house and he renovates it it will increase the value of the premises but it will also increase the profits of that business.  This business becomes more valuable and the Revenue Commissioners will get a bonus.  They may allow something against the cost, but they will get the benefit of the extra property.  In other words, to the extent of 26 per cent you are working for the Revenue Commissioners and the Government.  The Minister should allow these renovations or extensions to be written off the following year against tax, like wear and tear.</P>
    <P>I will come back to a point I mentioned yesterday.  Rather than have the threshold agreement, I believe business should be valued on its replacement value.  With inflation, values can fluctuate.  The actual cost of replacing it should be allowed rather than the notional value.</P>
    <P>Another point is that as a private house with one acre is exempt from capital gains, a second house at a seaside resort should also be exempt. There would not be much money involved in it, but people who have a house at the seaside should get credit for holidaying in Ireland and spending their money here, rather than going away for a month or six weeks to the Continent and spending it over there.</P>
    <P>As far as trusts are concerned, it works the same way as for an individual, and, if the Minister agrees on the two matters I have already mentioned, trusts would come under it. I believe the person who set up the trust, rather than the trustee, should be liable to the gift tax or capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday, a person who becomes a doctor or a solicitor has <Col N="1260" /> no capital gains assessed on his fees, but a chef who decides to open a restaurant and, after doing business for a number of years, sells it off, will be charged capital gains tax on his labour, on the premises, and on the goodwill he has created because he is good at his job.  It is very unfair that it should be divided in three ways.  The person who buys it from him may not be as good at the business, the business goes down and he, in turn, sells it, and is at a loss. Does he carry a placard around on his back saying: &ldquo;I am a failure.  I carry a capital gains loss forward&rdquo;. It is the premises that should be valued not the business.</P>
    <P>The interference of a Minister can upset a business.  If the price of drink goes up that has an adverse effect on the trade.  If a person is in a business and does not come into it to make a capital gain, he should be free of capital gains tax liability after ten years.  I also believe that, in order to encourage people to give away their property when they are young and when their family are young, the capital gains tax should not be charged on a gift, just as it is not charged on acquisition.</P>

      <P>It would probably help the nation and certainly this House if the Fianna Fáil Party could make up their mind as to what their attitude is to the taxation of capital gains both in principle and in administration.  They have attacked this Capital Gains Bill, asserting that it was complicated, that it was lengthy, that it was involved; yet it contains only one tax rate while the Fianna Fáil alternative contains no fewer than 13 different rates of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently Fianna Fáil gave no consideration to the question of the capital gains tax until we announced in Government our intention to introduce it, and even then, to judge from the hasty and badly thought-out reaction to the Bill when introduced, I can assume they did not give any consideration to the matter until after production of the Bill.  If they had taken the trouble to explore the experience of other countries, they <Col N="1261" /> would have found that other countries, particularly Britain, who started off with a complicated code such as the one suggested by Deputy Colley on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, were forced within six years of introduction of the complicated code to abandon it and go for a simple one.  When in 1965 Britain introduced her original capital gains tax there was provision for treating differently gains over different periods.  But by 1971 the Government were forced to abandon that procedure and go for a simple system.  That was four years ago and when the British Government changed the system, which involved treating some gains more harshly than others, there was almost unanimous thanks expressed because the new code was a simple and understandable one, one which was easy to administer, and on that account was less costly to administer than a complicated one.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms, a valid one, offered against any system of capital taxation which tries to close gaps is that it involves considerable cost to administer, both to the private sector, who have to engage accountants and legal advisers and so forth, and to the Government, who have to engage quite a number of staff on the Revenue Commissioners side, to administer the tax.  I was as anxious as anybody in this House who has professed himself in favour of treating long-term gains less harshly than short-term ones.  But the more I looked into the great complexities which any code would have to deal with in that situation, the more I saw it was necessary, in the interests of fair play to the taxpayer, in the interests of efficiency in business and commerce, to let people know precisely their liability, and in the interests of the cost of public administration, which the taxpayer has to meet in any event, to give them a fixed medium tax rate which would take into account all the different arguments relating to both long- and short-term gains.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out now the many defects in the suggestions made by the Fianna Fáil Party.  We were <Col N="1262" /> criticised yesterday and in other recent utterances by the conservative Fianna Fáil Party because we were introducing capital gains taxation at this particular time.  They have, I think, put on some sackcloth and ashes for their inaction over their period of 16 years by their admission now that capital gains tax is justified in principle and their complicated proposals, ill-thought out as they are, at least indicate a willingness now to consider the matter.  We were criticised that in this time of economic uncertainty and some financial difficulty we should be introducing capital gains tax.  Yet the tax we are introducing will run at a rate of only 26 per cent while those who criticise us for unnerving the business community at this time are themselves proposing taxation which would commence at a rate of 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>Any investor who would have the temerity to sell his investment in the next six years would be punished by Fianna Fáil at a rate in excess of anything proposed in this Bill.  The word &ldquo;speculator&rdquo; has been rather emotionally thrown around this House and elsewhere in recent times.  There are different ways of considering what a speculator is. Oftentimes people apply the word &ldquo;speculator&rdquo; to someone who shows a greater capacity than they have themselves to think ahead and anticipate demand, invest and take risks where others would be unwilling to invest and take risks.  The Fianna Fáil argument is apparently that taxation is not right unless it introduces new principles of what is moral <Col N="1263" /> and what is not, what is a respectable activity and what is lacking in respectability.  If this be a valid consideration for capital taxation it is also a valid consideration in relation to any tax.  Are Fianna Fáil now proposing we should have different rates of tax according to the respectability of the vocation of individual taxpayers?</P>

      <P>Under this Bill, if farmers or business people sell their assets and reinvest the proceeds, then there is total relief.  This is desirable and essential to encourage investment. It maintains investment.  It ensures that those who might be tempted to get out of business by making a total gain will think twice and keep their money in business, not necessarily in the same <Col N="1264" /> premises.  This will ensure that the money is recycled in business.  This is the correct approach.  If taxation is to command respect it must be neutral. The proposals in this Bill are neutral. We do not seek to condemn people who sell at a particular time by fining them more heavily than those who may sell later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is what the Bill is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Under the Fianna Fáil scheme the speculator could well be tempted to remain locked in his investment in order to get the tax advantage which delay in sale would confer upon him.  The investor could stay there simply in order to get the tax rebate Fianna Fáil would give him at the end of the period.  To say that speculation <i>per se</i> is something that is necessarily of short duration is to enunciate something that cannot be proved from past experience.  Speculators can sometimes look into the distant future and see advantage for themselves in building up a capital gain instead of taking current income.  Now one of the inequitable arrangements crying out for correction is that arrangement which people of means can enter into, perfectly respectably and perfectly legally, to create for themselves an investment which many years hence will produce a capital reward which would not be subject to tax.  If they spent the same money to generate a recurring annual income such income would be subject to tax. Under the Fianna Fáil scheme there would be no disincentive to such activity since there would be no taxation of the capital gain made at the end of a 15-year period.  It seems to me undesirable that we should maintain such an inequitable practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even longer, as Deputy Dockrell said.  If a person has adequate means to cover current expenses the wisest thing for him to <Col N="1265" /> do is to invest in such a way under the present law, or under the Fianna Fáil scheme, as will enable him to obtain several years hence a capital gain which would be free of tax.  Now that is not treating everybody in the same way.  It is treating those who are fortunate enough to have sufficient to cover current expenses much more favourably because it will give them a profit many years later free of tax. The line between capital gain and ordinary income is sometimes very, very difficult to draw.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to maintain a system of tax laws which makes it possible for people in better off circumstances to avoid paying their fair share of tax. The ordinary worker is obliged to pay tax.  Tax is taken from the worker before he even receives his pay, under the PAYE system.  Surely it is not wrong that people with much greater means, who postpone making a capital gain for many years, should be asked to pay on that capital gain a rate of tax which, if anything, can be criticised for being as low as the lowest rate of income tax.  That is the minimum rate of 26 per cent.  To allow such gains to be totally tax free would be wrong.</P>
      <P>So far as business is concerned, we have provided that any person retiring from business may, on disposal of property, be relieved from the capital gains tax if the consideration does not exceed £50,000 and, if the person is getting out of business and transferring to a member of his family, the consideration can be £150,000.  I have said on numerous occasions, and I repeated it in introducing the Second Stage of the Bill, and I am now saying it again, that it is my intention to adjust the various thresholds in the capital gains tax system so as to take account of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave very earnest consideration to the possibility of building a regulator or indicator into the Bill itself which would be automatic.  The great difficulty is that the various assets which come to be taxed here have different rates of inflation.  Their values vary for a multitude of different reasons. Some can vary in value because of the customary over-emotional reaction of the stock exchanges.  Others can vary <Col N="1266" /> in value at rates quite different from the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>We know, for instance, that notwithstanding the current rate of inflation of 20 per cent, many properties&mdash;I include land and buildings&mdash; have a lesser market value this year than they had last year.  In other days the increase in the value of buildings far exceeded inflation.  There is a multiplication of other problems, so that it is very difficult to find an appropriate indicator.  I am studying &mdash;and I have the assistance of a number of bodies and State agencies in these studies&mdash;the possibility of obtaining an indicator which could be used for many different purposes.  As long as we have different movements in a free market, such as we have, it will not be easy to find the appropriate indicator.  If and when we do, we can apply it in an automatic manner in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of a perfect indicator, would the Minister not make do with the consumer price index?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because there are many factors in the consumer price index which are not related to the true value of property or to movements in the value of property. As I pointed out on recent occasions, there are movements in the consumer price index which themselves represent no more than a redistribution of money incomes by transferring some moneys from the better off to the less well off.  For instance, such tax changes as occurred in this year's budget by taxing the old reliables could generate an increase of about 2 per cent in the cost of living index. That exercise is carried out in order to make our country more socially just than it would be if the transfer had not taken place from unnecessary expenditure on comparatively luxury items to give relief to the poorer sections of the community.  Is it proper that in capital taxation you should allow 2 per cent in respect of such socially necessary transfers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other ways of calculating the fall in the value of money.  Is not a fall in the value of <Col N="1267" /> money what the Minister really wants rather than movement in the value of different kinds of assets?  Is it not the value of money the Minister should be concerned with because the other adjustments will automatically be built into the gain or the loss?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister want to measure the movement in the value of assets?  Surely the Minister is not right in talking about the movement in the value of assets.  If he adjusts for the movement in the value of money, any movement in the value of assets will automatically be taken into account whether it is up or down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  Suppose it goes up by 50 per cent and the fall in the value of money is 20 per cent. If you operate on the basis of the fall in the value of money you will automatically get the correct gain in the case where it went up by 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly in the market in which most capital gains are made.  That is not a domestic but an international market and values can change very rapidly.  One of my ambitions as Minister for Finance is to make the tax code as simple as possible so that it can be easily understood and easily and <Col N="1268" /> cheaply administered.  That is why we have gone for one rate of tax.  That is why we have struck the rate of 26 per cent.  By and large, that takes account of many of the uncertainties and many of the incalculable elements which exist in the whole field of capital taxation.  It also takes account in a kind of rough and ready way, I would agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a very ready and not too rough way at all.  If the Deputy wants to play with words we will qualify them very correctly&mdash;in a ready and not too rough way by going for a figure of 26 per cent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton very properly said it was desirable that our rate of capital gains tax should not be higher than that of our immediate neighbour, in particular, and that of other comparable countries.  This is one of the reasons why the Government and I opted for the figure of 26 per cent.  We were criticised originally when we suggested as the appropriate rate in the White Paper what was then the standard income tax rate of 35 per cent.  It was argued&mdash;and I think cogently&mdash;by many people that it would be wrong to have a rate 5 per cent higher than the rate in Britain, having regard to the speed at which money moves between our respective countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be true across the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 26 per cent rate is now 4 per cent lower than the rate in our neighbouring country.  According to Fianna Fáil, we are wrong to go for that and we should be going for a 50 per cent rate initially and maintaining a higher rate on all capital gains for the first six years during which property is held.  This seems to me to be the most foolish thing we could do in present circumstances, or in any circumstances in which this country requires continuing investment from abroad.  We have gone instead for a rate which, by comparison with any comparable country, is a low one because the <Col N="1269" /> rates tend to vary from 30 per cent up to the ceiling of income tax in various countries.</P>
      <P>In many countries, instead of treating the short-term gains in the way suggested by Fianna Fáil, they are subjected to the full rate of income tax which, as we know, under Fianna Fáil could rise to 80 per cent, to confiscatory levels.  Our aim is to get rid of as many elements of our taxation system as are confiscatory and as tempt people to avoidance and evasion.  We want to broaden the taxation base and to make it an enforceable system of taxation without loopholes for avoidance and evasion.</P>
      <P>This is a challenging task.  I am not claiming that we will succeed but we are moving in the right direction.  This Capital Gains Bill is a very significant step towards broadening the base of taxation.  It is also a very significant step towards closure of avoidance and evasion loopholes.  One of the greatest merits of the alternative system of capital taxation that we have proposed to replace estate duties is that it will be much more difficult in future for people to engage in avoidance and evasion because the possession and movement of capital will be traced year after year.  The system of death duties, because of the high rates at which it was operated, was confiscatory and provoked people to engage in tax avoidance practices which were perfectly legitimate. Because the rates were so high, people were necessarily obliged to protect the family fortunes by taking evasive and avoidance action.  If they did not do so, they found at the most difficult time of the family's history that the family's capacity to earn was ruinously destroyed.  We are replacing that devastating system with one which will ensure that capital taxation is paid by comparatively small instalments over a life span while there is no family distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital gains tax of 26 per cent will not be charged until the gain is realised, until an actual sale takes place.  It will not be charged if the proceeds of the sale are re-invested <Col N="1270" /> and it will not be charged at all on the family house and one acre which surrounds it.  So the old crucifying element of estate duty is being eliminated.  Death duties caught everything including the family home, the garden, anything in the garden or in the family home, furniture, personal belongings&mdash;the whole lot, money in the bank or anywhere else. It was all caught under death duties but under capital gains the home and its contents and money itself will not be caught but only other assets.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should deal briefly with a point raised by Deputy O'Malley.  He said it was unfair that the House should be asked to consider this Bill in the absence of the Government's proposals on wealth tax and capital acquisitions tax.  That might have validity if the Government had not already given an indication of their policy in both these areas, but we spelled out very clearly what our proposals are and the legislation will very shortly be available for consideration in the House.  I can assure the House that they have no reason to anticipate that any difficulties are being created for them by the absence of the other two Bills.  Considering that it is only about a year since we revealed our outline thinking and that we are now discussing the details we have moved with extraordinary speed in a most complicated area.</P>
    <P>In the course of my study of this matter I have been looking at the legislative history of capital taxation in other countries and there is no example that I found of any country undertaking such massive reform of the taxation code in such a short period.  When the whole package in all its details is revealed people will see that the Government and their advisers have moved with extraordinary speed in a very difficult area.</P>
    <P>We should not have been able to move with this speed if we had not got the wholehearted co-operation of the public in general and the professional bodies in particular.  I should like to thank them for their very quick responses to the Government's White Paper and any consultations we had following that.  Often, when difficult <Col N="1271" /> decisions have to be taken there is much to be said for making them quickly rather than dragging on the process of thinking for so long that nothing is done.  That was probably one of the great difficulties of the Fianna Fáil administration&mdash;they thought about so many things for so long that they really achieved little or nothing.  Lethargy surrounded the whole unreformed Irish taxation code while they were in power and now they have some difficulty, as they acknowledged in this debate last night, in trying to keep up with the Government.</P>

      <P>On the question of taking account of inflation, the only countries that have any specific provision or take account of inflation in any way in the EEC are Denmark and Belgium, but none of the other countries provides any correction in respect of inflation. Having regard to the fact that the countries I mentioned have a higher rate of tax than the one we propose, it was imperative in their case to have some method of correcting for inflation; but they are having very great difficulty with its operation.  I am very interested in devising a suitable corrective, and if and when I can find a suitable one which will commend itself to the public at large I shall introduce it.</P>

      <P>Did the Deputy speak against capital gains at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis?  If he did the Ard-Fheis rejected his advice. Apparently there was such a row at the Ard-Fheis that they had to take two votes to make sure they were right.  Having taken two votes the record was that the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis twice rejected capital gains tax so convinced were they from Deputy Colley's support for or opposition to capital gains tax.  That is the record of their collective wisdom and of democracy at work in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned on the introduction of the Second Stage it is proposed to impose capital gains tax on gifts. If we had not taken this particular step it would have been open to people to take very simple evasion and avoidance action which could not be justified.  They could do so by simply arranging transfers of properties notionally as gifts but with hidden consideration.  The capital gains tax could have been avoided.  It was therefore necessary, as it has <Col N="1276" /> been found necessary in other countries, to treat gifts as disposals and at the time of disposal to subject the calculated gain to tax.</P>
    <P>To appreciate that this is not in most cases going to generate difficulty it would be well to realise that the following would not be regarded as exempt under the capital gains tax code: gifts of money without limit; farms or family businesses valued up to £150,000 transferred on retirement within the immediate family; farms and businesses transferred on retirement outside the immediate family up to £50,000; the principal private residence and ground attached thereto of up to one acre; any chattels of less than £2,000 per annum; a gain of £500 a year.  The gain could be quite small and the chattels of a considerable value.  Others not regarded as liable are: normal life assurance policies; Government securities or State guaranteed stocks; chattels with a life of less than 50 years; land bonds and gifts to genuine charities, national institutions and public bodies.</P>
    <P>Even when the gain on any gift would be chargeable if the gift is made, as in most cases gifts are, to members of families then the capital acquisition tax would be charged only on so much of the gift as remains after payment of the capital gains tax on the gain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital gains tax would be deducted from the value of the gift, that is assuming that the value of the gift is diminished by the amount of capital gains tax that would be deducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  It would only be subject to two taxes if the gift exceeded the thresholds in the capital acquisition tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In reply to points made by Deputies Belton and <Col N="1277" /> O'Malley I should like to point out that the rate of capital acquisition tax is reduced by 25 per cent in respect of gifts <i>inter vivos.</i></P>
      <P>Also a disposal of property as a consequence of death is not regarded as an occasion for calculating a gain. It was suggested by Deputy O'Malley that what we were proposing would lead to a situation in which people would continue to hold on to their property because there was nothing to be gained by its early transference. Of course, as the inheritance tax would be higher than the tax on a gift, there are advantages to be gained by transferring during lifetime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be higher than the combination of capital gains and gift tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend on who was the donor, who was the donee, the accumulation of gifts in the hands of the donee, having received them from the donor, and so on.  One cannot give an absolute answer as to what would be the situation. One would have to deal with particular situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Colley and Fitzpatrick <i>(Dublin Central)</i> criticised the imposition of capital gains tax on companies which had been induced by the IDA to set up here as a consequence of income tax relief on export profits. In this case it is important to realise that capital gains tax is not collected unless there is a disposal of capital assets.  Therefore this tax would not be collected unless and until the foreign investor was selling out and leaving the country.  While there are certain safeguards in relation to grants and so on from the IDA, a situation can arise where foreign investors can come in here with public moneys, set up here, operate for a number of years, then realise the assets and get out with the total assets without payment of taxation of any kind, either income or capital.  I do not think that is right or defensible.  It is desirable that, in the event of such a foreign investor realising the assets here and quitting the country, we should collect a 26 per cent tax on the capital gain, a capital gain in some <Col N="1278" /> cases made on assets which were paid for by the Irish Government on behalf of its people.  Unless something extraordinary happened the capital gain would be less than the assets themselves.  But, in any event, if a gain is made by some person while in this country and then that person proposes to get out, surely it is not wrong that the State should try to recover part of the gain so made for the benefit of those who remain?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider this to be in accordance with the undertaking given to those firms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, absolutely.  The undertakings given were in relation to profits earned on exports.  The undertaking was not to subject such profits to income tax.</P>
      <P>Nobody in any part of the world has a right to assume that the taxation code shall be frozen in a particular way and that no new taxes will be introduced. No reasonable business person expects that taxation codes will be frozen.  But undertakings given have been and will be honoured.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out again that in the event of such persons selling capital assets, if they are reinvested in a similar enterprise here no question of charge arises.  Therefore, as we are requiring that in the event of a person getting out 26 per cent of the gain be handed over to the Exchequer for the public good, we are providing also that in the event of sale and reinvestment here there will be no charge at all.  This is an encouragement to continuing investment.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for clarification of a point on which I am not too clear. It arises particularly in relation to shares but could arise in relation to other forms of assets.  Let us assume somebody bought shares&mdash;we shall say in 1972, or any time before April, 1974&mdash;which at that time cost, we shall say, £200.  Assuming they went to £100 by April 1974 and then sometime later the individual sold and the <Col N="1280" /> shares went up to £150 but were still below the price £200 paid originally, would any capital gains tax arise on that transaction?  The point I am making is that the individual would not have made a gain; in fact he would have suffered a very considerable loss.  But the figure might be above the April, 1974, one.</P>

I would not wish to have an unduly restrictive provision in respect of a case of a genuine change of business, but an amendment could not be considered unless some suitable way of blocking avoidance and evasions can be devised.  It could not be provided for in too liberal a fashion.  The Revenue Commissioners have administrative responsibility in this matter.

No difficulty would arise if the same type of business were carried on in different properties but if a person were to change the whole nature of a business, the relief would not be available.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley raised the possibility of relief under section 27 being used where there was retirement of a young person because of ill-health.  It is said that hard cases make bad law.  But the age of 55 is a comparatively young age for retirement in Ireland, certainly in normal circumstances.  It allows for an element of ill-health in mature years.  It is most unusual for people to give up business before that age.  The normal retirement age is 65, or more where a person has any option in the matter.  We have provided for retirement ten years earlier than 65.  There would be a possibility of abuse and avoidance if we were to bring in a provision relating to ill-health. I have no wish to criticise any medical certificate issued in the past by anybody for any specific purpose but any provision of this nature could lead to practices that nobody here would wish to condone.  The interpretation we have given of what would be normal family circumstances and the allowing for the comparatively early retirement age of 55 takes account of the kind of problems Deputy Colley had in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have a look at that.  Deputy Colley asked me also why I was not giving relief on the size of gains rather than on the amount of the consideration.  Normally there is a relationship between gains and consideration. In certain cases the consideration could be a fairer measure of the size of the assets than the gains. For instance, a farm might tend to have a truer value in relation to the consideration rather than to the gains that might be made from it, particularly farms located in certain areas.</P>
      <P>If the gain were used as a measure it could exclude many small farms or businesses from the relief, particularly if they had been held for a long time or if the gain was large and the property small.  On the other hand, there could be a very big farm or substantial business held for a comparatively short time with a gain sizeable in relation to the assets because the asset was big in value but the gain could be made during a short time. There is more stability in using the consideration rather than the gain for the purpose of measurement.</P>
      <P>I was asked also what is the position of an adopted child under section 26 and 27.  In law an adopted child is treated precisely the same as a blood child.  Therefore there is no need to make any provision in this or in any legislation for an adopted child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, I have undertaken to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to provide that a nephew or niece who stands in the shoes of a child would have the same rights of succession, without charge to tax.  An argument is made here as to the same rights being conferred on brothers and sisters. Again, this brings up the demon of <Col N="1284" /> possible avoidance.  There is a danger that if we provide for moving sideways, as it were, in the one generation, avoidance measures could be devised easily.  What I have in mind would provide the necessary desirable relief in the majority of cases but I would be prepared to consider any amendments or suggestions put forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> In relation to the proposed amendment, is it envisaged that the provision will be confined so as to include only those nieces and nephews who have been engaged in the businesses concerned for a certain length of time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have in mind is that they would have been involved in the operation of the business or farm for a period of, say, five years before the transfer taking place. Otherwise, we could have the undesirable practice developing of people visiting their relations to see how ill they looked and of moving in at the last minute in order to avail of a concession.  But there are many genuine cases where nephews and nieces work in businesses for many years and have a reasonable anticipation of succession.  In some cases they may receive wages less than the level that would be considered reasonable elsewhere but are prepared to accept such arrangements in anticipation of succession.  We would not wish to spoil any such arrangement by a provision of this or any other Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley asked why interest payments are not to be allowed as deduction for capital gains tax.  Interest, for example bank interest, is an expense of a revenue nature. Where business assets are involved it is a business expense which can be set off against tax liability.  Therefore, it is an expense which enjoys relief under the ordinary income tax code. For capital gains tax, allowable expenses are confined to capital outlay. The interest will continue to enjoy such concessions as are enjoyed under the income tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley asked if the provision means that the exemption implied in <Col N="1285" /> paragraph 88 of the White Paper will apply.  There will be a liability to capital gains tax but this does not create an anomaly.  I think what Deputy Colley had in mind is the proviso to paragraph 2 of Schedule 1.  Where this proviso applies, the gains for the disposal of investments will not have been brought into charge.  This is a technical matter relating to the restriction in the relief in respect of management expenses which relate to insurance companies and the proviso is not inconsistent with paragraph 88.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the effect be that such funds will be liable to capital gains tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Colley also asked for an assurance that the question of whether the value of an asset had become negligible could be brought to appeal.  The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The charge in respect of capital gains tax will be imposed by assessment.  Each assessment is, like any other tax assessment, open to appeal by the taxpayer if he is dissatisfied with the assessment and any reductions and reliefs given.  The loss envisaged under section 12 (4) would be a deduction in computing chargeable gains for assessment and as such the value of an asset becoming negligible would be proper grounds for appeal.</P>
      <P>I hope I dealt adequately, by way of intervention when Deputy Belton was speaking, with his query about a house with one acre of land attaching.  It is the house and the acre attaching to it which are exempt.  Any land in excess of that can become liable to capital gains tax.  In the case visualised by Deputy Belton there would be no real charge to tax.  He spoke of a house which might stand on one good acre and have several acres of rock and gorse surrounding it.  Of course, that might greatly enhance its amenity value, especially if it were close to an urban area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave other examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he did, but I will deal with this one first.  On its own the rock area would be unlikely <Col N="1286" /> to attract much capital value.  Having regard to the exemption of £500 gain, it is unthinkable that it would come within the tax net.  Where there is an acre attaching to a house in an urban area the acre itself could be of immense value, even without buildings. In fact, its value could be greatly enhanced by not having a building on it. This is a further indication of the generosity of the Government in giving exemptions and considerations to the representations made that private homes should be exempt from the charge.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley also visualised the possibility of a person resident in Ireland and Britain being doubly charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going through my notes in sequence and am dealing with Deputy Colley's points at the moment.  We will be entering into double taxation arrangements with all relevant countries to ensure that there will not be double taxation under this code, as applies to every other tax code.  Therefore, the possibility of double taxation as feared by Deputy Colley should not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also asked for clarification on the contradiction between section 8 (2) and clauses (a) (ii) and (b).  Clause (a) (ii) treats the receipt of capital sums under a policy of insurance as a disposal of an interest in the property which has been damaged or destroyed. The sums in question become payable after the happening of an event covered by the insurance policy. Obviously it can be related to particular assets.  Clause (b) relates to rights under an insurance policy as such.  By virtue of the rights sums may or may not become receiveable, depending on whether certain specified <Col N="1287" /> events occur.  Under this clause the disposal of rights under an insurance policy, apart of course from life assurance policies which are dealt with separately in section 20, is not to give rise to a chargeable gain nor correspondingly, an allowable loss.  In another respect, an amendment in clause (b) will be needed to counteract possible abuse, and I will be considering that for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It was argued that the Revenue Commissioners should be the people to decide on the alternative charge under section 6 instead of leaving it to the taxpayer to elect.  As I pointed out earlier, the provision is advantageous to the taxpayer because he is given two years to review his capital gains tax position and in the light of that review to elect for the alternative charge which suits him.  These taxpayers are likely to have available to them plenty of good advice.  We are allowing a complete exemption for the first £500 of gains.  In general, the small man will be outside the capital gains tax net altogether and will not have need to make an election.  Incidentally, in Britain where the revenue authorities make the review without an election, the exemption is given only up to a consideration of £500. We are providing it for a gain up to £500, again accepting the desirability of having a less severe tax code here in order to encourage continuing investment.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley suggested that funds raised for productive investments should be relieved from capital gains tax.  His suggestion is that we tax only unproductive assets.  The exemptions given in sections 26 and 27 show our wish to provide relief for the moderately sized business.  It would be very difficult indeed from a tax point of view to make the differential suggested by Deputy O'Malley.  In any event, to give relief beyond what we are proposing would be to give relief to the better-off section of the community.  As we are seeking to broaden the base of taxation, we are also seeking to bring within it people who have previously avoided paying their appropriate share of tax.  The exemptions which we are giving will ensure that there will not be hardship and if people go above those exemption levels it is not unreasonable that they should be required to pay a comparatively light tax on substantial gains.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton suggested that if the qualifying assets are transferred by a settlement the relief on a £150,000 disposal should apply.  There is a provision in section 15 which is designed to ensure that the objects of the Bill are not defeated and one way of defeating the objects of the Bill would be by the creation of settlements.  It would be contrary to the spirit and intention of the Bill if the reliefs in section 27 were to be available to settlements.  However, in the case, where the trustee holds the property for another person absolutely entitled to the property as against the trustee or for any person who would be so entitled but for being an infant or other person under disability, such as mental disability, the provisions of the Bill are to apply as if the property were vested in and the acts of the trustee were those of the person for whom he is a trustee.  Section 8 (3) of the Bill so provides.  Where this situation applies the relief under section 27 would be given in the same way as if the child took it directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Colley who queried whether ordinary residence can be established with legal understanding in the same way as &ldquo;residence&rdquo;<Col N="1289" /> or &ldquo;domicile&rdquo;.  There are court decisions which have given rulings on the meaning of both &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo; and &ldquo;residence&rdquo; and both of those terms in this Bill have the same meaning as they have in relation to income tax. There is a difference between the British &ldquo;bed and breakfast&rdquo; operations referred to by Deputy Colley and the provisions of the Bill.  The British provisions of &ldquo;bed and breakfast&rdquo; have been so called because they are one day transactions but our provisions apply to four weeks' transactions because this is broadly the stock exchange accounting period.  It will, of course, embrace same day transactions and is, therefore, more extensive than the British one.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is argued that there is double taxation from the same source where a company realises a capital gain on the sale of an asset and distributes it to the shareholders by way of a special dividend on capital distribution.  If a company is not resident in the State the dividend will be taxable as income in the hands of the resident shareholders and there will not be any charge to capital gains tax.  If, however, the company is resident in the State the dividend will not be taxable as income in the hands of resident shareholders under the present income tax code.  The charge to capital gains tax under paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 on the capital dividend is designed to achieve equity in taxation between the shareholder who sells his share cum divided thereby getting the distribution <Col N="1290" /> in the sale price of his shares and the shareholder who retains the shares and receives the distribution in the form of non-taxable income.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Deputy Belton effectively replied to the criticism of charging compulsory purchase transactions to capital gains tax.  Compulsory purchase arises where it is considered that it is necessary in the interests of society to make a compulsory purchase to meet the common good.  The Constitution specifically provides for laws which are required to meet the exigencies of the common good.  I cannot see any reason why a purchase or a sale which takes place in answer to the exigencies of the common good should be treated in any way different from any other sale. In practice, if the exemption of 26 per cent were to be given in those circumstances people would remain locked into their properties requiring all public authorities to go through the full process of compulsory purchase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in order to effect, at the end of it, a profit of 26 per cent.  In the public good it is desirable that people should enter into voluntary arrangements for the sale of their properties so that the public good may be met.  If that can be achieved at a reasonable price with the vendor content with the price we should allow those free forces to operate rather than cause a situation where simply because a public authority sought the land the vendor would find himself obliged to push the public authority through the compulsory purchase procedure in order <Col N="1291" /> to get a tax advantage.  The alternative to going through this compulsory purchase procedure, if we were to make this allowance, would be that the public authority would have to pay 26 per cent above an agreed price in order to avoid the delay of the compulsory purchase process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Our motion seeks to call the attention of the Government to the abiding problem of store cattle reared in this country.  I call it the abiding problem because the prospects for the coming year in this area of cattle husbandry appear to be little better than in the last six or nine months when, because of the <i>laissezfaire</i> attitude of the Government to this vital sector, many thousands of small cattle producers were deprived of any income.  Many of the cattle are still held with the niggardly aid of feed vouchers and the pathetically small loans available but even with the assistance of these props many producers will be forced out of business. In the context of the number of small cattle still on hands and considering the poverty of their prospects, it is difficult to think the situation will right itself in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It sounds very much like whistling past the graveyard for the Minister to say the market has been improving <Col N="1294" /> in recent weeks.  It has for forward beef but it is worth remembering that the general economic situation in Great Britain, our principal consumer, is tending to create a situation where the consumption of meat will drop considerably.  It would be foolish for the Government not to take the view that our main traditional outlet for beef in Great Britain must be a diminishing market and, therefore, it is inescapable that we must sell increasingly large quantities on the mainland of Europe.  We cannot do that unless the monetary obstacles that have been allowed to remain, to a large extent because of the negligence of the Government, are taken away.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the very serious malpractices&mdash;to call them the least objectionable of many names one could think of&mdash;that occurred in the processed meat trade in the last 12 months.  I am talking about the rackets that were operated in the meat factories that enabled certain privileged suppliers to buy from their neighbours at ridiculously low prices and to put the cattle from the marts straight into the factory at intervention price.  They skimmed off £60 or £70 per head through that process because they were privileged people in what are allegedly farmer-owned cooperative meat factories and they pocketed the proceeds.  This exploitation of the ordinary producer who has not such privileged access to meat factories must be stopped and the movement to stop it must be initiated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is like locking the stable when the horse is gone for the Minister to say at this late stage that we will have an inquiry.  Although the inquiry is better later than never, the only result will be information as to where the horse went and who got the profits to which the ordinary, underprivileged producer was entitled.  It is certain that the profits went somewhere.</P>
    <P>The unnatural imbalance that exists at the moment between the cwt. price for small cattle and forward stores and fat cattle will have to be corrected.  As an emergency measure we are advocating that <Col N="1295" /> deficiency payments be made to producers of small cattle.  This is absolutely vital in order to tide these people over this crucial period.  There must be rapid action by the Government to correct a situation they allowed to develop.  Probably it will be the death knell for many producers if this is not done immediately.</P>
    <P>Two courses of action are necessary. First, immediate action on the monetary front to remove the obstacles which prevent the necessary movement of our cattle outwards to the mainland of Europe and, as a temporary measure, the introduction of a floor on the prices of small cattle. This is vital in the context of a total absence of any kind of livestock programme, or even an attitude that would give rise to one.  We are not sanguine in our hopes that the Government will produce such a plan. In the context of pig producers who, a little more than six months ago, were told to get out of pig production and by the end of the year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage it is futile to engage in an argument about who said what first but it is beyond question that it was generally assumed this advice was given.  Before Christmas bacon was making £1,000 per ton on the British market but we did not have it.  There is no recognisable policy with regard to pig production, <Col N="1296" /> but we should have one because it is vital in the small farm area. There is no policy with regard to the marketing of sheep.  The Commissioner said we would have some kind of sheep arrangement before last June but there is no policy yet.</P>
      <P>In the short time at my disposal I would beg the Minister and the Government to realise this central fact&mdash; the vital necessity of our cattle herd. It is the most important thing the Minister should be preoccupied with. There is no such thing as having too many cattle.  What is wrong is that we are not selling our production.  The blame for that rests on the shoulders of the Government.  I am afraid there will be a drop off in cattle numbers, that the size and quality of our herd will shrink.  Lasting damage has been done because for the past 12 months the quality of breeding has dropped.</P>
      <P>I beg the Government to take radical measures to save this industry which is vital to our economy.  Let the Minister also resolve that our pig industry will thrive, that it will be based on small farms and that there will be centralised fattening.  We have good reason to believe there is no faith in the future of the Irish pig industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The motion in the name of Members of the Fianna Fáil Party calls on the Government:</P>
      <P>To seek immediately those changes in EEC Directives 159 and 160 which are necessary to permit the survival of the smaller farmers of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> I propose to confine my remarks in the main to Directive 160, which encourages farmers to leave farming as that directive comes within the ambit of my Department.  So far in this debate only three objections have been made to this directive as far as I can see.  In the first place the Opposition complained that the scheme does not apply to land left by farmers who wish to retire.  Secondly, the Opposition complained that the scheme is confined to farms of 45 acres.  Thirdly, they faulted it on the grounds that the scheme gives priority to farmers who have a development plan under Directive 159.</P>
    <P>I will later on deal with each of these objections.  At this stage I should like to say that I am somewhat surprised the Opposition should find fault with this directive because I find from the records of my Department that it came into operation and was adopted by the Council of the European Communities in April, 1972.  We completed our negotiations and signed the Treaty of Accession on the 22nd January, 1972 and we entered the European Community on the 1st January, 1973. When this directive and Directive 159 were being negotiated we had a right of audience in Europe.  If that is too strong a claim it is certainly correct to say we were consulted regarding these two directives.  The records of my Department show that my predecessor in office was consulted regarding Directive 160 and asked for his observations on it.  It is equally true to say that none of the objections now being put forward by the Opposition as being faulty in the directive was drawn to the attention of the European Community at the time.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the directive is as faulty as the Opposition would have us believe.  If it is they have been guilty of a grave dereliction of duty and of gross negligence in not trying to amend the directive when they were consulted about it.  That is simply a statement of fact and I cannot be contradicted when I say that the former Government were consulted about this matter.  I see Deputy Bruton has now entered the House. He put down a parliamentary question about this matter when he was <Col N="1298" /> in Opposition.  The question was answered on Tuesday, 30th May, 1972. It is clear that none of the points so eloquently made last night by Deputy Collins was made by my predecessor or by the previous Government.  I want to say, having said that, that when I assumed office as Minister for Lands I was confronted with Directive 160 and I was required to draw up a scheme under it.  I prepared a scheme of incentives to encourage farmers, who were not happy in farming or were not profitably engaged in it, to retire in dignity and financial security as required by Directive 160.</P>
    <P>This scheme is a purely voluntary one.  I want to drive that home.  There is nothing compulsory in it.  A farmer may avail of it or he may ignore it as he chooses.  The scheme came into operation on the 1st May, 1974, and as I hope to show in the short time at my disposal that it is a much more generous and a much more attractive scheme than the minimum requirement of Directive 160.  The financial benefits are much more generous than the payments which will be subvented by Europe under that directive.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the scheme received a generous welcome from the farming organisations all of whom I consulted before it was finally settled. I consulted them several times.  I listened to their suggestions and I implemented as many of them as I could.  The final product was a scheme that was accepted by the farming organisations as a good one.  It was also welcomed by the national Press and the farming Press as a good scheme.  More important, this scheme has been welcomed as a good scheme by the people whom it was intended to help, the farmers.</P>
    <P>To date over 1,100 applications under this scheme have been received and are being processed.  These applications cover an area of 45,000 acres of land.  I do not expect the House to believe that everyone of those applications will be accepted and will go through.  However, the applications received since 1st May last cover 45,000 acres, and that is in marked contrast to the estimate Deputy Collins gave yesterday evening that the scheme would bring in only 25,000 <Col N="1299" /> acres of land in total during the currency of its operation.  The record shows, that in the teething days of this scheme, before other farmers have seen the example of the people who will enjoy it, it has brought in 1,100 applications covering 45,000 acres of land.</P>
    <P>Farmers retiring under the scheme qualify for the following benefits: an applicant who is 55 years of age or over may sell or lease his farm for cash, and in addition he will receive from the Land Commission a life annuity of £600, if he is married, or £400, if he is single or widowed; and a premium or bonus of 10 per cent on the sale price, up to a maximum of £1,500 or double the annual rent, up to £3,000.  The directive requires payment of an annuity of only £400 for a married man, whereas we have given £600; or £280 for a single man, whereas we have given £400; and it requires that the pensions be paid only from 55 to 65 and does not require payment of a premium or bonus at all where the annuity is paid.  Those are very much in excess of the minimum standards laid down by the directive.</P>
    <P>I said the former Government made no representations in regard to the directive.  That is not strictly correct. The pension will be subvented by Europe only between the ages of 55 and 65.  We are giving the pension for life, but the former Government wanted the limit extended, and the basis of their argument was that the non-contributory old age pension in this country should not become payable until 70 and, therefore, the pension should go on until then.  That means one thing to me, that the former Government had no intention in the then foreseeable future of reducing the old age pension non-contributory qualifying age below the age of 70.  Of course, it is now at 67 and the point is not so important.  Nevertheless, our scheme is a pension commencing at 55 or the date of surrender and going on for life.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that for the applicant over 55 our scheme is much more generous than the model EEC scheme, and the extent it exceeds the directive <Col N="1300" /> will have to be paid for entirely by the Irish taxpayer, and is being so paid for.  For the farmer who wishes to retire under 55 there is no annuity, but there is a premium on the sale price or leasehold rent I have already mentioned, and, again, Europe will not contribute to this premium or bonus.  It will have to be paid for entirely by us.</P>
    <P>If a married applicant under the scheme who is in receipt of £600 dies, his spouse becomes entitled to a pension of £400.  If a person leases his land he retains the right to sell it or leave it by his will to anybody he likes, subject of course, to the lease.  The scheme also provides for a cash grant to enable people to put their title in order.  That is a very valuable benefit in most parts of the country, particuarly in the west, where titles have not been looked after, perhaps, for generations. The farmer can also retain the dwelling house and up to two acres of land.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the farmer may continue to work as a paid hand for other farmers.  This is another advantage over the directive and something I fought for and gained.  He may take on any other employment he can get, but the main thing is that under the directive he would have been precluded from working for another farmer.  I pointed out that in our circumstances it was in the interests of the retiring farmer and the continuing farmer that the retiring farmer should be able and permitted to work for the continuing farmer if he wanted to do so.</P>
    <P>As I said, during the course of this debate only three objections have been raised to this scheme: the first is that it does not apply to land which is being let; the second is that it applies only to holdings of 45 acres; and the third is that development farmers under Directive 159 will get priority.  I should like to deal with these very briefly.</P>
    <P>First of all, I concede that it does not apply to farms which are being let at the date of the application.  My predecessor in office might have been able to exclude that when the directive was being drawn up if he had bothered his head to make representations about it.  However, it is not a <Col N="1301" /> fatal flaw in the scheme because all it means is that a farmer who is letting his land will not qualify for the benefit of the scheme, but the Land Commission have plenty of machinery at their disposal to acquire that land for the relief of congestion or for bringing up transitional farmers or other farmers to a viable state.  It does not put the land that is being let outside the reach of the Land Commission. The Land Commission can acquire the land, give it to congests, uneconomic holders, transitional farmers, development farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is something my predecessor could have attended to, too, when the economic position in Ireland and the world was better than it is today but, please God, before I leave office the economy will be booming again and we shall deal with that matter.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second complaint, that the scheme applies only to farms not exceeding 45 acres, I would point out that that means 45 adjusted acres, which in most parts of the country would be 60 or 70 acres.  But there are very important exceptions: there is no limit to the area of the farm that may be acquired if there are not sufficient small farms in the area to comply with Directive 159. They can acquire any size of farm under the scheme, give the pension and give the benefit.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there is no limit on the area of the farm which a disabled farmer or a widow of a farmer may surrender under the scheme.  Therefore, this 45 acres provision is really not important here.  It is not important because the important thing in the scheme is the fact that, if there are not enough small farms, we can move for larger farms and give the benefits of the scheme to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third objection is that development farmers under Directive 159 have a priority claim to land surrendered under Directive 160.  That is not correct because, in order to have priority, the farmer must have a development <Col N="1302" /> plan which certifies that he requires more land.  If he has such a plan, I concede he has priority.  In my opinion a fully fledged development farmer will rarely require more land.  He may want credit.  He may want fertilisers. He may want machinery.  He will not want land.  If, however, a transitional farmer goes to the advisory services and gets a plan from them and a certificate saying that, if he gets more land, he can become a development farmer, then he will fit into the scheme.</P>
    <P>The objections put forward by the Opposition are put forward against their own directive, against the directive negotiated and accepted by themselves, and they seem to me to assume that this scheme is to replace all other powers at the disposal of the Land Commission for acquiring land.  That is not the case.  This is simply an additional bit of machinery given to the Land Commission to enable the Land Commission to acquire land and it complements the powers already at their disposal.  The Land Commission will continue to use their existing and, as I describe them, traditional powers to acquire land.  Where there are progressive farmers who show they can make a job of what they are doing, farmers who show they can become viable, the Land Commission will not hesitate to go after land that is let, land that is derelict, vast ranches, or land that is not producing, under their traditional powers and hand that land over to deserving farmers.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to report that the Land Commission acquired an exceptional amount of land in the nine months just ended, both in terms of acreage and in terms of money.  In regard to this directive and the scheme drawn up under it, the scheme is a good scheme and one which is working more than reasonably well.  It came into operation on 1st May, 1974, and the House will accept as a reasonable statement that no one could expect that application forms would be rushed out, returned and processed immediately. There had to be a breathing space and time to get the scheme across but, in the seven months from the time the scheme came into operation, 1,114 applications have been received in the Department; 200 of <Col N="1303" /> those have been accepted as eligible and 120 have been rejected.  The rest have yet to be processed.  In 65 cases the price has actually been fixed and agreed upon with those wishing to surrender the land.  Up to 50 have got as far as the solicitor's office to complete the legal technicalities and some pensions are already being paid to those intending to benefit.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Opposition not to run down this scheme but, rather, to speak in favour of it as the north Connacht Co-Op has spoken in favour of it and likewise the national newspapers. I would say to the Opposition that they should encourage those intending to avail of the scheme and, if they do that, they will be doing a good job for those who are unhappy in farming and unable to make a job of it.  They will also be doing a good job for those who want to continue in agriculture.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, has been queried on a number of occasions as to what the position will be after 1977.  The impression has been created that there will be an end to 65 per cent of farmers after that.  Again, I appeal to the Opposition not to play politics with small farmers, not to try to terrorise them.  I appeal to the Opposition to be frank with the small farmers because this is too serious a business about which to play politics.  There is no reason why anybody should be worried about what will happen after 1977. There is no question whatever that grants will come to an end.  That is simply not the case.  What Directive 159 says is that the special concessions under which transitional farmers get the same grants as development farmers for most things will be reviewed in 1977.  Even if the concession is not continued, that will not mean no grants for transitional farmers.  At worst, it will mean only that they will get slightly lower rates of grant than they do now.  That is the worst that can happen.  But that will not happen because the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Clinton, will see to it that it does not happen.  Someone says he may not be there but, if the forecast of the Leader of the Opposition <Col N="1304" /> in <i>The Sunday Press</i> last Sunday is to be taken as serious, we will certainly be here because he says there is every danger of their losing nine seats and, he says, they could win, but it is very unlikely.  That is poor solace and poor encouragement for the henchmen down the country.  That was <i>The Sunday Press.</i></P>
    <P>Any decision on this will be a decision for the Council of Ministers and not for the Commission and it is as near certainty as it can be that many Ministers will want to continue the present system.  Certainly this country will want to continue it.  The essential point is that there is no question at all of grants ending in 1977.  Fianna Fáil will not be in power but, if they were, they would not stand for grants being ended.  We will not stand for them being ended; we have an independent voice and we will see to it that grants will not be ended.</P>
    <P>Another point made was about the floor price for store cattle.  Deputy Gibbons suggested there was no problem at all about this, that it was done in the UK every day in the week.  First of all, there is no comparison between our system of cattle rearing and fattening and the British system.  Cattle reared in Britain are born on the farm from which they are sold for slaughter.  Here they change hands several times, from the west to the midlands, from the midlands to the east, and so on.  My information is that, notwithstanding what Deputy Gibbons said, there is no floor price for young store cattle in England.  It is simply not a fact.  It does not exist and it never existed. There is some sort of a bonus or a bounty for bigger cattle.</P>
    <P>I know what it is to be in Opposition but Fianna Fáil are playing a game saying that grants will be ended after 1977, that only 35 per cent of the farmers can become commercial, and so on.  Deputy Collins' forecast about only 35 per cent becoming commercial is just about as accurate as his estimate of the amount of land which would be surrendered under the retirement scheme.  We know he was very far out there.  The fact of the matter is that far more than 50 per cent of the farmers will become <Col N="1305" /> commercial, will become viable in one way or another.  They will buy up small farms beside them, or they will get farms under my scheme, or they will get farms from the Land Commission, or they will go into intensive farming.  The day of the 45-acre farm criterion being sacrosanct is over and finished with.  One farmer could be viable or commerical with 30 acres and it might take 70 acres for another.  The question of the 45 acres will have to be looked at.</P>
    <P>When he was concluding his remarks yesterday evening, Deputy Gibbons made an attack on the Taoiseach in reference to his speech in Galway.  He was out of order but he made the remark before he could be pulled up.  He looked as if he were going to develop it but he did not.  It was reported.  Last Saturday in Galway the Taoiseach appealed for a sense of responsibility all over the country.  He referred to the industrial arm of the economy and he appealed to the best growers to be responsible and not to put the economy in danger.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> He made a reference to upholding law and order and in that he was referring to tyres being cut on lorries which were bringing manures from one place to another for beet growers. Surely that was illegal, and surely it should be condemned.  The Taoiseach asked for responsibility right across the country.  If this country were to rely on its industrial arm entirely, it would be a poor country.  If it were to rely on its agricultural arm entirely, it would be a poor country. It is only by both arms of the economy pulling together and cooperating with the Government of the day in this difficult time, that we can pull through.  If the Opposition are to be responsible they will not cash in on any temporary difficulties and encourage people to do things which might damage the entire economy. I appeal to the House to reject the motion in the name of the Opposition and to accept the amendment in the <Col N="1306" /> name of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>He knew the opposition which would have faced him if he had come to Galway and listened to the problems affecting the small farmers in the west.  The Minister for Lands asked the House to reject this motion put down by Fianna Fáil Deputies.  I cannot understand how any rural Deputy who knows the problems affecting the small farmers, whether they be in the west, or in the south, or in the north, can vote against this motion.  I will read the second part of the motion:</P>
      <P>...to introduce a scheme of financial assistance for those farmers who have been forced to sell young cattle at totally uneconomic prices, or who are trying to hold their cattle, or both, and immediately introduce a floor price for all young cattle.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries spoke here yesterday he said this would be impossible.  I cannot see why it should be impossible. We know that when something like this is promoted the first thing to be said is that it would be administratively impossible.  There is no reason why it should not be administratively possible.  Deputy Gibbons and Deputy Collins outlined how this scheme could be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that 1974 was a disastrous year for Irish agriculture.  The recession in the beef trade throughout Europe affected all producers, but none worse than the Irish farmer.  In November, <Col N="1307" /> the average price for adult cattle in Ireland was only £11.36 per cwt, whereas in Europe it was £20.92.  The intervention system which was designed to offset the glut which occurred in 1974 failed because of the serious practical shortcomings in its implementation. We have seen those shortcomings ourselves over the past few months.</P>
    <P>Neither the Minister, nor his Department, nor the specially chosen intervention board, anticipated the peculiar problems which would arise when we in Ireland adopted the EEC intervention scheme.  We all know the trouble which has occurred at the marts particularly in relation to people breeding small cattle.  Those of us who have attended marts during the past 12 months saw the low prices obtaining. Farmers were forced to sell their cattle at ridiculously low prices because they had no feedingstuff.  They could not afford to run the risk of holding those cattle for the winter months and run the risk of losing them through starvation.</P>
    <P>The problems in Ireland are different from those obtaining on the Continent because on the Continent the small cattle are fattened on the same farm on which they are born.  The Irish store producer sells to the fattener who in turn sells to the fresh or processed beef markets in Ireland or abroad. Consequently, the intervention aid given to the Irish fattener does not always go back to the producer.  This is exactly what happened this year.  The intervention benefits which were supposed to be given to the farmers did not go back to the producer.  It is unfortunate that this should be allowed to continue and that something is not done about it.</P>
    <P>The people who really made money out of this scheme were the factory owners and the butchers.  The intervention money did not go back to the small farmers.  That is unfortunate but at this stage it is useless to talk about an inquiry because this will not compensate the small farmers who were forced to sell their cattle at ridiculously low prices.  An inquiry will merely reveal where the money went to and this is no good to the people who have <Col N="1308" /> suffered.  We had much criticism of Directives 159 and 160 and we know that when we went into Europe we accepted them but that is no reason why we should accept them for ever. Those directives should be revised from time to time and every effort should be made to ensure that the farmers are going to benefit by them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands has outlined the advantages of Directive 160 and I have no doubt that he is sincere in his belief that farmers will avail of the benefits under the scheme and will sell their land to the Land Commission and so make it available to farmers who are able to use it properly.  In County Galway, a county where the scheme should operate and if it were attractive enough, should be eagerly availed of by the farmers, the results are not too promising.  In a parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister for Lands on 10th December, 1974, I asked him the total number of applications received to date from farmers in County Galway who wished to avail of the farm retirement scheme.  He said that 59 applications were received but that two were later withdrawn leaving a net 57.  I do not know what the present position is but I thought that was a rather small number from a county where the scheme should be very attractive and where there is great fragmentation of holdings. Every effort should be made by the Land Commission to ensure that under this scheme, or under the powers they had prior to this scheme, the serious problem of fragmented holdings is eliminated because it is very difficult for small farmers to eke out a living but when the farm is divided into five or six parts it becomes extremely difficult.  I hope that more money will be made available to the Land Commission because the big problem seems to be that they have not sufficient money to buy land and it is useless to offer land bonds because farmers are not prepared to accept them.  The Minister might consider devoting some of the money brought in by taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many points I should like to raise concerning <Col N="1310" /> agriculture but they have been covered by Deputy Collins and Deputy Gibbons and, therefore, I shall not deal with them.  I have mentioned the case of the meat factories, the scandal that has taken place, and I hope we shall never see this repeated. It is a disgrace to Irish agriculture and to the Government to have allowed it to happen.  Although the Minister might say he is not responsible or that he did his best to try to eliminate it, as the political head of a Department of Agriculture and Fisheries he must accept responsibility for what happened in the meat trade during 1974.  Certainly, people have become millionaries overnight because of this scheme, to the disadvantage of the small farmers. Years ago, Cromwell drove thousands of farmers out of this country by brute force but the Government's lack of action in this field is driving them out quietly because they cannot hold on at present.  They hoped that in the budget statement the Minister would have provided some benefit for them but the benefits made available are very little use to the farmers.</P>
      <P>The Government made great play of the seed voucher scheme but it cost them nothing.  The scheme was set up because one penny per lb was deducted from the meat processors who agreed to this to provide seed vouchers.  That scheme has been totally inadequate, as the Minister admitted yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is no great credit to the Minister because it is not a direct contribution by the Government. It is provided by depriving meat factories and other registered cattle buyers of VAT credit facilities and this amounts to something like a 1 per cent refund for costs.  It costs the Government nothing.  It is merely money provided through the factories just as when the scheme was first initiated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not half enough of it. We want it: That is why I am here trying to make a case for those people. When they applied for their vouchers they expected they would qualify but I fear something went completely wrong because people who made their applications in time were refused vouchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>They will get them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did people who applied later get the vouchers?  The administration of the scheme seems to have gone completely wrong.  Farmers have suffered enough without this sort of messing continuing.  I hope when the £2.2 million that the Minister boasts about is made available the scheme will be tidied up and that those people who have applied will be able to get their vouchers.  Even if they do I am afraid that with the way prices are going it will not be a really great advantage but it will go some of the way.  About 85 per cent of the applications for feed vouchers came from the west of Ireland, a clear indication of the plight of the people there.  Farmers in the west are hard hit and for this reason money should be made available to them as soon as possible.  If the feed vouchers are given to them they will serve as an encouragement.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands stated that we were not to play politics with this thing of driving farmers off the land after 1977.  However, I do not know how the farmers will be able to stay on the land unless they go into some kind of intensive farming such as pig production.  Of course, we have all seen what happened to that industry in the past 12 months.  The price of meal last year has driven small pig producers away from this type of farming entirely and I cannot see them returning to it. Pig production was a great source of income for the small farmers but they are prevented from continuing in this line because of the price of meal.  The Government made a serious mistake allowing that situation to occur because the small pig producer made a noble contribution to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most serious aspects of <Col N="1312" /> the whole situation is the question of fertilisers.  The fact of the matter is that farmers cannot afford to buy fertilisers. I understood that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was to hold an inquiry into the stockpiling of fertilisers last year but I have not seen any result from that inquiry.  Unless some kind of subsidy is given to farmers to enable them to purchase fertilisers we will be in a serious situation next year.  The fact that fertiliser is not applied to the land this year will mean a drop in production in livestock and tillage next year, something which would be disastrous for our economy. A couple of years ago if a farmer had a suck calf he could go to the shopkeeper and order a ton of fertiliser but the same farmer would need to have at least ten such calves to be in a position to order the same amount of fertiliser now.  The little nest egg small farmers had to tide them over a bleak period has gone on increased prices of fertiliser.  If the sale of fertiliser drops the production on the land drops also.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that A. I. stations which have provided a very good service for farmers irrespective of where they live are in serious difficulty.  Up to now a farmer who availed of this service had a good choice of breed of cattle but these stations are finding it difficult to continue because of lack of finance.  Even though the price of the service has been increased the stations are in serious trouble.  Unless the Minister comes to their aid there will be serious unemployment. The Minister should ensure that this service continues because otherwise we will have a bad breed of cattle and we will be back to the scrub bull situation.  If this is allowed to happen it will be disastrous for our national herd.  There is no reason why money cannot be provided for this service because foreign industrialists are given grants and every facility to establish industries here.  The A. I. service is essential for the country's most important industry, agriculture.  No money has been provided for the creation or maintenance of jobs in agriculture and that should not be so.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out to the Minister that there has been severe <Col N="1313" /> criticism of the brucellosis scheme.  A constituent of mine has informed me that he has been held up by this scheme since 1973.  In that year he had an income of £1,400 from milk and since then he has been trying to get his herd cleared so that he can return to milk production.  Unfortunately, through no fault of his own, he is held up with the result that he has suffered a great loss in his income.  It will take him many years to get back on his feet again.  In my view the difficulty is that reactors are not removed from the farm quick enough.  That complaint is common among the farming community. The Minister should ensure that reactors are cleared as quickly as possible.  The scheme is costing the Exchequer a lot of money to administer but the farmers are suffering because of the delay in removing reactors. The fact that this man's herd has not been cleared has cost him in the region of £3,000.</P>
    <P>Animal health committees were established with the approval of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries some time ago but I understand they are not functioning&mdash;at least the committee in Galway is not functioning&mdash; because the Minister has refused to sanction travelling expenses for the members.  I have been informed that expenses were paid to the Cork members. This matter has been raised by many Deputies but we have not got anywhere.  The committees serve a good purpose because they are composed of veterinary surgeons and those connected with farming.  They should not be allowed to go out of existence because of a trivial matter such as the payment of travelling expenses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this because these committees could make a good contribution to agriculture and the elimination of disease in animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sheep are very important as far as farmers in Galway and the west are concerned.  I should like to ask the Minister if in connection with the French market at the end of the full transitional period Ireland, Britain <Col N="1314" /> and Denmark will have equal access to it as that which now applies to the original five members.  This is a very important question with regard to the sheep industry and to producers who in County Galway are very numerous.</P>
    <P>At present the position is that Ireland, Britain and France are treated in a similar way to non-EEC countries. Irish lamb exports can be stopped overnight when prices reach a certain threshold level.  In addition, Irish exporters must pay France import levies. In 1973 we exported £7.6 million worth of mutton and lamb and £1.3 million worth of live sheep and lambs, which constituted a considerable contribution to our economy.  France took £4 million worth of mutton and lamb and, thereby, constituted our major market.  Irish exporters have established good contacts in France and foresee considerable scope for development but, all too often, they find themselves cut off with little notice and having to return to the United Kingdom market. It would be unfortunate were this allowed to happen at present because the main effect of such an occurrence is to disrupt planning totally both at factory and farm level.  As a result our sheep population has remained static at approximately four million.  Uncertainty prevents expansion, particularly when account is taken of the repeated delays in achieving a common agricultural policy for sheep.  Therefore, I think this question should be pursued. Sheep provide a very good income for the economy.  Every effort should be made to develop this market and ensure it is not lost to the farmer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins dealt at length with the anomalies as he saw them in Directive 159.  We know there are many things inherent in that which are not to the advantage of the small farmer.  I am told by our chief agricultural officer that at least 75 per cent of the farmers of County Galway would not become development farmers under Directive 159.  This is a very serious situation if one considers that those who are not classified as &ldquo;development&rdquo; farmers would not qualify for additional lands or for subsidised loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation or any other agricultural <Col N="1315" /> agency.  Where possible, I would request that the Minister try to gear that directive to suit the small farmer in the west, thereby ensuring that as many of them as possible remain on the land and continue to live and support their families there.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to comment briefly on the contribution of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. I should like to have it made known that but for the fact that this motion tabled by the Fianna Fáil Party was placed before the House, Deputy M. P. Murphy, as Parliamentary Secretary, would not even have had the two minutes he did have in which to make his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I further say that if he is sincere in what he has just said&mdash; that he would always welcome debate on agriculture in this House&mdash;then he might remind himself that the last time we had a discussion on the Estimate for Agriculture was on the one introduced by his Minister in October/ November, 1973.  That was the last time we had open and free discussion on the activities of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I respectfully suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he use his good influence on the man of whom he speaks so highly&mdash;and rightly so he being his Parliamentary Secretary&mdash; and let the Minister use his influence on his Government colleagues to bring the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries before this House for discussion.  Then we might have an opportunity of hearing contributions from other members of the two political parties which make up the Government because, let me say this, the man who for years portrayed himself the defender of the farmers and of their rights, whether big or small, the man who was front bench spokesman for Fine Gael for many years, Deputy L'Estrange, has not come into this House since this debate began.  So well he might not because the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries at least knows full well what <Col N="1317" /> would have to be the contribution of Deputy L'Estrange if he were sitting in on this debate, as would be the contribution of many members of his party had they an opportunity to speak.</P>
    <P>I, like Deputy Hussey, heard a little about the Fine Gael conference which took place in Galway last week-end. It is no secret that there, amongst those who are solidly and politically committed to the Minister and his Fine Gael colleagues, very harsh criticism was voiced.</P>

      <P>If the Minister for Lands would allow me, I will tell him where I got the information.  I received it from two people who attended that conference and who came away in disgust.  If Deputy M.P. Murphy wants to make a contribution on agriculture in this House at any stage, we would indeed welcome the opportunity of hearing it.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the motion we have tabled&mdash;and, I might say, drafted by the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy J. Gibbons, and myself on behalf of our party&mdash;was deliberately to highlight in our Parliament the plight of the farming community and, in particular, the disastrous situation obtaining at present. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was far more honest in his contribution than was the Minister for Lands, because at least the former admits that there is a very bad situation. If Deputy M.P. Murphy, the Parliamentary Secretary, believes there is nothing wrong in the agricultural sector I might ask him to cast his mind back only a very short time to when there were farmers picketing Leinster House.  May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary what motivates ordinary people to break the law by picketing outside this building?</P>

      <P>Let me remind the House, too, that at no time during the almost two years that we have been in Opposition have we attempted to use farming organisations in the political way that Fine Gael used them when that party were in opposition. No Member of this party went to any part of the country for the purpose of organising individuals to march to Dublin but this was done by the Opposition when we were in Government.  It was an attempt to embarrass us.  If the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister for Lands believe that everything is bright and rosy in so far as the farmers are concerned, we may take it that the situation is much worse than we see it.  It is common knowledge that many Fine Gael supporters are asking whether the Government know of or have any interest in what is happening in rural Ireland.  In my constituency many Fine Gael supporters have approached me saying: &ldquo;What is wrong with that shower in Dublin?  Have they no commonsense?&rdquo; That question might be said to have been answered for them now by the Parliamentary Secretary when he says that nothing is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of this debate we were told by the Ministers who contributed, as we were told on a previous occasion by the Minister for Defence, that we should not highlight the situation.  We were told that to do so would create harm.  It is our responsibility and our duty to bring to the notice of Parliament the situation as we see it, and we see it as a dark and dismal one.  We tabled this motion <Col N="1319" /> in the hope that the Minister and the Government would do something positive and quickly to alleviate the problems.  Knowing the Minister to be an honest man, I can only conclude that he approached the Clerk of the Dáil tongue-in-cheek when tabling the amendment to this motion.  It took a lot of political neck to put down such an amendment and to pretend to have believed in it.</P>

This amendment will be passed tonight by the Deputies who make up the two parties opposite, but in conscience they cannot vote for it if they are aware of what is happening. The situation is very bad.  The softly-softly approach will not help them.  Words will not ease the problems of those who are in such difficulty.</P>
      <P>Regarding the farm modernisation scheme in particular and the debate in general, I have been extremely disappointed with the contributions of the Minister.  I had hoped to hear from him of some positive steps to deal with the situation and that he would have held out a light at the end of some tunnel for those unfortunates in difficulty.  This was not to be.  Many people were waiting for something worthwhile to emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see the farm modernisation scheme in operation and operating as freely as possible.  I would not accept the sly innuendos of the Minister <Col N="1320" /> for Lands who, falling back on his legal brain and training, tried to say that I meant otherwise.  That is not so.  I should hope that this scheme would operate as quickly as possible, but there are not enough staff available to put it into operation.  It is a scheme that is top heavy with documentation. The keeping of accounts is a big problem, but something definite must be done.  The farming community distrusts this Government on the question of accounts.  While some of them might trust the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, I do not think any would trust the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley asked whether the value of an asset which had become negligible could be brought to appeal if it was not accepted as such.  The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, all questions of assessment can be brought to appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier Deputy Colley asked me if <Col N="1325" /> I was finished with the land surrounding a house and I have since recalled that it was he who raised the question of other statutes referring to a house being that which lies on five acres of land and wondered why was the difference between five acres and one acre. The reason is very clear.  It is the same reason that other people, including Deputy Belton, spoke about.  Any land attached to a house could be of immense value depending on its location. Obviously the greater the demand on the land the greater will be its value.  A private dwellinghouse with one acre in an urban area could have a market value far in excess of its worth as a single private dwellinghouse.  This is a considerable exemption and it would be wrong to add to that exemption the further addition that would accrue to the person who had five acres surrounding such a house.  As with other measures in this Bill we had to go for a reasonable compromise to let out the normal private dweller.  We have done this but to extend it further than the one acre would allow a bolthole for escape to avoidance and other practices that could not be condoned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the rural areas I mentioned earlier what will happen is that the house and one acre will be exempt.  Any excess will be taxable as long as it is within the brackets of liability.  If all the property is sold together, the house and the value of one acre will be taken out and the remaining acres will be liable if they fall within the appropriate figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think it would be justified for the reasons I have given.  It would allow extremely generous concessions to people fortunate enough to have this extra land.</P>

      <P>No, but why should one confer this piece of luck on one section of the community who happen to be in property that has immense market value?  This would be wrong because it would be giving a concession that would not be warranted.  It would be a special favour to people who least need it.</P>
      <P>Company group treatment is a matter that falls for treatment not within the ambit of capital gains tax but rather on the Bill relating to corporation tax.  I shall insert the necessary provisions in that Bill so that capital gains accruing to members of a group of companies will be dealt with within the Bill dealing with corporation tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that while that is a reasonable approach it is important when this legislation is being passed that some indication be given regarding how the matter will be treated in the other Bill.  Will it be broadly similar to the treatment in Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions for group reliefs have been set out in the White Paper on corporation tax.  I think they are somewhat similar to what exists in Britain but I should not like to be specific on that.  I am not too familiar with the position in Britain and I should like to study it before I give an answer I might be held to on that.  We have set out the provisions in the White Paper.  Pending the introduction of corporation tax legislation, any company that consider they are adversely affected by existing rules may apply to the Revenue Commissioners who have power to grant relief administratively where hardship occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley asked me to provide that there be a carry back of losses. As the Deputy knows, this is not permitted under the income tax system and, as the great argument in favour of capital gains tax is that it is a tax on receipts that are analogous to income, I do not think it would be right to provide this special exemption <Col N="1327" /> in respect of capital gains unless it could be provided in respect of income tax.  It could not be provided with regard to income tax without generating immense, costly and complex situations for taxpayers and the Revenue Commissioners.  The right in respect of losses will be similar to the one that applies to income tax, namely, the right to carry forward capital losses against future capital gains.</P>
    <P>Deputies Collins and Fitzpatrick asked for information about the way the Revenue Commissioners will require taxpayers to account.  On the annual income tax form there will be a space in which taxpayers will be required to fill in details of assets acquired during the year, their cost and any capital gains made in that year. Deputy Fitzpatrick asked specifically what accounts would be required to establish what money had been invested in a business.  The ordinary income tax returns will show what money is invested in a business because by making such returns the taxpayer can receive credit for investments made.</P>

      <P>Deputies may be assured that I will be only too willing to give that information.  I started my speech by pointing out the contradictions in the Fianna Fáil stance and I will conclude by pointing out another example of this.  At one stage I was taunted that the words I used suggested there could be an increase in the rate of tax.  Coming from the party opposite this amused me because instead of the 26 per cent rate for the first six years they urged we should have a higher rate of tax on capital gains.  It emphasises what I said at the beginning, that apparently they are confused in their approach to capital gains and they are trying to milk two different cows at the same time into opposite buckets, but they have not got four hands.</P>

      <P>Perhaps not at this time of year.  Let the Deputy not draw me into that or we might reopen the debate which took place earlier.  If Fianna Fáil would decide before the next Stage on which side they are it would help them and the country generally to identify what their approach is to this issue of capital gains, which I see very simply as being a necessary step towards the achievement in this country of what every progressive country has already, that is, a much broader base for taxation with less avoidance and evasion than we inherited in the taxation code which we took over and are now as quickly as possible trying to reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I pointed out to the Deputy that this is a Bill which introduces capital taxation in Ireland, that the rate chosen and the concessions given take account of the possibility of inflation and provide a very generous measure of relief to the overwhelming <Col N="1330" /> mass of taxpayers.  I am satisfied that these thresholds, adjusted from time to time, are the most appropriate way to tackle this problem of inflation.  There is almost unanimous agreement among financial commentators that it is not possible to produce a satisfactory index or regulator to govern inflation in respect of capital taxation.  That is one of the reasons we have gone to these ready and not so rough thresholds and one rate so that account can be taken of possible movements in inflation without causing hardship to anybody.  This is not the last word and further reliefs and amendments can be given as is given in respect of income tax.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress last Wednesday the House had spent a considerable time debating section 17.  I devoted considerable time explaining the purpose of the section and its effect and I think I succeeded in allaying the fears Deputies may have had about it.  I mentioned that the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, in dealing with the corresponding provision in the 1963 Act, indicated that the provision would not be used except in exceptional circumstances.  I think I made it clear that has been the position since that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also said I would be prepared to make it clear to the new planning board that in my view the new provision should be used in the same way.  In addition I moved amendment No. 36 which would enable me to make regulations setting out matters <Col N="1333" /> which should be taken into account by the board before directing that expenses be paid.  When the debate was adjourned it was my feeling that we had reached a certain amount of agreement on it.  I trust that, on the basis of the assurances and explanations I have already given, the House will now formally agree to the section and it will not be necessary to go back over the ground we have covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the Minister see as an exceptional case?  He might see something as an exceptional case but the board might not see it in the same light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason it is not worth talking about what I would think is an exceptional case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is precisely why I am still worried about this.  The Minister might decide something is an exceptional case but the board might decide it is not.  They will have to interpret this Bill when it becomes an Act and, as they see it, they would have to give costs against the third party appellant, which could amount to a very considerable sum and would have a deterrent effect on people pursuing genuine appeals. As regards paragraph (b) (iii)&mdash;&ldquo;to the Board, such sum as the Board in its absolute discretion...&rdquo; can award itself&mdash;I do not think that would stand up in court, and there would still be the fear in people's minds about costs which would prevent them from lodging appeals.  I agree the section does not alter the 1963 Act in substance, but it does indicate that there might be a different attitude in the future than there was in the past. Section 16 deals with vexatious and frivolous appeals, and therefore section 17 is not required.  The figures show that the number of third party appeals coming in were not of any great consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Deputy O'Brien saying that the number of third party appeals coming in were not of any great consequence?  What exactly does he mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of 3,520 over an <Col N="1334" /> 11-month period, 216 were third party appeals.  29 of those were upheld, 86 were unsuccessful and 101 had conditions attached.  In the light of that information, I would think this section is superfluous and it is causing fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Two hundred and sixteen is a substantial figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not mind the top number.  Just take the figure 216.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of 216, 86 were unsuccessful.  It is the figure of 86 we are talking about.  The others had some substance in that 29 were upheld and 101 had conditions attached. These 86 could well have been frivolous or vexatious and could have been dealt with before coming to this stage at all.  It is important that third-party appeals should not be inhibited in any way.  They are the platform for the man-in-the-street who feels he has a genuine grievance.  I know the Minister is concerned for the man-in-the-street, as he has shown since he came into Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill as a whole is very good and will close a number of loopholes. When we talk about planning we talk about environment and about people. In talking about people we consider the greater good for them.  Anything we might do to restrict their rights would be contrary to the spirit of this Bill.  The Minister has given assurances here, and I accept that is what he intends, but when this Bill is enacted it is the intrepretation of the Act that will be important.  There could be a different Minister there tomorrow or in five years' time.  While the present Minister will see that the provision will not be used in the way it is feared it might be used, another Minister could see it differently.  As the section stands, the board can award costs against the Department and, after all, it is largely against third parties that the vast sums of money will be awarded.  It is the developer and other such people who will employ the expertise.  If you go to oral hearings you will see that residents' associations and individuals <Col N="1335" /> are generally represented by, at best, a junior counsel, sometimes a solicitor, and in this way, their costs would not be anything like those of the others.  Therefore I would ask the Minister to look sympathetically at section 17 between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister giving any indication to Deputy O'Brien that he will reconsider this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a slight difficulty here.  The last day we went over this very fully and I said that the draftsman used the words &ldquo;costs or other expenses&rdquo;, and that, since there was no ulterior motive behind it as far as I was concerned, I was prepared to delete the reference to costs.  That brings us back to the 1963 Act. With reference to what the Deputy says about Ministers changing, Ministers did change since the 1963 Act and, to their credit, all of them honoured the word given by the then Minister, Deputy Blaney, and there has been no difficulty about this.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien talks about the new board being in a different category, that they will be administering the law. That is so, but if it was pointed out to the new board in reference to this &mdash;and I am taking the necessary authority to do this sort of thing&mdash;that there was no intention that it should be administered any more stringently or any more widely I believe things could go quite smoothly.  I have no reason to believe there will be any difficulty about it.</P>
      <P>We have almost reached agreement, and if we could stay on this point without going back over the whole discussion of the last day, I am most certainly prepared to alter this on Report Stage, and to have a look at the section, even though I do not see there is much I can do to improve the rest of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had many representations on this matter, too. There seems to be a substantial amount of disquiet about the provisions of this section and as to how they might apply to a person making a third party <Col N="1336" /> appeal.  We would not like to see the fears that have been expressed to us become a reality.  The Minister is probably in a difficult enough position in trying to give us sufficient guarantees here to accept the section as it stands, but, on the face of it, on an ordinary reading of the section there does seem to be justification for the fears we have heard expressed.  It is a big change. The only change from the 1963 Act is that the board can now direct that the expenses of the developer be met in certain circumstances by the person who has brought the third party appeal. That could be interpreted as inserted there to frighten off third party appeals altogether.</P>
      <P>I know there has been a certain amount of annoyance and frustration expressed by developers against those who have brought such appeals and they have tried to justify their frustration and annoyance by saying that many of these appeals were vexatious, ill-founded and mischievous.  Section 16 would seem to cover the situation adequately.  Why then insert this provision which could prove an obstacle to persons making a third party appeal?</P>
      <P>I have had representations quite recently again, probably because the matter has been highlighted, though I have not seen much coverage of this debate in the Press, on this particular point; this seems to be a vindictive section aimed at trying to frighten off those who might bring third party appeals.  In view of the way appeals are being dealt with under section 16 why is there any real need for this provision?  Deputy O'Brien expressed the views of many people in this and we have reason to believe these people are making valid points.  I accept that the Minister is not anxious to be vindictive and not anxious to frighten off appellants or deny people the right of appeal, on the one hand, and then effectively he is doing exactly that by facing them with the prospect of very heavy costs and expenses.  I would strongly urge the Minister to rethink this provision.  I refer to section 17 (1) (b) (ii) in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to hold up the Bill on this point but we would like a definite indication from the Minister <Col N="1337" /> that he will satisfy the House that this will not be used unnecessarily or in a vindictive fashion.  Safeguards will have to be written in to ensure this. Past experience does not provide us with any precedent because we have not had experience of a board operating the Planning Act.  We must safeguard against any excessive use of this section.  When the Minister was introducing the original 1963 Planning Act he gave an assurance that Ministers would not operate their powers under section 16 of that Act in a vindictive or unnecessary way, that it was intended only to use the powers in extreme cases, cases in which the Minister was fully satisfied that the appellant had no grounds except delaying the development for petty and mischievous reasons.  The Board, if they are of that opinion, can stop an appeal under section 16.  Why then include these penal provisions which will act as a severe deterrent to organisations and residents' associations interested in the proper development and planning of the areas in which they reside?  Up to this these people have taken on the job of appealing against planning permission by the local authority in certain cases and they have undertaken a heavy enough expenditure in presenting their cases at oral hearings.  They have had to collect funds on a voluntary basis.  If they are faced in future with a bill possibly running into thousands of pounds that will act as a serious deterrent to community organisations bringing third party appeals against large developers.  It is a question of the small man <i>vis-à-vis</i> big business and capitalism.  The Minister, professing to be a socialist, must have some doubt, even if it is only at the back of his mind, about this whole section. He has gone quite a long way in section 16 to meet any difficulties and I would appeal to him to rethink that part of section 17 which introduces this new aspect of costs and expenses being charged against third parties.</P>

If the House will be any happier <Col N="1338" /> about it I am prepared to delete the reference to costs.  This will bring us back practically to the 1963 Act. The only difference will be that it will not be the Minister interpreting, it will be the board.  If we are going to appoint a board then we will tell the board that the 1963 Act is not to be used in a certain way.  That assurance was given by the Minister at the time and I am prepared to assure the House that I will advise the board in the same way.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into the question of Ministers saying things and afterwards finding out that their successors did or said something else.  This has been honoured in a certain way and the board we appoint should be trusted to honour something they are asked to honour.  Deputy Molloy referred to representations made by certain bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said residents' associations and so on.  The Deputy also said he accepted I was not trying to be punitive in order to prevent people bringing appeals.  I <Col N="1339" /> am grateful to him for making that point, but there is no ground whatever for suggesting this is being done. For some extraordinary reason this has been spearheaded by certain people who kept saying that this was put in for the purpose of preventing those who want to make third party appeals from making them.  I do not think anybody believes that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy referred to section 16.  Section 16 simply provides for the forfeiture of the deposit of £10 for frivolous objections.  That is a different thing altogether.  With the exception of &ldquo;the costs&rdquo; what we are providing here is almost word for word what is in the 1963 Act.  If it would make anybody any happier, I do not see why we should not put in the whole section and take out &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and put in &ldquo;board&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Molloy reads the two sections he will find that section 17 in the Bill has good points.  I am prepared to consider changing it completely if that would make the House any happier.  This comes off the top of my head and I would like to have a look at it.  If it covers the problem which I think is there, that might be the simplest way to do it. In any case, I will take out the objectionable words, the reference to costs.  I could put in a reference to frivolous or vexatious objections in paragraph (b) if that would tie it up any better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all trying to get a form of words which will do what we think should be done.  We should be able to settle on a form of words.  Can we agree to the deletion of the words &ldquo;the costs&rdquo; and let the section go, or do the Opposition want the words <Col N="1340" />&ldquo;frivolous and vexatious&rdquo; to be included in paragraph (b), or would they prefer to wait until Report Stage and consider whether we should substitute section 18 of the 1963 Act in its entirety, with whatever alterations would be needed to make it fit into this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Which can be very elaborate, as the Minister knows.  Experts could be flown in from all over the world and that could be deemed to be the expenses of presenting their case at the oral hearing.  This could run into thousands of pounds.  I know the Minister would not agree that money should be able to influence or frighten off somebody with a legitimate reason for appealing.  That is why we are on the same ground.  We must find a formula of words which will ensure that what we fear cannot happen or will not be allowed to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>During my time in dealing with planning we took serious cognisance of appeals by bodies such as tenants' associations, farming organisations, An Taisce and other voluntary bodies.  Some of these are well established bodies but others are not. They are <i>ad hoc</i> groups who got together to deal with a particular planning case because they wished to make a third party appeal.  They have a meeting and they appoint a secretary.  They discuss their problem and it is left to the secretary and chairman, or somebody like that, to draft the appeal.  The committee may never meet again.  They have no finances.  They have no assets or resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody may get in touch with the secretary who is the signatory to the appeal and say: &ldquo;The law is different now from what it used to be. Previously the Minister could be got at. He could be contacted and he was answerable in Dáil Éireann, for appeal matters.  Now a board have absolute discretion as provided in section 17 (1) (a) (ii).&rdquo;  If the appeal has not gone in, this may mean that the person who is acting voluntarily and in good faith on behalf of the group when he is told: &ldquo;You are dealing now with a different situation; you are dealing with a board not answerable to Dáil Éireann or to anyone except the Minister&rdquo;&mdash;and even the Minister admits he has no <Col N="1342" /> say in this matter and that he cannot direct the board in ordinary day to day matters&mdash;may very well say : &ldquo;Hump this.  I will not stick my neck out&rdquo; and that is the end of what may be a very genuine appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the whole thing hinges on whether or not we can trust the board.  We are simply saying that &ldquo;in its absolute discretion the board may&rdquo;.  Part of section 18 of the 1963 Act provides :</P>
      <P>(a)  the Minister, if he so thinks proper and irrespective of the result of an appeal, may direct the planning authority to pay&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  to the appellant, such sum as the Minister, in his absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the appellant for the expense occasioned to him in relation to the appeal,</P>
      <P>(ii)  to the Minister, such sum as, in his absolute discretion, he specifies as compensation to him towards the expense incurred by him in relation to the hearing of the appeal;</P>
      <P>(b)  if, but only if, the appeal fails, the Minister, if he so thinks proper, may direct the appellant to pay&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  to the planning authority such sum as the Minister, in his absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the planning authority for the expense occasioned to them in relation to the appeal,</P>
      <P>(ii)  to the Minister, such sum, as, in his absolute discretion, he specifies as compensation to him towards the expense incurred by him in relation to the hearing of the appeal.</P>
      <P>Under the law as it stands at present, any third party appellant could be asked to pay very substantial sums and this has not prevented third party appeals.  I have not seen any appeals from the tenants' associations but residents' associations and boards such as An Taisce and people like that have made appeals.  This has not prevented them from making appeals.</P>

      <P>Only God can tell that. We cannot decide anything on that argument.  I am not sure whether the section as it now stands will do what is suggested by the Opposition and by Deputy O'Brien.  I am not sure of that, but I am sure that there appears to be an unreasoning fear of a board which we were all terribly anxious to set up.  I hope and think the board will be very reasonable.  To save any further discussion, we appear to have gone away from the agreement I thought we had reached on the last occasion&mdash;we were within seconds of it when time ran out.  I suggest that if the Opposition would let me look at this again on Report Stage I would consider whether this section completely covers what I want to do regarding section 18 of the 1963 Act or whether some alteration in the Act, such as is suggested by Deputy Molloy, might be a better way of dealing with it.  I am anxious to reach agreement.  I want the Bill when it goes through to have the confidence of the House but I do not want to have an emasculated Bill that will not be worth the paper it is printed on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall more than likely agree to that suggestion.  I do not want to delay any longer but I should like to put on record the type of representations that have been made about this section.  The Association of Combined Residents' Associations&mdash;I am sure they have also sent these recommendations to the Minister&mdash;stated that subsection 1 (b) (ii), the one to which I have referred, was unfair to the ordinary citizen because the parties are of unequal financial standing.  That is more or less what we have been saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were representations from the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland about section 17 and they said <Col N="1344" /> there was concern that the board might appear to impose costs on the appellant punitively and they suggested that for this reason the words &ldquo;or other expenses&rdquo; in subsection 1 (b) (ii) should be struck out and that consideration be given to requiring the board to advise in advance parties to an appeal as to whether there is the possibility of costs being awarded against them, and that, in any case, parties against whom costs have been awarded should have the right of appeal to the courts.</P>
    <P>The National Association of Independent Retailers&mdash;I am quoting from a varied group of people&mdash;said regarding section 17 that it dealt with expenses of appeals and gave extraordinarily wide powers to the board, the effect of which would be to frighten off persons who wanted to appeal planning authority decisions. They said the section should be deleted, which would leave matters as they are under the Act and statutory instruments.  That is their view.  The Royal Town Planning Institute submitted representations to the effect that this section gives power to the board whereby the board may direct one party to pay such a sum as the board in its absolute discretion specifies as compensation for the expenses of another party in relation to the appeal and this was not considered by the institute to be an appropriate and effective method of dealing with unwarranted use of the appeal machinery.</P>
    <P>I want to give a contrasting view by a group that are in favour of the section.  This group are very great friends of the Minister, the Construction Industry Federation.  They say that, in the light of experience, the Construction Industry Federation fully supports this provision but requests that all third party objectors be obliged to publish notice of their intention to object in a newspaper circulating in the area in the same manner as a developer has to advertise his intention to apply for planning permission.</P>
    <P>Of the few groups making representations which I have chosen at random the only one in favour is the <Col N="1345" /> organisation one could expect to speak for the developer.  The ordinary reaction is against the section and the only persons to my knowledge seeking it are the developers.  They may have had just cause to require such a section in the Bill because of what they may have regarded as ill-founded appeals against them by third parties in the past.  I do not think the record says that this practice was engaged in to any great extent by third-party objectors and the Minister has not brought forward any great list of practical cases to justify the inclusion of such sweeping power.  We accept what the Minister has said, that he will have a serious look at this and will attempt to meet the wishes expressed here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I also accept the Minister's assurance that he will consider this on the Report Stage.  I have had the same sort of representations from all these groups.  They are groups that have done quite an amount of good work in the past by way of preserving amenities and ensuring good planning and they should get what support we can give them.  That is important.  I am happy that the Minister will reconsider this and come up with something that will be generally acceptable.  Over the past couple of years there has been fairly subtle propaganda by the confederation and other interested parties aimed at eliminating third party appeals.  I can see their reason, but this is a democratic institution and we must protect the rights of the individual.  By having a further look at section 17 we are showing our concern for the rights of the individual and I look forward to its reconsideration on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputies for the line they are taking but it is only right to point out that, while what Deputy Molloy says is correct, quite a number of people made representations to us&mdash;as was their right&mdash; and most of them seemed to have the idea that there was something very wrong with section 17.  The Construction Industry Federation, as they were entitled to do, supported it <Col N="1346" /> because they felt it would at least ensure that they would not suffer long delays.</P>
      <P>I saw, as I am sure Deputy Molloy and Deputy Cunningham saw, people coming into the Custom House, business competitors putting in appeals with no connection with an area for the purpose of holding up one business so that they could get started ahead of it.  I am aware of this happening. In fact, we had no provision made to punish the person who did that.  The strange thing is that those who claim to know everything about this Bill did, as I pointed out on the last occasion, completely misinterpret the whole thing.  I have here a cutting from <i>The Irish Times</i> under the heading &ldquo;Planning Bill `Erosion Of Rights' To Be Looked At: Plea to Law Society by An Taisce Chief&rdquo;&mdash; by Michael Viney, Environment Correspondent.  He proceeds to give the statement made by Mr. John O'Loughlin Kennedy, director of An Taisce&mdash;Deputy Molloy asked who it was and I am giving the name. In the course of his discussion this is what Mr. O'Loughlin Kennedy said:</P>
      <P>This last could include the loss of profits suffered by a developer during the period taken by the Appeal Board to consider the matter.</P>
      <P>He was talking to the Law Society and their reaction was that they would not make any comment, in view of a statement like that which is absolutely ludicrous since this is not included in the Bill and could not by any means be accepted, if one went to the trouble of reading the Bill, as being included in it.  It is easy enough to get up the hackles of a group of people who might be involved or who were involved in third party objections previously when they read a statement made by somebody who should know better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is not, but the Deputy did make the argument that there were a number <Col N="1347" /> of organisations who were complaining that this was what was likely to happen.  I am trying to point out that the reason they were saying this was because somebody who should know better told them publicly, and the Law Society, that this was so.  It is not so and anybody who read the Bill will appreciate that.  The Opposition, having read the Bill, were well aware that it was not so and stated this. Those who have complained about this section, if they read the debate of the last day and tonight will be perfectly satisfied that there was no question of the loss of profits suffered by a developer during the period taken by the appeal board to consider the matter being involved in any way. I am prepared to agree to have another look at the matter in an effort to get something which will be completely acceptable and I am grateful to the Opposition and Deputy O'Brien for the way in which they have dealt with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The last few words of the Minister might convey the impression that what the man from An Taisce was saying was that third-party people could be involved in heavy expense under this section if compensation was levied against them. The Minister has now said that this is not so, but he is dealing only with one aspect of it.  A third party will not be obliged to carry as costs loss of profits; he will only be obliged to carry costs or expenses involved in relation to the appeal itself.  Our point is that, even there, the amount can be quite substantial and run to thousands of pounds if the person whom the appeal is being made against decides to bring in elaborate arguments and costly experts to present his case.</P>
      <P>Without getting involved in the loss of profits field and expenses other than those legitimately arising out of the holding of the appeal itself the point must still be made that third party people can find themselves faced with the possibility of heavy expenses to be met by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to repeat that Mr. O'Loughlin Kennedy in his <Col N="1348" /> position as director of An Taisce addressed the Law Society and urged them to consider this section.  He said that An Taisce was urging the Law Society to consider the section in question and to make representations to the Ministers involved to have it omitted or drastically amended.  He was speaking to a paper on &ldquo;Public Participation in Planning&rdquo; by Mr. Gordon Hyde.  The Incorporated Law Society have informed us that they do not propose to make any such representations.  The reason so many organisations made representations on the particular point was because somebody who is an authority on planning in fact said this, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 16th January, 1975:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If section 17 is adopted in its present form, every appellant will be faced with the possibility of an open-ended award against him, not alone of the legal costs of other parties but of any figure the Appeals Board chooses to state as its own costs plus any other expenses in relation to the appeal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He told the Incorporated Law Society that the inclusion of the right of the board as its absolute discretion to award itself costs was contrary to the best traditions of Irish law and almost certainly would give rise to unnecessary and costly litigation.</P>

      <P>We are not wasting time because I want to have it on the record of the House why certain organisations, in my opinion, made representations which when they understand what the position is will know that their fears were ill-founded. I should like to continue with the quotation from the <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
      <P>This section, he added, as drafted was loaded heavily against the community and its environment.  While the conservationist could only hope to claim his costs, the developer could claim his costs &ldquo;or other expenses occasioned to him in relation to the appeal&rdquo;.</P>

      <Col N="1349" /> In <i>The Irish Times</i> the same gentleman is reported as saying:</P>

Swords Progressive Preservation Society; Husbands' Bridge Association; Grange Woodbine Residents' Association; South Shankill Residents' Association; Hollybrook Grove Householders' Association; Allen Park Residents' Association; Rathgar Residents' Association; Churchtown West Residents' Association; All Hallows Area Residents' Association; Wyckham Park Estate Residents' Association; Frascati and Blackrock Protection Society; Mount Prospect Grove Association; Sandymount Residents' Association; Mount Pleasant Residents' Association; Living City Group; Clontarf Residents' Association; Irish Georgian Society; Soroptomists; Bayside Village Development Society. These are groups of concerned citizens who have approved the comments on section 17 which I have already read.  They agreed that subsection (b) (ii) of section 17 was unfair to the ordinary citizen because the parties were of an equal financial standing.  They had objections to it.</P>

      <P>Yes.  They are the three signatories to the letter.  They represented a group of concerned associations.  I am just giving the names of the persons who signed the letter.  They represented a group&mdash;the Dublin Civic Group, the Dublin Bay Preservation Association, the Upper Leeson Street Area Residents' Association, the Living City Group and the Dublin Association of An Taisce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> Might I say to the Minister also it is not just these groups.  They have not merely been influenced by the view of one organisation.</P>
    <P>I had a letter from a retired sergeant of the Garda Síochána who resides in County Limerick, who procured for himself a copy of the Minister's Bill and his amendments and, having studied them, wrote a letter to one of our Fianna Fáil Deputies asking him to pass it on to me.  In that letter he expressed concern about section 17.  It was the one section on which that individual thought strong objections should be voiced.  Therefore, it is not merely Mr. O'Loughlin Kennedy who has influenced people's minds on this.  That individual I mentioned from County Limerick was not in any way involved with the Dublin organisations I mentioned.  Anyway, we accept the Minister's agreement to review it fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy can be assured that I will do that.  Incidentally, with regard to the list he read out&mdash;if it was the ACRA&mdash;it contained a lot of new members.  So far as the Garda sergeant was concerned, he might be a very intelligent man and he might not.  I have received dozens of letters from people who genuinely felt it was wrong and a lot of letters also from people who thought that the whole Bill was very necessary as it stood.  I am not condemning anybody; people are entitled to make representations. I am sorry to keep coming back to this but I believe that when somebody who leads in planning in the country, who knows an awful lot about it and who makes a mistake&mdash;as evidently was made in this case&mdash;and circularises a lot of organisations saying that a certain thing is so, I will not blame such people for accepting that it is so and now trying to prove that it is not.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister shall make regulations providing for any oral hearing by the Board of a reference or appeal being conducted by a person appointed for that purpose by the Board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment is purely a drafting one.  The provision under section 18 (1) (b) will be covered by a new section in the Bill and this amendment is to tidy up a subsection.  The new section is proposed to be added before section 21.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, amendments Nos. 38 and 47 are being discussed together. Amendment No. 47 makes more specific provision for the matter which, under section 18 (1) (b) would have been dealt with by regulations now altered by amendment No. 38. The purpose of the new section is to provide that not only should reports on the oral hearings be submitted to and considered by the board, or the Minister as appropriate, but to make it clear that such reports may include a recommendation and that such recommendation shall also be considered. The Minister is included because there <Col N="1354" /> may still be occasional oral hearings in connection with closure of public rights of way and, when the Bill and regulations come into operation, there may be appeals where the planning authority refuses to dispense with or relax requirements.  See section 33 (f) of the Bill.  I think it is understood that those are the appeal functions that are not going to the board.  The planning appeals are going to the board but the same Bill covers a number of other functions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (3) to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  In case revised plans, drawings or particulars mentioned in subsection (2) of this section are submitted to the Board by virtue of regulations made under that subsection, the applicant shall furnish copies of such revised plans, drawings or particulars to all of the other parties to the appeal at least seven days before the appeal is considered by the Board.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is involved here is important because people have built cases on drawings they have, only to find at a hearing that they had been changed. Consequently, they were not prepared to comment on the changes.  Therefore, <Col N="1356" /> any substantial change made in drawings before any hearing should be notified to all parties involved at least seven days before the hearing. This should be done as a matter of courtesy, if nothing else, but also to ensure that justice is seen to be done. A delay of seven days would not hold up any appeal to any extent but it would give the appellant time to examine the changes and seek the necessary advice on which line to take.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not acceptable because section 18 (2) provides for regulations which will allow more flexibility in dealing with proposals on appeal.  It is not always possible to devise satisfactory conditions when dealing with appeals particularly in relation to designs but the board will be enabled to invite the applicant to submit the revised plans showing how his proposals can be modified to meet their requirements. The degree of flexibility must necessarily be limited.  The proposals must remain substantially the same or the board would virtually have decided the case.</P>
      <P>Instead of trying to spell out in detail conditions relating to matters such as design, the board may indicate their requirements in general terms and allow the architect to suggest how these can be met.  If the drawing is acceptable the board may incorporate it in their decisions.  Therefore, the amendment is not acceptable.  The implications of the whole question could be reopened and the board would have to take into account the views of all parties but the scope of section 83 does not warrant this.  Such a situation would cause delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am hoping that the board will minimise delays because there is nothing more frustrating than having to wait for decisions.  Looking at the situation from one angle, Deputy O'Brien's proposal might help but viewing it on a board basis it would be almost certain to cause not only short delays but very substantial delays. It is not clear as to what would be the effect of failure to comply with the requirements.  If the failure <Col N="1357" /> occurred inadvertently would a decision by the board be invalidated with resulting considerable cost?  There are a large number of parties involved in many appeals.  Technically, also, the amendment is defective.  How, for instance, would the applicant know when the decision of the board would be given or how would the board know when every party had received a document?</P>
    <P>If Deputy O'Brien looks at the matter again I am sure he will realise that this is not the best way to deal with this matter and that the section as it is is a better instrument in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly this places the appellant at a disadvantage in that when he goes to a hearing with a certain set of ideas on which he has based his case he may find that the design, for instance, has been changed without his knowledge.  When the board are requesting alterations before oral hearings, surely they should request from the interested parties what they might regard as changes.  In that way the parties concerned would be conversant with the changes.  I am talking in terms of a seven days' delay but in the case of drawings being changed there would be a greater time lag.</P>
      <P>Regarding the technical aspect of the matter, I cannot see any problem. If the board request changes, these changes cannot be put forward on the spot because after the changes are made they are submitted to the board and if the board are of the opinion that there is some substance in them they should submit them to the interested parties and allow for seven days at least elapsing before the oral hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Brien's amendment because, as I see it, if the parties concerned are aware of the changes suggested, the oral hearing can be shortened by reason of the people being prepared for what would arise.  This might also change the opinion of the parties concerned as well as the opinion of the board.  It is only fair that all parties <Col N="1358" /> concerned should know what is to take place at an oral hearing.  I agree with the Minister regarding cutting down on delays but I cannot see that a delay of seven days would make much difference one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputies are mistaken here.  They are talking of a situation in which if, at the oral hearing there is a change, somebody should know in advance.  This is not what is suggested.  What is suggested is that the oral hearing having taken place and the board having made up their minds, the officer may say: &ldquo;There is a slight change which will make this building a better one.  Could the architect submit the necessary drawings to show whether this could be done?&rdquo; At present appeals may be refused whereas if they had been put in a different way they might have been accepted.  The suggestion is that the slight alteration which might make an appeal acceptable should be included but to suggest that everybody should be given copies of plans so that they could come back for another oral hearing is not acceptable.  I do not think that either of the Deputies who spoke would be prepared to accept that because that would mean we would have the whole rigmarole all over again.  The point that is being lost is that this would occur at the end of the oral hearing, and not during the oral hearing.  I ask, therefore, that the amendment be withdrawn on that basis.</P>

      <P>In the Minister's explanation he says that where the word &ldquo;modify&rdquo; appears in subsection (2) of section 18, it refers to slight changes in the design of the application which might be required by the board in deciding the appeal after the oral hearing has taken place.  Reading the section, as worded, one could not come to the conclusion that this would only apply where minor modifications were involved.  The wording refers to any modification of the design.  That could be a substantial or a slight change. Will this refer to only minor changes and not changes which will affect the overall development of the proposals? Under this section the board could decide to change the whole facade of a building.  Can the Minister satisfy me on this point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this section is open to the interpretation which Deputy Molloy puts on it.  It reads:</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may make regulations enabling the Board when considering an appeal under section 26 or 27 of the Principal Act to invite an applicant and to enable an applicant so invited to submit to the Board revised plans or other drawings modifying, or other particular providing for the modification of, the development to which the appeal relates.</P>
      <P>We felt that the use of the word &ldquo;modify&rdquo; and &ldquo;modification&rdquo; did not mean a major change.  Possibly some qualifying word might be inserted to ensure that the modification will be of a minor nature.  I take the Deputy's point.</P>

      <P>Unlike Deputy Molloy, I like the word &ldquo;modification&rdquo;. Section 18 will be a very important section and will do a great deal to facilitate the whole planning process.  Instead of the board having turned down an application and, perhaps, inviting an applicant to go through the whole process of submitting a new application, they can invite him to submit a modified plan. The importance of the word &ldquo;modification&rdquo; is that it must be basically the same application, but modified in some way.  I like the word &ldquo;modification&rdquo; in this context.</P>

      <P>The reason I did not allow Deputy O'Brien's amendment to go forward before I raised this point was that unless we are satisfied on the issue I have just raised, his amendment is very important.  If the changes to be considered are substantial, then the other parties to the appeal are entitled to receive notification of those changes before the board make a decision. Therefore, his amendment is very important if major changes are involved.</P>

      <P>I had experience of the Hume Street planning appeal. There was a great deal of agitation in Dublin arising out of the proposal of the Green Development Company. That happened about the time I was appointed Minister.  The issue was settled by changing the facade of the development.  One could argue if that was a modification.  Some persons were quite concerned about the outward appearance of the completed building.  This was an issue of great public importance at that time.  On the Minister's definition of the word &ldquo;modification&rdquo;, that change might be deemed merely a modification although it was a major change.  So I am still not satisfied.</P>

      <P>Could I give an example of something we might expect? Suppose someone had an oral hearing for a single house in a rural area. After consideration of the oral evidence, the board might decide that if the house were moved ten feet to the left they would be happy.  Is that considered a modification or is it considered a major change?  I think what the Minister is trying is to allow the board make the suggestion of shifting the house five or six feet without putting the applicant to the bother of going back to the county council for a new application.  I really think that is what the Minister is trying to get at and it is very praiseworthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  At present, by conditions, the house could be moved. What I am talking about is a change in the design.  Here is where we need the wording.  Section 18 (2) reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may make regulations enabling the Board to invite an applicant and to enable an applicant so invited to submit to the Board revised plans or other drawings modifying,</P>
      <P>Leave it with me and let me have another look at it.  Personally I think it is all right but when I have had a discussion with my advisers it may turn out that we can put something in which will meet Deputy Molloy's view.  I do not want to make it awkward. I agree with Deputy O'Brien it is rather a pity that the local authorities when they are considering appeals do not do something like this.  Possibly we may get around to it because it would save a lot of trouble if they could refer back and have another proposal put in rather than having somebody go all around the house again before they can consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has hit it on the nail.  This is the legislative Assembly.  Since that view has been expressed by all sides, surely we should ensure that that happens at local authority level?  Though this Bill deals only with appeals, I would suggest that the Minister should consider putting in another amendment which will oblige <Col N="1363" /> local authorities to give this facility to applicants instead of requiring them to go back with the notice on the paper and go through the whole rigmarole again.  They write out to applicants and ask them for further information. That meets the difficulty in some cases, but in others they say it is a substantial change.  In many cases it is not a substantial change at all, but this is a delaying tactic or a frustration machine that councils seem to apply in the planning sections.  It is the view of this House that we would expect local planning officers to be very flexible in dealing with planning applications and, in the interests of saving time, allow applicants consultation and the opportunity to adjust their designs and plans after they have been lodged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to give some kind of order to the local authorities along those lines. When I first went on Galway County Council I looked for the files when a particular planning application was turned down and was told that I was not entitled to look at them.  The planning officers never notified a person when they were going out or asked them to meet them on the site.  One's only hope was to try to get an oral hearing from the Minister, which we got on various occasions.  This is the type of thing that has put everybody up against planners.  They would not meet the people at all.  Now we have a change, in my county anyway.  We have made arrangements that they must notify the applicant when they are coming.  The local authorities should be told that there should be consultation and people should not have to make new applications.  We are fed up with officials taking it upon themselves to turn down applications and the procedure has to be gone through all over again.  I should like to support very strongly what Deputy Molloy has said.</P>

He did not draw it up, he did not interpret it down there.  The only difference is that I found I was not satisfied with the way it was being interpreted.  I agree that, if we can, we should endeavour to have the process of considering planning applications at local level simplified so that if somebody applies for permission to do something and if there is a slight alteration the local authority should endeavour to have that slight alteration made before it is decided or definitely before it is refused.  We will be doing everyone a good turn if we can have that included. I will consider it for Report Stage and I hope it will be possible to do it.</P>

      <P>The Minister is very good at creating impressions and it is the man who creates the impression that he is doing something who gets the credit even though he may not be doing anything at all.  I would suggest that the Minister read some of the circulars, particularly the main circular, which I sent to planning authorities when I was in the Department. He will see whether I was in favour of flexibility in planning or not. He will see that I gave advice very similar to the advice he gave afterwards to deal in a more flexible manner with applications.  I spelled out that I was of the opinion that quite a number of planning authorities were turning down applications which could and should have been decided locally and sending them on to the Minister.  I differed with the Minister on the question of national primary roads.  At present, unfortunately, if <Col N="1365" /> one wants to get a planning appeal through the most effective way of doing it is to approach a member of the Fine Gael or Labour Parties.  We have a Senator in our own area canvassing support on this basis.  It is regrettable.  Cases that are being passed have had political representations made and very similar cases that have been refused have had no political representations made.  I would ask the Minister to have a closer look at what is going on and at what Deputy Begley is doing in the planning section and the political influence that is operating within the planning section of the Department of Local Government at present.  It is undeniably going on.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) A draft of any regulation which it is proposed to make under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The inclusion of section 18 in the Bill is desirable and beneficial.  It will greatly facilitate the whole process of planning and it will make life much easier for those who have occasion to seek planning permission for developments of one kind or another. It will simplify the procedure considerably. I am concerned that section 18 should work efficiently because of the importance I attach to it.  It is in that context that I put down my amendment.</P>
      <P>As the House will note, section 18 deals with the question of the Minister making regulations.  He will make regulations that will lay down the procedure to be followed at oral hearings, with regard to the furnishing of reports and so on.  By this section he will be empowered to make regulations covering this important new proposal in regard to the applicant; that, instead of having his appeal rejected and being forced to go through the whole machinery from the start again, he will be able to submit a modified proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the importance of this, it is necessary that the regulations be fully scrutinised by this House.  They will be important regulations, particularly in that they will lay down the machinery for oral hearings and so on.  My amendment proposes that the regulations will come before the House in draft and that the House will have an opportunity of considering them. They will become effective only when there is a resolution of the House approving of the draft.  In other words, I want the House to have an opportunity of examining at some stage the <Col N="1367" /> detailed machinery that will be provided for in the operation of section 18. My main reason for that is that this section is an important one and it will be of great significance in smoothing the operation of the planning machinery throughout the country. Therefore I should like the regulations to have the benefit of the experience of Members of this House before they become effective.  There is probably a larger collection of people in this House who know the workings of the planning machinery intimately than anywhere else and it is important that the practical experience of Members in the operation of the planning laws be brought to bear on the regulations. It is to enable that to be done that I put down this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I have to oppose this amendment.  It is inconsistent with the general provision governing regulations.  Deputy Haughey has not mentioned section 10 of the 1963 Act, which is to be construed with this legislation.  It provides that all regulations be laid before both Houses and for amendment by either House within the next 21 sitting days.  So far as I am aware there has not been a single complaint or any criticism of the appeals and reference regulations made under the 1963 Act.  The new regulations will be in similar terms, except for subsection (2) which includes a new provision. This is on very specific terms.  It is difficult to see how regulations to give effect to legislation would require approval of the Oireachtas.  If the House thinks it could be done, the simplest thing is to put subsections (2) and (3) in the Bill as separate sections.  There is nothing extraordinary about it.  The provisions which have been placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas are in the parent legislation.  The new section I am putting in cannot be twisted in any way.  It is quite plain and specific. Perhaps Deputy Haughey would consider it for a moment.</P>

There is only one addition and that is in specific terms.  There is no way in which there could be any opposition to what is proposed to be put into it. If the House prefers, I have no objection to putting subsections (2) and (3) as separate sections.  Deputies opposite know that I do not like legislation by regulation.  It has been the practice. It has been suggested in this case and therefore I included it.  It is in the Bill now and I should prefer it to be left like that, but if there is an objection I do not mind putting them down as new sections in the Bill.</P>

The Minister quite rightly has said that section 10 of the Principal Act governs the making of regulations, that they must be laid before the House and that if there is not a resolution annulling them within 21 days they become law.

My amendment is that a draft be laid before the House and the Minister must come in and move for the approval of that draft before it becomes effective.  There is that difference between what I am proposing and section 10 of the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that if anybody is alerted to the situation he can have a debate here on the regulations by moving for their annullment. It is quite possible that the regulation could be made, laid before the House and become law before anybody is alerted to it.</P>

The public attach great importance to oral hearings, which are an important democratic function in regard to planning matters.  It is important that the regulations the Minister will make in regard to oral hearings be as perfect as possible.  I thought that, if there was an onus on the House, to positively look at these regulations and approve of them before they become law, it would be advantageous.

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 30 and 31, to add to the section the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) For the purpose of enabling the Board to perform its functions on and from the appropriate day, the Board may, as an interim measure, make arrangements for the supply to the Board by the Minister of any services required by the Board pending the making by the Board of sufficient appointments pursuant to section 10 of this Act and the Minister may supply and the Board may avail of services for which arrangements are made under this subsection.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey put down amendment No. 1 to section 2 seeking to have the board established not later than the 31st December, 1974.  There is general agreement that the transfer of appeal functions should be carried out as soon as possible.  There will be some unavoidable delay due to the necessity to revise and amend the various sets of regulations made under the 1963 Act.  This delay would be greatly lengthened if the board had to recruit their full complement of staff before they could commence operations.  The difficulty would be overcome by the type of regulation <Col N="1372" /> proposed in the amendment which could cover staff and accounting services. It would also facilitate a smooth changeover and involve minimal disruption of the work of dealing with appeals.  There is also a consequential amendment to Article 24 of the Schedule, that is amendment No. 117.</P>

      <P>There is one point about this which could cause some apprehension: this amendment could, in effect, allow the Minister to retain a large area of influence in the work undertaken and carried out and also the decisions made by the board.  I say that because the amendment would allow the board to employ officers and servants of the Minister to perform the administrative duties of the board and to assist them in carrying out their functions.  If the planning staff in the Department of Local Government are to be transferred to the board and they are to remain as civil servants to the Minister, then his influence over his servants could be seen to directly affect decisions of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> I would not object to this facility being accorded under the Bill for a period of time, but as it is stated here it could remain for all time so that at all times the board could be serviced by the Minister's personal staff.  I do not mean personal in the sense of personal secretaries.  I mean the staff directly responsible to the Minister. That would be a most unsatisfactory situation.  We realise the difficulty of ensuring an efficient and smooth start to the work of the board and that there must be a transitional period.  I hope this amendment is put down to facilitate the transition from the Minister to the board.  There is no termination of the power granted under this amendment.  Would the Minister not consider seeking the power in this amendment for a stated period of time only, not for an indefinite period?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am touched by Deputy Molloy's comments.  He seems to think that every evening the officials of the Department on the board will come to me to tell me their little tales, tell me what happened, what they are doing and look for instructions for the next day.  I am quite sure he realises something like that does not happen in the civil service.  The amendment says:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of enabling the Board to perform its functions on and from the appropriate day, the Board may, as an interim measure...</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Haughey will probably be on my side this time.  An interim measure does not mean for ever and a day, as Deputy Molloy says.</P>

      <P>If I had my way the board would recruit their own staff very quickly, and I hope this will be so.  As the Deputy knows, we can use the civil servants who are tied up with this, but the initiative must come from the board themselves.  The board must be set up.  The reason this suggestion is there is that I do not want a vaccum: to-day the Minister is dealing with appeals and tomorrow nobody is dealing with appeals until such time <Col N="1375" /> as the board recruit staff.  I think the Deputy can take it in the spirit that this is an interim measure.  I do not want it to continue, and I would prefer if we did not fiddle around any more with this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regrettable as it may be the postal service is not 100 per cent reliable and I am suggesting here that the time scale of three days should be extended to five.  Subsection (1) of section 20 states:</P>
      <P>Where a provision of this Act authorising an appeal (other than an appeal to a court) enables the appeal only to be made within a specified period, the appeal, if sent by post, shall be received not later than the third day after that period and any appeal so sent which is not so received shall be invalid as not being made in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quoted cases of persons living on islands and in remote areas.  The island case cannot be refuted by the Minister where the postal service is dependent on the arrival of steamships. Take the case of the Aran Islands where the Naomh Éanna will not travel the 30 miles across Galway Bay if the weather forecast and the weather conditions are not favourable. The postal service in such conditions is very haphazard and cannot <Col N="1377" /> be relied upon.  I have had cases of persons making application for certain things: in one case a man applied for a salmon licence; there was a statutory time limit and because of the week-end and the non-sailing of a boat on a certain day that man was denied his salmon licence for a whole fishing season.  I am against these very rigid time limits laid down in statutes.  I would appeal to the Minister for greater flexibility, and the only contribution I can make in the course of this debate towards that desirable aim is to suggest extending that period to the fifth day rather than the third day.  In that way we would at least be making some attempt to provide for those who are hard done by because of the uncertainty of the postal service.  I do not think the Minister will dig in his heels, because of the islanders and those in remote areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why people who want to make an appeal should wait until the last three, four or five days before the time runs out.  If they get a decision from the local authority and the decision is something they do not agree with and they want to appeal, there is no reason in the world why, if they live in the Aran Islands or in Dublin city, they should not, as soon as they get the notification, make an appeal.  All they have to do is send a post card or a note, any communication, to the Custom House to say: &ldquo;We wish to appeal.  We shall send on the grounds later.&rdquo;  If you provide for five days, that is an extra week added on to the time already allowed.  I do not find anything wrong at present with the postal service.  The Post Office people are doing their job very well. The suggestion is that the Post Office are getting letters, holding on to them <Col N="1378" /> for a long time and not delivering them.  In fact, a letter that is posted in Galway this evening will be in Dublin tomorrow.  There may be exceptions.</P>

      <P>I had a question down to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs some months ago in which I gave him the date on which the letter was posted and the date it was delivered.

      <P>In the glorious and immortal time of the last Fianna Fáil Government there was a question in this House by Deputy Oliver Flanagan about a goose that one of his constituents had posted to Newry and he said it could have walked there quicker than it was delivered.  These things have happened and will happen again.  You can pick out a particular case of a letter not arriving, but what I am saying is that, if somebody gets a notification and he wants to make a third party appeal, he gets 24 days to send in that appeal and if it is a first party appeal he gets 33 days.  I do not know what more people could want.  Why should there be special consideration given?</P>

      <P>May I make a point in support of Deputy Molloy?  It is not a question of 24 days or 33 days, or any number of days like that.  The Minister by putting this section into the Bill is admitting the principle that in so far as the time allowed for an appeal is concerned the posting of the letter on the last day of the specified period will legitimate the appeal.  The Minister is accepting that principle.  If an appeal is posted on the last day&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister has admitted that one can add the postal time on to the statutory number of days&mdash;that is, the time taken for the letter to be delivered.  The <Col N="1379" /> Minister is accepting that principle in this section.  Deputy Molloy argues that, once the Minister accepts that principle, he should add the time taken for the delivery of the letter on to the statutory number of days allowed for the appeal and make it five days instead of three days.  Under the present régime it may take at least five days before a letter is delivered and once the principle of posting on the last permissible day is accepted then it should be five days instead of three days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>It is not asking a great deal to make it five days.  That could be a worthwhile facility.  The debate is being conducted in a very pleasant <Col N="1381" /> spirit and we expect the Minister to accept this slight amendment without all this long argument about it.  Consider the position where the Aran Islands are concerned.  Sometimes, because of bad weather, there is no sailing.  This amendment would cover that position.  We are not now asking for special treatment in exceptional cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping the Minister would accept this.  I am not asking for an exception to be made in the case of islands.  I am merely asking for an extra two days to facilitate those dependent on island postal services. I have known of applications which were not delivered until the day after the closing date and people told me that great inconvenience could be caused because they would be unable to appeal against the decision and, if they were late, they would have to go through the whole process of putting in an advertisement in the papers, a new application and then waiting two months for a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They had 30 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seemed rather silly that the regulations were being applied in such a rigid fashion in order to facilitate administration.  I agree that there has to be some limitation, but it should be flexible. Allowing the five days would meet the type of cases which have arisen from time to time.  I cannot see what great problem this will cause for the Minister, but I see the facility it would afford to persons who in the past have found themselves in this position.  It is very frustrating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be hard to identify the reasons why people leave their appeals until the last moment.  Human nature being what it is, the Minister will find that people do not appeal on the day they get their decision.  They like to consider it very fully.  They like to discuss it with their family, or with their friends, or with their business associates.  They like to consider what the prospects are if an appeal is made, <Col N="1382" /> and whether they would be able to make a case which would justify their going to the bother and the expense of making the appeal.</P>
    <P>All of this involves a certain delay. This pushes people towards the end of the specified period before they finally make a decision and post off the application.  Therefore, the Minister can forget about the first two-thirds of the statutory period which he is granting, the month or the three weeks, whichever the case may be. Usually these decisions to lodge an appeal are made in the last third of the statutory period because of the preparatory work which must go into them and because of the time which would normally and naturally elapse before people made their decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister can say to me that all they have to do is to write a simple letter to the Department within the month or the three week period stating their intention to appeal and that they will forward the grounds for that appeal later on.  The Minister may make that point, but I do not think that in itself it would invalidate my argument.  The person making the appeal is not obliged within the statutory period to present his full case, to go into great detail and to produce maps and designs to justify his appeal. A simple letter stating that he intends to do it is sufficient to justify the holding of the appeal and he can come forward afterwards with the details. Before a person decides to make an appeal he will go into this detail, especially if a lot of expense will be involved for him in presenting the appeal.  Of necessity time must be consumed before people arrive at the stage where the decision is made.</P>
    <P>In effect, the practical application of this means that the time within which people make these decisions is roughly about a week.  Therefore, they have about a week to post off their decisions. The Minister is saying that, if their application does not arrive within three days of the last statutory day, it will not be accepted.  I am suggesting that it should be let go to the fifth day to allow for postal delivery, to allow for mishaps, and to allow for the fact that these statutory time limits are necessary <Col N="1383" /> evils.  They are an incumbrance.  We would all love to do without rules and regulations.  They are accepted only for the sake of orderly living.  We would much rather if we did not have to have them, but we accept that we must lay down some procedures.  It is only on balance that society allows itself to be governed by so many rules.  I would be inclined to bend this one a little bit and I would ask the Minister to accept my suggestion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy has been quoting hard cases.  There is an old saying that hard cases make bad law. Deputy Molloy and Deputy Haughey are forgetting that if five days are added to the period suggested, if you add a weekend you have a month and the notification of the granting of permission may be sent out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Because 21 and five make 26 and if you add a weekend that makes it a full month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Exceptions can occur and weekends occur at each end of the week as Deputy Haughey may have noticed.  People may want to appeal but the confirmation of the notice may have been sent out by the local authorities before the third party had the opportunity of making their appeal, and further complications will arise.  Deputy Molloy is saying, in effect, that we should alter the whole schedule of dates and that we should add on two days at least at the end of the period.  If he stops to think he will realise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying no such thing.  I am talking about five days for receiving it after it is posted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there is a lot of merit in what is being suggested. There has been a High Court ruling and the law is that the date of posting must be accepted even if it is the last day.  If a third party is so interested in making an appeal that he is prepared to make an appeal to the Minister for Local Government, no matter who he is, it is unreasonable to suggest that he would require the full three weeks to do what he intended to at first.  He objected to it at local authority level and he now wants to appeal to the Minister or to the planning board but he will then wait until the last day. Deputy Molloy says that in order to ensure that it is in time we should allow two days apart from what is suggested here.  I am not arguing this for the purpose of being awkward. We have had quite a reasonable discussion and we want to approach this in a reasonable way.</P>

      <P>There is one big flaw in what the Minister is saying. By putting in this section the Minister is admitting, in principle, that the man has a right to the full 21 days to consider the matter and 21 days is the statutory number of days in which he can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>The Minister's amendment means that a man can wait until the 21st day before coming <Col N="1386" /> to a final decision to appeal.  The only difference between the Minister and Deputy Molloy is that the Minister says he can wait until the 21st day but then he must do something within three days and Deputy Molloy says three days are not enough and that if the Minister is allowing him to wait until the 21st day, as he is, he must allow five days postage.</P>

      <P>Why not leave it open-ended and let him decide on any time he likes?  If he is interested there is no reason why he should not get his application in in time by telegram, by postcard or by letter.  If he does not want to do that, I think he is not entitled to get the facilities available.</P>
