      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment we are discussing is one which some people think does not go nearly far enough.  Ignoring the economic aspects of this, I wish to put briefly to the Minister the proposition that in the absence of this amendment an indefensible position would arise, a position in which the valuation date, that is, the date on which wealth tax becomes due this year, would be April 5th.  Furthermore, that three months thereafter, under the Bill, the wealth tax due this year would become payable legally.</P>
      <P>It is clear to everybody that by that date the Bill will not have passed both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The only gesture which the Minister for Finance has made in regard to this situation is that he has tabled an amendment, one which has not been reached yet, and the effect of which will be to provide that no interest would be payable on any wealth tax that was paid this year before some date in October.  This is not a satisfactory position.  It may be argued that it is meeting practical difficulties but it is not a defensible position that this House should enact legislation under which tax&mdash;whatever kind it may be&mdash;is due and payable and that the date for payment of it has passed at a time when the legislation has not been passed and when there is no certainty as to what the law is.</P>
      <P>At least the amendment I have tabled is designed to try to overcome that position, a position which we should not allow to arise under any legislation.  It is a situation that tends to bring the law into disrepute.  I would have thought that the case for this amendment is self-evident, that it would not have been necessary to argue it but from what was said earlier it appears that it is necessary to argue it.  I should hope that the Minister for Lands would agree that if this amendment or some other similar amendment is not enacted, the position would be indefensible.</P>

      <P>During the debate last week I described Deputy Colley's amendment as being &ldquo;a soft amendment&rdquo;. I did not consider it strong enough to meet our present situation. However, I would go further now and say that in our present economic situation in which I understand we are to have a minus growth rate, the introduction of a wealth tax is bordering on the irresponsible.  Approaching the autumn of this year we will have a situation in which a large number of industries will be unable to pay their expenses.  Many of them may not be able to meet the provisions of the national pay agreement.  As I understand it, through their assets these companies may become liable to tax. Deputy Colley's amendment is a mild one.  It is trying to help industries to maintain employment for the remainder of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It has been said that the object of this amendment is to change the valuation date so far as this year is concerned from 5th April to 5th October.  Every consideration has been given to the amendment but it is not acceptable and I propose to give the reasons.</P>
      <P>First, there is no question of anyone having been taken by surprise.  The White Paper on capital taxation was published in February, 1974 and the Bill we are now discussing was introduced and published in February 1975.  It would be an understatement to say it has not been carefully studied and debated by all concerned.</P>
      <P>Later in the debate I propose to introduce amendment No. 28.  I wonder if Deputy Colley was aware of this amendment before he tabled his amendment?  Under the amendment there would be no question whatever of any interest being charged on returns or on tax which has been paid before 5th October, 1975.  That is giving taxpayers a period of seven months since the publication of the Bill to arrange for the making of returns and the payment of tax.  In fact, I am sure many taxpayers have arranged or are arranging their affairs so that they will be able to make the returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2080" /> Deputy Ruairí Brugha mentioned the ability of people to pay this year and the effect it would have on business generally.  At this early stage of my entering this discussion I should like to put the record clear in this matter.  Trading companies as such are not liable to wealth tax.  It is incorrect for the Deputy to suggest that they will be liable to wealth tax through their assets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> They will be liable through their shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is a very different matter.  Deputy Ruairí Brugha was making the point that the money available to the companies for cash flow would be eaten up, or used to some extent, in payment of this tax and that the companies would be worse off.  That is not so and I want the House clearly to understand it.  The assets of trading companies are not liable to tax.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said that the shares will be liable to wealth tax and that is so. The shares of trading companies are liable to wealth tax in the hands of holders who are liable to tax.  They will have the benefit of a threshold which is the most generous in Europe and they will be able to avail of the concessions that exist.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I would ask Deputy Colley to withdraw his amendment and to accept that amendment No. 28 which will be moved by me covers the difficulties he foresaw when he tabled his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I should like to support Deputy Colley's amendment for the reasons he put forward as well as for other reasons.  I agree with Deputy Colley that this is a type of retrospective tax.  When the Government were on the Opposition benches they always argued against such a tax.  Deputy Colley said this Wealth Tax Bill may not become law until the end of the year.  We may be discussing it for the next six months and, in any event, it will not become law until it is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill is framed, tax is due as <Col N="2081" /> from 5th April, 1975.  The Minister for Lands stated that some companies have put their houses in order and taken this into consideration but I do not know any businessman in the city who has made provision for this tax. Whether we like it or not, this tax represents a costing of 1 per cent; there is no difference between it and the 25 per cent increase under the national wage agreement and other factors.  The majority of businessmen have not made any provision for this although the Minister has said to the contrary.  A very considerable number of taxation measures have gone through this House&mdash;the Capital Gains Tax Bill and the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill as well as this measure. Business people have not time to study all the measures before the House.</P>
    <P>Every day we read in the newspapers of the economic difficulties companies are facing.  Daily we are lectured by the leading economists about what we should do with regard to industry and how to keep people in employment.  We have been told what the workers should do and there have been rumours about the national wage agreement.  This morning we were lectured by the social and economic council about what the Government should do with regard to reducing prices.  If the Government are sincere in playing their part, I am convinced employees and employers will do likewise. However, it is up to the Government to give a lead with regard to reducing costs.</P>
    <P>Above all other Bills, this Bill provides for a direct increase in unit costs. The Minister said that companies will not be liable to tax but companies are composed of shareholders and they will be taxed.  Many of the shareholders may take a very poor view because they will want a return.  This is the reality of the situation and it will affect the economy.  We can develop this argument as we go through the Bill.  I do not want to cloud the issue at this time and I will confine myself to what Deputy Colley stated.  The Minister should consider seriously Deputy Colley's amendment and give companies a chance to put their houses <Col N="2082" /> in order.  I realise that it would mean that tax would not be paid for an additional few months but it is only a deferred operation.  The weath tax must be paid from 5th April but, as a gesture on this occasion, the Minister should give the concession sought by Deputy Colley.  As I mentioned before, Deputy Colley has been very modest in seeking this extension.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Opposition should press this amendment because, the more they press the amendment, the more they expose the flaws in their spurious opposition to this Bill.  I use the word &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; because they have used arguments which can be based only on the conclusion that the Fianna Fáil Party have sold their souls, so to speak, to a very tiny minority who will be liable for wealth tax.  It boggles the imagination that they still presume to call themselves a republican party.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Brugha perfectly well knows, only discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies will be liable and I <Col N="2083" /> would hazard a guess that 0.015 of the labour force of the country has any remote connection with a discretionary trust or with a private non-trading company.  To suggest, as both Deputy Colley and Deputy Brugha suggested, that employment or economic growth will be affected by this amendment is, on the basis of any rational analysis, so laughable that it brings me back almost to the kind of example given by Deputy Colley on the recent &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; which has made him the laughing stock of every tax expert in the country: if someone had £100,000 and he had £50,000 of an overdraft he would be caught for wealth tax&mdash;that kind of thing lapped up by the particular commentator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to take the hypothesis to show whether or not the man has to pay wealth tax.  This State has done something unique; it has given a 50 per cent reduction so that man's liability is £250,000.  This is a unique threshold exemption in the whole of Europe.  In fact, the exemption is so generous I have had inquiries from people in Britain asking me if this is true.  They are asking me, as a socialist, if this is true because they wish to come here and buy 800 or 900 acres of good land and settle here; they know Denis Healey would never give them that exemption in Britain.</P>

I would urge both Deputy Colley and Deputy Brugha and other Fianna Fáil Deputies to be very careful who they listen to in relation to wealth tax.  We know who is talking to them, and God knows, they are in strange company when one considers the representations they are making.</P>
      <P>Let us take the man with £500,000 worth of land, liable for £250,000; his private residence would at a conservative estimate be worth, I suppose, about £25,000; that is exempted&mdash;no liability.  Let us give him £30,000 worth of racehorses.</P>

Let us assume he has taken particular care of his pension rights and has capitalised something in the region of £40,000 and let us be quite frank about his deep freeze full of nice lamb and a few salmon, and so on, and a good bit of household effects worth about £5,000.

For good measure, we will give him two children with £2,500 each.  His liability out of that £670,000 will be £240,000 &mdash;1 per cent on that.

On the half year it is £1,200.  The net effect of this amendment <Col N="2086" /> is that Deputy Colley proposes to say to him £1,200 and, furthermore, Deputy Colley knows we are not even in the magnificent generosity of the Marxist socialist extremism of wealth tax; we are not charging interest on the amount due.  These are the people Fianna Fáil are defending.  I met many people around the country with a fair amount of money who said: &ldquo;We are not liable for this tax.&rdquo;  The propaganda is out, that what you have you hold.  If a person has a couple of million you make representations to Deputy Colley because you know you have a soft touch to put up some ultra-special pleading in relation to this Bill in this House.  Deputy Colley should not make a party political plea.  I have met rank and file Fianna Fáil members around the country who say: &ldquo;What is happening to our party?  They are screaming their heads off in Dáil Éireann about the wealth tax.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The company the Deputy is keeping in relation to amendment 2b is the strangest I have ever found for a person who professes to be a member of a republican party.  It is a very peculiar twist to constructive opposition here.  If the Deputy is worried about expeditious proceedings through the House in relation to this Bill the answer is that we could have sent it to a select committee. As we know Deputy Colley and Deputy de Valera spent 70 hours in the House on the Capital Gains <Col N="2087" /> Tax Bill with the Minister for Finance.  Three Deputies spent 70 hours on that Bill.  The Deputy got as much change out of it as he thought he might.</P>

      <P>I suggest that for a party who have sold their souls on the wealth tax they should seriously think it is a bit early in the morning to continue the process.  I know I have raised the temperature somewhat but I found the hypocrisy of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to the Wealth Tax Bill very nauseating in a situation where we are introducing wealth tax in this country.  The threshholds are so unique in Europe that the belted earls of Britain are seriously thinking of coming over here to settle down and save themselves the impact of the British levy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley brought in employment into the debate. He said that this was undesirable in the current economic climate.  This is the great threat they have been using in the Dáil and on television during the past few months.  The productive assets reliefs in this Bill are unique.  I challenge Fianna Fáil to analyse any part of the wealth tax legislation and they will find that the situation is one they cannot defend. Just because they have got a few wealthy constituents breathing down their necks the pleading is so special that it boggles my imagination that they still call themselves a republican party.</P>

      <P>I would like to deal with the point the Minister made that the tax is not paid by companies but by shareholders.  I did not intend to convey the impression that it was otherwise.  I will leave the politics to Deputy Desmond, who does not really understand what the <Col N="2088" /> Opposition are talking about in relation to the importance of employment. I would like the Minister to consider the point I made.  I am not interested in the category who are over the threshold.</P>
      <P>If you have a large number of shareholders throughout the country holding shares in various industries who find that not only are they not getting a reasonable return from their shares, as compared with what one would get in any gilt-edged security on the market at the present time, but if they fall within the category of those who have a fairly large shareholding they will now find themselves carrying shares which are not paying dividends and will now be subject to tax, it is the effect of that which I think should be considered by the Minister in relation to this wealth tax.  If a significant number of people are holding shares in private industry who find themselves in that situation they will ask what is the use of their carrying this thing and they will try to persuade the directors to wind up so that they can get their money back.  That is the employment factor I was trying to make to the Minister despite what Deputy Desmond may say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at Deputy Desmond's special pleading.  He made a case about an individual who has great assets.  I do not agree with practically a word the Deputy said.  He cited an individual worth £600,000 odd.  The point about opposition to certain aspects of this wealth tax is that, irrespective of whether or not the assets are wealth producing, certain people will be stuck for paying tax on it.  That will bring great changes here.  The Deputy also referred to 5 per cent, 2 per cent and .01 per cent.  I always understood that justice should be done to everybody and that it should not necessarily be a case of saying: &ldquo;Of course, we do it to 95 per cent of the people and 5 per cent are too small to count.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>Not necessarily. The logical extension of that is <Col N="2089" /> something we saw very much of in fascist doctrine and thought, that there were people who were not worthy to be considered as citizens.  I know Deputy Desmond does not mean anything like that.</P>
      <P>I was also interested at the Deputy's reference to broadcasting.  In answer to the charge that the projected tax had been reduced to 1 per cent since the introduction of the White Paper I heard him saying: &ldquo;Of course, the principle will be established and the amount could change&rdquo;.  I commend that to the attention of the House.</P>

      <P>To get the irrelevancies out of the way I should like to point out that the level of Deputy Desmond's contribution was highlighted by his totally inaccurate, careless and wrong reference to an example I gave on the radio.  That, I believe, was the key note of his whole approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That shows how inaccurate Deputy Desmond has been. The Deputy's reference to the Bill was equally inaccurate.  Deputy Desmond thinks that shareholders are some kind of incorporeal beings or that when money comes from shareholders they do not count.  The Deputy spoke of the number of shareholders who would be involved in discretionary trusts or private non-trading companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. The Deputy does not know what he is talking about.  Every trading company <Col N="2090" /> employing workers is ultimately dependent on capital advanced by shareholders, it may be directly or indirectly through other companies.  Ultimately, it comes back to individuals and the money they are prepared to save and to put into investment.  If Deputy Desmond does not understand that the jobs of thousands of industrial workers are dependent on people putting money into Irish industries he should not be wasting the time of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is aware of it how can he come in with that kind of nonsense and suggest that no worker is endangered by what is being done here?  If there is any basis of truth in what the Deputy is saying then it must follow that no shareholder in any trading company is going to be liable to wealth tax on his shares. Surely the Deputy is not going to contend that that is true.  If it is not true of course the return that is got&mdash;in many cases where no return has been got up to now from the company income tax has to be paid on top of it&mdash; that money has to be paid out of the profits of the company.  Of course, it will affect employment at a time when Deputy Desmond should be concerned, more than anything else, with the chronic unemployment position we have here.  However, we have had the glib nonsense from him as though it does not affect anybody.</P>

Substantially what he had to say was: &ldquo;It is not going to affect me; I am all right, Jack, and you can squeeze the rich.  To hell with the consequences for employment or anything else.&rdquo;  That is not the attitude of the Fianna Fáil party and it never will be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To suggest that the wealth tax will not affect employment is either crass ignorance or deliberate misrepresentation of the position.  Deputy Desmond can take his choice as to which is the explanation in his case.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated the level of exemption and the rate of tax in this Bill.  He referred to it as being very high; I am not sure if he said it was the highest in Europe but he indicated that it was extremely high.  The fact is that if one is to make a real comparison with the other countries in Europe which have a wealth tax one must have regard to the level of income tax and the thresholds of income tax at the marginal rates.  What one discovers is that the effective rate of wealth tax proposed here is the highest in Europe.  I propose to demonstrate that at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I was aware that an amendment on the lines of Amendment No. 28 would be submitted by the Minister because he indicated when we raised the difficulty on the Second Stage about the 5th April and the consequences that would flow from it that he would put in an amendment.  While the effect of that is to say that people will not have to pay interest on unpaid tax up to 5th October, nevertheless, is it not true to say that if that is not the only amendment made in connection with this point we will have a situation in which 5th April, 1975, will be the valuation date legally.  Three months thereafter, under the Bill, the wealth tax on the 1975 valuation will be legally payable.  The only concession being made is that there is no interest on that but legally it will be payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2092" /> The Minister may say that in practice this will not make any real difference, but I believe it could depending on how long the passage of this Bill takes through both Houses. Leaving that aside, surely the Minister cannot accept that it is a satisfactory position to be providing in that way for the legal valuation date at 5th April&mdash;the date on which the payment is legally due being 5th July &mdash;when the Bill has not been passed and when the ultimate content of the Bill is not known to anybody, including the Minister.  That is the point of the amendment I have put down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I respectfully agree that there will be other opportunities later for a wider discussion on the effects of wealth tax.  We have had an adequate Second Reading debate already and throughout the committee stage we should concentrate on the details of the Bill.  This amendment proposes to change for the year 1975 the valuation date from 5th April to 5th October.  It has been suggested by the Opposition that if that is not done trading companies in some way or another will be confused; that they will not have time to make provision for this tax, presumably in their accounts, and that it will be to their disadvantage if this date is not postponed. Anybody who understands the working of the proposed tax must realise that it does not concern the internal workings of trading companies in so far as the preparation of accounts is concerned or the payment of tax.  They are not assessable; they are not accountable; they do not come into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that shares of these companies in the hands of people who are not exempt will be liable to wealth tax in the ordinary way.  However, if, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, there are many shareholders in trading companies, the greater the number of shareholders the less the likelihood that they be affected by this wealth tax, because they will have the exemption from the fact that the more people the shares are spread <Col N="2093" /> across the greater will be the threshold available to them.</P>
    <P>The Government proposal is to introduce wealth tax as from 5th April of this year.  Everybody has known about that proposal for some time.  Deputy Colley complained that in this Bill we are asking them to pay retrospectively, as he puts it, and making them liable at a time when they did not know what the law was. Without going into detail, I think there are ample precedents for that in taxation.  The budget is frequently introduced in May&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister will agree that it is not quite the same thing.  There are specific increases in certain taxes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Indeed, sometimes there are new taxes introduced in the budget, and income tax is altered frequently and made payable from the previous 5th April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules are known in advance.  It is only a change in the rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Therefore, I say this is nothing new. If we are to accept Deputy Colley's amendment, it is almost certain that accounts will not be put in until 1st October or even after that, and the effect of that will not facilitate the Revenue Commissioners, as has been suggested, by giving them an opportunity of preparing for it.  Not alone will it make the tax more difficult to operate this year but it will probably overflow into next year and it will take longer to get the tax working smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Admittedly there will be teething problems with this tax.  There are teething troubles with any new system of taxation or with an innovation of any description.  Our entry into the EEC had its teething troubles despite the fact that every precaution was taken to negotiate the best terms possible. The Minister for Finance has met the real point that Deputy Colley is worried about, that people were going to have to pay interest on tax because they had not an opportunity <Col N="2094" /> of putting in a return.  By providing that no interest would be payable on tax paid before 5th October next, I think I have gone, on the Minister's behalf, sufficiently far to remove any hardship.</P>
    <P>In regard to many other points that have been introduced into the discussion on this amendment, I agree that there will be an opportunity, even perhaps on the very next section, for dealing with this sort of thing, and again I suggest to Deputy Colley that he might withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to speak about companies as if they were inanimate things.  Companies are made up of shareholders.  Shareholders are motivated, as we all are, by economic and other norms.  He said earlier on that the Department had an intimation already that these companies were gearing themselves for the payment of this wealth tax.  My only interest here is the reaction this may have on the rather hopeless and chaotic economic conditions which unfortunately prevail in our country today.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Public Accounts Committee I received from the Department of Finance a statement indicating in respect of companies and their liability for PAYE, VAT and pay-related benefits that the amounts that will be paid this year by them will be considerably less than has been paid heretofore, and there is also not a request but an intimation to the members of that committee that if these companies are not in a position to pay it, we shall have to go the easy way about extracting it. There is a change in the whole pattern. They are not bringing these companies to court now.  They are sending officers around trying to coax payments out of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ascertain from the Minister whether what he says is correct, that, notwithstanding all they are liable for to date, they are looking forward to paying an additional tax, or whether the statement we have received from the Revenue Commissioners intimating that these companies are going to find it most <Col N="2095" /> difficult to pay the liabilities that reside with them at the moment, is correct.  We must have that clarified. Either the statement we got from the Department is incorrect or the information the Minister is giving is incorrect.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not want to intervene at any length here, but I want to make it abundantly clear that this Bill, when it is passed, will not impose any further tax on trading companies as such.  Deputy Tunney spoke about companies saying that they were unable to pay PAYE.  I would ask Deputy Tunney to be really serious in discussing this.  All these companies that transmit amounts for PAYE income tax to the Revenue Commissioners have already collected it from their employees and it is no burden on them.</P>

His liability to payment of the amount due, in effect, does not arise until 5th October, 1975 because, as Deputy Colley knows, interest does not arise.  Naturally, those with even very modest wealth know that if we are not liable to pay interest we will sit on our cash and the amendment proposed by Deputy Colley is irrelevant in terms of amendment No. 28.  His argument is a non-argument. <Col N="2098" /> In replying to Deputy Brugha, I would say that there still seems to be embedded in Fianna Fáil the idea that every shareholder&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I want to raise on this.  The first I would put to the Minister in relation to the definition of &ldquo;discretionary trust&rdquo; in subsection (1).  The Minister has received representations to the effect of what I am about to say, but I should like to get his comments on it now.  It appears that the definition of a discretionary trust may include something which is not discretionary.  For example, it has been suggested to me that the definition could include a trust in which a widow is paid the income during her lifetime from property left to her by her husband.  It appears the effect of the Bill would be to charge a fixed trust to wealth tax without any threshold.  If that is so, the definition should be amended so as to exclude fixed trusts of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I will take the point raised by Deputy Colley now.  A widow entitled to a life interest in the income from her husband's property would not be regarded as being involved in a discretionary trust.  The widow would be deemed to have a limited interest in the husband's property, and we will be dealing with this under another section. That would have implications for the widow but not because it would be considered to be a discretionary trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the definition as provided in the subsection clearly provides that there must be a discretion?  In other words, cannot the definition include what I have described as a fixed trust where, in practice, there is not a discretion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i>&ldquo;Discretionary trust&rdquo; is a definition of what is normally understood by the term.  It is defined as a disposition which results in property being held on such trusts that the income of capital, or part of the income of capital, may be applied for the benefit of one or more of a number or class of persons at the discretion of the trustees or any other person.  A trust is a discretionary trust notwithstanding that there may be power to withhold payments and to accumulate all or any part of the income.  A trust may arise under a disposition which is a deed, a will, any covenant, agreement or arrangement and may be established with or without an instrument <Col N="2101" /> in writing.  There is nothing in the definition which does not accord with the usual concept of a discretionary trust.  The very essence of a discretionary trust is that the trustee, or some other person, must have a discretion as to what is to be done with the subject matter of the trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that that is the essence of a discretionary trust. The matter is somewhat technical, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I may return later to what appears to be the difficulty about the definition, as to whether it does make it clear that there must be a discretion.  In the meantime, I should like to refer the Minister to the definition of &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo; which follows the definition of &ldquo;discretionary trust&rdquo;.  First of all, the general definition of &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo; goes on to provide that, without prejudice to the generality of that definition, a person shall also, for the purposes of the Act, be deemed to be entitled in possession to, and the first part is &ldquo;property comprised in an instrument which he may revoke&rdquo;. In regard to that part of it I should like to know is the person who is entitled until revocation, also deemed to be &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Like myself, I am sure the Deputy will have had many experiences of transfers&mdash;perhaps more common in the country&mdash;of property subject to a power of revocation.  A person who parts with property subject to a power of revocation does not, in reality, part with control of it because he can take it back at any time.  Were this provision not in the Bill, there would be nothing to prevent a wouldbe taxpayer executing an instrument at the end of, say, March, transferring property valued at £50,000 to somebody who had no other property, revoking that instrument in the middle of April and thus avoiding tax altogether.  Therefore, it is provided in the Bill that the person who has the power to revoke is &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo; and that the person who <Col N="2102" /> holds, subject to the power to revoke, does not hold in possession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, up to a point, but there are implications in this.  Of course, I understand why the provision is there but the Minister's illustrations of it was in relation to somebody who parts with a property just before the valuation day.  One can visualise a situation where somebody parts for, say, 20 years subject to revocation, that it might continue for 20 years.  Yet the Minister says in such circumstances the person who is enjoying the property is deemed not to be &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is really necessary to put the matter beyond doubt.  Probably the effect would be the same were the paragraph not there.  But we thought there might be arguments that a person entitled to a share in a deceased person's estate was not in possession of it, in that he had the right to claim it only; that it might be argued that joint tenants have not exclusive possession of any part of the property they own and that, if one were to acquire possession of it, one would have to have a petition suit or something like that.  It was to forestall arguments such as that that this provision was inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a beneficiary in the estate of a deceased person, prior to the winding up of the administration and, therefore, before the beneficiary has, in fact, received the property, is he deemed under this provision to be &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes, he would have the right to it.  I could visualise a situation arising where one might not be able to say precisely, within a few pounds what was in fact coming to one.  Before we did away with death duties, there used to be such things as corrective affidavits or corrective accounts.  I am sure that could be tidied up afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Some interesting possibilities may arise on that also which, again, may be considered later.  Another question to be posed in regard to this paragraph is that, included in the definition of &ldquo;entitled to possession&rdquo; is an interest or share in a partnership.  I should like to know what are the rules for determining the interest of a partner in a partnership where under this provision a partner is deemed to be &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> There are not special rules in this Bill on definition for ascertaining the precise <Col N="2104" /> share the taxpayer would have in a partnership but, presumably, the partnership agreement or arrangement would spell that out.  Otherwise, it would be a very loose form of partnership indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite as simple as that.  It is true to say that this Bill does not contain any rules for the valuation of assets, not merely partnership assets, but any assets unlike, say, the Capital Gains Tax Bill which has very detailed rules for assessing the valuation of property.  In the case of partnerships, it is not quite as simple, I think, as the Minister indicated&mdash;the partnership deed may not necessarily make it clear what is the share because one could approach it on the basis of the share of the profits, or one could approach it on the basis of the share of the subscribed capital at the commencement of the partnership.  There may be other ways of approaching it but, anyway, those are just two.  It is important that there be no uncertainty about this. Not only in relation to partnership and the points I raised but, generally, in relation to the valuation of assets for the purposes of this Bill, there should be detailed rules for those valuations.  As I have indicated, there are precedents which would go a long way in meeting this in the Capital Gains Tax Bill and I am not quite clear why such rules should not exist in the Wealth Tax Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Colley.  Deputy de Valera was ready to give the Revenue Commissioners a certain amount of leeway and to allow them to make up their minds about valuation of different things in the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  I agree with Deputy Colley that, from a business point of view, we must put a value on a person's home.  To go further, we must also put a proper valuation on an estate.  We must also be told how the Revenue Commissioners will arrive at that value.  We may be told that the Revenue Commissioners will be fair.  I agree that in the past they have been fair but the day will come when a person might over-value his assets and <Col N="2105" /> will be able to prove by law that his estate is worth X amount of money. In my opinion, a proper valuation should be put on everything.  No businessman will tolerate a valuation that is wrong.  One must plan ahead in business. One must plan for five, six or even ten years ahead.  There is no way that one can look for a price until one knows at what price the assets are valued.  One cannot be depending on the whim of some man who has never been in business.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Colley asked how a person's share in a partnership will be ascertained. I cannot conceive a partnership without some provision for at least winding it up.  If there is such a provision, that would suggest who would be entitled to the assets.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes, indeed.  We can only apply common sense to this.  If there is a partnership for which there is no written agreement, it would be very hard to devise rules for ascertaining the ownership of the assets of that partnership.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I agree that if there was no other basis for deciding who owned the property, then the profits were equally divided, presumably the assets would be equally divided.  I noted when studying the Second Reading debate that some people complained that there were not rules for doing this, that and the other, and that the absence of rules would lead to a great deal of litigation.  Candidly, and speaking as a rural solicitor, I believe the more rules and the more one tries to define things definitely, the more litigation one creates.  I understand that since 1910 there has not been one appeal to the courts against the valuation of land for estate duty purposes. I also understand that since Deputy Colley, as Minister for Finance, introduced machinery for appeals against the value of shares, that there has not <Col N="2106" /> been one case.  It is the job of the Opposition to say that such and such might happen.  We must deal with the realities and the practicalities of the situation.  The simple, everyday lanquage used in this Bill will be more likely to lead to the smooth working of the legislation.</P>
      <P>I can only anticipate what the Revenue Commissioners will do.  I cannot speak on their behalf nor can I give any assurance of what they will do but I am sure they will not try to value something to within pounds. The rate of tax here is fairly low, so if there is an error of a few hundred pounds one way or the other, nobody will be robbed.</P>

It is an open secret that this Wealth Tax Bill is very largely modelled on the Indian Wealth Tax Bill.  Under that legislation there are detailed rules for valuation of assets. Since the Indian legislation was followed fairly closely in this Bill, why was this aspect of it not followed?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I agree with Deputy Colley and Deputy Belton.  Valuations will be of vital importance in this Bill.  The Minister pointed out that valuations for death duties have worked reasonably well through the years.  I believe this to be so.  Death duty valuations will probably occur once in every 20 or 30 years, but we are dealing here with a different ball game.  We are broadening the scope of valuations. From the Revenue point of view, valuations will become much more difficult, especially when we take inflation into consideration.  The fluctuations in inflation will undoubtedly affect valuations.  It will present an enormous problem for the Revenue Commissioners to get fair valuations from year to year.  Property bought at a very high price 12 months ago would have a different valuation today.  It <Col N="2108" /> could be 25 or 30 per cent lower.  This is the type of complicated situation in which the Revenue Commissioners will find themselves with regard to this wealth tax.  As the Minister said, it was much simpler in relation to death duties.  There should be certain guidelines to show exactly what the valuation is.  The Revenue Commissioners have power to appoint people.  I am not sure that I will agree with that section when we come to it.  We can discuss it then.  Valuations will have an important bearing as we go through the Bill.  I doubt that any Revenue Commissioner would be competent to value property accurately throughout Dublin City.  I would find it very difficult to imagine that there is such a man.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Fitzpatrick hit the nail on the head when he said we can discuss this later.  It arose indirectly.  It was a hare raised by Deputy Colley on partnership. I do not think he intended to raise the question of valuation but rather the question of ascertainment of shares in partnership, which is different.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said we are in a different ball game.  We are dealing with something which occurs every three years, whereas death duties were different.  When we were valuing for death duties we were talking about a handover of 55 per cent of the assets to the Revenue Commissioners, whereas we are dealing here with less than 1 per cent effectively.  I suggest that section 8 (2) will afford us an opportunity for discussion on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to approach this Bill in the same spirit as the Minister and I am grateful to him for creating an atmosphere which enables us to do so.  Would he permit me to make one general observation on the section which requires a technical approach?  Having regard to the nature of these Bills, there are three points of view.  There is the businessman's point of view which was so aptly and ably expressed by Deputy Belton on the Government side and Deputy Fitzpatrick on our side.  There <Col N="2109" /> is the administration point of view, the point of view of the public service, what is commonly called the bureaucratic point of view.  The third is the lawyer's point of view.  The lawyer is, perhaps, the bridge.  As we are making law, the lawyer's point of view is relevant and so are the other two points of view.</P>
      <P>There was some substance in Deputy Belton's submission that the administrative point of view does not always take account of the problems and the practical situation when it comes to commerce.  Perhaps the lawyer's point of view is a little closer to it although, with the State having its finger in practically every pie nowadays, I would not go so far as to suggest that the administration are not aware of what is going on.  No one point of view should be allowed to override the others unfairly.  I hope the Minister does not mind my making these general statements because I want to put what I have to say into perspective.</P>
      <P>I welcome a Minister like the Minister who is deputising for the Minister for Finance and who obviously knows what he is talking about when he says there is merit in simple language.  I think I heard him express the opinion: the more rules, the more litigation. That is a very common-sense point of view which is applicable to the three points I mentioned. I have been trying to advocate that on all these Bills.  I am probably in a minority in the view I have taken about the discretion which should be given to the Revenue Commissioners, from what I hear in the House, but I still feel that in our set up to give that discretion is the clearer and the more practical course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come now to the definition section.  I should like to invite assistance from Deputy Esmonde.  He knows much more about this than I do.  I do not pretend that I have kept up to date in these matters.  Is not this Bill <i>in pari materia</i>, as the lawyers say, with the Capital Acquisition Bill and the Capital Gains Bill which are before the House?  Is this not a code of law of the same nature, or dealing with the same subject matter, as the lawyers say, <Col N="2110" /><i>in pari materia</i>?  I am not so sure that could not be extended to relate to the income tax code.  Just for the moment I want to raise that point.  I am very glad Deputy Esmonde is here because there is nobody more competent in the House to express an opinion on some of the matters I may raise.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is <i>in pari materia</i> with the other Bills in certain circumstances they can be mutually relied upon for interpretation.  If they are mutually to be relied on for interpretation, the comparison of the definitions in the three Bills is of vital importance.  I was intimidated when I opened the Bill and saw the task which faced us.  It will be a very difficult task in Committee.  I do not want to delay the House with details.  I shall try to be as general as I can.  Certain questions arise.  I think the point I am raising has substance. The principles on which, therefore, we have to approach this section are that this is a fiscal charging and taxing statute and that although it received the same interpretation as any other statute it is to be strictly construed.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is of the same nature as two other statutes that we are passing simultaneously.  Incidentally, the fact of the homogeneity of the Bills and presumably the close dating of when they become law will go towards substantiating the point I am making.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the rules are that where there are different statutes <i>in pari materia</i> though made at different times or even expired or repealed and not referring to each other and though using different language they shall be taken and interpreted together as one system and as explanatory of each other.  Whatever has been determined in the interpretation of one of several statutes <i>in pari materia</i> is a sound rule of interpretation for the others.  For Deputy Esmonde's information I am referring to Beale's <i>Cardinal Rules of Legal Interpretation</i>, Third Edition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The general statement I have made is qualified. Frankly, I would not be prepared to offer an opinion as to what the precise position is at the moment but there has been a great deal of case law on this and I suggest that the three Bills going through the House are in that sense <i>in pari materia.</i> If they are, those rules of interpretation can be complex when it comes to the practical case and difficult in application.  There are a multitude of decisions relating to them.  It is that fact that I want to emphasise here.  I do not want to indulge in the exercise of giving a legal opinion.  I do want to point out that these three statutes are as far as I can see so related that they may be used and in principle should be used for mutual interpretation when the necessity would arise, that the rules governing their relationship are complex and you would need particular cases to apply them and that, therefore, there are possible grounds for legal points in court.  I do not say that they would in themselves bring about extensive litigation but I do relate it to the Minister's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the relevance of what I am saying to the section?  The Chair has been very tolerant in not asking that question.  The relevance is: in these three Bills the same words are defined and the definitions vary.  I do not say they are contradictory.  I make that clear so as to avoid our <Col N="2112" /> going off at tangents.  They vary.  I have not found a blatant contradiction between the definitions but one may evolve in the course of the debate. I have found more than once in making the comparison the suspicion at least of an enlargement of meaning or a qualification in one Bill or the other in the use of the same words.  This is a legal problem.</P>
    <P>Before I embark on each individual definition, perhaps I should give the Minister an opportunity to comment. I greatly appreciate the fact that it is the Minister for Lands who is deputising for the Minister for Finance on this occasion.  I am not criticising the Minister for Finance but it is useful to know that what one is saying will be understood in its full implications.  If the Minister likes, I will give him an opportunity to comment on what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I will comment very briefly.  First of all, Deputy de Valera has embarked &mdash;and he is quite entitled to do it&mdash; or highly technical legal argument and has put forward the case that statutes which are <i>in pari materia</i> to each other should have common construction, so to speak.  I was not being funny or obstructive when I asked for a definition of <i>&ldquo;in pari materia&rdquo;.</i> There are absolutely different principles involved in each of these three Bills.  The measure we are dealing with now imposes an annual tax and if it would be <i>in pari materia</i> to anything it may be <i>in pari materia</i> to the rating system.  The Capital Acquisition Tax Bill imposes a tax once and once only when a gift passes or an inheritance occurs. Capital acquisition tax is really a different code altogether and bears no resemblance to what we are dealing with here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy de Valera was quoting from but I understand&mdash;and I want to make it clear that I cannot quote the authority for this&mdash;it is laid down and accepted that a taxing statute must be construed within the four walls of the statute. Some people say the law is an ass but the law quite frequently follows <Col N="2113" /> common sense and that is elementary. What I have said there is that a taxing statute must be construed within the four walls of the statute because if that were not the case, dear only knows what the taxing statute would mean.  For want of a better expression, it is a penal statute; it is a statute which is extracting tax from people. You cannot wander over statutes which have no relation to it to see how it affects the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I may be able to produce authority for that statement later.  It appears to be full of common sense.  I repeat that the language in this statute is simple. If we are to wander now from the capital acquisitions tax definitions to the definitions here and then to the income tax code and to the capital gains tax code we shall find ourselves in chaos.  Anybody questioning his position in relation to the Wealth Tax Bill will rely on the definition in that Bill and not any other in determining his rights.  I suggest, respectfully, that we accept that and deal with the Bill on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to accede to the Minister's point of view but this is a capital code.  The Income Tax Acts are a code in themselves.  I submit that the three Bills relating to wealth are dealing with the same subject matter&mdash;namely, capital&mdash;and are part of a whole code of legislation dealing with that subject.  For that reason I submit that they are <i>in pari materia.</i> However, it is not my intention to use this point as a type of filibuster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera is correct in raising this point at this stage because we are dealing with the definition clause in the Bill.  Normally, when Bills are being drafted, the definitions are at the end although in relation to finance business they are usually at the beginning.  Consequently, when people find definitions at the beginning of a Bill they wonder whether they should allow the definition to be enacted without making any comment at the preliminary stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has raised the question of <i>in pari materia.</i> I cannot <Col N="2114" /> see any grounds for <i>in pari materia</i> in respect of the three Bills.  As the Deputy says, all three Bills are related to capital but there is nothing to corelate them.  They must be taken as separate entities.  The approach to the tax base is different in each of them. To take a simple example, capital acquisitions tax is a tax on capital but one tax is an annual one and the other is, so to speak, a once and for all tax. That, alone, is sufficient to put them in different categories.  Deputy de Valera pointed out that there are differences in the interpretation sections of the Bill as to the meanings of words used. That bears out the fact that they are not <i>in pari materia.</i> While I cannot say what is the definition of &ldquo;real property&rdquo; in the other Bills, I have always understood it, in lawyers' terminology, to mean freehold property.  However, in this Bill we find that included in the definition of real property are leaseholds, so that here we have a special definition in a special Bill, included for special purposes. Therefore, it is a package on its own.</P>
    <P>Obviously, lawyers will read the debate on the Bill because they will be interested in knowing what was the view of the House.  Without going into the wider interpretations of law, there is ample evidence in the Bill to show that it is a package on its own.  It is usual, when one takes a Bill like this, to endeavour to find analogous sections in some other Act but one must be very careful in this regard. Usually a section that is analogous to a section of another Act is invoked by lawyers as a precautionary measure but that other section does not necessarily govern their judgement.  It is helpful to a lawyer to look at the ways in which words have been used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde is right up to a point.  I submit that what we are dealing with in these three Bills is <i>in pari materia</i> and to that extent I disagree with the Deputy.  Should a quotation be needed in regard to the definition of <i>in pari materia</i> I would refer the House to Hardcastle on the rules which govern the construction and effect of statutory <Col N="2115" /> law, second edition.  He tells us that it may be profitable to refer to one Act for the construction of another and says that when the statutes are <i>in pari materia,</i> that is dealing with the same subject matter or in other words constitute a part of a whole of the code of legislation on a particular subject, and so on.  There is a case quoted in this context.  It is Rex v. Tonbridge Overseers, 1883, 11, Queen's Bench Division, 134.  The work is well known to lawyers.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the technicalities of law.  However, we are dealing with three Bills where the subject-matter, namely, capital is the same.  We are dealing with three Bills that propose to tax capital, and which are going through the House at practically the same time.  The same words are defined in at least two of the Bills and I am suggesting this may give rise to complications.  I do not wish to go into a legal exercise regarding the legal position but we should have consistency and we should avoid making traps or causing grounds for further litigation.  That is why I went into the question of <i>in pari materia</i> because I wanted to establish the relevance of the definitions in these Bills. I think I have done so <i>prima facie.</i></P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about market value, and this is a matter that must be considered.  However, I think it better if I consider the points made as we proceed in this debate.  It is an involved process and I do not intend to parse every word but I wish to ask a few questions.  For instance, why is the definition of a word in this Bill not the same as in another Bill?</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;property&rdquo; is defined in the two Bills.  Why it should vary slightly seems to suggest that the draftsman nodded.  In the Bill we are discussing &ldquo;property&rdquo; includes interests and rights of any description, and in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill it includes rights and interests of any description.  Could we not go to the trouble of keeping the same definition? In one case it is &ldquo;interest and rights&rdquo; and in another case it is &ldquo;rights and interests&rdquo;.  That may seem a trivial point, and I realise that there is no difference in the meaning, but it serves to bring out the point I wish to make in regard to the other sections. Incidentally, the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; is to be taken in its general sense&mdash;at least that was the case originally.  Since then it has been defined by statutes in various ways, and nowadays the word probably means anything one owns.</P>

      <P>I am perfectly entitled to ask, and I do ask, and shall go on asking as to why the Minister does not subtract or why he does not add certain words.  I have referred to the other Bills.  If the Minister puts me to it I shall go into detail, and that <Col N="2118" /> will delay the House.

      <P>I have made my point about <i>in pari materia.</i> I have pointed out that the definitions in this and the other Bills are at variance with one another.  I do not say they are contradictory. I was very careful at the beginning and I did not say contradictory, but they are at variance.  They are not quite the same.  I do not want to make any further legal point, but I am entitled to ask the Minister why certain words are there and why certain words are not there.  Even if I am excluded from dealing with the other Bill I now want to put it on the record that, if I am driven to it, I will do it in relation to the other Bill.  The Minister cannot stop me asking him why he did not add the whole string that includes disposition.  Let us be reasonable and do it in a reasonable and less technical way.</P>
      <P>This is one of the devices suggested to the Minister, and I will not be stopped from discussing freely the contents of a Bill we are passing no matter how inconvenient that may be to anybody, and I will not be stopped from relating the three Bills.  The definitions are at variance.  In the case of property they could not even put the words in the same order; it is rights and interests in one and interests and rights in the other. That does not matter one whit but it is an indication of the difficulties. The Minister has provoked me into saying those things, things I regret, and the real reason why I want to do what I want to do is because I want to try to see if we can get consistent definitions.  The definitions could be consistent.  I do not see why there are these variations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House, but discretionary trusts is defined in line 17 onwards of section 1 (1) and it is also defined in exactly the same <Col N="2119" /> words in relation to &ldquo;accumulate any part of the income&rdquo; but then, in this Bill, disposition includes any disposition whether by deed or will and any covenant agreement or arrangement whether effected with or without right. Those are the words in this Bill.  In the other Bill disposition includes a whole list of things running from &ldquo;a&rdquo; to &ldquo;n&rdquo; in the definition and not in both cases the words &ldquo;include his house&rdquo;. Why the difference?  There is probably a reason why what is defined in this Bill is more relevant.  I accept all that but, if one takes definitions like that, it is easy to see the list can only be jarring on a lawyer finding the same words in the same code defined in a different way.  That is all I am saying on that.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to parse the words, something to which I would have been driven had the Minister persisted in his earlier approach.  The next words are &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo;. The phrase is defined in essentially the same way in the other two Bills but in the Bill before us there is a difference. The property and the interest and the share of a partnership are set out separately and in the other Bills there is a reference to &ldquo;joint tenants and beneficiaries&rdquo;.  The wording, as I say, is precisely the same.  If this Bill is passed in this form I will leave the courts to deal with what is meant, but this is an indication of the technical difficulties that are beginning to arise on this whole code.  &ldquo;Interest in expectancy&rdquo; is varied in the definition in the Bill before us.  It gets a separate definition in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  In this Bill it includes an estate in remainder or reversion but does not include a number of other things.  It seems to say the same thing but it is set out differently.  There is certainly a formal variation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House with these comparisons.  Anybody who reads the Bills will discover them for himself: although they appear to be essentially the same they are set out differently and presented differently. There is some variation.  Lawyers would ask: Why?  The courts would ask: Why?  I do not want the Minister <Col N="2120" /> to send me looking to authorities. I can give them.  I am quite capable of giving them.  If this were as simple as the Minister says it is, that would be all right, but it is not.  But even if it were not a statute <i>in pari materia,</i> when difficulties of interpretation arise one can refer, as Deputy Esmonde said, to decided cases or any relevant legal material for the interpretation.</P>
    <P>I do not know why, if one definition in one of these Bills is all inclusive, it cannot be repeated or adapted in the other Bill and why, in the case of words or phrases like &ldquo;discretionary trust&rdquo;, &ldquo;entitled to possession&rdquo; or &ldquo;interest in the expectancy&rdquo; a suitable general definition cannot be taken and be the same in all three.  It would give certainty, avoid dangers that may be here, and it would obviate the possibility of one qualifying the other.  After our experience with the last Schedule of the Capital Gains Tax Bill, Deputies might be excused if they were somewhat suspicious about variations in wording as to what was being imported.</P>
    <P>In the three definitions I have mentioned, I do not see that any of these three materially expand the meaning in the other Act but it seems to me that the widest interpretation, taking all three together, where they are consistent, will be the interpretation put on these words.  It is the widest possible meaning over the three Acts that will be taken, not necessarily the narrow meaning within the Act itself. If the Minister wants me to justify that statement I can do so but I would prefer to make the statement here as a Deputy rather than to have us running into technical law.</P>
    <P>In the same spirit I want to take the words &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  Market value in relation to property means the market value thereof, ascertained in accordance with section 8 or 9, as the case may be.  I am glad Deputy Esmonde has got his ammunition and will join with me but I also want to say that while he was collecting it, I said that I wanted to try to avoid going into the finer details.  I want to <Col N="2121" /> say to him, on the question of <i>in pari materia</i> or otherwise, that in the last analysis that will be decided by the courts and not by us.  I am entitled to take the possibility into account in making my submission.</P>
    <P>The Wealth Tax Bill defines market value as:</P>
    <P>The market value in relation to property means the market value thereof ascertained in accordance with section 8 or 9, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the details of that are best argued on these sections. It is relevant and important for me to point out, at this stage, that section 8 has four subsections of some substance and section 9 has three subsections. Under the Capital Gains Tax Bill we had a big debate on market value.  Section 49 of that Bill defines &ldquo;market value&rdquo; in some detail.  I shall not go into a detailed comparison of the details of market value here.  It seems from the discussions we had on that lengthy subject that it is important, from the point of view of the business man as a person practically engaged in commerce, to give particular attention to the definition here. I, therefore, suggest that when we come to sections 8 and 9 we give it rather particular and detailed scrutiny, particularly in the light of section 49 of the Capital Gains Tax Bill and indeed the provisions in it.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to draw the line that the Minister&mdash;and I sympathise with him&mdash;would like to draw on where the discussion on this should occur.  If we have an important practical matter of this nature am I asking too much to suggest that it should be treated in the same way in the three Bills and that instead of having the definition, as we have it in this Bill, because of the practical difficulties, that the definition already in the Capital Gains Tax Bill, which the Minister has seisin of still as it has to come back for Report Stage, and the definition of market value in this Bill should be taken together, reconsidered, if necessary adjusted, so as to cast them in precisely the same form in the two Bills?  Here is something on which my colleague.  Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, and Deputy Belton <Col N="2122" /> have expressed views on.  It will be a matter of major practical importance and even day to day importance where this Bill and the other Bills are concerned. Valuations will be required. The Revenue Commissioners will have to make many more assessments. Under the Bill the taxpayer will have to make assessments.  Therefore, it is unfair to the citizen complicating the issue for the administration to have, in the one code, dealing with the taxation of capital, varying definitions even though an involved legal argument at the end will show that there is not a very great substantial difference between them.  The fact that there is even a verbal difference can be important in law.</P>
    <P>Suppose I were to embark on a word by word comparison of these defininitions and Deputy Esmonde and I were to go into a technical argument on this, we would be here for a long time.  The Minister would be valid if he complained that we were discussing the matter in a way more appropriate to another place, namely, the courts. Deputy Esmonde could reinforce him by saying that one can never discuss anything in a court without a specific case.  Both points would be perfectly valid and I accept them.  However, my point is that we are making the law in the interests of the citizen, and of the administration, in the interest of the Deputies who have to take the responsibility for passing this.  Deputies should be given a chance of using their heads instead of their boots to put the Act into effect because the feet will march up to the lobby when the division bell sounds, but it is not asking too much to give Deputies a chance of using their heads on this matter.  I complain that it is, indeed, confusing to have a common thing like &ldquo;market value&rdquo; defined in the complex way it is and, differently, in two related statutes we are putting through the House at the same time.</P>
    <P>They may not be different in content but that is part of my trouble.  I have to read through a lot of apparently different material because it is differently set out and presented to see whether there is any variation or <Col N="2123" /> qualification in meaning at all.  We have the warning of the parenthesis in paragraph 3 of the last Schedule of the Capital Gains Tax Bill to warn us what can be buried, inadvertently often, in this kind of legislation.</P>
    <P>In order to avoid that I am making, as strongly as I can, the point that in the case of a phrase like &ldquo;market value&rdquo; can we not get a common definition, a clear definition? All the qualifications necessary should be put in one Bill and &ldquo;market value&rdquo; defined in a section.  In the Bill before the House the word appears as a definition in the interpretation section but that definition is meant to refer to two further sections in the Bill.  That seems to be deliberate confusion.  The charge has been made before now that certain types of statutes have been drafted in a way that can be confusing.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, in connection with &ldquo;market value&rdquo; to put the definition into one section at least, either in this section or in another; to have it consonant with the definition contained in section 49 of the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  It should be done in a clear way so that the people in commerce will not have to go to a lawyer.  The general rule governing would be that words will be used in the general meaning.  Here I have great sympathy with what the Minister said at the outset.  It would, perhaps, have been better not to define the words &ldquo;market value&rdquo; at all, to let it be dealt with as common words as &ldquo;property&rdquo; was in the beginning. However, that may not be feasible in a Bill of that nature.  That is freely conceded.  If it is defined, it should be in a clear way so that the person reading it, whether he be a lawyer or a layman, will have some certainty in the answer to his particular problem as to what is the market value of the item of property he is interested in at the moment.</P>
    <P>That is the practical test.  Market value will not become a live issue until there is something to be valued, until there is some property there whose market value is to be determined and when one knows the <Col N="2124" /> property it should be clear what is the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;market value&rdquo; and what are the rules by which one decides what the market value of that piece of property is.</P>
    <P>There is a definition by reference to two sections but it seems to be unnecessary to include them in this.  It is a bit of a puzzle, for instance, why when it is virtually defined in section 8 and 9 and it is also defined in section 49 of the Capital Gains Tax Bill, a definition by reference has to appear in the Wealth Tax Bill but no such thing appears in the corresponding section of the other Bill.  I do not think there is any sinister reason for this but I have pointed out the fact that courts will usually try, wherever possible, to come to the conclusion that Parliament meant what it was doing.  If the question of <i>in pari materia</i> ever arose, if the Bills were related, and if the subject came up, it might well be that the question as to why it was put in this way in this Bill and different in the other could arise.</P>
    <P>These are all questions of legal interpretation, but this is the morass we are getting into with this Bill.  I am a little puzzled as to what the outcome will be.  Property is defined essentially the same but there is no reason why the words should be inverted in one to the other.  It is an indication of what will happen.</P>
    <P>We have net market value as a new definition in this Bill.  However, taking subsection (1) of this section, I want to make the general point that we should in defining the same words in these three Bills as far as possible have the definitions exactly corresponding, and where they do not correspond a good and sufficient reason should be given to the House for the lack of correspondence. To go into the matter in greater detail than that would be trespassing, at this Stage, beyond what is properly our business.</P>
    <P>There are some further points I want to make on the section, but on this first point I have made the Minister should be satisfied of the consistency of these definitions.  Secondly, on the words &ldquo;discretionary trust&rdquo;.  &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo;, &ldquo;interest in expectancy&rdquo;, <Col N="2125" />&ldquo;the market value&rdquo;, all of which I have discussed, will the Minister at this Stage say whether those definitions in the Acts are <i>in pari materia</i> or not, whether the definitions given in this Bill now before us are the same as the definitions given in the other two Acts and, if they are different, would he please indicate to us the points where there is a difference?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I cannot accept the proposition that this is a code of tax or that these three measures are <i>in pari materia.</i> Deputy de Valera urges that the three measures are dealing with capital or wealth and that they are dealing with the taxation of capital or wealth.  He goes on to say that because that is so, all the words used in the three Bills should have the same definition.  The Planning and Development Act of 1963 deals with land and with the use of land.  The Land Acts deal with land, and indeed to a very large extent with the use of land, but it would be going very far to say that our definitions in regard to land in both those different codes should have the same definition. I think that is what Deputy de Valera is trying to do here.  I concede that these three Bills&mdash;and it is coincidental that they happen to be here at the same time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes, I am not going to become controversial but even the opposite side of the House agree that the Capital Gains Tax is years overdue.  The other Bills are to replace death duties.  It just happens that when this Government came into office they decided that a revision was long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respectfully put it to the House that we have three entirely different approaches to the taxation of capital and wealth here and that these words that are worrying Deputy de Valera must be looked at in the context of the measure in which they appear.  The Bill we are dealing with now is the only Bill we are concerned with.  It deals with wealth in the possession of <Col N="2126" /> the taxpayer or which is deemed to be in the possession of the taxpayer on 5th April in any year.  Therefore, the emphasis here must be on clarifying what possession on 5th April means. That is the important thing here, to ascertain as clearly as possible what we mean by possession of property or wealth on 5th April.  I put it to the House that the expressions that are used in this Bill bear that in mind and are adequate to make it clear to anybody or any court what exactly is meant by them.  That is the important thing.</P>
    <P>It is also important to ensure that certain devices which might divest or might appear to divest a person of property or wealth temporarily will not be accepted.  That is what is at stake here.  When we come to deal with the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill the emphasis shifts, and what we are dealing with there is the passing of property&mdash;not the stationery existence of property&mdash;from one person to another by way of gift or inheritance, and the emphasis there must be to provide words and phrases and meanings which will make the situation clear to all concerned when property passes by way of gift or when property passes by way of inheritance, as indeed when we come to the Capital Gains Tax Bill we have another principle involved and another situation arises.</P>
    <P>There we are concerned with the appreciation in value of property between one date and another in the hands of the same person.  That is the issue involved there.  I sympathise with Major de Valera.  He has read these three Bills in or about the same time and must naturally be inclined to think they all deal with the same thing.  They are dealing with the same thing in a very different way and under a very different set of circumstances.  I have no intention of trying to indulge in a learned argument about the meaning of <i>in pari materia</i> in this House, because if politicians had to be qualified to do their business in that sort of way it could never be done.  I have certain experience as a lawyer going back over a number of years since 1940.  I <Col N="2127" /> hope that I always approach things in a common-sense sort of way, and I feel that in doing that, I keep myself and, indeed, my clients out of trouble.</P>
    <P>That, I think, answers clearly the general points raised by Deputy de Valera.  He mentions that &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is defined in section 1 by reference to two other sections.  But when we have the whole thing threshed out we will find that market value means the ordinary market price that a thing will fetch in the open market on a given day with a couple of exceptions mainly in ease of the taxpayer.  I will not give details now: one of them would not be an ease of the taxpayer but it is necessary in order to ascertain the real value of things.  Shares which confer control of a company are valued on that basis.  The fact that they do give control is taken into account.</P>
    <P>Agricultural land, if it is within a mile of a town, will not be valued under this Bill at its development price, at the price that a speculator might pay for it, or even at the price that a genuine building contractor would pay for it.  At the option of the taxpayer, it will be valued at agricultural value, farm value plus 25 per cent.  That is all the mystery there is about that.  It is a sensible approach that a farmer who is using his farm for agricultural purposes should not have it valued at five or six times the agricultural value because he happens to be within a mile of a town or because a town decided to extend near him.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, suggest that when we get down to talking about these definitions as most of them arise in the various sections, we will see that for the purposes of this Bill they are a practical common-sense approach and that they are couched in language which will not be difficult for either the taxpayer or the Revenue Commissioners to understand.  I understand that in the death duty code which could be regarded much more as a code than the passage that we are dealing with now, various words have different meanings for the purpose of estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty.  There are three branches of a <Col N="2128" /> code that were much more related than what we are dealing with.  I am advised that estate duty stood on its own, as did succession duty and legacy duty, and that that has been the position for a long time.</P>
    <P>As I said in my general remarks, in the capital acquisitions tax disposition is the all important thing.  No tax arises until there is a disposition, change of ownership by way of gift or inheritance.  The important thing is the ownership as on the 5th of April in any year.  I have already dealt with the extended definition of property in possession including property over which some person has a power of allocation and interest in partnerships and that sort of thing.  I respectfully suggest that we can deal with any definition that is annoying anybody or indeed with any definition that is giving anybody any trouble.  I will do my best to clarify the position and take part in a realistic debate on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his approach, which I can only characterise as a common-sense one, which is the best compliment I can pay him in this regard.  I do not wish to go into detailed technicalities on this but I want to make two points which are material in approaching this section.  One is in regard to the meaning that is in the section.  For that reason one can ask a number of questions.  My view is reinforced by the point I made about <i>in pari materia</i> with which the Minister does not agree.</P>
      <P>When he suggest that it is accidental that they came in at the same time I respectfully reply that it is not accidental, because the whole thing was forecast in the same White Paper: it is manifestly part of a code of capital taxation.  These Bills were all preceded by this one White Paper. This is an argument that we do not wish to pursue.  I do not want to pursue it any more than the Minister except to say that it is a point that should not be lost sight of in our drafting of definitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask a couple of questions here which I have asked already in general terms, and I do not intend to parse the two&mdash;lawyers will do it&mdash;<Col N="2129" /> and anyone who is interested now has the reference to read those definitions to see if they can get anything further than I have got out of them.  The point is this: we will take the definitions, &ldquo;discretionary trust&rdquo;, &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo;, &ldquo;disposition&rdquo; and &ldquo;interest in expectancy&rdquo;.  We will take these first.  They are all contained in subsection (1).  I repeat &ldquo;discretionary trust&rdquo;, &ldquo;disposition&rdquo;, &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo;, &ldquo;interest and expectancy&rdquo;.  These also appear defined in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  The question I wish to ask is: are the definitions in this Bill narrowed or the same in content, or do they embrace anything wider than the definitions in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill?  I take the Minister's point that the purposes of the particular Bills, in the sense that they are dealing with different aspects of capital, are different and that there are certain parts of these definitions that require different emphasis in each of the three Bills.  That, I accept, of course.  I also accept that these being taxing statutes, the danger of the definitions in this Bill being enlarged by reference to the other Bills is minimal because the court would tend to construe strictly in favour of the taxpayer as far as possible.  Therefore, if this Bill is narrower than what is in the other Bills for the purposes of this Bill, it is not so important.  Nevertheless, I would like to know whether we have a wider definition here or how far these definitions are on all fours, one with the other, notwithstanding the point which the Minister made that you are dealing with different aspects of capital taxation in the three Bills.</P>
    <P>In asking the Minister that question I am really asking him whether he could not, from a common-sense point of view, from the point of view I have mentioned already, get common definitions in all the Bills which would make it so much easier for the layman, the businessman and the lawyer to read.  That is really what I am asking him: Is this definition narrower or wider than, or the same as, that in the other Bill?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not want to be unhelpful or appear to be ungrateful but I would rather conduct this debate on the basis that Deputies would find fault with the language used in the Bill or with the definitions used there and suggest that they should be amended if they find fault with them rather than to ask me, or anybody, to compare one Bill with another.  It may be an interesting exercise, but the object of this Bill is to define words so as to include the entire wealth of an individual and bring him into the net.</P>
      <P>I imagine in the Capital Acquisition Tax Bill, which has not come to Committee yet and which will be dealt with later on, the emphasis will be to see when property is changing, when an ownership is changing.  If the House thinks about it seriously it is not realistic to do that now.  If Deputy de Valera says we are going too far in this.  I say we are not going too far because the intention is to go as far as we can to embrace all of the wealth. But if he says that the language is defective we will have a discussion about it and I will try to see how it can be improved.  I do not think it serves any useful purpose to ask why is this Bill different from the others.  They are two different Bills with two entirely different objects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some other questions to raise but I want to say a brief word in regard to the general point raised by Deputy de Valera. To suggest that similar words or phrases in these three different Bills ought to have precisely the same definition would, of course, be going much too far.  Deputy de Valera never suggested that.  He made it clear on a number of occasions that because of necessary differences in the purposes of the three Bills it could be necessary to have different terms used in some of the definitions.  The general <Col N="2131" /> proposition he was putting was that in so far as they could be similar they should be similar.  On the other hand, to suggest, as the Minister has, that these three Bills are totally unrelated and are purely fortuitously coming before the House in or around the same time is also, I would suggest, going too far.</P>
      <P>As Deputy de Valera said, the three Bills are part of a code of capital taxation.  Furthermore, in regard to the Capital Gains Tax Bill, it is very necessary to define in that what is the wealth in the terms of what is taxable on a particular day, the day of acquisition or the day of disposal, so that the same purpose is required as in this Bill.  A similar argument could be made in regard to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that the proposition put by Deputy de Valera, which is, as I understand it, that in so far as is possible the definitions of the same words and phrases should be the same, is a reasonable proposition.  To take the simplest and most minor one which Deputy de Valera put forward, in one case there is reference to &ldquo;rights and interest&rdquo; and in the other there is reference to &ldquo;interest and rights&rdquo;.  Is there any good reason why they should not be the same?</P>
      <P>As the Minister well knows, mere difference raises a suspicion in lawyers' minds that there is a difference in meaning and they can spend a long time trying to find out whether there is or not, whereas the whole thing could be made very simple by making them the same without any loss to the purpose of any of the Bills. That is just an illustration of what is the general proposition we are urging on the Minister&mdash;that is, in so far as it can be done, and recognising that it cannot be done 100 per cent, the definitions should conform and thereby make life simpler for the citizens who have to live under these Bills when enacted apart from any question of lawyers.  Some lawyers might like them to be complex.  I, as a lawyer of sorts, would prefer if they were simpler and more straightforward.</P>

      <P>Take &ldquo;market value&rdquo; and ask the question, in the context of what the Deputies have been saying, why it could not be in the interpretation?  Each Act has its own meaning.  Basically, an Act is given its ordinary everyday meaning. I see the point that has been made about the definition of words and I do not think there is anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic point is that interpretation sections are used to clarify the meaning of words used in a particular Act.  Sometimes it has appeared in many statutes that have been discussed that definitions were put in which were not basically required at all.  <i>Ex abundanti cautela</i> is the Latin phrase used in that sense. They were put in to make it quite apparent, and it turned out on Committee Stage on other Bills where a point was raised that the Minister said: &ldquo;I do not think it is necessary but if you like I will put it in.  There might be another pertinent view, it might be different.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are dealing with definitions here now.  It all goes back to the theory on which Deputy de Valera and I disagree, what is <i>in pari materia</i> and what is not.  There is no need for alteration of the other Acts. When a new, in layman's language, package comes in, Deputy de Valera, who is a prominent member of the Opposition, and I support him, would naturally compare it, which is the natural thing for a lawyer to do, but that does not make the one code.  I want to quote a well-known legal authority in reference to interpretation clauses which says all that needs to be said.  It is from the 1913 edition of Halsbury's <i>Laws of England,</i> Vol. 27, paragraph 234:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most modern statutes contain an interpretation clause wherein is declared the meaning which certain words or expressions are to or may bear for the purposes of the statute in question.  As a rule it should be used for interpreting words which are ambiguous or equivocal only and not so as to disturb the meaning of <Col N="2133" /> such as are plain.  Interpretation clauses are often inserted <i>ex abundanti cautela</i> and are not necessarily to be construed as positive enactments.</P>
    <P>That covers everything we have been discussing here in ordinary, plain, simple language.  Halsbury had a gift of putting what might appear to be complex points into simple language, and any judge, lawyer or layman looking at the sections of an Act which is to stand on its own, and not part of a code, would take that view, whether he was a lawyer or not.  The sooner we get down to the sections where these definitions become relevant the better. We could go on and on for ever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think that, when passing legislation, we should have regard to simplicity.  Incidentally, that interesting passage from Halsbury does.  Indeed I could invoke it to support the point of view I was urging here.  The question is this: why, in two similar Bills we are passing at the same time&mdash;leaving out the law altogether; leaving out <i>in pari materia</i> or anything else; forget the law; just think of two Bills going through the House simultaneously; after all it is the ordinary citizen who is involved in this&mdash;should we use exactly the same phrases, in quotes, purported to define and have manifest differences in the definition when it appears to me to be unnecessary? Some of it may be <i>ex maiori cautulae,</i> if you like, in which case, it is unnecessary though I agree with Deputy Colley that much of it is necessary.  What I am complaining about is that some of it is so very nearly the same, why is it not exactly the same?  To come back to that quotation from Halsbury, would it hurt to add the additions that are, say, in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill to some of the definitions here, even though they were not directly relevant, for the sake of completion?  I would be completely justified in doing that on that quotation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the interpretation section from <Col N="2134" /> which the Deputy quoted.  Here we find this peculiar situation.  We are dealing in every case in the interpretation subsections in these Bills with words or phrases in inverted commas and we are purporting to fix their meaning by Act of Parliament.  But, when I look at these Bills before us at present, I find these very same words or phrases are being defined in this code which I have submitted as <i>in pari materia</i> and that they are either precisely the same, as in the case of definition of &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo;&mdash;that is all to the good&mdash;they are practically the same, as far as I can see, but with variations, both in form and, in one case, two of them telescoped into the one paragraph&mdash; which happened twice&mdash;the wording is practically the same.  I can find no very tangible difference in meaning. But, on first blush, looking at the two, they are completely different.</P>
      <P>I do not want to hold up the House by reading those long provisions and putting them on the record.  But anyone who takes up the Bill and compares the way it is set out will naturally enquire: why the difference when there does not seem to be any reason therefor?  In the case of &ldquo;disposition&rdquo;, for instance, one may well say: Well, it is more complete in one Bill than the other because it is required to be more complete.  But, relying on the quotation of Deputy Esmonde about interpretation clauses, I would go so far as to say that perhaps it would be safer, in this case the way we are putting it through, to insert the longer definition even though parts of it were not directly relevant to this Bill.  It would not go any further to defeat the Minister's argument, if it is valid, that it is not <i>in pari materia</i> because, as I pointed out earlier, the courts would lean to strict construction of the particular Act itself as it is a taxing Act.  All this being so, I am puzzled why some are exactly the same, some appear to be the same, even the same words, but are juggled around differently, presented differently.  Then, as I will say later, there is possibly substantive differences but I shall reserve them for the sections concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2135" /> Why must we put &ldquo;market value&rdquo; into an interpretation section in one Bill and not in the other?  All these, to my mind, create a certain confusion. I would be willing to bet that those of us who have been trained as lawyers and those practising lawyers in the House were we to get down to the details of this, would find themselves with a lengthy and time-consuming task.  Should that be relevant or necessary for this debate, it would be a very long and tedious job to tease out the whole thing.  If that situation is there&mdash; apparent confusion as far as the layman is concerned, a patent involved technicality; a matter that has given rise to both Deputy Esmonde and myself, in the spirit of what the Minister has asked, repressing ourselves from getting into a legal argument&mdash;but there has not been a phrase opened on either side that does not tempt one to run for the books and the cases&mdash;if that is the factual situation on a definition section of an Act, cannot we get more simplicity?  That is what I am asking.</P>
    <P>Taking the Minister's very reasonable opening I think&mdash;and I am back to it&mdash;that sometimes, with general words, the less rules, the less litigation. I could not agree more.  My point is being made by the very fact that here are Deputy Colley and the Minister, Deputy Esmonde and myself, all of us agreeing on simplicity.  But the complications of this have launched us into a position where we are having a legal argument and we are trying not to have a legal argument; where we are having, if one likes, a political debate on it, that is, a debate appropriate to the House, where we should have a debate but where we cannot have such without adverting to technicalities and complications in the very way the Bill is presented.  Surely that makes my case, apart from anything else, that these Bills are unnecessarily complicated in their presentation.</P>
    <P>I have made that point generally in certain other ways.  I am concerned about it not only from the simplistic point of view but also with the experiences we had on the last Schedule of the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  I am afraid that this complication could <Col N="2136" /> lead to unforeseen and unexpected interpretations.  If the Minister thinks I am exaggerating, the Minister for Finance, when he was on paragraph (3) of the last Schedule of the last Act, immediately took more than one point.  We had strong argument on them; there were differences of agreement but he said, at the end, he would re-examine it, and we expect there will be a drafting change in that Schedule coming from the Minister on Report Stage.  All that arose out of the type of situation about which I am talking on the definitions section.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to ask for the maximum of simplicity here.  If you must define it, then try to have the definition on all fours.  As I said, I would invoke that passage which Deputy Esmonde quoted from Halsbury, if we are going to take that approach, to say that no harm is done in putting the wider definition into all the Acts.  If there is a specific reason for narrowing the definition in the Act, then there is a well-known way of drafting it.  As it is before us, I feel that we were embarking on a course of big complications and it is not going to help the administration, the taxpayer, or the people who have to deal with the matter in everyday commerce.  It may give plenty of material for lawyers to pour over but that is not the object of the exercise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the Bill in its context I should perhaps go back to section 103 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which set up the system of so-called &ldquo;fines-on-the-spot&rdquo;.  Under this a person to whom a notice is given alleging that he committed a specified Road Traffic Act offence may pay a stated penalty in lieu of standing prosecution for the offence.  The offences to which the system applies are prescribed by regulations made by the <Col N="2137" /> Minister for Local Government. These regulations confine the system to parking offences.</P>
    <P>Under the 1961 Act members of the Garda issued the parking &ldquo;tickets&rdquo;.  However, with the continuing growth in traffic and the corresponding increase in traffic offences, it became clear that the work would make too great an inroad into Garda time.  Indeed, it is wasteful to use trained police on this kind of work. Accordingly, section 64 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, enabled the Commissioner of the Garda to appoint &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; to issue the &ldquo;tickets&rdquo;.  These men came to be known as traffic wardens.</P>
    <P>At first the Garda authorities themselves operated the system of traffic wardens, but as its operation extended, particularly in Dublin following the introduction of parking meters, it became more apparent that the control and direction of the wardens and the administration generally of the system of parking tickets was absorbing a disproportionate amount of the time and resources of the Garda. Accordingly, the Garda Commissioner came to an arrangement with Dublin Corporation whereby, on a basis agreed with him, they recruited and supervised the traffic wardens and assisted the Garda in administering the collection of payments on the parking &ldquo;tickets&rdquo;, the Commissioner giving his covering appointment to the persons employed. Nearly 40 wardens are now employed in Dublin.  Wardens are similarly employed by Cork Corporation and directly by the Commissioner in Limerick, Tralee, Killarney and Athlone.  While the present informal arrangements in Dublin work reasonably well, it is desirable to regularise them and to give the full operation of the service to the local authorities and to enable other local authorities to operate it also if they think fit.  This would be in line with a recommendation of the Conroy Commission.  It is also in line with my general policy to devolve the powers and responsibility of local authorities.  It will encourage them to take an overall practical view of the traffic and parking <Col N="2138" /> problems in their areas, not merely from the aspect of road construction. I may say that the previous Government had approved of proposals for legislation generally in line with those now before the House.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, a local authority may decide to establish a service of traffic wardens in their areas.  This could be on a standing basis, or in the case of a smaller town with seasonal problems, on a seasonal basis.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding, the local authority would have to consult the Garda Síochána, who would give them the benefit of their advice.  The local authority would then take their decision, subject to the normal controls on pay and conditions of service operated by my Department in relation to local authority employees generally.</P>
    <P>The wardens would be confined to administering parking tickets and checking the display of tax discs.  Giving them this latter function should help in the enforcement of motor taxation, the proceeds of which go largely to the local authorities for road works.  I shall have something more to say on this.</P>
    <P>As to finance, the payments by the recipients of &ldquo;tickets&rdquo; will be made to the local authority concerned and, in so far as they exceed the cost of the wardens, will be retained by the local authority in accordance with regulations to be made by the Minister. The intention is that the regulations would require such sums to be used for roads and traffic purposes.  If the cost of the wardens exceeded the payments received, the local rates would meet the difference, but there is provision for possible recoupment by the Minister.  I should say that I would not envisage recoupment save in very exceptional cases, as I would regard the warden service as basically a local service.</P>
    <P>It may not be feasible for particular local authorities to operate a warden service, and so the Garda Commissioner is still left with the power under the 1968 Road Traffic Act to engage wardens.  And of course the gardaí themselves will continue in all places to have the power to dispense &ldquo;tickets&rdquo; for parking offences and <Col N="2139" /> will continue to enforce motor taxation. On this, I may say I am concerned at what I believe to be widespread evasion of motor taxation.  The matter has been taken up with the Garda Commissioner and I am glad to say that I expect that, despite the very heavy demands on the Force at present, a considerable increase in enforcement will shortly evince itself. I am sure I have the support of all members of the House in appealing to the public to meet their responsibilities in regard to motor taxation.  Not alone is the tax essential if the road system is to be properly maintained but it also provides a valuable source of employment throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Nobody of course likes taxation, nor does anybody like controls on traffic and parking, or penalties, but the growth in traffic and the inevitable gap between demands on the road system and the capacity available mean that parking facilities must be rationed, and rationing must be enforced if it is to be effective.  The Bill should therefore be seen as a useful addition to the powers of local authorities to enable them to operate the road system more efficiently in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Before speaking on this Bill, I should like to protest against the refusal of the Government to continue with the Committee Stage of the Planning Bill.  I cannot understand why this Bill was so urgent that it should be brought before the House at this stage while the Minister was dealing with a Bill which was of considerable public importance.  I can only conclude that neither the Government nor the Minister wish the Minister's powers regarding planning appeals to be transferred to the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that this Bill was of such urgency that we could not utilise any time available to the House to continue with the Planning Bill.  I queried this matter on Wednesday morning last when I received a copy of the Bill.  I was informed by the Minister that it was a simple Bill and would take up very little time.  At that time I had not read it and, therefore, I did not know what its provisions were.</P>
      <P>Having studied the Bill it would appear to me to be much more complex than either the explanatory memorandum or the Minister's speech would give us to understand.  It is a Bill which needs careful consideration because it appears&mdash;and I am open to contradiction on this&mdash;to make available to the Minister very wide powers to make regulation to extend the authority of traffic wardens. I would refer particularly to section 3 (1).  If my interpretation of what it contains is correct it would enable the Minister to widen the powers of the wardens to such an extent as almost to create another police force which apparently would not be under the control of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  I would have thought also that where there was provision for the widening&mdash;it seems to me very considerably&mdash;of the powers of the traffic wardens that reference would be made in the Bill to recruitment standards, to training, to educational standards and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real objection lies in the fact that not only do we not know what powers the Minister would transfer to the wardens but the Bill appears to give him unlimited powers to prescribe by regulation any offence under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973.  In that respect it would appear that the explanatory memorandum does not give the information to which we are entitled.  If we were to take the explanatory <Col N="2141" /> memorandum on its face value certainly we could then describe the Bill as the Minister has described it as a relatively simple measure.  That is not the case and I would have thought that we would have been given more detailed information as to what, in fact, is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with section 3, subsection (1), the content of which is my main objection, I will comment on some other aspects.  The powers to appoint traffic wardens was conferred on county councils and on borough corporations, urban councils and commissioners of towns by section 96 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 for particular purposes and this power could only be exercised with the consent of the Garda Commissioner.  The control of traffic is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and he may make bye-laws, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government, and bye-laws have been made in certain areas.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has already stated and so far as I could ascertain, the traffic warden service at the moment is in operation only in Dublin where the Minister says there are approximately 40 wardens.  In Limerick, Killarney, Athlone there are full-time wardens and in Tralee there are part-time wardens. At present, I think I am correct in saying, where a local authority wish to appoint a warden they can apply to the Department of Justice and to the Department of Local Government for permission and when permission is granted the local authority advertise the post or posts in the national Press. The local authority interview the applicants and submit the names of suitable applicants to the Commissioner, who appoints them.  This situation will not continue under the terms of this Bill. It would appear that there are some fundamental changes here made in respect of the appointment of wardens.  We should be concerned about this, particularly when we advert to the fact that the powers the Minister will have will be quite considerable.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me from reading the Bill that traffic wardens will continue to be selected by the local authority but the local authority will also appoint them and the Garda <Col N="2142" /> Commissioner will no longer have any say in their appointment and therefore cannot ensure that the people appointed are suitable for the work they have to perform.  This might not be a matter of any great consequence or importance if the warden's duties were to be confined to relatively simple matters but where there is a danger that the warden may ultimately take over a relatively wide range of police duties it is quite another matter.  This could happen if the Bill is passed in its present form.</P>
    <P>The proposed method of appointment as envisaged in the Bill is that the local authority will consult with the Commissioner with regard to the traffic warden scheme.  The operative word here is &ldquo;consult&rdquo;.  While they may be compelled by the terms of the Bill to consult with the Commissioner, they may not necessarily take his advice.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if there would in future be consultation between the Commissioner and the local authority in relation to individual appointments.  It would appear to me that this will not be the case.  Then, even though the Minister could transfer quite a considerable number of police duties to the wardens, the Commissioner would have no say in their appointment.  The body to be set up and which may be given wide powers by the Minister in matters relating to offences under the Road Traffic Acts will not be under the control of the Commissioner or of the Minister for Justice although they will be carrying out what might be considered to be police duties.  Generally speaking, where police duties are involved or duties which have been carried out by the police, the Commissioner should still have some power in relation to the appointment of wardens.</P>
    <P>The section which disturbs me is section 3, subsection (1) of the Bill.  I quote the section:</P>
    <P>This section applies to such of the following offences as may be declared by the Minister by regulations made after consultation with the Minister for Justice, to be offences to which this section applies, namely, any offence under the <Col N="2143" /> Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973 and the offence under regulations made under the Roads Act, 1920, of not attaching to and carrying on a vehicle in the manner prescribed by those regulations a licence in respect of the vehicle issued under that Act.</P>
    <P>I am mainly concerned with the first part of this subsection.  This subsection would empower the Minister to hand over to the local authority and through them to the traffic wardens all the powers at present confined to the Garda Síochána in respect of offences under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973.  I feel that this right which the Minister will have if this Bill is passed as it now stands is much too wide.  It would be worth while enumerating some of the offences which could be delegated by the Minister to traffic wardens.</P>
    <P>Some of the matters which are offences under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973, are dangerous driving causing death or serious injury, drunken driving and offences relating to the breathalyser, insurance offences, careless driving, using a motor car without the consent of its owner, and any offence under the Larceny Act in which a motor car is used.  Some of these, of course, are indictable offences, incurring heavy penalties and even jail sentences.</P>
    <P>When I studied this Bill I came to appreciate the wide-ranging powers the Minister appeared to be seeking and I was concerned on this account. I have no doubt that many other people will be concerned, too.  I know that the Minister in his reply may state that he had no intention of including by regulation any of the offences I have outlined but the fact remains that once he has the power conferred on him to make regulations he, or any of his successors, could include any of the offences by regulation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister decided to bring in all the offences by regulation, as he would be entitled to do, if the Bill becomes law as it stands, traffic wardens would then be empowered by other sections and subsections to act <Col N="2144" /> in respect of cases of dangerous driving.  I should like to know who decides whether driving in a certain manner is dangerous driving.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with this Bill as I see it.  I am dealing with the provisions as I see them, and if the Minister, when he is replying, can show me that the course I am going on is completely out of line, he is at liberty to do so. I am dealing with the Bill as it stands, not with what the Minister may have had in mind.  Section 3, subsection (1) says that:</P>
      <P>This section applies to such of the following offences as may be declared by the Minister by regulations made after consultation with the Minister for Justice, to be offences to which this section applies, namely, any offence under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973...</P>
      <P>As I see it, that means that the Minister could, by regulation, transfer the power to deal with these offences to the traffic wardens.  If that is not what the Minister had in mind, I am sure he will bring in an amendment to that subsection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not sufficient that the Minister should simply say to me that I am misinterpreting this.  What he must ensure is that the subsection is not capable of misinterpretation.

    <P>I hope the Minister will take another look at it.  I must admit that when I read that subsection I was disturbed and I am sure other people will be concerned also.  Therefore, it would be wise to ensure that the subsection clearly indicated what the Minister had in mind and not have us discussing a situation whereby the Minister could, by regulation, prescribe any offence under the Road Traffic Acts between 1961 and 1973, if that is not his intention. <Col N="2146" /> I will not proceed any further with that particular aspect except to say that if my interpretation is the correct one&mdash;I am sure the Minister will get legal advice on it when he is aware there are other interpretations&mdash; then there is no question about the fact that it could lead to a very dangerous situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the second part of subsection (1).  In sections 2 and section 3 of the Bill there is specific mention, as the Minister has said, to an offence under regulations made under the Road Act, 1920, that is the offence of not attaching to and carrying on a vehicle in the manner prescribed by the regulations a licence in respect of a vehicle issued under the Act.  That particular wording is satisfactory.  It makes us fully aware of what is involved in relation to the 1920 Act and we can clearly assess its merit.  I have no objection to it.  I agree that this is a task which might suitably be carried out by traffic wardens but, as I said earlier, I have a decided objection to handing over to the Minister or to any other Minister power, the effects of which would be impossible to calculate.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has any other type of offence in mind, I see no reason why he would not include the other offences to be transferred by regulation in the same manner as has been done in relation to the tax discs offence and then we would clearly know what he had in mind and could discuss it accordingly.  I take it from what he has already said that he does not propose to transfer any other duties to the traffic wardens than the ones he has mentioned, that is parking offences and tax discs offences.  Therefore, I would appeal to him to look at this subsection again to ensure that it fulfils the function he has in mind and nothing else.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with a few other aspects of this Bill.  At present when a traffic warden affixes a notice to a car the person committing the parking offence is given a number of days to pay the fine and, pending the completion of the time allowed, no prosecution takes place.  I note that the same provision is in this Bill.  At <Col N="2147" /> present the traffic warden operates from a Garda station and when he hands in his book to the station the Garda sergeant usually sends a note to the person involved reminding him of the position regarding the payment of the fine.  I understand it is usually at that stage that the fine is paid.  This is a fair system because it is possible, for example, for children to tear off the notice which is affixed to the car or for the notice to be blown away and the owner of the car may not be aware that there was a notice on the car and that he has committed an offence.  Therefore, were it not for this note that is sent to him by the Garda sergeant he would be unaware that he had committed an offence until a summons arrived.  I understand that it is not obligatory on the sergeant to do this but that the practice is that it is done.  Under the new system I suggest that where the local authority are dealing with the matter they would likewise send a notice to the person concerned.  It is only fair that should be done.</P>
    <P>The Bill also refers to the fact that different amounts can be prescribed in respect of different offences.  I think the Minister will prescribe the amounts but I am not too sure of that. I would take it that it will not be left to the various authorities to decide on what the particular penalties ought to be?  If that were so we could have a very wide variation in relation to the penalties imposed.  This causes quite a considerable amount of dissatisfaction as we are only too well aware in relation to the fines imposed for traffic offences in different courts in different parts of the country, which can be very different from one another.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also let me know why it has not been possible to indicate these penalties in the Bill.  I know there is a reference made to penalties but I think that refers to other matters.  I understand that at present where the local authority have a traffic warden scheme in operation the fines are collected and are sent to a central fund.  The wardens are paid by the local authority and <Col N="2148" /> the local authority can reclaim the money from the Department of Justice who recoup it from the Department of Local Government.  I would like to know who will pay for the scheme under this Bill.  The Minister stated that while he has authority to make certain subventions he will not be all that anxious to do it and some of it may fall on the rates.  I do not think that this should happen.  Do we take it that the fines collected will be used for the purpose of paying the wardens?  I am assuming that up to the present the local authority have been fully reimbursed by the Department in regard to the moneys expended by them on the traffic wardens. If that is so I do not see why there should be a change made now in relation to this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>If it is intended, as it would appear to me to be, that the scheme would pay for itself then that could be open to certain abuse.  We could have a situation where the city or county manager would call on the wardens and advise them that they wanted them to be more strict and in effect, collect more money.  What we should concern ourselves with here is that on-the-spot fines or fines of any kind in relation to traffic infringement should not be for the purpose of collecting money.  It is very important to ensure good traffic control.  There should be an opportunity to exercise cautionary control; in other words, the traffic warden should be in a position to give a warning.  Sometimes we can be over-zealous in the operation of this particular scheme.</P>
    <P>We certainly would be in danger of such if it were intended that the income from on-the-spot fines would pay for the whole system or if the cost should come from the rates. Quite obviously, if it were to be charged on the rates, it would be more than likely that traffic wardens would be advised to get in as much money as possible.  My feeling is that the system should be operated to ensure good traffic control with the least possible harassment of the motorist.  At present the motorist is harassed to quite a considerable extent in many ways.  We should concern <Col N="2149" /> ourselves more with endeavouring to ensure proper traffic control while, at the same time, having a reasonable approach to it.</P>
    <P>A further matter which arises in relation to this Bill is the administration of the warden service.  I know the local authority will administer it generally but in relation, for example, to prosecutions, what will be the position?  Local authority legal personnel have far too much work to do as it is.  We are all well aware of the many complaints about the length of time it takes the various councils to deal with legal matters, and this refers to housing and so on.  At the present time many local authorities are engaging outside solicitors to help cope with council legal matters.  Unless the Minister has some way in which he hopes to deal with this particular aspect this burden will be added to the heavy load already being carried and, if it is, we will face difficulties in the future.</P>
    <P>The law officer would appear to be the obvious person to deal with prosecutions under this Bill but, if the Minister does not propose to sanction a considerable amount of help, then the whole working of the Bill could be frustrated and the system could break down.  I wonder if the Minister proposes to set up a special section under each local authority to deal with this matter and whether he proposes they should be entitled to employ more legal experts.  The Minister may not intend existing council law officers to deal with these prosecutions. If this is so, perhaps he would let us know who would take evidence, who would prosecute, who would make available the book of evidence and so on.</P>
    <P>It does not appear to me, from reading the Bill, that there is an obligation on a traffic warden to be in uniform.  The traffic warden is not obliged to identify himself unless he is requested to do so by a person who allegedly commits a crime.  Therefore, in such circumstances, the local authorities could bring a prosecution for obstruction of a traffic warden who was not in uniform and who did not identify himself and the person concerned <Col N="2150" /> may not know that he could require the traffic warden to identify himself.  Similarly, in relation to another subsection of section 4, a traffic warden who is not in uniform and who has not identified himself may demand the name and address of any person when he has reason to believe that person has committed an offence. This subsection gives the warden the right to demand the name and address of the person he suspects of being guilty of dangerous driving, for example. If a regulation is made in relation to this offence, in my reading&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>On my reading of the Bill he is apparently entitled to march on to the scene of an accident and ask for a person's name and address.  If the Minister is convinced that my approach to the Bill is wrong and, if he can explain exactly what is meant by the first part of section 3 subsection (1), I will consider what he has to say about it.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister, in his reply, would also let us know if he has consulted with the Garda Commissioners and the local authorities before bringing in this Bill and if he had any advice or recommendations from them in relation to it.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister how he proposes to proceed with recruitment to the traffic warden service from now on.  Even if we accept his interpretation of the Bill, he is giving the wardens more power and authority. I am informed that traffic wardens are given only one week's training.  I think the Minister will agree that one week's training is inadequate for any job and especially when the person concerned has to deal with the public. Apart from any other consideration, a week's training gives no standing to the person so trained, and in a job where there is constant contact between the individual and the public generally&mdash;this contact is not of a very pleasant nature, through no fault of the traffic wardens&mdash;it is essential that there should be much more thought given to the training of traffic wardens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2151" /> The traffic warden, because of the nature of his duties, has a very difficult task to perform and he should get proper training.  If he got proper training we would have fewer problems in relation to the work he does. It would not be necessary in those circumstances as it, unfortunately, appears to be necessary, now, to insert a subsection in the Bill in which a penalty is laid down for abuse of or attacking a traffic warden.</P>
    <P>We know that the Garda, for example, have a very much longer training period.  Even when the Garda had to deal with this type of offence, people did not hold it against them, as they appear to do in relation to the traffic wardens.  It is possibly because of the extra training that the Garda have in how to deal with the public. It is unfair to the traffic wardens not to give them this training which, as I said, is very essential for the type of work they are doing and which would make the work more pleasant for themselves and the effects more pleasant for the public, in general.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would inform us what the educational standards are at present for entrance to this job.  If there are no qualifications laid down, I suggest that he should consider this matter and decide that, at least, a certain level of educational qualification is necessary.  If we are to adopt the suggestion I have made in relation to a much longer training period for traffic wardens it is essential that we have, at least, minimum educational standards laid down.</P>
    <P>If the offences under the Traffic Acts, which the Minister has in mind, are relatively minor ones&mdash;he has stated they are&mdash;then we would be satisfied if we had a properly trained corps of traffic wardens.  It is necessary to know in advance what offences are to be delegated by the Minister.  He has stated that the offences are confined to parking and to dealing with tax discs on cars.  I want to point out again that my interpretation of the Bill is quite different.  I would have to be satisfied that my interpretation is not correct before I could accept the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is the bone of contention which is between us.  It is not just my own <Col N="2152" /> opinion.  It is the opinion of others who deal in legal matters.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to take another look at that section, which is disturbing me, and to have it amended to ensure there will be no doubt as to what the Minister has in mind with regard to the offences he proposes to delegate to the traffic wardens.  As I said if the matters to be dealt with are relatively minor matters then I would be satisfied with a properly trained corps of traffic wardens but, of course, if the offences prescribed were those which I have in mind, which would be possible under this Bill, we would have to reconsider the whole situation.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this Bill which are satisfactory and which we could accept but, as I said at the outset, I am still perturbed about section 3 (1).  The fact that I am perturbed about it overshadows in my mind, the good aspects that are in the Bill itself.  Most of my speech might have appeared to consist of adverse criticism.  This was not intentional.  I simply wanted to ensure that another look is taken at this subsection so that there will be no doubt about the fact that the Minister will not have the power through this Bill to give further powers under the Traffic Acts, 1961-73, to traffic wardens.  I am in favour of a properly trained corps of traffic wardens.  A very large proportion of the accidents which occur occur in the vicinity of vehicles which are parked in a dangerous manner, in a prohibited area or in areas where common sense would tell the driver he should not park.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we could reach agreement in relation to the parts of the Bill I am perturbed about, it could perform a useful function.  Anything which helps to reduce the shocking death toll on our roads would be very welcome to us.  I hope the Minister, in his reply, will help to dispel any doubts I may have and, if necessary, be prepared suitably to amend the Bill.  Why is this Bill called the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Bill when it appears to relate to Road Traffic Acts?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole thing. The whole point the Deputy is missing is that it does not relate to Road <Col N="2153" /> Traffic Acts except for one thing.  I think Deputy Faulkner will agree with me when I explain it to him later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will also agree that the reference all through the Bill is to Road Traffic Acts.  However, I ask the Minister to ensure that section 3 (1) is amended if there is any possible danger that it can be interpreted as I have interpreted it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Any effort or legislation brought in for better traffic management must be welcomed, particularly in the densely populated urban areas.  I am a member of the local authority for Dublin and this responsibility will be passed over to them to operate.  A lot of time is taken up by gardaí going to court to deal with very petty offences. I hope this Bill will eliminate a lot of the time taken up on these very minor offences where people opt to go to court.  When people who opt to go to court are convicted of one of these minor traffic offences the fines should be quite substantial because of the amount of time taken up with this exercise.</P>
      <P>The whole aspect of the traffic warden service, the training and may be the retraining of existing staff will have to be looked at.  More staff are required in the Dublin area to ensure that these offences are checked.  We realise the amount of illegal parking that goes on which causes a fair amount of chaos and slows down the movement of traffic.  When traffic wardens come under the local authorities they will be able to plan and will be able to control traffic to a far greater degree than they have been able to do to date.  A lot of point duty work done by gardaí could be taken over by the traffic warden service.</P>

The statements by RTE about costings in this matter have to be considered under two headings, their estimates as regards the cost of an RTE second channel where they speak as representing RTE, and their observations as regards the cost of rebroadcasting BBC where they are speaking without access to relevant information and where, as I have said, their view is purely speculative.

      <P>I am prepared to consider any such suggestion, but I should like to make it clear that my suggestion which RTE have now availed themselves of was that they should put before the people, not just a committee, the arguments in favour of a second channel being allocated to them.  They are now doing that, and as far as their advocacy of an RTE second channel is concerned I welcome that.  I would somewhat deprecate their references, which are necessarily not well informed, to such matters as the cost of rebroadcasting.  I welcome them putting this before the people, including the people of the single-channel areas.  What I want to know at this stage is the reaction of the people in the single-channel areas as this proposition is put before them by RTE and explained to them.</P>
      <P>I regret Deputy Molloy who put down this question is not here for the answer.  I would like to hear from Deputy Molloy, and Deputy Lynch, whether their constituents share that party's enthusiasm for a second RTE channel as against rebroadcasting BBC or UTV.  If they do, then the argument is over.  However, the argument is really only now opening as this matter is put before them.  It is a very interesting exercise in democracy to try to get that reaction, to try to find out what the people want.  I welcome the opening out of this debate.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the houses involved are included in the board's Clifden rural area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsidised terms for connection to the electricity supply were quoted in July, 1973, to the 12 householders involved as the area was then being <Col N="2166" /> developed under the subsidised rural electrification scheme.  The terms quoted to each of the 12 applicants included a capital contribution of £56.02 and the payment of a special service charge every two months.  These terms were based on an overall cost of £9,250 for extending supply.  The terms quoted at that time were not accepted and supply was not extended. The Clifden rural area is now closed to subsidised supply and subsidised terms are no longer available.  The present estimated overall cost of extending supply is £12,000 which represents an increase of 29 per cent in costs compared with the 1973 figure and the unsubsidised terms would be based on this cost.  In closed areas, special service charge arrangements do not apply and the cost of extending supply is payable by means of a capital contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will make a statement to clarify the position regarding Eurocontrol and the Shannon centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The new Shannon centre is being established for the automated control of air traffic in the Shannon Upper Flight Information Region.  It will replace the present manually operated centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase of the new centre is expected to be available for operational service before the end of 1975.  The growth rate of future air traffic will determine when the second phase will be required.  Present indications are <Col N="2170" /> that this may be some time in the 1980's.</P>
    <P>The question of the centre being operated by Eurocontrol was under consideration for some time.  In the light of developments both in relation to operating concepts, the higher cost that would be involved and the personnel problems which were foreseen, I decided, in agreement with the Director General of Eurocontrol, that air traffic control in the Irish upper air space, including the new Shannon centre, will continue for the foreseeable future to be operated by the Irish Air Traffic Control Service on behalf of Eurocontrol.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to tell the Deputy that arrangements are in train for a formal opening of the Shannon centre by the President of the Eurocontrol Commission on 2nd July next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the air traffic control personnel in Shannon will only be acting as agents for Eurocontrol in this case?  Is it not also true that they will be acting as agents and doing the same work at lower standards of pay than if they were working for Eurocontrol as was originally intended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The control of the upper air space as it now is will be a matter for the Irish Government who will employ air traffic controllers to handle it.  There is a difference in the salary scales applicable to the Irish employees and the Eurocontrol personnel. That is true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking of two different things.  These people are working on salaries negotiated between their union and my Department. If Eurocontrol took over full-time operation of the centre these people would have to apply to Eurocontrol for positions and would operate at salaries negotiated between their union and Eurocontrol.  At present they are operating on the salaries agreed <Col N="2171" /> between their union and my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the policy of Eurocontrol to employ any particular nationalities anywhere.  They employ competent people to operate air traffic control centres and the personnel may be of any nationality and may be posted to any of the Eurocontrol stations.  Anybody in the Irish air traffic control centre who wants to work for Eurocontrol is quite free to apply to Eurocontrol.</P>

      <P>Among a number of suggestions which are under consideration by the Advisory Committee on Energy Conservation set up by me is one relating to the extension of standard time.  While the committee has not yet made a firm recommendation in this matter, I understand that the estimate of savings which would result from a prolongation of summertime throughout the full year is less than 0.08 per cent of our annual oil consumption.</P>
      <P>Of the EEC member States, only Ireland, Italy and the UK have summer time.  France has proposed that, with a view to saving energy, the other States should introduce summer time.  The proposal has not yet been discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final analysis, it is a matter for the Minister for Justice to decide on the extension of summer time.  Any recommendation which I might make to him to extend standard time, based on energy conservation considerations, would take cognisance of the EEC position.  There would, of course, be a number of other considerations to be <Col N="2176" /> taken into account before a final decision could be made.</P>

      <P>The position is as set out in the Deputy's question, and figures for total exports in February and March, 1975, were down on those for January and February respectively. On the basis of the provisional figures so far available from the Central statistics Office for the first quarter of this year it appears that this trend can be attributed largely to a slackening of exports of agricultural, chemical and petroleum products.</P>
      <P>I would, however, point out that total exports for the first three months of 1975 showed an increase of £56.3 million over those for the first three months of 1974.</P>
      <P>In addition the Deputy will no doubt have seen the provisional figures for April, published on the 16th May, which show that the downward trend in exports referred to in his question has not continued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to new jobs created in manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to make a close estimate of new job creation in industry because of the time-lag between approval of new projects and their realisation.  However, on the best information available to them, the Industrial Development Authority estimate that in the calendar year 1974, the latest period for which an estimate is available, about 16,000 new jobs were created in manufacturing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are a number of inputs in the context of rising unemployment. So far as we can estimate&mdash;this <Col N="2180" /> is from the IDA survey rather than from Central Statistics Office figures&mdash;the number of job losses was about 20,000.  Therefore, the net number of jobs losses is about 4,000.  This is a first estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not develop that point when replying to the previous supplementary.  In regard to the total number on the register, there are such factors as young persons coming on to the labour market, people leaving agriculture and downturns in the service sectors.

      <P>We are now in the sixth month of the year.  To take the situation for a twelve-month period, the predictions are for an upturn in the third quarter of 1975, becoming more marked in the last quarter of this year and in the first quarter of 1976 although the experts in this field in various parts of the world have been in conflict with each other.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The term as used is &ldquo;new job creation&rdquo;.  The point the Deputy is making is important because there is a time lag between the creation of new jobs in terms of the agreement for an investment in an enterprise and the recruitment of staff which usually takes place in a phased way over a fairly long period of time.

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a point about the Tallaght area. Since people travel either a short distance or dozens of miles in some parts to get to work, statistics are not prepared in Dublin for particular sectors. There may be a short-fall in one area while there are employment opportunities in another area.  I tried to say something specifically about the Tallaght area since that was the Deputy's second question.  There is the industry to which I referred which will have some male employment but, with a city like Dublin, it is very difficult to break down sector by sector both the labour availability and the job availability.

Now we have the attack of unemployment which is just as severe in Dublin as in other parts of the country.  The Deputy has mentioned the figure of one in four new jobs.  There are three million people in the country and there are approximately 750,000 in the Dublin conurbation and that seems about <i>pro rata.</i> In the past, and when I came into office, we had a specific policy of trying to direct industry away from Dublin but in the present circumstances we are happy to promote Dublin as hard as other areas because unemployment is biting here as well as in other parts.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy really suggesting that nobody is being taken on in a new job anywhere in Dublin at the moment?  The job losses are exceeding the new recruitment and that is a regrettable fact but recruitment is going on for new jobs all over Dublin.  I agree it is not enough but certainly it is happening.</P>

I do not know of any place in Dublin where people are being recruited and, therefore, I have difficulty in interpreting what the Minister is saying.  If he tells me he knows that workers are being recruited in Finglas and Cabra I can go to those areas and find out if that is the true position.  I should like him to tell me where people are being recruited for employment because I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the position in the firm which I presume the Deputy has in mind.  I understand that there has been a continuing fall-off in sales resulting in substantial losses which has led the firm to take a decision to go into voluntary liquidation.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the serious loss of employment involved in the closure of this factory and the earlier closure of a subsidiary factory in Carrickmacross.  I understand that proposals have been made to recommence the manufacture of footwear in Carrickmacross on a reduced scale. These proposals are being examined by the appropriate State agencies.  I have, also, impressed on the IDA the necessity of securing some alternative sources of employment for the area. I understand that the authority have plans to provide an advance factory in Carrickmacross.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the footwear industry, in common with certain other sectors of industry, has been experiencing difficulties for some time because of the general recession in trade on home and foreign markets and the growth in imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2186" /> I have indicated on a number of occasions the action which was being taken with a view to helping the textile, clothing and footwear industries.

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out before progress was reported, the very fact that the discussion was of the nature into which it developed was in itself a plea for consistency and simplicity <Col N="2195" /> in regard to these three Bills. We are defining the very same words and phrases in these Bills, which follow the one White Paper and which are related to capital and the taxation of capital.  They are going through the House at the same time and I do not think it is too much to ask why there are differences and to suggest that in the interests of simplicity the matter should be reexamined.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a point now on subsection (3) which is essentially the same point I made on the preceding two subsections.  First of all, the word &ldquo;indicated&rdquo; is used.  It is used in all three Bills to relate them to other enactments but in this Wealth Tax Bill it is in a somewhat different form from the other two measures.  In the Capital Gains Tax Bill the reference is section 2 (6): &ldquo;References in this Act to any enactment shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be construed as references to that enactment as amended or extended by any subsequent enactment.&rdquo;.  It is precisely the same in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill but in this Bill it is: &ldquo;A reference to any other enactment shall, except so far as the context otherwise requires, be construed as a reference to that enactment as amended by or under any other enactment, including this Act&rdquo;.  There is a difference of meaning.  Is there any particular reason why this variation should be there?  I have been quoting subsection (3) paragraph (c).  There is a similar but yet somewhat different provision in the other two Bills dealing with the same matter.  This is confusing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the import of the word &ldquo;indicated&rdquo;?  It occurs in the interpretation section of the Capital Gains Tax Bill, subsection (7), and in the Capital Acquisitions Bill, section 2 (6) and, in this Bill, it occurs in section 1 (3), paragraphs (a) and (b).  What is the meaning of &ldquo;indicated&rdquo; here? Deputy Esmonde might be able to help me here.  Is it to be taken in the general meaning or is it now to be taken in the technical term?  I have not attempted to follow up the word <Col N="2196" />&ldquo;property&rdquo; and some of the other words today.  I do not want to pursue the purely legalistic line.  It states here that a reference to a section is to a section of this Act unless it is indicated that a reference to some other enactment is intended.  That is the phrase at (a).  What precisely is the force and effect of the word &ldquo;indicated&rdquo; in a statute?  That should be looked at in relation to this Bill and also as far as the other two Bills are concerned.  I do not know if this is simply a general word to be taken in its general meaning or if it has been used in the statutes before and has become a technical term or has even been interpreted as such.</P>

It could possibly be conducive to litigation, which is always costly to the parties involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Cavan):</i> Before we adjourned I was trying to bring home to the House that we are dealing here with definitions for the purpose of this Bill only.  We are now dealing with the Committee Stage of the Wealth Tax Bill, 1975.  Deputy de Valera insists on going forward to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, which has only had a Second Reading, and compares what is in this Bill with what is in that Bill.  Unless he can convince me that <Col N="2197" /> what is in this Bill is inadequate for the purposes of it I do not think he is being reasonable.  He thinks it desirable to synchronise the definitions in both Bills.  I do not think he can do that because they are two different Bills dealing with different matters. Unless he is convinced that what is in this Bill is not sufficient or is inadequate he should pass from this Bill and put forward the amendments to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, when it comes to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>There is no point in comparing definitions in this Bill with those in another Bill, which may or may not be amended at a later stage.  It is valid to say that we are not concerned with definitions, drafting or terminology of other Bills, some of which have not yet been passed.  If we do that where will it all end?  Why not go back to the Income Tax Acts, the Death Duty Acts?  In the field of property and succession we could spend a very interesting week dealing with the Succession Act, 1965 and it would be every bit as relevant as the one Deputy de Valera is dealing with now.  I want to be reasonable, and I do not want to give the impression that I am not prepared to listen or that I am not prepared to talk.  If it is any way helpful, having taken the stand I have taken and which I intend to continue to take, because I believe it is reasonable in regard to a comparison of the two Bills, and if it throws any light on the problems which Deputy de Valera has, I will give him some comparisons and some reasons which I hope will demonstrate to him why there is a difference in terminology between the two Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to &ldquo;discretionary trust&rdquo; the first seven lines are identical with the definition in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill except that the word &ldquo;disposition&rdquo; is used instead of &ldquo;trust&rdquo; in the first line.  Disposition is then defined in three lines in this Bill. Disposition in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill involves up to 40 lines instead of the three lines in this Bill.  That is because the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill is concerned with property passing on death or <i>inter vivos.</i> The word &ldquo;disposition&rdquo; is intended to embrace <Col N="2198" /> all possible means by which property can pass.  A full and detailed definition of the word &ldquo;disposition&rdquo; was therefore a <i>sine qua non</i> in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, hence the necessity to spell out every conceivable manner by which property might pass.</P>
    <P>I said that this morning in different language.  I said that in this Bill we are dealing with ownership on a specific date, the 5th April in any year and that in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill we are dealing with a change of ownership.  That is why the emphasis in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill must be on the change of ownership whereas in this Bill the emphasis must be on the ownership in possession on a given date.  No such necessity arises in the Wealth Tax Bill.  A detailed definition of &ldquo;disposition&rdquo; is unnecessary and would be superfluous.  It is not advisable to insert in any statute superfluous language or superfluous matter.</P>
    <P>That is the point Deputy de Valera has been making all morning, that we should simplify things and cut out a lot of unnecessary verbiage.  In &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo; there is no substantial difference between the definitions except that in the wealth tax &ldquo;interest in expectancy&rdquo; is made part of the definition.  The major difference between the two definitions arises in the addition of subparagraph (2) in the wealth tax.  This is for the purpose of anti-avoidance in the wealth tax and is not relevant in the capital acquisitions tax.</P>
    <P>A minor difference is that in capital acquisitions tax interest in expectancy is stated to include every other future interest, whether vested or contingent. This is not considered necessary in the wealth tax.  Capital acquisitions tax is concerned with all interest whether in possession or future interest because dealings with either could give rise to a charge for tax.  No doubt that was one of the reasons why separate treatment was given to the interest in expectancy. On the other hand wealth tax is only concerned with the present right to the enjoyment of the property. I have spelt that out in detail but I have been expressing repeatedly this morning the same view.  I ask the <Col N="2199" /> Deputy to accept that while it is reasonable to associate these three Bills with each other because they were introduced at the same time there is a different principle involved in each Bill and a different emphasis.  Different machinery is necessary in order to attain the object of each Bill.  I cannot put it clearer than that.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that statement, and I thank him for his courtesy and the trouble he has taken.  I regret I have put the Minister and his officials to that trouble.  I do not intend to pursue this matter further; my argument is on the record.  Some points I made may be worth nothing and may call for a rethink in some way or another.  I should like to assure the Minister that we have no intention of trying to make a red herring of the other two Bills but one has to refer to the state of legislation in certain cases.  I do not accept the view of the Minister that we should not go outside the terms of this Bill in reference.  To push that to its logical conclusion would mean that we could not refer to any other Act.</P>
      <P>I shall try to co-operate as much as I can in this regard.  My intention was to indicate the dangers and the complexity of this section.  It may be a material matter in such common things as market value.  The definition sections of these Bills left the situation rather confused.

Therefore, both are, on the face of it, liable to tax, but it is provided that only one person can be taxed at the same time for the same property.  In this regard I should like to refer the Deputy to section 21 (2) which states:</P>

Perhaps it might be simpler if we took an example of somebody who is in possession, a tenant on foot of a 21-year lease.  Under this he is liable to wealth tax on that, other things being equal, and his lessor or his landlord who is entitled to the reversion is also liable to wealth tax on his interest in the reversion.  Is it not possible to argue that under section 21 (2) the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; as used there in the case of the lessee means one thing and in the case of the lessor, another thing, that there are two separate properties involved, and if that is so, section 21 (2) does not save the position.</P>

The outrageous thing would be if there was any danger of the same property being taxed twice in respect of the same date and it is absolutely clear that that cannot happen.  The best way I have of illustrating this is that if there are these two people, A and B, and A pays, the Revenue cannot follow B and if B pays, the Revenue cannot follow A, and if neither pays, the Revenue can follow one but cannot follow the other.</P>

I suggest for the Minister's consideration that in a case like this where there are alternatives for the Revenue to go for and nothing is laid down to indicate which they should go for in order to achieve some degree of certainty, it would be better to provide that either A or B is the one the Revenue will go for and if they cannot or do not recover from A, they can go for B.  I am unhappy about the situation in which they can go for either and neither knows which will be liable.</P>

It is all very well for the Minister to say that if one pays, that is it, but if they are not connected persons&mdash;for instance, Deputy Belton and myself&mdash;why should either of us choose to pay the tax when I know that the minute I pay, Deputy Belton is released of all liability and <i>vice versa</i>, so I think the likely position is that neither of us will pay, leaving it to the Revenue Commissioners, and have a fifty-fifty chance that we will not be charged.

If they have a case of a man here who executed a lease in favour of somebody resident in Liverpool or the United States, the effect of that would be, if this bit of mechanism were not written into the Act, that the man out of the jurisdiction could not be followed while at the same time the wealth of the native would be substantially reduced.  In that particular case, the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="2205" /> would obviously follow the man at home who divested himself of the property in favour of the absentee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that, but I would think it would be worth the while of the Minister and his advisers to give a little more consideration to this.  It may be possible to have a method whereby you could value the whole interest, whatever the valuation of it may be, including the interest of the lessor and the lessee, or the A and B we have been talking about, and to provide that in the event of one of the persons concerned being resident outside the State, the person resident in the State is liable. There are refinements possible in this, but I have the feeling that the Minister agrees with me that the position as it stands at least requires a good deal of explanation, and I should imagine that he would hardly be happy if the situation were that two genuine taxpayers, not talking of an avoidance situation, are liable and there is no way to determine which one should pay.  I am sure that it is possible to devise machinery which would give a degree of certainty in that case which I think is desirable.</P>

When they go for it they will value only the property of the person they go for, not the two interests together as one interest as an apportionment. There is no provision for that.  The provision is to value the interest of the taxpayer who is sought to be charged rather than the two interests together as one.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I believe that unless we have dual possession here with the right of the Revenue Commissioners to elect, avoidance is utterly impossible to prevent. Take a block of property valued at £150,000 owned by a married man. The deciding factor as to wealth tax will be, is he in possession of all that on the 5th April in any year?  If we did not do what we are doing here, this man who owns the £150,000 could make a short lease of £60,000 worth of property to somebody in the United States at a rent which the man in the United States might never pay, but then the wealth of the person here in this country would be only £90,000, and he walks out of the net.  In that case the Revenue Commissioners would clearly elect to recover from the lessor; that is the case where he is out of the country.  Deputy Colley may say: why not make provision that if the lessee is a non-resident, you follow <Col N="2208" /> the lessor, but in every other case you do not?  Then the tax payer properly advised would lease his £60,000 worth of property to some poor relative, to a brother of his or somebody else in the country, and you get the same thing over again.</P>
      <P>If the Revenue Commissioners are left to their own devices, they will recover from the lessor, but if this was a genuine case of a lease to somebody, say to a prosperous solicitor who was paying a rent, the Revenue Commissioners would say: &ldquo;This is a genuine transaction.  The reasonable thing to do here is to ask the solicitor to pay.&rdquo; I think that is the way it will work and that we should wait until we see some glaring abuses.  If we do not do this I am advised&mdash;and I accept&mdash;that it is so wide open to avoidance as to be valueless.</P>

      <P>There is something arising out of what the Minister has said that raises a doubt in my mind, and perhaps he could clarify this point.  Take a property that is, as the Minister says, worth £150,000 freehold. If there is a genuine lease of £60,000 worth, am I right in thinking that when the Revenue Commissioners elect between the lessor and the lessee as to which they go for, if they go for the lessee they will assess him only on the £60,000, and if they go for the lessor they will assess him on only £90,000?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2209" /> The Deputy, by his example, has given the exact situation that this clause is directed to deal with, because the person who was granted the limited interest has put himself outside the value by creating a transaction himself.

However, I gather from what the Minister said, that that is not so, and I am trying to get this clear.</P>

That transaction will be utterly ignored.  In a genuine transaction the limited interest would come into play and neither would be liable for tax in the case the Deputy and I were discussing where the £150,000 is divided as to £60,000 here and £90,000 there.

Exactly similar wording was used in the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  I raised this with the Minister for Finance and we <Col N="2216" /> had some discussion on the matter.  I then referred to it again.  I want to quote this.  It is reported in the Official Report for Wednesday, 5th March&mdash;column 1519.  I was at that time speaking on the Second Stage of the Wealth Tax Bill and I said:</P>
    <P>I note also that, as in the Capital Gains Tax Bill, in this Bill the term &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; is not defined.  I should like to remind the Minister that, in connection with this phrase in the Capital Gains Tax Bill, as a result of certain exchanges which took place between the Minister and myself, he undertook to let me have, not in the House but privately, details on which he based the claim that this phrase had been adequately defined, and that I have not yet heard from him.  I am not faulting him for that.  I am just reminding him that that is so.  I would appreciate getting that information as soon as possible in relation both to this Bill and the Capital Gains Tax Bill.</P>
    <P>That was on 5th March last when I was reminding the Minister of his undertaking earlier to give me privately&mdash;he gave reasons why he did not wish to do so publicly&mdash;the basis on which he argued that the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; have been adequately defined.  I have not received the information and we are now dealing with the Committee Stage of the Wealth Tax Bill.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will appreciate my difficulty.  This question arose on the Committee Stage of the Capital Gains Tax Bill. On the Second Stage of this Bill I reminded the Minister of my request for the information but now that we are at the relevant part of the Wealth Tax Bill, my hands are tied in the absence of this information.  Therefore, I must continue the argument I was making.  All the information I can get from people who are very well <Col N="2217" /> qualified in this field is to the effect that the phrase &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; is not defined, that certainly, it is not defined with any degree of precision although it has a very considerable importance in the operation of the Wealth Tax Bill.  We are told here that the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act but there is nothing in the income tax code to define the phrase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, presumably what is intended to be conveyed is that the phrase has the same meaning as in the decided cases on the Income Tax Acts.  Even then my information is that decided cases in this regard do not define &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; with any degree of precision. Since we do not know what the phrase means, the matter is in the air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I appreciate the Deputy's point.  There is no definition of &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in the income tax code but it is equally true that it has been a relevant consideration in the income tax code since about 1910 and that that term is being used, operated and worked on in the income tax code year after year.  What we are saying in the Bill is that anybody who is ordinarily resident here for the purposes of the income tax code will be ordinarily resident here for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; has the same meaning here as in the Income Tax Acts.  The term is not defined specifically in the income tax code but from decided cases and working rules a meaning has evolved in that code.  Where a person is treated as ordinarily resident here for income tax purposes he will be so treated for the purposes of wealth tax.  &ldquo;Ordinarily resident&rdquo; is defined in section 1 generally as having the same meaning as in the income tax code.  The term is not defined in relation to income tax but as in the case of &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo;, guidance as to the meaning has been given in decisions <Col N="2218" /> of the court.  The expression &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; is used in its everyday sense and has no special or technical meaning.  It is broadly equivalent to being habitually resident.</P>
    <P>In any case, where wealth tax arises in relation to an individual the question of his residence would have to be considered for income tax purposes. Whatever decision is reached as to a person's ordinary residence for that purpose for a given income tax year ending on evaluation date will be applied also for wealth tax. Therefore, tying ordinary residence with an income tax situation will reduce the problem.  The term, as it was operated in relation to the income tax code, involves a very high percentage of the population, whereas the measure we are dealing with would involve only a very low percentage of the population.  The term in question has been used in the income tax code and has stood the test of time.  It can be relied on but it is not as important as it was because, as the Deputy knows, I will be moving an amendment to section 3.  This is amendment No. 3 which proposes:</P>
    <P>In page 5, subsection (5) (a), lines 9 to 14, to delete subparagraph (i) and to substitute the following subparagraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(i)  an individual who is not domiciled in the State on a valuation date and who has resided in the State for not less than&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  183 days in the year ending on that date, and</P>
    <P>(II)  183 days in each of six or more of the nine years immediately prior to that year,</P>
    <P>shall be deemed to be domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on that valuation date;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I understand that is broadly the test that has been operated down through the years with regard to the income tax code.  It puts the matter beyond any reasonable objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important point he has made is in regard to the amendment because, in effect, what is being said is that &ldquo;resident&rdquo; in those circumstances set out in the amendment means &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;. At least, therefore, we have something to go on.  Another part of the Minister's argument was based on the assumption that &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; has been used, interpreted and relied on in the income tax code since 1910. This is where I part company with the Minister because the information available to me is that that is not so, that while it applies to domiciled and to resident it does not apply to &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.  This is why I was pushing the Minister for Finance to produce the evidence on which he based his statement that the term is defined clearly in the income tax code and on foot of case law and otherwise. He has not done so yet.</P>
      <P>To the extent that the Minister relied on the assumption that this phrase has been defined clearly down through the years, I take issue with him.  I concede that the effect of the amendment he proposes to move takes away from the difficulties I was facing. Despite that, I would still appreciate if the information I sought earlier were given.</P>

      <P>When the information becomes available to me, I may have to come back to this point in some other way but for the moment I shall rest on the amendment the Minister proposes to move.  &ldquo;Ordinarily resident&rdquo; is defined as having</P>
      <P>the same meaning as in the Income Tax Acts and an individual who has been ordinarily resident in the State for a year ending on a valuation date shall be deemed to be ordinarily resident in the State on that valuation date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister see any conflict between that and section 3 (5), even as he proposes to amend it?  That refers to a year ending on a valuation <Col N="2220" /> date.  The amendment seeks to provide that if a person is not domiciled in the State on the valuation date but he has resided in the State for the period set out he shall be deemed to be domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on that valuation date.  Which valuation date is referred to?  I am trying to reconcile the proposed amendment with the definition of &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.  Perhaps I am making an unnecessary difficulty but I think there is a slight conflict here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>That is clear enough if we can ignore the amendment for the moment and provided we are agreed on what &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; means. The Minister referred me to the amendment and it is helpful in defining what &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; means.  Here we are dealing with a case where the person is resident on a valuation date and for a year ending on a valuation date.  We are dealing with someone other than one to whom the amendment applies.  That brings us back to the meaning of &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.</P>

I was going on the basis of advice <Col N="2221" /> given to me by people who are quite skilled in this area.  Since I raised the matter originally, the Minister undertook to give me certain information and I reminded him of that on 5th March.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am quoting now from the booklet issued by the Board of Inland Revenue of the United Kingdom entitled Residents and Non-residents Liability to Tax in the United Kingdom. I.R. 20, 1973.  It states:</P>
      <P>The terms &ldquo;resident&rdquo; and &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; are not defined in the United Kingdom Income Tax Acts but guidance as to the meaning of these words has been given in decisions by the Court.  These show that both expressions are used in their everyday sense and do not have any special or technical meaning.  The term &ldquo;domicile&rdquo;, on the other hand, is always used in its strictly legal sense.</P>
      <P>My amendment deals more with deeming domicile than ordinary resident.  It is only fair I should tell that to the Deputy.  It may be a guideline to &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.  The real effect is to deem domicile and capture global assets.  In that section it gets rid of the need for using the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; but it uses the yardstick we have been using during the years.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I shall read my note on it for the benefit of the Deputy.  All immovable property held either in fee simple or under lease comes within the term. The definition is expanded to provide that such property will remain immovable property here even if it is impressed with a trust for sale when in the beneficial ownership of a foreign individual, a foreign discretionary trust or foreign private trading company.  This is done to counter possible avoidance. A foreigner owning land in the State could impress the property with a trust for sale and investment of the proceeds. He need not have the slightest intention of selling the land.  However, the land would cease to be land in his hands and would be notionally converted into foreign personal property and, as foreign property in the ownership of a foreign person, it would be outside the scope of the tax.  It is the old case that once a contract is signed land ceases to be land and becomes <Col N="2223" /> money.  I imagine if it is impressed with a trust for sale here it is the same thing.</P>

What I am urging on the Minister is that, if the position is as he says it is under subsection (2), a married couple who are separated are entitled in fact to be treated as two single persons&mdash; that is what it amounts to&mdash;for the purpose of threshold, dwelling house and so on exemption.  If that is so, why are the married couple, who are not <Col N="2225" /> separated, not entitled to this?  In the case of income tax long, long ago the decision was made differently and over the years an effort was made to close the gap, but the case I have been putting to the Minister for Finance and the case I now want to put to the Minister for Lands, who is doing duty for him, is that this is a new tax; we are starting now <i>ab initio</i> and why do we not start on the right foot and have regard to the fact that a wife is entitled to be treated as an individual and that a husband and wife, who are not separated, should not for the purposes of this Bill be penalised as against the husband and wife who are separated, or as against two single people?  If the Minister would accept the proposition that one regards a husband and wife as two individuals and treats them accordingly he would solve a great many problems and at the same time start off on the right foot with this new tax uninhibited, as you are under the income tax code, with what has gone before and with the cost of changing it. I do not think it will make any enormous difference to make this change and I strongly urge the Minister to accept that proposition.</P>

      <P>Where couples are separated by order of the court or by deed of separation, in many cases, as the Minister knows, alimony is being paid and the wife is being maintained by the husband.  Nevertheless, here we are saying such people are to be treated as two single individuals with the consequence that each has an exemption limit of £70,000 and each may have an exemption in respect of a dwellinghouse as against the position of the married couple who are not separated where the limit imposed is £100,000 and one dwellinghouse.  I would understand, if the wealth tax were in operation, and this was an amendment of that legislation, the difficulties the <Col N="2227" /> Minister would face, but I want to urge him very strongly that, because this is a new tax, it is open to him now to treat husband and wife as individuals. He must admit that there is involved in this subsection, as compared with section 4, a distinct discrimination against married couples who are living together.  I do not think there is any justification for that and I think the Minister does not think there is any justification for it.  I would urge him very strongly in all cases of married couples, whether separated or not, under whatever circumstances, that they be treated as two individuals.  That would be in conformity with equity and justice and with the recognition we are obliged to give to married women.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As Deputy Colley knows it is done all over the country quite frequently in allied legislation.  I am not prepared to do that.  I want to be perfectly clear about that.  We are treating a married couple as one and we are treating the property of both of them as the property of one.  We are not meagre in this country.  We are much more generous in our approach to this than they are in most countries.  In our proposal a single person has an allowance of £70,000.  The threshold <Col N="2228" /> for a single person is £70,000 and for a husband and wife £100,000.  In Denmark the threshold for a single person is £31,500 and for a husband and wife exactly the same.  No added allowance is given for a couple in Denmark.  In Sweden the threshold for a single person is £19,000 and for a married couple it is £19,000.  In the Netherlands the threshold is £6,800 for a single person and £9,200 for a married couple.  In Norway the threshold for a single person is £5,700 and £7,700 for a married couple.  In Finland the threshold for a single person is £3,000 and for a married couple £3,500.  In Luxembourg the threshold is £1,100 for a single and also £1,100 for a married couple.  In each of those countries the wealth of both is aggregated and treated as one. I believe we are reasonable here.  We have given a very generous threshold and we have exempted the family home and its contents.  I am not open to conviction or persuasion on this particular point.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I would like to support Deputy Colley in regard to this.  The Minister called out some figures in regard to other countries and I hope this is not the thin edge of the wedge, that those are not the figures he has in mind for future years.  I believe, having given the concession of £70,000 each to the husband and wife who are separated, the same thing should apply to married people.  This is women's year and it is important to ensure that we do not discriminate against women when we have new legislation like this.  We are discriminating against average, decent married couples.  In section 13 two people can have £140,000 of a threshold and it is quite obvious in this particular section that an exemption will be given to people who live separately.  We should give equality of status to men and women. In section 13 an allowance of £2,500 is given for each child.  Who will claim this money in the case of a separation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann notes with deep concern the serious decline in the footwear industry with consequent heavy unemployment, and calls on the Government to take immediate steps to halt the decline and to get the industry going again.</P>
      <P>I have here a report in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of today headed &ldquo;Ban on Cheap Clothing Imports&rdquo;, a matter which was raised by Deputy O'Malley at Question Time.  I understand now that the report is not correct so I will not deal with it any further.  The present situation in the footwear industry is frightening, with large scale redundancies, rising unemployment, factories going into liquidation and factories closing down.  I must say that it is a matter of deep regret to me that there should be any necessity to raise this matter once again in Private Members' Time because I hoped the Minister would have taken effective action in the intervening months since the matter was previously discussed.  About six months ago, I raised the matter here and pointed out the very serious problems facing the industry at that time.  I underlined for the Minister the need for urgent action and pointed to the consequences of the failure by the Minister and the Government to take the necessary steps to save an industry which employed very large numbers of our people.</P>
      <P>Apart from agreeing at the time that the situation was a serious one and taking a small number of minor decisions which had no perceptible effect on the industry, no further action was taken and the whole industry is now sliding into the chaos which we predicted if the necessary steps were not taken.  The lack of initiative on the part of the Minister is deplorable and I fail to understand it.  Warning after warning was given by us as to the trends clearly visible at that time in the industry.  Warning after warning was given by the Irish Shoe and Leather Workers' Union and the Federation of Footwear Manufacturers. Indeed, warnings were hardly necessary at that time because redundancies were becoming very apparent and were growing rapidly.  None of the warnings and signs had any influence on the Government or the Minister and no decisions of any consequence were taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately previous to the last discussion we had six months ago, the footwear workers marched through Dublin in protest against the inactivity of the Minister and recently they picketed stores which carried enormous consignments of foreign footwear.  The footwear operatives are a highly responsible body of people, with little liking for parades and pickets, but the fact that they did parade and picket illustrates the grave anxiety which permeates <Col N="2233" /> the industry as a whole and also indicates the fact that they have lost all confidence in the Minister and the Government with regard to taking any effective action.  In a report of the annual general meeting of Woodington's boot factory in Drogheda in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of 29th May, I note that the managing director stated that the company had had discussions with the Minister for Industry and Commerce on their problems but that no remedial action had so far been taken. This is typical&mdash;nice, cosy and friendly discussions, with promises of action and nothing done, and I do not think it is any wonder that the workers in this industry are bordering on despair.</P>
    <P>The footwear industry to all intents and purposes was set up by the Fianna Fáil Government in the early thirties as part of their industrial development policy.  From a weak beginning, it thrived over the years, employing large numbers of people and my constituency of Louth benefited immensely from this policy and became what might be termed the headquarters of the footwear industry in Ireland.  The industry in fact was the greatest single employer in the county. When I spoke here six months ago the cracks were showing but nevertheless we still had reasonably good employment in the industry.  Today one large factory has closed, one has gone into liquidation and two other large factories are on short-time working.  If I might briefly refer to the factory which has gone into liquidation, Donaghy's of Drogheda, it was established in 1932 and gave very considerable and worthwhile employment to a number of generations of workers in Drogheda.  A valuable pool of skills was built up over the years, and now the factory is about to close, with resultant loss not only to the workers but to Drogheda and the economy of the country as a whole, without the slightest effort being made by the Government to help.</P>
    <P>When one recognises the tremendous effort both workers and management put into the development of the footwear industry over the years, the present position is nothing short of calamitous.  The skills acquired by our workers, allied to the exceptional technological <Col N="2234" /> developments which took place in the industry over the years, had placed the standards in the industry here on a par with standards abroad.  This was proved by the fact that there was built up here over the years a very considerable export trade which now regrettably has been reduced to a trickle because of unfair competition about which the Government have done nothing.  It is a fact that at present the industry has reached crisis point and I sincerely hope it has not passed the point of no return.</P>
    <P>Protests by the footwear union, by the employers, by the newspapers, by other unions and by the Fianna Fáil Party have failed to get any response from the Minister, who is apparently satisfied that his only contribution to the health of this industry is to say that the EEC rules are there and he can do nothing.  In an earlier debate on this subject, he stated that the economic consequences of breaking the EEC rules would be disastrous for Ireland, but we pointed out at that time that the consequences of doing nothing to curb the flood of cheap imports of footwear from low-cost countries would be much more serious. Everybody, except the Government evidently, could see that the footwear and textile industries were set on a course which could only result in collapse and the consequences of their inactivity are now with us.  The simple facts are that not one of the EEC countries adhered strictly to the rules when their own vital interests were at stake and in circumstances in which the footwear industry here is facing extinction, extraordinary measures have to be taken.</P>
    <P>As a result of the pressures from us, the Minister flew to Brussels and requested an EEC task force to come here to investigate the footwear and textile industries.  The task force arrived, spent some time examining the situation, and in effect told the Minister that the remedy lay in his own hands, something which we had been telling him for quite a while, but the Minister still sticks to his guns and says he cannot do anything, that the rules of the EEC are the problem and <Col N="2235" /> he cannot do anything about them.  In fact, I have no doubt that in the EEC they are beginning to wonder if we are not too good to be true.  The really disturbing part of this whole saga is that many of the jobs in the footwear industry are not simply temporarily lost, they are gone forever, and the sad aspect of it is that so far as I can see this need not have happened if decisions had been taken at the proper time.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the question of whether rules and regulations should be broken or not, the simple fact is that the rules and regulations were made by the member countries, either by the Six or by the Nine, and therefore these rules and regulations can be changed if they are unjust or if the EEC countries desire for whatever reason.  We pressed the Minister on many occasions to propose such changes as were necessary, to pursue such propositions vigorously and to enlist all the support he could possibly get in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Quite recently I watched a television programme on the EEC Referendum in Britain in which Mr. Roy Hattersley, who is a pro-Market Labour Government Minister, discussed entry with three anti-Market intellectuals.  One of them asked him, in the event of staying in what would Britain do if the continued existence of one of her major industries was in jeopardy because of Common Market regulations which the other members were not willing to alter.  He replied that when Italy was in serious economic difficulties the EEC recognised this and did not press for the full implementation of the regulations in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Why can we not adopt a similar attitude to that adopted by Italy, when one of our most labour-intensive industries is in great danger, where large numbers of footwear workers are now redundant and where many jobs are now lost?  I would remind the Minister that when we were speaking here on a Private Members' motion on the footwear industry six months ago, he cited Italy as being an example of what can happen a country, to its detriment, which breaks EEC rules.  Might I now point out to the Minister that this same <Col N="2236" /> Italy has succeeded in cutting its inflation rate since then from 24 per cent to 12 per cent, while we are at the top of the inflation league.</P>
    <P>It should not be necessary to refer again to the underlying problems facing the industry, but in view of the Minister's lack of initiative I think I should once again recount the situation. There is a flood of cheap imports coming on the home market from low-cost countries such as Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong, and there are large supplies coming in from Comecon countries, all of which are coming either directly or through the United Kingdom.  Evidently all that is required to tranship these products and dump them on our market is to make slight alteration in them and repack them. The low standard of living, the low raw materials costs and the low wages paid in the low-cost countries constitute unfair competition.  This must be overcome by changing the appropriate EEC regulations and by changing, where necessary, our own anti-dumping laws.</P>
    <P>I suggested previously that we should change, at least for a time, from the tariff system to the quota system.  Tariffs of even 100 per cent, which of course are not permissible at that level because of other trade agreements, have no effect when the cost of the imported shoes is very low. Therefore we should deal with the problem by restricting imports to an acceptable level through the quota system.  I have no doubt the Minister will reply that this also is impossible, but I would remind him that when the Irish footwear industry needed time to adjust to the situation arising from the change-over to the tariff system under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy George Colley, reverted to the quota system for a couple of years, a change which had very beneficial consequences for the industry at the time. The British did not like the reimposition of the quotas and they told us so, but the industry got from the decision the boost it needed.  I might add that the British, who protested then, had little hesitation in applying levies to our goods going into the United Kingdom <Col N="2237" /> when it suited their purpose, in spite of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Comecon countries in exporting to the West is to obtain currency for the purpose of buying capital goods, machinery and so on from the countries of the West. Few people have any doubt that the footwear from these countries is subsidised. Subsidisation is difficult to prove, and our dumping laws need further scrutiny in this respect.  I could give an example; an all-leather shoe, with a leather upper, leather sole, leather lining, can be imported for about £1.70 from the Comecon countries. A similar shoe manufactured here would cost about £10.  You would not buy the sole of the shoe for the price of the finished article being imported.  How is this done?  I strongly advocate that the countries such as those I have mentioned should have to substantiate their costs.  We must insist that they, as the importer, must inform us as to the cost of the raw materials, the production costs, the transport costs and so on.  If we had this information it would be a relatively simple matter to identify dumping, which it quite clearly is.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind that goods of this nature dumped into Britain are also a very serious source of danger to us because of her capacity for unloading unwanted footwear on us.  Because of her wider trade commitments with the Comecon countries, she may not wish to disturb their equanimity by requiring them to substantiate their costings, but if she does not, then we must keep a wary eye on imports from Britain, especially through the north of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As things stand in regard to dumping, the onus is on the complainant to prove that dumping has taken place. This is imposing an almost impossible task on the complainant.  As I say, the onus should be placed on the importer or on the country of origin, where a clearly justifiable complaint is made, to prove that the footwear is not being dumped.</P>
    <P>The Merchandise Marks (Restriction on Importation of Footwear) Order, 1971, was made by my colleague, Deputy Lalor, when Minister for Industry and Commerce.  By this <Col N="2238" /> order the importation, by way of trade, of footwear was prohibited unless the goods bore at importation an indication of origin marked on the goods and consisting of the words &ldquo;Made in&rdquo; followed by the name of the country in which the goods were manufactured.  In all cases the goods had to be marked indelibly, legibly and conspicuously on the outer surface.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if this order is being adhered to.  Is it being adhered to in relation to container loads of footwear crossing the Border?  Does the Minister propose to extend the order so as to ensure that the footwear concerned will continue to carry the indication of the country of origin at retail level?  We have been advocating for some time that imports of footwear should be monitored.  We recognise that the effect on the imports will be relatively slight, but at least our manufacturers will have a clearer view of the problem and it will give them some easement in the present frightening situation.  The French have operated such a scheme for some time, even though the EEC rules did not allow it.  This year the EEC have consented to a surveillance scheme such as the French operate, and I understand it is applicable to imports from the EEC countries as well as to imports from outside the EEC.  It has been open to us for quite a while to adopt this arrangement; yet we are in a situation in which the Minister, in reply to Deputy Leonard today, said he hoped to put such a scheme into operation soon.  I would have hoped and expected that the scheme would have been in operation long ago.</P>
    <P>The visa technique system is operated in France.  The importer must apply to the French Government for a visa before he can place an order.  The visa takes from two to eight weeks to obtain, and I think we can take it that a visa for sensitive goods would hardly be forthcoming in less than the eight weeks.  There is another system whereby the importer places his order abroad and simply applies for a licence to import the goods.  Whatever merit there is in the French system, the other is useless, and I hope he is not proposing to bring in the second system I have mentioned. The French Government have <Col N="2239" /> never had any compunction in protecting any sensitive sector of its industry. For example, on the 25th April, this year the French Premier stated that his Government recognised the important role of the textile industry, particularly in current difficult trading conditions, and that he intended to support that industry.  He also stated that the French Government would press the EEC to conclude a bi-lateral agreement for the limitation of textile imports from third countries as quickly as possible and that this would prevent what he termed &ldquo;the uncontrolled and brutal influx of textile products on the French market from countries whose trading practices were so different from those of France&rdquo;.  What is to prevent us from adopting a similar attitude in relation to our footwear and textile products?</P>
    <P>Further, in 1968 the French, with the consent of the EEC, introduced quota restrictions.  Some of the reasons given then for permitting the French to do so were that their production costs had risen rapidly due to a number of factors and that France had a balance of payments problem.  The French invoked articles 104 and 108 of the Rome Treaty.  We are now in a comparable situation.  Our footwear production costs are rising much more rapidly than in any other EEC country and we have a balance of payments problem. Surely it is not necessary for me, when our footwear industry is facing disaster, to urge the Minister to consider what he can do in a similar way.</P>
    <P>He might also concern himself about article 137 of the Treaty of Accession which gives permission to us to take measures in cases of extreme urgency to protect our industry up to December, 1975.  I need not stress that we are in a situation of extreme urgency in regard to the footwear industry.  The call for urgent and effective action has come from many sources but has met with no response apart from lectures on the Common Market rules and regulations and, as in the last speech, taunts about Fianna Fáil activity at the time of the EEC referendum here, as if Ireland could live in splendid isolation had we not entered the EEC, and leave ourselves with tariff barriers being erected against us by practically <Col N="2240" /> all western European countries.  I think the result of the British referendum should put paid to that argument.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this problem which has done untold damage to our footwear industry.  We have a frightening inflationary situation, being now well at the top of the EEC inflationary league.  This Government have neither the courage nor political will to do their duty and take effective measures to curb inflation. They hold highly-publicised Government meetings but if meetings could solve the problems these would have been solved long ago.  Inflation is playing havoc with Irish-made footwear at home and it has destroyed a once-creditable export trade.  Footwear manufacturers who had a good export trade six months ago when we last debated this subject now inform me that in some cases this trade has dried up completely while in others it is reduced to a trickle.  Foreign agents who used come here to view our products and buy them no longer come.  They ring from London to say however high the quality of our footwear may be our prices are no longer competitive and there is no point in coming to see it.  This is a frightening situation.</P>
    <P>A pointer to the seriousness of the situation is found in comparing the change in recent years in the relation between imports and exports of footwear. In 1970 our exports were 1.8 million pairs and imports 1.6 million pairs, a balance in favour of exports. In 1974 our exports were 3 million pairs and our imports 5.3 million pairs, a balance very much in favour of imports.  Our exports this year will be very much lower and the trading imbalance much greater.  The number of manufacturing units is growing less each year and the number unemployed increasing very rapidly, not in small groups but in hundreds.  I had intended to give the number of factories left but as such factories are closing now fairly frequently that is not possible.  Some time ago manufacturers had pinned their faith on increased exports&mdash;and with some considerable success until recently. Of the main exporting factories one is closed, one is threatened with imminent <Col N="2241" /> closure and the remainder are on short time.</P>
    <P>I advocated a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign when I last spoke on a similar motion.  During that debate the Minister said he was about to launch a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign that very week which he believed would be effective.  Apart from going through the motions of declaring a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign open, there was no follow-up and the whole thing fizzled out in a couple of weeks.  For most people it never got off the ground.  I understand that the princely sum of £3,000 was spent on the programme. At that time a new approach to a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign had been promised but it came to nothing. There is no better indication of the paucity of ideas and lack of will to pursue any worthwhile plan or strategy by the Government than their lack of initiative and staying power in this venture when the employment of so many people depended on a vigorous and sustained &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sell Irish&rdquo; campaign.</P>
    <P>We have now reached a really frightening situation regarding stocking of Irish goods particularly by many large supermarkets in this city and by many supermarkets in large stores in larger towns throughout the country. From personal observation and research conducted by me and some of my colleagues I have found it is virtually impossible to find either Irish footwear or textiles in the large stores, not to speak of buying Irish goods.  These stores are packed from floor to ceiling with foreign products, many from low-cost countries and some from our nearer neighbours.  The problem is not so much buying as finding Irish goods.  Very often a specific request must be made before Irish goods are shown to a customer.  Every effort is made to encourage the purchase of foreign goods and often it is only after a struggle that one can purchase an Irish article.  This is a disgraceful situation and how the owner of any store who has the slightest interest in the country's economy and welfare can persist in this kind of national sabotage is beyond me.  It is past the time when a long hard look should be taken at the whole position <Col N="2242" /> including, specifically, profit margins on imported footwear.  I do not wish to tar all large stores or supermarkets with the same brush&mdash;some do their best&mdash;but in general the situation is extremely bad and a thorough investigation of the reasons for it must be made, followed by a constructive approach, if the vital industry now being discussed here is not to go to the wall.</P>
    <P>I understand that for some time after the last lengthy discussion here on this matter many large stores placed extra orders for Irish footwear but that after a relatively short time they reverted to their original practice of buying vast quantities of foreign goods.  I hope this discussion will again have the effect of ensuring increased purchases from our own factories but that this time it will be a continuing process.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with a case that is made, perhaps with some validity regarding this matter and to suggest how it could be met.  First, let me say that prices are escalating; the cost of living is intolerable; not a day passes without increases in the prices of a number of products.  Before the last election we were promised that this Government would stabilise and reduce prices.  I have no doubt that this promise helped more than any other single factor to ensure that the Coalition were returned to office.  The results of their efforts are now only too apparent: prices have escalated to a point where many families are pushed to the limit even to exist.  In such circumstances it is very difficult to be critical of the harassed mother of a large family if she decides to buy foreign made shoes when she can get them at a price which is considerably lower than the price of Irish footwear.</P>
    <P>I would stress strongly that the Irish footwear industry&mdash;management and workers&mdash;are not asking for a monopoly here for their goods.  They recognise that they can only develop as a result of trading.  They are asking simply for fair competition and are willing to accept that there should be a considerable importation of footwear into this country.  They are asking that we apply a quota system so as to enable us to control the level of imports.  If this proposal were <Col N="2243" /> accepted by the Minister and fought for at EEC level and if it were acceded to there, there would continue to be a big range of cheap imported footwear products from which a mother in the circumstances I have outlined could buy.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, a properly directed buy Irish campaign would encourage those who are better off to leave these cheaper products to those who cannot afford anything else and to buy Irish themselves.  Whenever there is any suggestion of placing a restriction on the importation of footwear, those who favour unrestricted importation use the argument that we are trying to penalise the less well-off. The fact is that those who buy pairs of cheap foreign shoes in any year are not the poor who cannot afford to buy Irish goods but, very often, are those who are reasonably well off and who, through lack of thought regarding the effect of their action on employment or because of a could-not-care-less attitude do not bother to buy Irish. By leaving the cheaper products for the less well-off larger families and by buying Irish, even at some little financial sacrifice, they could help transform the industry, prevent further redundancies and help consolidate employment.</P>
    <P>Let me further remind them that they would be doing themselves a favour, perhaps, today, this is more obvious than ever before when even jobs which were regarded previously as being in the safe categories are now under severe pressure.  It should be understood clearly that each footwear worker who loses his employment, renders a little less secure at all levels the employment of every other worker in the country.  The man who becomes unemployed suffers a drop in income which means that his ability to purchase goods decreases.  It means that the volume of necessities he buys is reduced and that the purchase of other articles or of articles he proposed to replace is put off to a later date.  All of this affects adversely, directly or indirectly, the security of those still in employment.  Workers at all levels have a clearer perception now of this situation and I believe <Col N="2244" /> that some well planned and properly thought out publicity would hammer home the vital need for all our people to buy Irish today.</P>
    <P>Basically, there is a need for the display of more Irish goods in the larger stores and supermarkets and also in the smaller shops.  We need, too, to instil in the public a clearer understanding as to the economic consequences of ignoring the call to buy Irish.  If these labour-intensive industries are permitted to collapse, either because of lack of positive thinking and decision on the part of the Minister, or because of a lack of understanding on the part of the public, the consequences for all of us, and not merely for the workers in these industries, will be very serious.</P>
    <P>A good start might be made in this respect in relation to a buy Irish campaign if we were to begin by concentrating on buying locally.  Every town and village is experiencing unemployment. If we could concentrate the minds of our people not only on the general problem but on the fact that each individual has some responsibility for the welfare of his neighbour, we would be on the way towards overcoming the main difficulties we are experiencing.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might summarise briefly the general position in which the footwear industry finds itself and some of my proposals to overcome the problems.  The first and basic matter to realise is that this industry is set on a disaster course.  It is no longer a question of a few workers becoming temporarily disemployed in the factories.  The stage has been reached where the industry is disintegrating. Whole factories are going into liquidation. They are closing down with an alarmingly detrimental effect not only on the workers immediately concerned but on workers in ancillary industries.  Very often where the industry is the only one in the area, its closure has a disastrous effect on the whole community.  What is at stake then, is the employment of thousands of people.  I am sure the Minister will accept that swift and effective action must be taken by him at this stage, action which would curb imports from low cost countries by insisting <Col N="2245" /> at EEC level on a quota system.  This must apply, also, in the case of the Comecon countries where the importer or the country of origin must be obliged to substantiate costings. The most effective monitoring system must be brought into operation at once and the best possible use made of it.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration must be given immediately to invoking Articles 104 and 108 of the Treaty of Rome.  The conditions laid down for invoking these Articles is clearly evident in the Irish economy of today although the Minister may hold a different view.</P>
    <P>Article 137 of the Treaty of Accession underlines clearly that we can take measures to correct our economy in cases of extreme urgency up to 31st December, 1975.  With so many of our people swelling the dole queue, there is no doubt that this is a time of extreme urgency for all industry but, particularly, for the footwear industry.  Consideration should be given to the application of VAT to footwear imports at the point of entry.</P>
    <P>In arranging quotas for imports from Comecon countries, realistic values should be applied by the Revenue Commissioners to documentation for the purpose of establishing a correct duty.  The necessity for this is obvious to everybody.</P>
    <P>Special help should be given to the footwear industry for export purposes. Again, I would emphasise the necessity for a worthwhile buy and sell Irish campaign.  Such a campaign must be got under way immediately and sustained.</P>
    <P>Efforts are continuing on the part of the IDA to secure new industry. This is highly commendable and is worthy of our full support.  However, in the short term, we need to concentrate on saving the industries we have. We are spending a considerable amount each year in setting up new industries.  It is right to do this because very often these industries have worthwhile potential. However, their employment content is small in their early years, whereas the collapse of one footwear industry in a town may mean the loss <Col N="2246" /> at one fell swoop of as many jobs as may be provided at the initial stage in many new industries.  While recognising the urgent need for industrial expansion, I am well aware of the excellent work being done by Fóir Teoranta in their efforts to assist industries in difficulty.  In the short-term, while proceeding with our industrial development we should make available more money from whatever source to help the footwear industry which is now in a very serious predicament.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would say that all our efforts to keep the footwear industry going will be futile unless immediate action is taken to curb inflation.  This is fundamental.  It is ridiculous to hear Ministers making speeches to that effect.  They know the facts, we know the facts; what we want from them is action but to date they have done nothing to curb inflation.</P>
    <P>So long as inflation remains at its present level, not alone will the footwear industry disappear but all industries are in serious danger.  I can say this from experience in one of the most highly industrialised constituencies in the country.  The footwear industry is faced with disaster.  The Minister knows this and only a superlative effort can save the jobs of thousands of workers.  I hope that in his reply the Minister will give the industry some hope.  I hope he will not persist in his previous attitude of saying there is nothing he can do, that it is in the hands of the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will reply to the debate tomorrow when he has heard more of the contributions from both sides of the House.  What I shall say will be just a few remarks that may be of help to the House in considering what everyone will agree is a very serious situation.  It is causing grave concern to the country in general, to individual families and to localities where the shoe industry is of significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise that this is a profound problem, one that has been with us for a very considerable time and whose roots go back into history. <Col N="2247" /> This was referred to by Deputy Faulkner when he stated the shoe industry was established in the thirties in conditions of protection.  In fact, there was virtually an absolute bar on imports of footwear for many years.  In that situation an industry developed that was very unspecialised, which had to supply every conceivable need for shoes of any type in the country.  This meant the industry was diversified, did not have economies of scale and was producing a small amount of a wide range of products.  Such an industry was not likely to survive in conditions of free trade where specialisation was necessary to achieve the economies of scale that would allow one to break competitively into export markets.</P>
    <P>The previous Government were faced with that situation and they recognised it when they set up the Committee on Industrial Organisation which considered the shoe industry. Their report was presented to the Government in 1961 and it is important to refer to it.  On page 220 of the report it is stated:</P>
    <P>We have been asked to indicate if possible the loss of output and employment which would result under free trade conditions in the shoe industry.</P>
    <P>Later in the report they stated they were disposed to think that if nothing were done about the recommendations they made home sales could be reduced by as much as 50 per cent and that our exports to Britain could be reduced by 25 per cent.  On page 221 they stated:</P>
    <P>Without improvements which we regard as desirable, the disemployment might conceivably go as high as 2,000.</P>
    <P>A further report on the shoe industry was issued by the Committee on Industrial Progress in 1972.  It is interesting to see how, in 1972, the COIP looked back on the action taken in the interim on the 1961 recommendations of the CIO.  In the interim, the previous Government had held office continuously. The CIO had made the following recommendations:</P>
    <P>(i)  Co-ordination of adaptation <Col N="2248" /> and development plans and co-operation in carrying them out.</P>
    <P>The COIP said: &ldquo;We found no evidence of co-ordination in adaptation and development on an industry-wide basis...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(ii)  Reduction of ranges of production and concentration on fewer lines by means of a division of work between manufacturing units to be organised by the Adaptation Council.</P>
    <P>The COIP said that: &ldquo;The CIO regarded as one of the more important tasks of the Adaptation Association... but concluded that &ldquo;The Association did not undertake this task but, as far as we can see, limited itself to commending to the members the wisdom of undertaking a certain degree of rationalisation...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(iii)  Improvement in factory production&mdash;modernisation of plant and enlargement of scale of operation.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that some considerable progress was made on this recommendation but of the grants made available for adaptation and modernisation of equipment, six firms received 60 per cent and this indicates many other firms received very small grants. The report stated that in 1972 some 44 per cent of footwear machinery in use in the Irish footwear industry was more than ten years old.  This indicates that the modernisation in factory production recommended in 1961 had not taken place in the interim to the extent one might have hoped.  The CIO also made the following recommendation:</P>
    <P>(v)  Investigation into provision of industry-wide research and information facilities and for the setting up of a central advisory service on design.</P>
    <P>There was progress on this and the industry is in consultation for some years now with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards on the question of research and information facilities.  The next recommendation is one with which all of us would agree and perhaps it is of the greatest significance. The CIO called for:</P>
    <P>(vi)  Training of employees with a view to remedying deficiencies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2249" /> On this the COIP said: &ldquo;This is an area in which little progress has been made.&rdquo;  This is a recommendation which the Government of the day had the greatest opportunity to do something about because, to a great extent, the other recommendations were within the competence of the management in the industry while the Government were confined to making facilities available.  The committee also recommended as follows:</P>
    <P>(vii)  The establishment by the industry of a body or bodies to improve production and marketing. No action appears to have been taken on this recommendation.</P>
    <P>Thus as far back as 1961 warnings were given to the Government and to the industry although I accept it would not be fair to blame the Government solely for the lack of action in that period.  Nevertheless recommendations were made that, to a substantial degree, were not heeded and this is borne out clearly in the report of the COIP presented in 1972.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the problem we are discussing became very acute during the period of office of our predecessors. If they had some magic remedy to deal with the situation I should think they would have produced it while they were still in office. It is important to quantify this.  In 1969 imports of shoes represented only 12 per cent of the market in this country.  In 1973, which is the year the previous Government left office, 48 per cent, or four times 12 per cent, of the Irish footwear market was represented by imports.  That was an alarming trend taking place in those four years during which the previous Government were in office.  If they had ideas as to how this trend could have been reversed&mdash;it was obviously a serious one and one that would cause any Government concern&mdash;I would have imagined that they would have come up with them and translated them into substantial changes in the situation during 1969-1973.  They did not do that, and one must recognise they were obviously seriously constrained from doing it by the realities of the economic situation at the time.  We were moving into an <Col N="2250" /> area of free trade and, it was decided by the Government that this was a desirable course of action on balance, although there would be problems arising from it.  It is wrong for Fianna Fáil to have taken that stance then and come along now and say we should do what they themselves failed to do.  They want to have their cake and eat it; they want free trade but they do not want the consequential disadvantages.  It is easy to say something like that when one is in Opposition.  It is not so easy when one is in Government.  Fianna Fáil did not advocate this when they were in Government but they appear to be advocating it now when they are in Opposition.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise from whence imports are coming.  Deputy Faulkner did not dwell on this but I heard other people implying that to a significant extent the problem arose from imports of footwear from outside the EEC.  It was these, they argued, which were causing the problems.  Reference was made to the Comecon countries and to Taiwan. It was suggested it was easy to take action against extra-EEC imports while not so easy to take action against our partners in the EEC.  The fact is that 88 per cent of imports of shoes come from within the EEC and that leaves only 12 per cent coming from without the EEC; 76 per cent are in fact coming from Britain.</P>

      <P>Those are the figures available to me and, if the Deputy has evidence available to him to suggest the figures are false, he should produce it but, unless he has that evidence, <Col N="2251" /> these are the figures supplied to me by officials of the Department who are in a position to know what is happening. I am giving them to the House.  I think they are fair figures which indicate the real situation and I challenge the Deputy to deny them in substance.</P>
      <P>It is also fair to say that one of the serious problems we are facing is represented not just by the increase in imports but by the fact that we are not as successful as we should be in exports.  Statistics for the first four months show that fewer shoes are being imported than were being imported in the first four months of 1974. From January to April, 1974, 1,958,000 pairs of shoes were imported; in the same period of 1975 the figure was 1,668,000.  There was a decline in imports. That is not to say that the situation has improved.  In fact it has worsened because of a very significant decline in our exports.  That is something upon which this debate might usefully focus.  So far the focus has been solely on the imports dimension. The export dimension also needs attention. In the first four months of 1974 we exported 1,274,000 paris of shoes; in the same period in 1975 we exported 1,021,000 paris of shoes, a reduction of about 20 per cent in exports.  That is a serious situation and one which must cause us concern.  I can make only very general comments on why this is the evolution.  I think one of the most significant factors is the decline in our competitiveness and costs of production. These are much higher here and projected UK basic wage rates are approximately 28 per cent higher than the rates in the shoe industry here. Wages have to be paid out of the prices received for shoes sold and quite clearly that discrepancy affects to a significant extent our competitiveness in export markets and explains to some extent the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I detected at one stage in Deputy Faulkner's speech&mdash;I may be being unfair to him&mdash;a hint that he might contemplate actually breaking EEC rules.  I do not think he actually said it and he may well not agree with such a sentiment but it would be useful if we could have a clear statement as to whether or not the Opposition would <Col N="2252" /> contemplate such a course of action.  If they would, and I think it is unlikely, it would indicate a rather strange anomaly in that they wish in one sense to be even more European than others because they were stating at considerable length that they would remain in the EEC irrespective of what Britain did, indicating they were, in the continental term, more communitaire than anybody else.  Now they cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I heard someone on that side of the House say that too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed, but we do not advocate breaking the Treaty provisions in any way.  I do not know whether the Opposition would contemplate breaking the terms of the Treaty but it is a matter that should be cleared up.  Deputy Faulkner referred to Articles 104 and 108 of the Treaty of Accession which permit unilateral action when severe balance of payments problems arise.  I think the Articles are Articles 108 and 109 actually.  I am advised one cannot take action in relation to a balance of payments problem affecting one particular sector of the economy.  It has to be a general balance of payments problem affecting the whole economy, putting the currency in danger or threatening the creditworthiness of the country as a whole.  That situation emphatically does not exist in respect of Ireland and therefore those Articles could not be invoked in this particular situation.</P>
      <P>In relation to Article 135, which refers to specific sectoral problems and allows action to be taken by member States to curb imports, in that situation action can be taken unilaterally by a member State but it has to be taken with the consent of the EEC Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in relation to the shoe industry and the textile industry is that the problems we are facing are being encountered in <Col N="2253" /> practically every country in the EEC where there is a footwear industry and a textile industry.  If we were to impose restrictions on imports of footwear and textiles from other EEC countries, whose footwear and textiles are experiencing the same problems, the obvious corollary of that is that they would impose similar restrictions on our exports to them, either in that sector or some other sector.  That would lead to a breakdown of the Common Market concept.</P>
      <P>As the House is no doubt aware, the heads of state of the EEC made it clear that they did not see a solution to the economic problems of member states lying in import restrictions being imposed by one member as against another, and that the problems should be solved by concerted action between members on a co-operative basis. Ireland, which depends for its livelihood and that of many thousand workers on exports, must support the concept adumbrated by the heads of state which calls for concerted action on this matter.  This does not involve punitive restrictions on imports which in the end would hit us harder than our compatriots in the EEC because we depend more on exports than many of them.  If we start a cycle of import controls there is a danger that they in turn will act in a similar manner against us which would put many thousand more jobs in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>This is the real situation we are faced with.  I believe everybody will recognise that it is a difficult situation which does require some of the remedies suggested by Deputy Faulkner.  He made a very valuable contribution in relation to the Buy Irish campaign.  I hope everybody will pay attention to what he said.  His contribution pointed out that in the distribution sector much needs to be done to ensure not only that people want to buy Irish but that they are able to buy Irish, that Irish goods are there for them to buy.  I hope, in the distribution sector, that what Deputy Faulkner said will be taken due heed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me no pleasure to come back to the House <Col N="2254" /> after six months to speak again on the problem facing shoe companies and the workers in them.  I was slated in the House when I said that this industry was in a serious position when we moved our motion last December.  I was told I was going around creating a scare.  I defy anybody to say now that I created a scare.  The scare has come now into the homes of all the shoe operatives in the country.  The Parliamentary Secretary went back to 1961 and quoted from records and statistics.  At that time Fianna Fáil could take action to counteract imports into the country.  When we left office in March, 1973 the total employed in this industry was 6,000.  I believe the total number now is about 3,000.</P>
      <P>We see closures of factories very frequently now.  We see companies in difficulties nearly every day, depending on one loan from a bank and another from State agencies.  Last December I stated that a factory that has to go on the borrowing market today is running into very serious difficulties with the interest charges involved.  The aids given, whether from banks or State agencies, are only a stop gap.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about the legalities we all talk about in relation to the EEC, that we cannot renegotiate.  I believe under the articles of our treaty of entry and our negotiations that if employment was to be badly affected we could renegotiate.  Almost every country in the EEC has broken every rule when it suited her and this is still happening.  France did this. Germany also did it.  What action has been taken against either country in the EEC courts?  France did what suited her.  She was right to do so if she felt it would have an adverse effect on the financial upkeep of the particular concern.</P>

    <P>We are very grateful to the IDA for the amount of job potential they have brought into the country.  When this matter is talked about we hear numbers quoted but lately I divided the figure given by two and I got a more realistic answer.  It is time the State agencies and the Government took action to protect the shoe companies in particular who have given very good employment down <Col N="2255" /> through the years.  Some workers are 30 years in a shoe factory.  They say that when a person becomes redundant he can go to AnCO for retraining.  That is all right for a man aged between 20 and 35 years but it is difficult to train people over 35.  Since January the cost to shoe companies has increased by 40 per cent.  The increase has come about by increases in ESB, CIE, postage, insurance and labour costs, including the honouring of the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary appeared to say we were not doing enough for export.  I do not know whether he was alluding to the design or quality of our shoes but I should like to point out that the shoe factory in my constituency has won three awards for design.  When it comes to design that factory rates as one of the best in Europe.  They can supply a top quality range of shoes.  When I visited a number of shops in Dublin city recently I discovered that they had a wide range of Italian, English, and Korean shoes.  I was asked for as much at £16 per pair.  The average price was about £12 per pair.  When I asked if there were any Irish shoes available the assistants were not very helpful in saying they had.  I do not know why they adopt this attitude.  The same applies in our supermarkets.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that dumping of shoes is taking place through England from countries outside the EEC.  From England the shoes, which are stamped in that country, find their way on to the Irish market.  It should be possible for us to insist that the stamping operation is carried out by a machine before the shoe leaves the factory in the country of origin.  If this was done it would be more difficult for foreign supplies to find their way on to the Irish market.  The people involved would put a stamp &ldquo;Irish made&rdquo; on the shoes if they thought they would get away with it.  Some of the footwear comes from Czechoslovakia at a cost of £1.80, duty paid.  We should be able to take measures to counter that.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary asked if we were anxious to break rules.  We do not want to break rules but we do <Col N="2256" /> not have to break them.  We can renegotiate these rules, and that is what we should have been doing since last December.  In December the Minister invited a task force from the EEC&mdash;he may not have asked them but they came anyway&mdash;to look around this industry.  Those people returned to the EEC capital but did nothing for us. Apparently, the attitude is that we must stand on our own two feet.</P>
    <P>The Buy Irish campaign never got off the ground.  The publicity given to this campaign was not what it should have been.  It would have been better if we had launched a campaign stressing the importance of preserving jobs at home and the importance of maintaining employment for families.  I do no think anybody was happy with the campaign which was launched in December.  If the proper work was put into such a campaign we would get the co-operation of our people.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the argument put forward by the Minister, or the Government, that nothing can be done to alter EEC regulations.  We should be able to renegotiate, particularly when the shoe industry is on the point of collapse.  In my view, we have a marvellous case to present to the EEC.  The manufacture of footwear is one of the largest industries in my constituency.  However, the employees are on three days one week, five days in other weeks and then off work for a further week. They do not know when they will be told that a receiver is to be appointed. I hope that will not happen, but if costs continue to soar, if imports are allowed to come in unchecked, I cannot see any future for our footwear industry.</P>
    <P>When replying I expect the Minister to quote EEC regulations and say that nothing can be done about the matter.  When I spoke on this previously I did not attack the Minister but I must attack him and the Government now for their failure to take action.  The Minister should take action even if it means renegotiating or breaking a regulation.  Are we always to be the nice boys and say everything is going well in Ireland <Col N="2257" /> when we are on our knees?  On the last occasion the Minister said that when Italy put on an embargo it brought the Italian Government to its knees, but that Government was never in any other position except on its knees, so it would not be anything to go by.  That being so, I am now of the opinion that the EEC Commission feel that we are easy meat, that they can palm us off, that they can get us off their hands easily because we will do nothing about it. France imposed a lamb embargo against us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not know it but I know that we can renegotiate and the Minister must admit also that countries have broken their agreements when they affected the industries involved.  Nobody can deny that.</P>
      <P>I want to go on to some of the matters that are crippling us at the moment.  Inflation at 30 per cent is having a major effect on us and that is one of our problems that is pricing us out of the export market.  What company can stand a 40 per cent increase in costs in six months?  A company has confirmed to me that their costs have gone up by 40 per cent, an enormous increase.  We ought impose some sort of import quota as well because we would then be restricting imports coming in as they are now. They seem to have free access here. Reading the reply given today to a question put down by Deputy Leonard, there is no good news in it.  I do not want to deal with the report in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of today because that seems now to be untrue, according to the information I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the broader issues, there are millions of pounds worth of cattle being exported each year.  These include the hides.  I brought this up on the last occasion and I would like to know from the Minister if he did any checking <Col N="2258" /> up to see whether the raw hides sent out by the container loads are processed and imported here again. This is an industry we could develop and expand and we would be using an obvious natural resource.  To export the hides and then import them back in does not seem to me to make sense at all.  I would like to know why we cannot do it here and if we have not got the means now, perhaps we would be able to get around to it with the help of IDA grants and grants from other agencies which would help us out.  At the moment the imports coming in here, I am led to believe, are running close to 70 per cent, an increase over last year of about 15 per cent.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated that there were not as many imports as last year, but it must be realised that there is a falling off in consumer demand which has been brought about by the grave unemployment position we have.  That is the answer to that&mdash;that people have not got the same purchasing power.</P>
    <P>I want to say also that the shops here have not supported the Irish shoe companies in the way they should have and I regret to have to say that. I do not want anyone to say that the same profit margin is not there.  Some of the companies recently in order to keep their companies viable had two options.  One was redundancy and the other was to increase the price of the shoe.  To increase the price would have priced us out of the market, so they brought about redundancies in an effort to cut their costs.  It is not a very good thing when you have to bring about redundancies to keep down your costs, but on top of that, they had inflation which was running wild and this has had an adverse effect on them.</P>
    <P>I believe that the import of shoes from outside the EEC should be banned completely.  Some may say that that is not on, but I feel it will have to be because if it is not, the closure of most of these companies is imminent.  I said here in December that action of that nature should be taken then to stop these imports.  Surely we should have stopped them but these people got <Col N="2259" /> clever in the end and switched over to using England as a jumping off ground.  I do not know how we are to get over that, but it is something which the Department and the Revenue Commissioners should look into, the using of England as a launching pad for this country.  They have been consistently using it.  They have been using the North also but mainly England.</P>
    <P>I was of the opinion after the debate here in December that something would happen to improve the situation with regard to the factories, but I regret to say that they have been going downhill all the time and the workers are now wondering what is to happen next.  They have been responsible people because there was another option open to them.  I fear that it will happen, that they will black the places of entry into this country, which may have an effect on other aspects of our industrial life but when you are 30 years in a job and it has been your livelihood, the only trade you know, you cannot be blamed.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Wealth Tax Bill, 1975: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before progress was reported I was posing the question as to whether the imposition of a wealth tax is good or bad for our economy. There is nobody who can say that the imposition of a wealth tax in our economy will create one new productive job or will cause an increase in the export of any commodity, except capital.  It will not contribute towards breaking the inflationary spiral which is the now acknowledged prime target of economic policy.  I say &ldquo;now acknowledged&rdquo;, because although we have been telling the Government for quite a long time, it is only in recent weeks that there has been any acknowledgement by the Government that this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one were to look at the state of our economy in early 1973 when <Col N="2260" /> Fianna Fáil handed it over to the present Government and tried to judge whether the imposition of a wealth tax at that time would have been a good thing, I think the conclusion one would have had to come to was that, despite the very great strides in the expansion of our economy which had been achieved, nevertheless, in comparison, say, with our EEC partners, our economy was still at a stage of development way behind that of our EEC partners.  Yet some of the most wealthy countries either do not have a wealth tax at all or have one on such a limited scale that it does not compare with what is before us in this Bill.  When we look at the situation today and try to consider the thinking behind this measure, it escapes my understanding as to what kind of thinking produces the imposition of a wealth tax in our circumstances today.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to recite the litany of woe in regard to our economy.  The state of our economy is a monument to the incompetent economic management of the Government and an indictment of the Government and of the individual Members of the Government who claimed to have expertise of some sort in the management of our economy.  It is not an excuse which carries any weight any longer to compare our situation with that of other countries.  The level of our inflation now gives the lie to all the claims that were made in the past to justify the failure of the Government in regard to inflation.  As a consequence of being at the top of the inflation league, we are not alone in the position where we are suffering unemployment at this time of the year in the region of 103,000 persons but we are also producing a situation in which more unemployment is going to be created as a direct result of that level of inflation with the consequential level of wage inflation.</P>
    <P>We have this enormous problem of galloping inflation, worse than that of any other member of the EEC; we have a very serious and worsening situation in regard to unemployment; we have various business firms just <Col N="2261" /> teetering on the brink of bankruptcy &mdash;those who have not closed down. The Government choose this time to introduce a wealth tax.  On Second Stage I invited any Members on the Government side, whether from the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party, to indicate to the House some economic argument in favour of the imposition of this wealth tax.  Nobody accepted my invitation.  I repeat the invitation.  I would be very pleased to hear some economic argument in favour of the wealth tax.  Are there some arguments with some degree of credibility that would indicate that by passing this legislation charging a wealth tax, we would improve the economic performance of this country, some argument to show that by the imposition of a wealth tax, we would reduce unemployment or reduce inflation or increase our exports?  Any one of these would give some degree of credibility from an economic point of view to the imposition of a wealth tax.</P>
    <P>So far, nobody on the Government benches has attempted to argue any such thing.  The arguments put forward are that it is in the interests of equity, that it will achieve a redistribution of wealth and that it will bring a more equitable distribution of wealth.  These things are said glibly, particularly by people like Deputy Barry Desmond, but no attempt has been made to examine this and to see how true or false the argument is. On the admission of the Minister for Finance, there will be no redistribution of wealth as a result of the wealth tax.  I say that because the Minister has admitted that, even taking the whole package together, not just the wealth tax but the wealth tax, the capital gains tax and the capital acquisitions tax, the total sum he expects to get into the Exchequer will equal the amount heretofore collected under death duties.  Therefore, from the point of view of redistribution of wealth as commonly understood, that is, by the State taking from the rich and giving to the poor, there can be no change in the situation if the Minister's estimates have any basis in reality.  But more than that, when <Col N="2262" /> pushed on this matter, the Minister for Finance said that redistribution would take place amongst members of wealthy families.  In case you might think that this is an incredible statement, I am not making it up.  The Minister said that.</P>
    <P>Are we seriously to believe that the social argument, the argument in equity and justice for wealth tax, is to achieve a redistribution of wealth amongst members of wealthy families?  Is this seriously put forward in this House? As I have indicated the question of redistribution of wealth as normally understood simply does not arise on the admissions of the Minister for Finance.  The question of redistribution of wealth between members of the one family is too ludicrous to be put forward as an argument in favour of a wealth tax.  So, what arguments are we left with in favour of the imposition of a wealth tax as proposed in this section?  An argument which is based, as far as I can see, on an appeal to the politics of envy, an argument which begrudges the success of Irish people in business or in any enterprise, an argument which ignores the role of such people, not only their capital but their entrepreneurial skill in providing employment in this country.  It has been a truism of economic policy in this country for many years that if we were ever to attain full employment&mdash; something, I admit, that sounds like a bad joke in present circumstances&mdash;it would have to be attained primarily through the development of industry. Of course the development of industry brings with it consequential creation of employment in the service industry but the primary effort had to be, still has to be and, at any time in the future, will have to be based on the development of manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>It is clear from some of the things we heard this morning, particularly from Deputy Barry Desmond, that there are Deputies on that side of the House who do not understand, or else do not want to understand, the role of those who invest their capital and those who invest their skill in the development, in particular of manufacturing industry in this country. There is some specious argument coming from the other side of the <Col N="2263" /> House that the wealth tax will not affect detrimentally industry in this country.  I do not know how any rational men purport to put forward that argument.  It is, of course, true to say that in the case of a trading company wealth tax will not be charged or levied.  If anybody is foolish enough to think that therefore there is no charge levied which will offset the operations of a trading company all I can say is, God help this country if it is in the hands of people who think that.</P>
    <P>The reality of the situation, as Deputies opposite should well know, and as was pointed out earlier today, is that essentially trading companies consist of shareholders, and whether those shares are held through other companies or any other way, ultimately you will get back to individuals, individuals whose money is involved, individuals who make the decision whether to invest the money, whether to withdraw it or not. If those individuals are adversely affected, can anybody say that can happen without any adverse effect on the trading companies concerned? Quite apart from the current economic chaos, many companies in this country have been built up over the years in which no dividends and no directors' fees have been paid and the profits have been ploughed back into expanding those businesses.  What is the position in the case of a company like that?  The position is that the shareholders who are liable for wealth tax will have to pay a certain amount of wealth tax based on their personal position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy wants to change feet.  Either the Deputy is not aware of this or is trying to cover it up.  That is one provision in the Bill.  Let us take the more ordinary case: the shareholder concerned is obliged to pay wealth tax in relation <Col N="2265" /> to his shares in a particular company, obliged to pay it in respect of shares on which he has got no dividend and no directors' fees for many years.  What will happen there?  Quite clearly&mdash;and I defy any Deputy opposite to deny this&mdash;what will happen is that the company is then going to pay out to that shareholder by way of dividend or otherwise a sum sufficient, first of all, to discharge his liability for wealth tax on those shares.  That is not the end of the story.  On top of that income tax will be payable so that effectively the amount withdrawn from the company will be approximately twice the amount of the wealth tax concerned. In those circumstances to suggest that the imposition of a wealth tax will have no adverse effect on a trading company is demonstrably nonsense.  Of course it will have an effect.  It will withdraw this money from that company, money which heretofore had been ploughed into the expansion of that company and the creation of new employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am suggesting, Sir, is that what is vitally relevant in <Col N="2266" /> the consideration of the wealth tax is not who is or is not to be affected in the sense of having to pay wealth tax. That is not what this is about.  The question is what will this tax do to our economy?  What will it do to our unemployment figures?  That is the question which every Deputy in this House who contributes to this debate must face and give an honest answer to.  I have tried to demonstrate in regard to different kinds of companies what the effect will be.  The effect clearly will be not alone in some cases the taking away of existing employment but certainly I can safely say in all cases the reduction in the number of new jobs which would otherwise be created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are aspects of this Bill which have the effect of encouraging or favouring foreign investment as against Irish investment.  There can be little doubt but that medium-sized Irish firms are the ones that will be hit most hard, especially family-owned, medium-sized Irish firms.  Again I ask if this is good or bad for our economy?  The answer is quite clear. Of course it is bad for our economy. But there is another and more serious aspect in many ways of this.  Again I am relating this matter to the creation of employment, particularly in manufacturing industry.  We have a body which have been very sensible in their efforts to create new jobs down through the years.  I refer to the Industrial Development Authority. This Authority are, of course, subject to the Government of the day.  One cannot, therefore, expect that they will come out with what I believe is the truth and that is, that their efforts at creating new jobs and attracting investment to this country are being seriously hampered by this wealth tax in particular, and by the Government's general stance.  In substantiation of that I would like to read into the record a letter which I received this morning from Mr. Frank E. Reilly who is Chairman of the Mid-West Chapter of the Ireland-US Council for Trade and Industry, a body with which I had the honour of being associated when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, a body <Col N="2267" /> consisting mainly, though not exclusively, of American investors who have plants in Ireland and which also includes others who had not plants in Ireland but in many cases after they became members and were brought here were induced to set up plants in Ireland.  This is a body which had served very well the purposes of the IDA up to now.  I am not reading the first sentence, which is personal.  Mr. Reilly is also the Chairman of the Board of the Electrographic Corporation of 20 North Whacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois, and he says:</P>
    <P>...Under normal circumstances I would hesitate to comment publicly on tax proposals now pending before your legislative body.  But, as I view it, the damage that may result from the enactment of these measures justifies that I speak out.  The Capital Gains Tax Bill, 1975 and the Wealth Tax Bill, 1975 to the extent that they affect shareholders who do not reside in Ireland are the latest in a series of economic measures which are inconsistent with the promises made by the Government to leaders of the Council to strengthen its policy of encouraging American companies to establish industrial facilities in Ireland. Among the factors which have encouraged American companies to make industrial investments in Ireland are the undertaking made on behalf of the Government that for specified periods profits from sales of industrial products outside Ireland would be tax free and that both profits and investments could be freely removed from Ireland without penalty or limitation.  I am concerned that the current tide of legislation which goes counter to these undertakings would seriously undermine the effectiveness of the Council as a recruitor of American investors for Ireland.  I suggest to you that the permanent damage to this recruiting programme would far out-weigh the benefit of any additional revenue which might be produced by these tax proposals as they relate to American industrial investors and their shareholders. <Col N="2268" /> The economy of the Republic of Ireland is under pressure from so many external forces over which it has no control it would be regrettable if it voluntarily added to the pressure.  I close by stating that while this letter is written in my personal capacity as Chairman of the Board of an American Corporation which is a long time industrial investor in Ireland I am confident that members of Mid-West Chapter of the Council of which I am currently President would affirm the views that I have here expressed.</P>
    <P>The letter is signed, Frank E. Reilly and dated, 6th June, 1975.</P>
    <P>No amount of snide comments or talk about Fianna Fáil aligning itself with big business interests or anything else will get over the truth of this matter.  If Deputy Barry Desmond or any of his colleagues of the Fine Gael or Labour benches will accept my invitation, issued on the Second Stage and re-issued tonight, to come in here and talk on the wealth tax proposals and demonstrate one economic argument in favour of it, I for one will be delighted.  We have not had one so far.</P>
    <P>We had sneering references: we had the &ldquo;I'm all right, Jack&rdquo; philosophy; we had the politics of envy.  Have we had anybody speaking in favour of this Bill who even tried to demonstrate that this Bill and this section in particular will help in one iota the development of our economy, the conquering of the terrible problems we are facing, will produce one productive job, will induce the exportation of anything other than the capital we need or will do anything to reduce inflation?  I invite Deputies opposite to tell us in what way they see the imposition of a wealth tax doing any of these things.  If they cannot, and so far have failed even to attempt to do this, they fall back on the argument of alleged equity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond is now present and since he did not hear what I said earlier I will briefly repeat it.  The Minister for Finance himself has admitted, on the basis of the estimated yield from the whole package <Col N="2269" /> of taxes, that there is no question of redistribution of wealth involved. There is no question of greater equity being achieved.  Even supposing there were, I submit that it would be a legitimate question, and the right one to ask, to say, is this going to help our economy or is it not?  If this is going to reduce employment, even if it were by a small number&mdash;my theory is that it will be by a large number &mdash;could it be justified in a situation in which we have approximately 103,000 unemployed at this time of the year, with the prospects of the situation getting worse?  Can anybody attempt to justify that especially in light of the fact that on the admission of the Minister for Finance there is no question of redistribution of wealth or greater equity being achieved.</P>
    <P>We have to consider the effects of this proposed imposition of a wealth tax without regard to whether it will personally affect any one of us. Frankly, I do not think it is in the slightest bit relevant whether Deputy Barry Desmond or I will be subjected to a wealth tax.  In fact on the Bill as it stands neither of us is going to be affected although with inflation running as it is and with no provision for changing the thresholds one would never know what would happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that one of the most useful things that this debate could produce would be genuine economic, social and equitable arguments in favour of the wealth tax.  I indicated earlier that now, at long last, the Government have acknowledged that the first target and aim of economic policy must be the reduction of inflation.  We have been telling them this for a very long time but at long last they have come to acknowledge it.  When I hear people talking about equity and about the redistribution of wealth, I must confess that my blood boils a little because I do not think the people on that side of the House have any moral right to tell us that this or any other Bill is going to achieve greater equity when they are responsible for the highest rate of inflation of any country in the EEC.  I say that because it is too easily forgotten that if a Government were to set out to redistribute wealth in the wrong way, in <Col N="2271" /> other words to make the poor poorer, there is no more potent weapon they could have than inflation at 25 per cent, except inflation at more than 25 per cent per annum.  I wonder do Deputies realise the enormous and growing inequity that is being produced by inflation?  A simple illustration should bring this home, I think, to everybody.</P>
      <P>Anybody who has any property&mdash; and I am not talking about people of property affected by the thresholds in this Bill&mdash;stands at least to hold his own if not to gain in an inflationary period but the man who has not property, who is depending on his weekly income just to pay for the necessities of life, who cannot own a house, who cannot own any property, what is happening to him as inflation rolls on?</P>

      <P>On section 2 which proposes to charge a wealth tax, I submit it is in order to consider the economic state of the country in the light of the proposed imposition of the wealth tax, what the effect of that imposition would be or what the effect of not imposing it would be.  It is on that basis that I have been discussing the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I think it will be agreed that the outstanding problem of our economy today is inflation and it is impossible to discuss the proposed imposition of a wealth tax without referring to inflation. If we are referring to an imposition of wealth tax as equitable to bring about a redistribution of wealth, I submit it is in order to point out that people who are concerned about this would make far more strenuous efforts <Col N="2272" /> to cut inflation than the Government have made.  This is a Government which have allowed inflation to rip and said they could not do anything about it until other countries do something about it.  Now, when other countries have done something about it, it is still getting worse here.  Equity demands that inflation be tackled.  What answer do we get?  A wealth tax.</P>
      <P>There is difficulty in ascertaining the cost of administration of this proposed wealth tax, certainly in ascertaining it with any degree of accuracy. However, it is quite clear that the cost of administration will be quite substantial and, if the estimates of the Minister for Finance as to the likely yield from the wealth tax have any basis in reality, it is highly possible that the cost of collection will exceed the yield.  This is another reason for questioning the whole thinking behind this.</P>
      <P>I suggest that at a time when we are facing the kind of inflation we are having, the kind of unemployment problem we are facing, the kind of lack of confidence, the kind of dip in production&mdash;there is actually a fall in national wealth rather than a growth &mdash;where the latest statistics indicate a substantial fall in the volume of retail sales, in these circumstances the imposition of a wealth tax can only be regarded as the action of a Government which are trying to engage in diversionary tactics to draw the attention of people away from the real problems of the country.  These are the actions of a Government which just do not know what they are doing. How anybody could regard it as justifiable, not alone to introduce a wealth tax but to spend so much of the time of the Government, of the Minister for Finance, of the Department of Finance on such an irrelevant proposal, irrelevant in the context of the real problems of this country, passes my understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that as far as I am concerned, and as far as this party is concerned, our test in relation to a wealth tax is, will it help or will it hinder our economy?  No snide remarks about people of wealth, or in any other context, can alter that. <Col N="2273" /> That is the real test and that is the test under which the people will operate in due course when they get the chance.  They will ask this Government, when faced with such an enormous economic crisis, what did they do?  When the Government reply that they introduced a wealth tax, they will be asked: &ldquo;What did that do for our economy?  What did that do for the man who is on the dole?&rdquo;. Unless members opposite can give a far more satisfactory answer to that, they will reap the just rewards for this, as I described it before and can only describe it again, fiddling while Rome burns.</P>

Deputy Colley has queried this side of the House as to what advantages there are in this measure from an economic point of view.  He invited anybody here to spell out how in any way this measure could attract capital into the country, how it could help employment, how it might help to cure inflation.  Deputy Colley has made a fair study of the Bill but I do not believe he completely understands it.  In the course of his speech he was guilty of economic and national sabotage.  He was guilty of that by reading out a letter from Mr. Frank Reilly, putting it on the record of this House and leading the House and the country to believe that that letter represented a genuine fear on the part of United States companies.

The shares in these Irish trading companies founded by American undertakings or owned by American trading companies and the shares in the American trading companies are owned by American citizens and neither the trading company here nor the American trading company nor the shareholders in the American trading company will pay one brass farthing of wealth tax under this Bill.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am not one of those people who <Col N="2275" /> go in for inviting people to debate here or there, or for challenges, but I am satisfied that what I have said will stand up, that trading companies here owned by American trading companies are not liable to wealth tax, and neither are the shares in those companies owned by Americans. That is that.  This package cannot be looked upon in complete isolation.  I believe that the measure we are now enacting, taken in conjunction with the abolition of death duties, will prove a great advantage to residents and citizens of the UK to come in here and invest their money because death duties are being retained in the UK.  Not alone are they being retained but they are being strengthened by the introduction there of a gift tax.  These, taken in conjunction with the abolition of death duties here, should, and will in my opinion, prove very attractive to British people who want to come here and invest their money.  That is another way that will prove attractive to foreign investors.</P>
      <P>I want to bring this debate on section 2 down to reality, back to some sanity.  There was an across-the-floor debate on this on Second Stage.  The debate that we are having now is much more a Second Stage debate.  I am not criticising Deputy Colley or the Chair because it is relevant on section 2 because this is the section which charges the wealth tax but we had it all before.  If we are to be critical or are to assess this tax fairly we must look at the position here as the National Coalition Government found it when we came into power.  We found that the pay-as-you-earn system of income tax was introduced in 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the enactment, which provided for the pay-as-you-earn system there was really a free for all here in regard to income tax and capital taxation. Everybody more or less made his own arrangements.  That may be an exaggeration but it is a fair enough picture.  Very many people, who were earning good salaries or good wages, paid no tax.  An income tax inspector never caught up with them and did not know about them.  As from the date <Col N="2276" /> of the introduction of the pay-as-you-earn system of tax everybody earning £6 or £7 a week at that time had to pay the last penny of tax for which he was responsible, right across the board, whether he was a road worker with the county council, a forestry worker with the Department of Lands, a clerk in an office, a skilled tradesman, a professional man or teacher, every one of them had to pay the last penny of tax.  In my opinion, as from then, it behoved the country to have a fair system of taxation in which everybody would contribute his fair share. The Fianna Fáil Government did nothing between 1959 and 1973, when they left office, to introduce a fair system of taxation.</P>

If he had been here earlier he would have noticed that I listened with great patience to Deputy Colley and did not interrupt him when I was satisfied that what he was saying was not in accordance with the facts.  I am saying now that the Fianna Fáil Government did nothing between 1959 and 1973 to rationalise the taxation system.  During that period there was no capital gains tax.  During that period, when values of property increased dramatically, a person could buy a house in 1968 for £3,500 and sell it six years later for £9,500 thereby gaining £1,000 a year free of tax.  It was not regarded as an income but was regarded as a capital gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I speak of a humble transaction like that I am only scratching on the surface of the incomes that were made in this country, thousands upon thousands of pounds by individuals, year after year.  I will not describe anybody as a racketeer but many people quite legitimately and in accordance with the laws had incomes of tens of thousands of pounds per year free of tax while the forestry worker, the national teacher and the self-employed man in a humble way was paying tax on a fraction of these sums of money that went scot free. <Col N="2277" /> That was not fair.  It was a disgrace. It was not just or equitable.  It was indefensible.</P>

I practised as a solicitor for many years in a county which cannot boast of many wealthy people.  It is a county of hard-working people, small farmers and business people.  By 1969 the small businessmen and the farmers of Cavan were worried about death duties.  They were concerned that when the husband died the Revenue Commissioners would invade the farm, the home, or business and beggar the dependants.  I should like to put on the record of the House the <Col N="2278" /> rates of income of death duties which prevailed up to the end of March last.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> £200,000.  In the light of that let us have a look at the type of tax that is going to ruin this country and chase capital out of it and prevent industrialists from coming in.  The threshold of this tax is £70,000 for a single man, £90,000 for a widow and £100,000 for a married couple.  The residence and the contents are exempt.  Speaking of the kind of people we are talking about, we could put the value of the house and the contents in most cases somewhere between £30,000 and £50,000, certainly in Dublin city.  On top of that there is an allowance for each child under the age of 21 of £2,500.  Four children, £10,000.  That amounts to about £150,000 free gratis and for nothing.  Then one pays at <Col N="2280" /> the rate of 1 per cent over and above that.  The difference between that and the death duties we are abolishing was that once one was in for anything one was in for all.  There was an exemption of up to £7,500 when Fianna Fáil left office and we increased it to £10,000 in the first budget but under estate duty law once one got £11,000 one was in for the lot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 of this Bill is the operative section, and in fact it is the section that sets out the whole principle of the Bill.  Deputy Colley challenged the Minister to put forward somebody or anybody on the other side of the House to make some attempt at explaining in what way this Bill will help the economy.  The Minister spoke for a good while and promised he would get to the subject but he sat down without even tackling it.</P>
      <P>He did not give us one iota of reason or example as to how in any way this will benefit the economy, which is in appalling state at the present time.  As a matter of fact, he made the ridiculous statement that it was attractive for a country to have an equitable system of taxation.  What form of taxation is this replacing? The <i>Evening Herald</i> financial correspondent the other evening pointed out that we are the highest taxed country in Europe now.  I did not see anybody making any effort to contradict that, but even if we were not, there is one thing certain in relation to the last two years, that we are the least developed country in Europe, with the highest unemployment rate and the highest rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironical that this Bill should be introduced at the time when the Government, through the Taoiseach, have called in all the sectors of the <Col N="2283" /> economy, the farmers, the trade unions, the industrialists, saying, &ldquo;Please help us; we are in a desperate state&mdash;we do not know what to do&rdquo;. What the Government are doing is adding more and more tax to the people they are purporting to help and if the calculated leaks that are being let out to the Press these days, particularly this morning, have any semblance of truth, they are going to have to eat many of the words spoken in this House on the two budgets and in all the economy debates that have taken place in the past two years.</P>
    <P>Why are we giving incentives to industry?  Why do we give industry a tax-free holiday to enable them to produce?  Why do we seek to protect industry to enable it to produce, because we must export or die as far as this country's economy is concerned? We can only use a fraction of our own production, and the most elementary facts on the economy illustrate the need for us to export more and more; but we are going at the time when the industrialists are crying out for some rescue efforts for the lack of liquidity, when the cash flow has dried up and then competitiveness is being eroded&mdash;why, when we are faced with having to reduce VAT and other taxes that have crippled the country in the past couple of years and driven inflation higher and higher, do we at this particular time bring in new taxes?  Nobody on the other side of the House, no economist or pseudoeconomist in this country, has attempted in any way to explain the madness of producing new taxes at the time when everybody is calling out for relief to enable them to exist.</P>
    <P>I got a reply to a question in this House recently and the number of firms that went into liquidation in the first three months of this year are 127, if I remember it, not taking private individuals into the reckoning at all at all.  We are going to make this country attractive by having wealth tax, capital gains tax, farmers' tax, capital acquisition tax, PAYE, VAT &mdash;tax on everything that one can possibly think of from dogs up to agricultural machinery.  The Minister <Col N="2284" /> for Finance boasted in the House not long ago that, by heaven, this country was not going to be a haven for people coming in here to save tax.  He was right.  It is not going to be a place for anybody with capital who will be in any way encouraged to come in the years ahead or now.</P>
    <P>We depend on investment from every source we can get to build this country up.  It is as simple as that.  Our own resources would never have done if it were not for the capital we attracted from outside and we are rapidly parting with the day when we could hope to keep on attracting that capital.  If I may digress a little, getting away from the industrial side of it altogether, a fairly important aspect in my own country is that emigrants who found it useful to come back when they got their social security pensions, thousands upon thousands of whom were driven out of this country in the period of 1922 to 1932, were coming back to live on their security pensions because they found that they could live here more easily than they could in America, but that day is gone and that trend has changed. There is not the slightest hope of the old homestead being built up to allow the retired emigrants to come back to live on their security pensions, which they could live on at one time. The Explanatory Memorandum says:</P>
    <P>In the case of persons domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State the taxable wealth is the global wealth.</P>
    <P>They will be taxed on everything they own, no matter where it is, so long as they reside here.  That is making perfectly sure that nobody will come here to retire.  It is actually highlighted in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.  I do not know what the Government are thinking about.</P>
    <P>We had reached the happy stage at one time&mdash;and it is not many years ago&mdash;when we saw that capital taxation would have to be studied.  We were far from the day, even then, when we could speak about making it a reality. We were milking the people of all the money we could possibly take from them, and we had to have regard to crossing the danger line when it would <Col N="2285" /> cease to be worth anybody's while to go to the trouble of investing money and giving employment to others. Remember that in private enterprise the profit motive is the prime motive, and if they find that profit is not there, unless they are fools, they are not going to invest.  A number of people have declined to come in here in recent months because of the scare about all this taxation that is being discussed at a time when the economy is literally on its knees.  It is no wonder people have declined to come here.  Nobody can say the number of people who might have come had we not created the situation which gave this country the reputation of being the highest taxed country in Europe.  I cannot see where this is getting us.</P>
    <P>As I said on the Second Stage, you will not help the poor by destroying the rich.  I said that this was a time to withhold this legislation until we reached the stage where people could generate wealth.  Then we could speak about taxing them.  All this talk about the threshold sickens me.  It is like the farmers with the £100 valuation having to pay tax.  The tax is here and it is here to stay and the threshold will be altered every time the Revenue people are pressed to find a new means of making extra money.  There is provision in the Bill to have the rate increased at any time, without reference to this House.  In regard to section 30, the explanatory memorandum says&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We know that the resolution on the Order Paper means that when something is brought before the House the majority is going to ensure that it is bulldozed through if there is going to be any question of opposition to it.  This Bill is unique in that it actually gave notice to the people concerned to get ready to pay their tax before the Bill came before the House at all.  It was payable from April last.  This was surely a prostitution of democracy, assuming that the Bill would go through.  The instructions went out to the people concerned to make provision in their accounts this year for the payment of tax from April, before the Bill even got a mention in the House.  This was an assumption that the House was not relevant; only the motions had to be gone through of putting the Bill before the House, that once it was printed that was notice to those concerned that they would have to pay, and pay they will have to do, because the members of the Coalition will go into the lobby&mdash;even Deputy Maurice Dockrell who is not in agreement with the Bill&mdash;and vote for it because he belongs to a set-up that will do anything except face the country.</P>

      <P>If they go to the country with the arguments they put before this House as to what it is going to do for the economy, then they will have a very poor case on which to face the country.  At the present time the people are witnessing over 100,000 people unemployed and the Taoiseach is crying out to those on the top echelon of the economy to advise him on what is the best thing to do to avoid ruination, and the answer that Deputy Barry Desmond has is: &ldquo;Tax the employer more.  By that means you will create a better situation&rdquo;.  As Deputy Colley said, nobody has attempted to say in what way that could be done, and in what way it will help people. Everybody knows that this new tax is an added impost; it is another blow against private enterprise.  It hastens the day when it will be easier to say that private enterprise does not work and we will have to introduce more nationalisation, more socialism.  There is no gainsaying that.  It is a step towards making it easy to bring about that situation and for that reason certain people will probably like it.  I do not like it and I want to speak the truth about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that what was in the White Paper on Taxation was mandatory on the Government.  We had White Papers on many things and that is the last we heard of them.  The Government need not be guided by anything in the White Paper on Taxation. They need not have acted on it at all.  When they assume that this Bill is going to be bulldozed through the House, they should keep in mind that legislation such as the Mergers and Monopolies Bill, which reached the Second Reading Stage has been relegated to the dusty shelves in the Department and we have not heard of it for months.  There is not even a mention of it.  Why could the same thing not happen this Bill?  At a time when it is essential to shelve it, would this not be one way of restoring a little confidence in the economy at a time when it is so badly needed, if we are going by the very simple elementary rules which must be followed, if we are going to conquer inflation, and if <Col N="2288" /> we are going to get the economy back to the state it was in when this Government took over?  The people of Donegal town wrote me three letters in which they pointed out that this Bill meant ruination in so far as investment in industry is concerned.</P>

      <P>The day when the last employer of labour to any worthwhile extent disappears, Deputy Barry Desmond will be happy.  But that will be the end of him also.  The people who work in good employment with good employers know perfectly well that the best security a man can have is to know that he is employed by a good employer who looks after his business well, who is not on the brink of ruin, who has accumulated sufficient reserves to enable the business to stand against any recession.  These are the men who we are now going to put in the forefront of the taxation battle.  These are the men we have by the throat at a time when the economy needs them so badly and needs more and more of them.  I would like to hear the Minister contradict that.</P>
      <P>If the Bill does not affect many people&mdash;and Deputy Desmond pointed out today that it affected only .002 per cent of the people&mdash;why is it brought in at all if it is going to produce no revenue?

      <P>Because we know that that is not true.  It is a damn lie. It is another new tax which one of these days will affected every employer in this country.  That is why we are opposing it.  It is not the few people the Government speakers contend <Col N="2289" /> will be affected who will in fact be affected.  We know perfectly well who it is going to affect.  It is the thin end of the wedge and it will rapidly wreck the economic ability of every possible worthwhile investor in this country and deter people who were likely, with heavy incentives from the IDA, to set up industry here.  We will be giving it with one hand and taking it from them with the other.</P>
      <P>This comes at a time when the whole confidence of the economy is shaken and was never at so low an ebb since the Coalition was last in power in 1957.  They trickled away the Marshall Aid in the few years they were in office then.  We know the history behind them; we know the background.  We warned the people and the people are now getting an empiric experience of what we told them then was going to happen.

But the Minister made no attempt whatever to show that this Bill is of any assistance to the economy.  He spoke of great thresholds and the extensions that have been given.  In the end I thought he was giving new grants all round to the people concerned, that he was bestowing some benefits on them.  It only needs the shifting of a few commas, the moving of the parentheses in order to change the number of people affected at any given time and to raise the rate that they will be charged just like the other taxes that were brought in recently.  You cannot actually discuss one of these without thinking of the other.  It is a <Col N="2290" /> demonstration of weakness for the Government to bring this Bill before the House at this time.  The whole country knows that this is not the time to bring in a new tax.  Every child in the country knows that.</P>
    <P>The Minister was so hard put to sell ideas about this Bill that he resorted to talking about death duties. Before we have discussed all the sections of this Bill we will find that the death duties are worse now than ever they were before and the people will be paying more and more.  The Minister may laugh but there will come a time when posterity will not thank him for standing in for the Minister for Finance as if there was an urgency about getting this Bill into operation.</P>
    <P>When all the sections of the economy meet one of these days to see in what ways they can rescue the country from the disaster into which it has been plunged would not one of the easiest ways be to hold back two or three of the new taxation Bills until the country has time to build up confidence and get back on its feet again? When we are moving ahead and making progress again, when the economy is expanding and the rate of unemployment is dropping, then you might think of bringing in one or other of these new taxes.  What is the use in the Congress of Trade Unions having to call on their members to forego part of the national wage agreement?  What is the use in the Government having to backtrack from their increases in VAT?  What is the use in having to retract some of the taxes imposed in the recent budget?  It would be much easier to withhold this tax and restore confidence in that way in the country.</P>
    <P>The Government are blind: they are not getting this message from this side of the House alone: they are being told by every economist in the country that this is distasteful legislation introduced against a sombre background of desolation, gloom and despair, at a time when every worthwhile company in the country is on the brink of bankruptcy and when many of them have already gone into liquidation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2291" /> I do not want to delay the House all night on this section.  I would appeal to the Minister to have second thoughts and even when the Committee Stage is over to hold back the Report Stage for a year to see if the country will get back on its feet, if confidence can be restored and see if there will be wealth in the country. We can see if some of the people who generate wealth so that we can distribute it, will be again generating wealth.  Then we could ask them to give a little more to the national economy by way of redistribution of what they are earning.  If we are going to adhere to private enterprise and the profit motive in industry and development we must ensure that the people who invest money get a fair return on the money they invest. Above all, do not tax them on the things they own.  Wars were fought over a long period in this country over ownership of property.  It is the most sacred thing to an Irishman to own what he has and to feel that he is breathing fresh air in the liberty of a free country where at least what he owns is not being taxed, where the pictures on his wall will not be counted or the machinery in his yard considered and where he will not have to make returns to see if he is free, to see if he comes up to the threshold or does not.  Do not leave out people who have such a love for private ownership. Do not put them in a position where the State is going to tax everything they own.  The Government have taken the first definite step towards this now at a time when the country can ill afford it.  I would appeal to the Minister to think seriously at this time when there are so many things to be done to restore confidence and to bring the country back on its feet before he imposes new burdens on the people who count.</P>

      <P>This is a very important section of the Bill.  The Minister is right in saying that this debate has become another Second Stage exercise and that in fact what we are discussing in section 2 is the principle of the Bill and the rate of tax which the Government propose to <Col N="2292" /> impose.  Deputies Colley, Brennan and Fitzpatrick have challenged us to produce genuine economic and social arguments in favour of a wealth tax. There are a number of entirely genuine, rational and objective reasons and also reasons of the utmost social validity for this tax.  The first is the general weight of what I would call responsible economic advice to the Government in terms of reforming the taxation structure and I challenge Fianna Fáil, the new friends of the tiny minority of extremely wealthy people of this country who will be liable for this tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are quite a few very evidently sound economists in Trinity, perhaps a better economics department I would suggest than in UCD although UCD people might be very annoyed <Col N="2293" /> by my saying that.  One will not find one economist in that department, except perhaps the official economist in their party, who would objectively say that the Government are wrong in what they have done in terms of taxation reform.  They might be more parochial, more national, and go to the economics department of the National University of Ireland and talk with an undergraduate, with a junior tutor in economics or with a rank and file student and try and find someone who would agree with them.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil did a good day's work when they set up the ESRI.  A distinguished group of Irish economists and social researchers work there, but none of them has said to me: &ldquo;You are going to ruin the country with this wealth tax.  You are going to destroy the nation.  You are going to act as a major disincentive to employment&rdquo;.  The public servants of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are by reputation people of enormous conservatism. So the story goes.  They are persons who are wont to be the last to be radical in terms of taxation reform. Yet in their wisdom they have suggested to us after years of considering the matter that a wealth tax and the rate of taxation proposed is fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>There we have the Fianna Fáil Party naked in their republican ideology, out-doing the Tories in Britain and out-doing every single conservative party in Europe.  Not even the Gaullists support them on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> They have no wealth tax in France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They have many other similar measures.  Whether one would take the most reactionary of the Swedish or Norwegian parties, the &ldquo;ultra&rdquo; people's land and agriculture party, or take the anti-taxation parties of the Netherlands or the <Col N="2294" /> extreme, conservative elements of the German or the Danish political spectrum, one will not find one political party there who say that a wealth tax would bring ruination to the economic growth of western Europe. They all have wealth taxes and have them in a far more rigorous and stringent way than we are even tentatively introducing here&mdash;it is a very tentative wealth tax, a bit of a mickey-mouse tax&mdash;and apart from a few lords one of them, I think, in Deputy Collins's constituency, who have taken fright, nobody else has forecast the ruination of our economic growth by the imposition of this tax.</P>
      <P>Apart from that and, perhaps Deputy Haughey buying an island off the coast hoping to evade wealth tax, I do not know of anyone who finds himself crucified.  Deputy Colley referred to the politics of envy of which I, presumably, am a living example.  My envy is a sheer envy that I am not in a position to have to pay wealth tax.  If one well-known millionaire who is about the same age as myself, but no longer living here, were to come back tomorrow, he would be paying about £6,000 a year in wealth tax.  That man would no longer invest in Ireland, he would no longer buy newspaper shares, he would no longer have any interest in this country because in the Republic of Ireland he is going to be called upon to pay, as a millionaire, £6,000 a year.  Deputy Colley has practically, politically, bled himself to death on the floor of this House with concern for the contribution of such a person.</P>
      <P>It is about time that the superious neo-republican wealth concern of the Fianna Fáil Party was exposed.  It is a most dangerous thing for a party in Opposition to mix itself among such friends.  Apart from perhaps narrow, transient, political party advantage, there is no long-term advantage for their party in adopting such an attitude.  I will go down to Newcastle West and to Abbeyfeale with Deputy Collins and I will face a cumann any night of the week and talk about the wealth tax.  If they do not vote Labour after that, I will be surprised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We had not the wealth tax then.  We are now in power and we are doing a lot of things. Therefore I suggest to Deputy Colley and to his colleagues that there are evidently fair arguments for this measure. The first principal argument is the kind of argument which I would advance.  Let us say that B. Desmond is a political beggar.  He has not got a bob in his pocket: he pays no tax but, suddenly, let us suppose that he becomes the Earl of Desmond and inherits 3,000 acres of land.  I am now a wealthy man.  I have property and disposable assets.  But, I pay no tax. That is the theory of Fianna Fáil.  It is as simple as that.  If one reads Titmus, Caldor or even Tony Crosland they will find an example of this.  Let us take the case of someone&mdash;say B. Desmond an unfortunate Irish labourer in London with a wife and four children with an income of £30 per week. Probably he does not pay any income tax but if someone owns an empty office block worth £500,000 in London, according to the Fianna Fáil theory he should pay no tax.</P>
      <P>It is a very sane, sound and socialist reason that those who have control of the resources of the State should be the people of Ireland.  Those fortunate enough in Ireland to have control over resources in personal ownership should make a national contribution.  That is all.  There is nothing ultra-Marxist or ultra-socialist about that.  In fact it is now accepted as such conventional social democratic thinking on the Continent that to talk about it one would be thrown out of the most undergraduate economic class.  It is an accepted piece of political truism in Europe and certainly in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sham socialism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that the Fianna Fáil Party, after 16 years of office when they courted the wealthy of this country because they wanted to be all things to all men, when they courted the poor of this country because they wanted to be all things to all men, think they are on a good <Col N="2296" /> thing because a few wealthy taxation experts who represent a few wealthy people in this country have suddenly caught Deputy Colley by the braces and whispered in his ear and said they will be crucified.  Therefore I advance a simple argument, the argument in relation to taxable capacity, that those who have the control and ownership of substantial resources of the nation, and I use nation now in its most catholic sense, have a social obligation to contribute to the revenue and well-being of those who have nothing. That is the first suggestion.</P>
      <P>I would also suggest that this wealth tax&mdash;and this perhaps is one of the other very important reasons why there is a great deal of nonsensical opposition in the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; has a most potent effect and is a very useful, clear mechanism of preventing gross tax avoidance in this country, because a person is obliged under the law to disclose his net wealth by completing a form from the Revenue Commissioners.  It will ensure that the massive tax avoidance which had gone on by some of the new Irish industrial and agricultural rich in this country, some of the massive tax avoidance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Deputy tell us about them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are such people.  A few of them live in my constituency with bloody big farms&mdash; excuse the language&mdash;outside Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and the Deputy would be amazed what they can do.  Up to now we ignored it but it is time that they contributed their fair share in this country.  The introduction of this tax means that a couple of hundred very wealthy individuals will have to disclose their wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, to my personal pride, is the most radical Minister for Finance in this country&mdash; perhaps that is a bit of a backhand compliment because the rest of them have not been very hot anyway, but Deputy Ryan undoubtedly is the best and has a genuine social conscience. Deputy Colley was a previous Minister for Finance, as was Deputy Lynch <Col N="2297" />&mdash;although one almost forgets that fact &mdash;and also Deputy Haughey who is a raving conservative at the moment with regard to taxation matters.  He has got terrible in old age, apart from making a few provisions for artists and so on.  In retrospect he has not been very good and the prospect is not very hopeful.  Therefore, the second reason I give is that it certainly reduces tax avoidance quite substantially.</P>
    <P>The third reason I would give is that the current classification which we have in Ireland will now broaden with capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax.  The traditional classification of earned income, investment income and a narrowing down of tax based on these two criteria will certainly be broadened, and that is necessary in terms of ensuring that those who have wealth in our community pay their fair and just share and no more.  It ill becomes Fianna Fáil coming into this House saying that we of the National Coalition expect sacrifices from wage and salary earners, from public service employees and from private sector employees.  They have the gall to come into this House and put forward a perverse theory that those with wealth should pay nothing. I would not mind if they said a wealth tax at 1/2 per cent.  We are only charging 1 per cent of assessable wealth in this country, but they demand total exemption. They had the hell of a nerve to speak of the 750,000 insured workers earning a weekly salary, who will not have to pay wealth tax, who do not suffer particularly from envy&mdash;I do not envy anybody because it is not worth it, I discovered that long ago.  Therefore, to suggest that we on the Coalition side are merely going through an exercise in the politics of envy is a sign of the political immaturity of the Fianna Fáil Party in this regard.</P>
    <P>The fourth reason I give, and it is a reason which is so traditional now that it boggles the imagination that Fianna Fáil cannot appreciate the point, is that wealth tax ensures that in the Republic of Ireland the resources of this country will be used productively and efficiently.  I quote as my source for that the most respected and revered <Col N="2298" /> individual in Irish fiscal policy, the governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, a man who is not wont to make extravagant, socialist, Marxian, radical, heretical claims about taxation, has time and again said the taxation system of this country should ensure that there is no, what he calls, &ldquo;idle money&rdquo; knocking about; the wealth tax will ensure that.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, there is nothing to stop me if I have £500,000 buying a couple of tons of gold; I could take up the floor boards in my home and bury the gold under them and sit on my wealth.  If, however, there is a wealth tax, that is an incentive to me to make use of my wealth productively.  That is part of the main reason why we have an efficient use of resources and wealth is used more productively when it is liable to being assessed for taxation.</P>
    <P>I would advance as one of four principal arguments that a wealth tax is a very useful and essential tax for discouraging wasteful investment.  I am quite certain some of the empty office blocks one sees in London and in the greater Dublin area are there because people just sit on their wealth and are not anxious to derive any income from it.  Why should they worry about an income when the property is appreciating all the time?  They are paying no tax.  Why bother about this problem of income?  Therefore, they sit on valuable national resources and the introduction of a wealth tax ensures there is substantial discouragement of wasteful investment.</P>
    <P>I will give three other reasons.  They are the classical reasons; they are the reasons why every country in Europe has introduced a wealth tax, France&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There will be such a flood of investment that we will not know what to do with it. Already we are getting plenty of it. <Col N="2299" /> I had an inquiry last week asking me was this Bill what the Minister really intended to do?  Would there be amendments on Committee Stage? The particular person was thinking of buying a couple of thousand acres of land here.  He was not a socialist but he came to me because he thought I might endeavour to have the proposals amended.  He was coming to Ireland because he would be clobbered in Britain.  Those Members who are whining here on behalf of the few who whispered into their ears should ponder on that.  They should ask Ganlys how many demands they have on their books from those who want to buy farms here.  There is plenty of money coming from Britain.  People are screaming for land here because there is a 50 per cent discount&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>My own relations in the Bronx in New York&mdash;they are not wealthy people; they have a few bob to pay their local taxes, State taxes, Federal taxes, social security taxes&mdash;would love to come to live in Ireland and have the benefit of our income tax laws.  Of course, retired Yanks come to Ireland, I make the point to underline the situation.  I have given the reasons.  I will just sum them up. First of all, those who control the resources of the nation as individuals should from their personal wealth make a contribution at national level. <Col N="2300" /> Secondly, the wealth tax will end massive evasion and avoidance.  It will be a salutary and a necessary mechanism. Thirdly, it eliminates the differential we have had between earned income and investment income. Fourthly, it ensures the efficient use of all our resources so that such resources are used more productively. Fifthly, it discourages wasteful investment; it ensures that money is put to productive use which is, of course, why trading companies are exempt. Deputy Fitzpatrick is a much more sensible man than he is pretending to be in this debate.</P>
    <P>This tax will reduce inequality in the distribution of wealth in the same way as progressive income tax over a period reduces inequality.  Are Fianna Fáil opposed to income tax? Are Fianna Fáil opposed to a 60 per cent or an 80 per cent rate at the higher levels of income?  If they are opposed to the wealth tax they must be.</P>

      <P>I do not have up-to-date data in relation to the number of shareholders in this country but I understand that the shareholding community is pretty widely diffused.  It may be that a certain newspaper proprietor has £1 million stacked away; there may be, perhaps, about 20 or 30 people here who may have stockholdings and shareholdings which, in effect, bring them well within the tax net but the vast majority of my constituents have not got this wealth.  In a constituency, which has the highest number of individual shareholders in any part of the State, 99.4 per cent, I would estimate, of my shareholders will not be liable for wealth tax.  To suggest that a 1 per cent levy will crucify them and destroy the value of their share-holdings <Col N="2301" /> is economic theory turned on its head.  I will give a classic example. Take an extreme example, a millionaire in Ireland; under section 2, liability at 1 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A millionaire in this country would be doing badly if he did not have a house worth £50,000, not a fantastic house but a nice comfortable one, so we will give him £50,000.  Furniture and effects, not works of art, which would be liable because he would not be putting them on display, we will give him a few nice carpets, some Waterford glass in a £50,000 house, let us make it £20,000&mdash;not outrageous.  That is what he has.  Anybody worth a million pounds would be foolish if he did not cover himself for £50,000 life insurance.

      <P>Under the National Coalition Government do you know what we are giving this man in threshold exemptions already without a penny liability because the 1 per cent does not even come into it?  We are giving him a quarter of a million pounds exemption.  Fianna Fáil are screaming about this on the floor of this House.  He is a millionaire so we have given £250,000 in exemptions so far.  He has £750,000 left.  Let us break it up so that there will be no land involved, because Deputy Brennan does not want land to be covered at all.  We will give him £300,000, for the sake of argument, in Irish securities and £450,000 in British securities.  He gets nothing off the British, but he gets 20 per cent off the Irish so his liability there is around £240,000.  I assess it, taking into account the quarter of a million pounds threshold exemptions, and the 20 per cent off the Irish portion of his wealth that his nett liability would be around £690,000.  That is a lot of money to be liable for, but what has he got to pay out?  1 per cent of £690,000.  He is a millionaire and his annual contribution to the Irish Republic as an Irishman will be £6,900 per annum.</P>

      <P>He goes to the Netherlands and finds a threshold level there of £6,800 for persons under 35 or £9,000 for a married or single person over 35 and he gets a mere £2,500 for each child.  If the person is aged 65 and over after all that travelling he gets a mere threshold in the Netherlands of £6,000.  The threshold level in relation to the wealth tax has boggled the minds of many tax experts and some of them found it to be so generous I confidently expect from the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Sweden and Norway to see a substantial capital inflow into this country. For example, in Norway, a country of vastly greater wealth, the taxation threshold level for the wealth tax is a mere £5,700.  In Sweden it is a mere £19,000.  There is the argument in relation to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>I make the point to Deputy Colley and Fianna Fáil that they read <i>An Annual Wealth Tax</i> by Sandford, Willis and Ironside, the 1975 edition. The arguments for and against the wealth tax are given in it and the threshold levels for various countries are also given in it.  I shall quote the threshold levels in respect of quoted stocks and shares.  May I, for example, give the level in respect of real property? Deputies opposite should listen to this rather enlightened reaction in relation to Denmark:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four-yearly valuations generally <Col N="2306" /> a little below market value.  Flats are assessed on capitalised rental value.</P>
    <P>That would be a right one for here if people were caught under it and they are not.  In Germany:</P>
    <P>Irregular valuations.  Current figures based on 1964 values, increased by 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the Netherlands the wealth tax is based on:</P>
    <P>Open market value&mdash;but occupied houses (whether by owner or tenant) valued at two-thirds open market.</P>
    <P>Similarly, farms are reduced, not 50 per cent but valued at two-thirds. The Netherland farmer has a heavier penalty as against the Irish farmer, provided, of course, he has a farm worth about £450,000 to find himself liable for wealth tax here.  He would want to be nearly half a millionaire before he would pay £1,000 a year in wealth tax.  In Norway it is in principle open market value, but values fixed by local tax boards.  In Sweden it is quinquennial valuation at 75 per cent of market value.  That is in relation to property.  In Ireland, of course, we have exempted agricultural land up to £200,000 assessed at 50 per cent of the market value, any excess at 100 per cent of market value, for &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; farmers.  That is the situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote to Deputy Brugha, who has an obsession with the value of shareholding.  What we are suggesting here is conventional.  For example, in Denmark it is a stock exchange value at 1st January; in Germany, stock exchange value at 31st December; Netherlands, stock exchange value at 1st January; Norway, stock exchange value at 1st January; Sweden, stock exchange value at 31st December and in the Republic of Ireland the open market value at valuation date.  In England they propose to have the stock exchange value at valuation date.  Mr. Healey, the British Chancellor, has not yet fixed it but I have no doubt he will not be half as generous as what we expect.  In relation to France d'Estaing and his colleagues have been <Col N="2307" /> introducing legislation of a fiscal and monetary reform nature at virtually one Bill per day.</P>
    <P>There has been a phenomenal change in taxation attitudes in France. My socialist colleagues, who are now very strong in France and the European Parliament, have assured me that country for country there will be very few Frenchmen complaining about the Irish wealth tax by the time they get what is in the pipeline in France in terms of the overall package. Therefore, to ask: &ldquo;What about France?&rdquo; and plead special exemption is something I do not expect.  Fianna Fáil have not yet discovered that the model of Germany was modelled in Prussia in 1893.  At this stage I expect Fianna Fáil to propose a Bill calling for the abolition of income tax, calling for the abolition of social insurance and of value-added tax.  Their opposition to this Bill is spurious.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Colley that my appeal is not to the politics of envy but it is to the politics of social justice and social realism in relation to taxation reform here; the politics of social justice and equality of distribution of wealth, whether it is the wealth of the humblest farmer or industrial worker or of the most wealthy industrialist or agriculturalist.  I hold no special envy in my approach.  I hold the envy of reform and I do not accept the arguments put forward by Fianna Fáil that the wealth tax will destroy entrepreneurial initiative here. I know of no evidence of it and I have not met it, apart from hearing a letter read out from Chicago tonight.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the IDA it may be that Fianna Fáil have a few friends left in the IDA and that they are being fed a little propaganda by a few people who are finding the going rough.</P>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge when the IDA have explained to visiting industrialists from Germany or any of the sophisticated European countries, they know the taxation levels and they are not conned by party propaganda from either side.  They are careful men.  They do their sums.  They come in to the Irish Congress of <Col N="2308" /> Trade Unions and ask us what the rate is for a skilled fitter in Tarbert, County Kerry; what they would have to pay if they opened up a new factory in Newcastle West, or in Limerick city.  They want and get those figures.  They are not taxation ignoramuses, as implied by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that the economic policy of the National Coalition Government is acting as a disincentive to the development of manufacturing industry.  In no way are we acting in such a disincentive manner.  We fully understand and appreciate the role of those who are investing their savings, personal incomes and wealth and we appreciate it in terms of investment into the Irish economy, whether it is money into a building society or into a small family-owned concern&mdash;and there would have to be a fair bit of money in the family or in the concern, say, yourself and your father, one or two brothers and a wife.  By the time they all get their exemption, the threshold exemptions and so on, by the time you have many exclusions, you would want to be a fair-sized farmer before your individual liability would amount to even 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest to Fianna Fáil that the arguments we put forward represent the reality of the situation. I do not accept the arguments put forward by Deputy Colley.  I refute them. I think they are dangerous in this country because the more the spotlight focuses on the inequalities of real wealth in this country, the more we talk about this Bill, the more we explain to the people, the more indeed will the people ask: &ldquo;What are Fianna Fáil really talking about?&rdquo; I have spoken to Fianna Fáil men who are staunch party supporters and there will always be Fianna Fáil, fair dues to them, they have every right to be, who have spoken to me about the obstruction of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to capital gains tax.  They came into this House, two or three of them, and Deputy de Valera, with the shadow of republican financial spokes-manship sought to be shifted on to his shoulders, spent 70 hours&mdash;with two <Col N="2309" /> or three Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side and one Minister on this side&mdash; on the Committee Stage of the Capital Gains Tax Bill and all Fianna Fáil could threaten was the kind of browbeating which Deputy O'Malley went on with when he said that as a trueblue republican, he would never disclose the financial affairs of a client, not even to the Revenue Commissioners, even if he was legally liable to do so.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of obstruction we get from Fianna Fáil.  That is the kind of national concern Fianna Fáil have. That is the kind of sense of social responsibility which that party have displayed. Frankly I would be ashamed to be known as a republican with such narrow introverted special ideological hang-ups as the Fianna Fáil Party have in relation to the wealth tax.  My advice to them is: listen to the plain people of Ireland.  They will tell you what they know about the wealth tax. Do not listen to those who are either trying to evade tax or who have made a living out of advising those who are trying to evade tax.</P>
    <P>Do not listen to them because they are not what I call the ordinary people of Ireland who are paying their taxes and earning their living, working as businessmen in the ordinary practice of this country, building up our exports. They have nothing to fear about wealth tax or from capital gains tax.  They know the score, and indeed I think that some of the accountants and some of the solicitors who yet have to make returns to the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;I am glad the Revenue Commissioners will have an opportunity of examining some of those returns because it is about time that some of the more shady, more obscure aspects of wealth in Ireland were examined and not, I would suggest, the genuine creation of productive assets in this country which the governor of the Central Bank so rightly loves.  I share those views as well as the views of Deputy Ryan, because there is no man in this country &mdash;even though he may be a solicitor and so on&mdash;who has shown a greater sense of responsibility, a greater sense of being not just unhappy but <Col N="2310" /> determined to root out idle money in this country, easy speculative money and make sure that the people pay their fair taxes.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Desmond has left the House.  His first reason was the responsible economic advice, as far as I could follow it, of economists and he referred to Trinity College.  That is not a reason; it is merely the opinion of an unnamed economist.  One reason, which I wrote down, that he attached to the first one was that is would be no benefit to Fianna Fáil to take up opposition against the Bill, and I would agree with the Deputy that it cannot be of much value to Fianna Fáil if the only measuring rod involved in this debate is the measuring rod of envy.  The basic reason why Fianna Fáil are opposing this Bill at this stage in our economic development is the state of our economic development and I will go into the comparison later on.</P>
      <P>The second point made by him, the disclosure of assets, is one that I do not disagree with.  If there is serious evasion, then there is some advantage to the economy, to the taxpayer even arising out of the necessity under this Bill to disclose assets.  His third point that those who have wealth should pay their fair share is a point that Fianna Fáil entirely agree with.  But the differences in opinion between us and the Government at this stage is the effect of a wealth tax.  Ordinarily, the few who possess the vast amount of wealth that is being spoken about pay tax normally up to 75 per cent.  As was published in some of our magazines recently, if the winding up of companies is any indication of even a fraction of what the effect of this tax has been, a considerable amount of capital has been moved out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond's first reason was that our resources should be used productively <Col N="2312" /> and efficiently, and I agree with that.  As I see it, the only valid reason for this kind of tax is, first, that it would have the effect of redistributing wealth.  The 1 per cent tax could not possibly have that effect. The inheritance tax Bill which is going through the House could, to some degree, have that sort of effect.</P>
    <P>The second reason I would put forward if I were supporting this Bill is that it would provide tax revenue. We have the Minister's assurance and our own reasonable assessment that it is not going to provide tax revenue. The Minister said this evening that it is virtually an innocuous tax and I agree with him.  I do not know why Deputy Barry Desmond should describe the Minister for Finance as radical.  In the eyes of Deputy Desmond a tax of this kind with a threshold of £100,000 could not be described as radical.  The great majority of people, including myself, the Minister and Deputy Collins, will not be affected by this Bill in any way.</P>

      <P>The question I have to put to the Minister is, if it is innocuous, why did he run away from reality and introduce it at this stage? Why could not the Minister for Finance, despite his Labour colleagues, have followed the example of the Australian Labour Government and postponed the introduction of taxes of this kind at least for a reasonable period until there was some kind of economic recovery?  This would be helpful for the economy and would help to provide work for people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I cannot understand about the present Government in relation to this kind of tax is why they have not learned some lesson from the history of this nation, because even in our recent history up to the end of the first quarter of this century and possibly coming up to the last war, our history was one where people of enterprise, energy and initiative had to leave this country in order to earn a living.  From time to time I have heard <Col N="2313" /> Members from all sides of this House taking some pride in the achievements of Irishmen all over the world, in the US, in Canada, in South Africa, in Australia, in South America and so on.  Our history shows that the vital energy and enterprise that was needed&mdash;and it is still needed&mdash;to build an economy, left the country and created wealth for other nations.  I find it difficult to understand why, when we are, one might say, half way through the development stage of our economy&mdash;or were, up to a couple of years ago&mdash;a tax of this kind, which will discourage the flow of capital, should have been introduced.  That is the basic reason for my opposition to that sort of tax at the present time.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the arguments put forward by the Minister for Finance the other night and by Deputy Barry Desmond this evening when he makes comparisons with countries like West Germany, Belgium, Denmark or any other EEC countries which may have tax of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <P>It is a theoretical assumption of some kind, because these economies are sophisticated, fully developed economies.  It may be that too many members of the Government live in Dublin city and do not really understand the nature of things; I would exclude the Minister for Lands from that.  We know that our economy is not developed.  We know that, despite the good work done by Governments since the establishment of the State, the economic takeoff here did not occur until the late 1950s.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance the other evening gave as one of the reasons for this introduction of the tax package as he called it, the fact that a promise had been given in 1973.  That is true. That promise was given in the 14 points, but that was in 1973.  That was at a stage where the present Government had taken over the economy in, if I might say so, pretty good condition. <Col N="2315" /> This is not 1973: this is June, 1975.  We are now in the middle of a period of considerable recession.  It is no time to discourage capital investment, energy or enterprise.</P>
    <P>This side of the House was critical of the first and second budgets introduced by the Minister for Finance.  We said that the extraordinary range of taxes, particularly value-added tax, could have only one effect, that of running down the economy; that the serious over-borrowing and taxation could only increase the level of what was serious inflation arising from the oil crisis.  It is now two years after the change in the economy has come about: it is only today that we hear of any sort of steps to try to deal with the economic problems.  I can only surmise from reading the papers that the suggestions mentioned this morning about reducing value-added tax which is something we recommended nine months ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>These suggestions may be the result of an awakening on the part of the Government to the fact that things are serious and that it is time they pulled themselves together and tried to get the economy back into order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not regard the level of tax in this legislation as being of any great consequence.  Despite what Deputy Desmond said about his economist friends I assure the Minister that the influence on potential investment here of the White Paper and of the pending taxes, particularly wealth tax, has been very considerable.  I could quote some cases where industry has not established here.  In these circumstances one can only know of cases that one knows personally.  The Minister should be in a position himself to find out how the IDA is doing.  The overall effect of the tax package, particularly this tax, has had a damaging effect on our prospects of introducing industries.  There is in addition the fact that the fiscal policy being followed by the Government has been criticised by both the Central <Col N="2316" /> Bank and the EEC.  The Government have been warned that over-expenditure and over-borrowing can only lead to greater inflation.  That is the problem that the Government is facing at the moment.  The inflationary problem is the most serious one.  We heard Deputy Brennan say earlier that in reply to a question he was told that 127 firms had gone into liquidation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I have information leading me to believe that at least 50 fairly significant industries have notified the trade unions that they cannot pay the current national wage award. This is a serious situation for any economy to be in.  Up to date, we have had no practical proposals to deal with the inflationary situation.  West Germany, with which apparently some Deputies on the Government side like to compare us, is an economy which had a 7 per cent inflation rate, which has now been reduced to 6 per cent.  We are talking about making comparisons with that economy.  Our inflation rate last year was, I believe, 17.9 per cent and this year it is estimated to have gone up to 23 per cent at least.  People who are talking about European countries that are fully developed and making comparisons with them as if this was a wealthy, fully-developed economy are people who are simply not responsible.  I hope that the members of the Government who have talked along that line will stop doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should face up to the fact that no efforts have been made to deal with inflation; there are no practical proposals coming from the Government that could help the exporting companies to hold their markets in countries where the inflation level is well and truly below that of ours, countries where our companies have secured markets to which they have been exporting goods.  That is where this Government will suffer the consequences later on when this inflationary wage spiral has taken its full effect.  With the possible exception of Britain which has a similar level you cannot have wage inflation at our present level and retain markets <Col N="2317" /> in countries with inflation rates from one quarter to two-thirds lower than our levels.</P>

      <P>The Minister may have something there, but he is aware of the very significant increase in the level of exports in 1973 and 1974. Both sides of the House are very pleased with this.  There is a natural concern, and it is not because we are in Opposition, about the effect of the inflationary rate on our export prospects, because Irish employment is involved.</P>
      <P>As I said the other night some businessmen I have been meeting in the past three months believe that a bunch of schoolboys have got hold of the economy and do not know what to do with it or in what direction to point it.  The type of businessmen I am talking about are those who have not any political affinity with this side of the House.  I can assure the Minister that during the past three or four months, I have met very many of them who have that viewpoint of the performance of the Government in the economic sphere.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason that we are mainly concerned about this particular tax.  I do not see any strong objections to the gift and inheritance taxes.  I was sensible enough to realise that when the Minister's Government promised to remove death duties they would have to be replaced by some other kind of tax, and the inheritance and gift tax is a replacement for the death duties on which the Coalition Government based a part of their campaign more than two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of a level of capital gains tax.  I am sorry that Deputy Desmond has left the House, because I should like to ask him the question that Deputy Colley put to him earlier: why did he vote against the Fianna Fáil proposal of a 50 per cent level of capital gains in the first year?  The object of that was, despite what Deputy Desmond may have to say <Col N="2318" /> about Fianna Fáil, that we are in favour of as high a level of taxation as possible on speculative development, on easy money, and on the kind of thing that Deputy Desmond and his friends talk about, but upon which, apparently, they are not prepared to act.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: - Veterinary Dispute.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank you for affording me the opportunity of raising this very urgent public matter on the Adjournment.  I should like to know at the outset why the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is not here tonight.  He is one of the people who has taken a particularly stubborn line on this and he should be here. He is one of the people who, during the past week, have consistently refused to meet members of the veterinary profession.</P>
      <P>This strike is of fairly recent origin. It was because of the attitude with which the veterinary profession were treated by the Department officials and the Minister that the present situation has arisen.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in a parliamentary reply to me two weeks ago, without any provocation used the word &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; in respect of a group that had already postponed their strike earlier in the year. Vincent Browne, in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of last Thursday week, took a small quotation from a statement made by the Minister and it reads as follows:</P>
      <P>I chose this time for a strike.</P>
      <P>It was, therefore, the Minister who in effect called the strike and gave reasons why a strike would have been better at this time.  Surely with a shortage of grass at the moment and with the glut of cattle that will arise due to this strike, can we say at this stage who is responsible and who is irresponsible?  The veterinary profession already put back their strike last February and only decided to go ahead with it when confronted by the Minister on 16th May and told:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2319" />&ldquo;This is my decision.  There will be no discussion; there will be no negotiations.&rdquo; That was said despite the promise made to give the veterinary profession four months' notice of such an intention.  The Minister announced that publicly on 16th May and also in conversations with the President of the Veterinary Association.</P>
    <P>What was the Minister's attitude some time ago to the veterinary profession? Speaking at a dinner of the IVA on 29th September, 1973, Mr. Clinton said that we depend on the veterinary practitioners, that he had faith in their ability to deliver the goods, that as long as they continue to do so he would offer them full involvement in State programmes for disease eradication over at least the next five years, that he would encourage them to make plans accordingly, that their State work and private practice could be serviced amicably and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>Those are the people the Minister praised: he now calls them irresponsible. While the possibilities were there of the strike being averted, the Minister has ruled them out.  It has now made some of the veterinary surgeons, who were very moderate and reasonable people, hard and bitter in this strike.  No such language was used to any other worker.  When the dockers in Dublin gave notice of strike this week, the Minister for Labour acted on Friday night, yet the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has refused to accept the services of a mediator.  This is stubbornness and pig-headedness at this stage.  Although he denied it to me, the Minister already had been offered a mediator on the previous night.  He has since been offered mediators and has refused.  The Irish Veterinary Union are prepared to meet and talk with him but he refuses to act.  The consequences of his action are that 2,000 people were laid off from employment last week.  At the present moment we have reports from all over the country that up to 8,000 workers will be let go at the end of this week.  The action to avert that type of lay-off which would add to the <Col N="2320" /> 103,000 people already unemployed a further 8,000 plus all the service jobs that will go with that, is now in the hands of the Minister, but he is refusing to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of lay technicians being involved in this.  The Department of Agriculture have tried to emphasise this point and have continually said that lay technicians could do the work, and I stress the words they used, better and cheaper.  I will argue that later on, but at this stage I would like to explain the position in which the veterinary surgeon finds himself in a rural practice.  First, he is not now being called generally by farmers except in cases of grave necessity and of extreme urgency.  Most of the work he is doing is heavier, the handling type of work. The veterinary practitioner who wishes to earn a high income must be prepared to work by day or night, suffer many injuries in the course of his work and he must be always available in all kinds of weather.  He has to bear the cost of his own transport, surgical implements and medical equipment.  He spent five years going through a costly university course to get into that profession. If a veterinary surgeon becomes ill today, it is at his own expense. If he decides to take a holiday, that, too, is at his own expense.  As he grows older he will lose the potential for earning in private practice and indeed will not be up to the mark for the competition with younger vets.  Of course, his general practice is also affected by the trend we have here today, the reduction in the price of animals.</P>
    <P>The Department have thrown all the muck that it was necessary to throw at the veterinary profession last week when they announced that £24,000 was made by one veterinary surgeon.  I am sure every Member of this House, and every member of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in particular, including the Minister, knows that no veterinary surgeon was capable of earning £24,000 in one year.  In fact, the man who was referred to has five assistants to whom he has to supply five cars, pay for petrol for the five cars, pay for secretaries and pay for his own <Col N="2321" /> administration costs.  That was particularly irresponsible of the Department and, indeed, of the departmental officials who were involved in this.  I believe that the Minister has been totally misled by his officials and, unfortunately, he has now put himself in a corner where he is left with very little room for manoeuvre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am explaining how the Minister got the blame.  If I may quote from the <i>Irish Farming Independent</i> of Saturday, 7th June:</P>
      <P>Just how wise Mark Clinton was in taking the advice he was given and how well &ldquo;informed&rdquo; he was time alone will tell.  But it now appears that the only way in which the present situation can be solved is through some form of &ldquo;give and take&rdquo; on both sides.</P>
      <P>That give is on the veterinary union's side.  It is not on the side of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister.  It goes on to say further down in the article:</P>
      <P>It appears that some very strong pressure is being used to influence the profession within the Department by the &ldquo;Admin&rdquo; men in the Service, who apparently feel that they know more about how the veterinary side of the Department's activities should be run than the members of the veterinary profession working within the Department.</P>
      <P>The position was that the Minister guaranteed the factories that there would be no doubt whatsoever but that meat exports would continue. How well informed was he, or what sort of advice had he taken to remind him that no member of any trade union was going to be used as a blackleg in a strike situation?  He was, in fact, asking veterinary colleagues, in the rural areas particularly, who would have to work with the vets who were on strike, to act as blacklegs in this situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to call them scabs in such a situation and expect them, when the strike was over, to go back to work with them again.  It was not doing the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries at local level any good. I am glad to say that the Veterinary Officers' Association did not succumb to that type of intimidation.</P>
      <P>We have now a situation where the Minister, in reply to me, stated that their position would be considered under the Civil Service Regulations, 1956, which is in itself intimidation and a threat.  Now we have the position that this strike can escalate totally, that the veterinary association have applied to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for an all-out picket if any of them is dismissed.  Again, I believe that there was some effort made to try to use the members of the Agricultural Officers' Association. I have read the reports in the papers and heard the newscasts on this matter and the statements made by their union or association that they would not take any part in that.</P>
      <P>Now we have the position when it comes to the costings of these items. The Minister has continued to blame the vets for the lack of progress in the eradication scheme which was due to be completed by 1977.  All the available advice is that it will be many more years after 1977 which, I understand, would be acceptable to the EEC provided that we were making a sincere effort.  I think that effort is being made but it is not being made from the follow-up afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not deny that there are some veterinary surgeons who are not doing their jobs.  There are some politicians in this House who are not doing their jobs.  There are some Ministers in this House, many Ministers in fact, who are not doing their jobs at the present time.  There are also people in every walk of life, including the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, who are not doing their jobs.  There is a method by which the Department and the Minister can take action against those people.  They may lose their right to practise as professional people should they continue on those lines but, in fact, we have had no proof at <Col N="2323" /> all from the Minister or the Department of this large-scale lack of concern by the veterinary association.</P>
    <P>I have heard&mdash;in common with many other Deputies particularly on this side&mdash;that the veterinary union will discipline and will take very strong action against any member they find not fulfilling his full duties. I have found them most reasonable people to talk to and most reasonable in their concern.  We have the position where the veterinary surgeons' incomes at the moment are reduced by 50 per cent.  The costings by the Department have stated that it would be cheaper to employ lay technicians. Of course, we know the comparison they make as between England and Northern Ireland; so let us take an average of the Northern Ireland costs.</P>
    <P>The non-veterinary personnel on average salary would earn £1,880 to £2,846, that is from 1st March, 1975 and not including the pay increase this year.  The mileage rate would be, on average, in the region of £0.097 up to 4,000 miles, £0.047 over 4,000 miles and £0.129 up to 4,000 miles for 12 horse-power cars and so on.  So, in fact, the calculation would roughly come down in average cases to a non-veterinary person's salary at £2,363. Travelling would be about £20 per week for 47 weeks, superannuation at the minimum rate of 8 per cent would be £185, subsistence allowance of 60p a day for 47 weeks would be £141, social welfare stamps from the employer would be £1.84 per week or £96 per annum, pay-related contribution from employers would be 2 per cent of the gross salary and would amount to £47 and protective clothing and laundry would be £40.  That comes to a grand total of £3,812 per annum. That is not the full cost because they are not taking into account the training of these people and other items for instance, contact with brucellosis. If one of these people contracted brucellosis, who is liable for any illness that may occur and any pension that might arise out of it?</P>
    <P>The veterinary supervision inspection of these people would be in the <Col N="2324" /> region of £810 on average per year, the veterinary service travel expenses would be £250 and the superannuation for a veterinary inspector would be £65.  The total veterinary supervision of those people who would be involved in that situation would be £1,196 added to the cost, which makes a total of £5,008 for each individual. That does not include the cost of recruiting and training lay personnel and the increased administrative and staff costs which will be necessary should lay personnel be introduced.</P>
    <P>It is an important matter for the farming community because at the moment they are getting a subsidised rate from the veterinary surgeons.  If veterinary surgeons did not have the Department's fees, then the cost of calls to the farmer would be higher. If any of this work is withdrawn from members of the veterinary association we will have a fairly sizeable amount of emigration. Already I have evidence that some young vets in my own constituency are emigrating very shortly to Australia and Canada.  If they go, it means that there will not be so many vets, the distances to be travelled will be longer, expenses will be higher and the farmers will have to pay higher fees.  No farmer has ever been refused service from a vet.  Often when he goes out to look at an animal, he does not charge the farmer providing he is doing testing in his house.</P>
    <P>If this strike continues it will cause havoc, not only to our cattle trade, not only to our meat trade, the markets concerned and the contracts that have been drawn up, but there will be a loss of about £5 million to our export trade this week and next week.  This is because of the stubborness of the Minister, because of the attitude he adopted last November and last January, and, above all, because of the insincerity when he promised he would look into their case and promised a formal notice of decision; but he refused to do that.  He chose this time for a strike, on his own admission.</P>
    <P>It is time that the Minister met the Veterinary Union, before there is a hardening of attitude and an escalation <Col N="2325" /> of the strike which might involve every official in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries concerned in this matter.</P>

      <P>It is peculiar, indeed, that we should have this kind of contribution from Deputy Davern at a time when we are honoured by a visit from the EEC Ministers.  He asked why the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is not present.  The Minister is acting as host to his colleagues from the EEC today.  He is accompanying them on visits to farmers to try to impress upon them the importance of agriculture to this country.  The work is similar to the work being done by Deputy Mark Clinton, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, since he took office two years ago.</P>
      <P>In the time at our disposal, let us examine the position so far as this dispute is concerned.  First of all, we have been endeavouring to eradicate bovine TB for some 20 years now and brucellosis since 1966.  It is quite true to say that we have not made the headway we anticipated when we embarked on these schemes; it would not be in the interests of our agricultural industry to give statistics, but the unfortunate position is that we have not made sufficient headway and, during all these years, the veterinary officers had sole control of both schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as salaries are concerned, the Minister has already given this information to the House and to the Seanad. Since we embarked on these schemes they have cost the Irish taxpayer £83.7 million up to the end of 1974.  Of that £83.7 million, £28.7 million was paid to the veterinary profession.  Were they or were they not paid reasonable fees? That is a matter for people, particularly the agricultural community, to determine. The Deputy blames the alleged stubborn line adopted by the Minister. The Minister did not adopt a stubborn line so far as this dispute is concerned, if one may use the expression.  In actual fact, the Minister has gone out of his way to try to meet the demands of the veterinary profession, because he realises the importance of our cattle <Col N="2326" /> export trade, the importance of keeping our factories in production and the benefits that will accrue to both those engaged in agriculture and those working in these factories.</P>
    <P>He suggested to the veterinary surgeons that we employ lay technicians to take blood samples.  This is done in Northern Ireland and Britain with great effect in regard to the eradication of both these diseases.  Lay technicians can do this job just as effectively and just as well as the veterinary profession.  The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons agree that a lay person can do this kind of work and, once this college agrees that it can be done effectively by lay personnel, I do not think there is need for any more argument.  The Minister is obliged to eradicate disease to meet our commitments, particularly in so far as EEC membership is concerned, and he is also obliged as the representative of the Government and as the representative of the Irish people to eradicate them in the most effective and economic way possible.  That is what the Minister is doing.</P>
    <P>So far as the stubborn line is concerned, throughout these negotiations he offered, as I have already mentioned, to utilise lay technicians in the six north western counties only, the least seriously affected area in the country and to continue with the employment of vets in the other 20 counties until such time as they can be added to the free area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern seems to think that there will be redundancies if the Minister implements this scheme.  My information is that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries advertised through the Civil Service Commissioners for veterinary officers and could not get an adequate number to meet its demands.  This belies the statement about the necessity for veterinary surgeons to emigrate to Canada and Australia to obtain employment. The salary scale here is from £3,900 to £5,800 for veterinary inspectors employed by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. This is quite a good scale.  I think it is quite fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2327" /> I realise what is happening throughout the country and so does the Minister, but I place the blame for the situation squarely on the shoulders of the veterinary profession.  I think they are stabbing the country in the back.</P>

      <P>At a time when we were getting our agricultural industry on its feet, particularly after the decline in prices, here come the veterinary profession demanding they take over functions which rightfully belong to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Minister is not prepared to hand over his powers to any group in this country. There was an obligation placed on him when he was appointed here in 1973 to utilise the powers conferred on him by virtue of that appointment and that he is doing.  The veterinary profession are being treated fairly and squarely.  So far as they are concerned there is no redundancy whatsoever and Deputy Davern should be making a case here about the difficulties of the agriculturalists and on behalf of factory workers who will lose their employment as a result of the irresponsibility of the veterinary profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2328" /> I have no apologies to make for my statements.  I believe the Minister adopted a very soft line throughout his negotiations with the profession, trying everything possible to obviate a stoppage of work.  No group, no matter who they are, will be allowed to hold this country up to ransom.</P>

Their use was allowed at these examinations in 1974 as a convenience to students and I am professionally advised that they do not confer any unfair advantage on a student who uses them over a student who does not.

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 10th March, 1975, but the claim was disallowed on the ground of insufficiency of employment contributions paid or credited during the 1973 contribution <Col N="2192" /> year.
