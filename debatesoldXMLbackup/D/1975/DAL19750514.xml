      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the period of payment of pay-related benefit from six to nine months.  The Bill also empowers the Minister for Social Welfare, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to extend <Col N="1780" /> by order the duration of payment for a further period not exceeding three months.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions of a somewhat technical nature which amend existing legislation in relation to pay-related benefit and may on that account be difficult to follow. The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill is aimed at clarifying these provisions and I hope Deputies will be helped by it in their examination of the proposals.</P>
    <P>This is a further advance in the social programme of the Government and is in line with the general trend of development which is desirable in our social welfare provision. The extension of the existing pay-related scheme is important in itself and the decision of the Government to bring forward these proposals after the first year of operation of the scheme is a reflection of their satisfaction with its general effectiveness.</P>
    <P>I have previously given details of the pay-related benefit scheme but I will take this opportunity, for the information of the House, to recall briefly the main features of the scheme.  The scheme was introduced under the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973, and commenced in April, 1974.  Pay-related benefit is payable as a supplement to disability benefit, occupational injury benefit&mdash;if the claimant is otherwise entitled to disability benefit&mdash;and maternity allowance, for up to 24½ weeks of incapacity for work.  It also supplements unemployment benefit for up to 24½ weeks of unemployment. There is a waiting period of two weeks which includes the three waiting days for flat rate benefit.  The maximum period of 24½ weeks of payment thus terminates at the end of 26 weeks of payment of the flat-rate benefit.  The weekly rate of pay-related benefit payable is 40 per cent of the amount by which the person's reckonable weekly earnings exceed £14 but do not exceed an upper limit of £50.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the introduction of pay-related benefit was, of course, to make better provision <Col N="1781" /> against the loss of income suffered by insured persons and their families during periods of sickness or unemployment than could be provided by the system of flat rate benefits. Although the flat rate benefits had been regularly improved over the years they were not flexible enough to provide adequately for the different needs of persons who, when working, had not the same levels of earnings and, as a result, had widely differing financial commitments.</P>
    <P>When the scheme was introduced last year a period of 147 days during which pay-related benefit would be paid was considered appropriate&mdash; subject to review in the light of experience&mdash;for the purpose of bridging the gap until in the normal course an unemployed or sick worker again resumed employment.  In particularly adverse economic circumstances, however, the period during which a worker may be unemployed may, unfortunately prove, in many cases, to be longer than that which would normally obtain.  Moreover, the date on which pay-related benefit ceases under existing provisions may now coincide for many recipients, with a reduction in the standard rate of unemployment benefit to the reduced rate which may be payable for the second 26 weeks of a period of interruption of employment.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned by the fact that the substantial fall in cash income which results for persons in the circumstances which I have mentioned, may undoubtedly sharply accentuate the difficulties, and, indeed, hardship, which ensue for the families of very many unemployed workers. To help workers and their families, therefore, to maintain a reasonable standard of living during periods of interruption of employment, I propose to extend by 78 days, from 147 to 225 days, the period during which pay-related benefit may be paid.  This extension of the period of payment will, of course, apply both to periods of unemployment and to periods of incapacity for work.</P>
    <P>In this connection I wish to emphasise that this proposal is not intended simply as an emergency measure to <Col N="1782" /> meet the current abnormal employment position.  It is, as I have said, a logical and necessary development of the social welfare system.  I indicated, in introducing the Estimate for my Department last year, that adjustments to the pay-related scheme would be made as indicated by experience.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that when economic conditions generally become more favourable, there will continue to be a substantial number of cases in which payment of pay-related benefit over the extended period proposed would be necessary to mitigate hardship, for example, in the case of families where the breadwinner suffers a prolonged spell of illness.  This proposal and the other proposals in the Bill will come into operation at an eary date which will be fixed by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated earlier, the weekly rate of pay-related benefit payable at present is 40 per cent of the part of a claimant's reckonable weekly earnings which lies between £14 and the upper limit of £50.  The rate which will be payable in respect of the proposed additional period of 78 days will be 30 per cent of reckonable earnings between £14 and £50.  This will mean an addition of up to £10.80 a week in payments for unemployment and disability during the extended period.</P>
    <P>Pay-related benefit is payable only for days for which flat-rate benefit is also payable and may not, at present, be paid beyond the 159th day of unemployment or incapacity for work in a period of interruption of employment. These 159 days include the initial 12 waiting days.  At an early stage in the operation of the scheme a difficulty came to light in the case of persons who were suspended from, or disqualified for, the flat rate benefit for some days in that period.  During such suspension or disqualification pay-related benefit would not of course be payable, because flat rate benefit was not payable.  Because of the bar on payment beyond the 159th day of incapacity or unemployment, a person in the circumstances I have outlined could not get the full 147 days of pay-related benefit.  To remedy this defect, provision was made in the Social Welfare <Col N="1783" /> (No. 2) Act, 1974 that days of incapacity or unemployment in respect of which a person did not receive payment of flat rate benefit because of suspension or disqualification would not be taken into account.  Now that the period of entitlement to pay-related benefit is being extended, similar provision is being made in the Bill in relation to the extended period of entitlement to pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>In considering the extension of the duration of the period for which pay-related benefit will be payable, I have given special consideration to the possibility of helping persons whose period of interruption of employment is continuing and who have already exhausted their entitlement to pay-related benefit. In the absence of a special provision to cater for such cases, a person might receive little or no immediate benefit from the proposed extension of the period of payment.  To take an example: immediately before the proposed extension comes into operation, a man may have been unemployed for 230 days.  When the extension of the period of payment of pay-related benefit comes into effect, pay-related benefit will be payable up to the 237th day of unemployment and the man in question would therefore get pay-related benefit for only seven days.  To help persons in this or similar types of situation a provision has been included in the Bill the effect of which will be that where a person has been unemployed for not less than 159 days and has received pay-related benefit, he may, if the period of interruption of employment continues on or after the commencement date, receive pay-related benefit for up to 78 days, provided that the total number of days of unemployment in the period of interruption of employment does not exceed 315 days, that is, the maximum period, including three waiting days, during which a person may be paid flat-rate unemployment benefit.  The Bill includes a similar transitional provision to cover days of incapacity for work.</P>
    <P>The cost of the pay-related benefit scheme is borne by contributions from employers and employees and the annual cost of extending the period of <Col N="1784" /> payment by 78 days as proposed is estimated to be in the region of £1.8 million.  At a lower level of unemployment, the cost would, of course, be less.  It is expected that the existing contribution income will be sufficient to meet the cost of the improvement and it is not, therefore, proposed to increase the existing contribution rate.</P>
    <P>Included also in the Bill is a provision to empower the Minister for Social Welfare, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to extend by order the duration of pay-related benefit for a further period not exceeding 78 days, and to determine the weekly rate at which pay-related benefit may be paid in respect of such extended period.  This power will enable the Minister to effect speedily further improvements in the pay-related benefit scheme in the light of experience and in line with social requirements. Thus, the scheme will acquire a most valuable element of flexibility.</P>
    <P>The proposal to extend further by order the duration of payment of pay-related benefit is, however, subject to the condition that a person shall not be entitled by virtue of any such order to receive pay-related benefit after the 315th day of unemployment or incapacity for work in any period of interruption of employment.  Moreover, any such order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by either House within the next 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some length about the technicalities of this Bill and this is, of course, necessary.  I want now to turn to a consideration of the working of the pay-related benefit scheme and I intend to deal with some criticisms which are made of its operation.</P>
    <P>After just one year of operation it is early to make a comprehensive statement on the effectiveness of the scheme but it can be stated without any fear of contradiction that it has proved to be of great significance for very many families afflicted by the hardship occasioned by the illness or unemployment of the breadwinner.</P>
    <P>In the past year we have seen a most difficult economic situation and <Col N="1785" /> a continuing high level of unemployment. This has happened in a period of unprecedented inflation, the impact of which is clear and harmful.  Beyond all its economic ill-effects, inflation tends to make inequalities worse and it bears most harshly on the poor and on the various deprived groups in the community.  It can bear in this way on those who are unemployed, and on their families.</P>
    <P>The average worker in this country spends what he earns each week on his wife and family, seeking to provide a reasobable standard of living for them.  Very few of them are able to put by money week by week, especially in a period of high and continuing inflation.  If that worker is hit by unemployment, as so many are now hit in our country, then his family is at once confronted with very severe economic difficulties.  In these circumstances a family may easily go into debt.  Over the years, I have seen many people unemployed through no fault of their own for prolonged periods.  I have seen them, and their families, put into the category of the poverty stricken from the beginning. This poverty could last for a very long time even after re-entering employment while efforts were made to repay debts built up during unemployment.</P>
    <P>The pay-related benefit scheme does not give the average unemployed man more than he would get if he were at work but it does keep his head above water.  It can keep the family in reasonable comfort during a period of unemployment, up to six months at present and subject to the provisions of this Bill for the longer period proposed. It can also save them from the distress of living in debt for perhaps two or three years after resuming employment&mdash;and I have known such cases.</P>
    <P>Surely it is the purpose of all income-maintenance payments to cushion a person to the fullest extent possible if he becomes unemployed or ill.  If the benefits provided under the pay-related scheme achieve this stated purpose, I certainly do not see any reason to apologise for it.</P>
    <P>The purpose of pay-related benefit <Col N="1786" /> is to make good some of the defects of the flat-rate system which represented far too low a proportion of the earnings of those on reasonably good wages.  If the scheme introduced last year, which it is now proposed to improve, is achieving its objectives, I cannot see why fault should be found with it.</P>
    <P>Before people condemn or distort the working of the pay-related benefit scheme and its effects, they should think very carefully and they should examine how it operates and what it is designed to do.  I have attempted in the early part of this statement to explain the main features of the scheme, which is admittedly complex and I have just stated my view of its purpose and impact.</P>
    <P>There is an amount of criticism of the social welfare system at present. I am not here referring to criticism of inadequate benefit payments or similar defects but to a new wave of criticism claiming that benefits are too generous.  It comes from certain newspaper columnists, from some politicians, from individuals or groups in the community, and from industrial leaders.  It has gained in volume in recent months.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that I welcome debate on the social welfare system and that I have always encouraged such debate.  I accept fully that there are defects and deficiencies in the system which must be tackled and remedied.  I have indicated clearly the lines of development which the Government believe to be necessary in order to create, in a planned fashion, a fully comprehensive system which can meet the needs of all citizens.  Success in this enterprise will depend upon the active support of the community and upon the maximum involvement of all interested persons and groups.  Such involvement will necessarily lead to a degree of criticism and this is essential.</P>
    <P>What is a cause of concern is the prevalence of ill-informed and emotional criticism, not founded on any basis of fact.  I have recently read statements about the working of the <Col N="1787" /> pay-related system, which have attracted Press, TV and radio coverage, and which have proved, on examination, to be without substance.</P>
    <P>I read that leading industrialists are &ldquo;genuinely concerned about work becoming less attractive than the dole&rdquo; and I read that it is the opinion of employers' leaders that &ldquo;a way must be found of channelling funds to those who are really in need and not to those who are work-shy or have an imaginary pain in the back&rdquo;. I should be equally concerned if it could be proved to me that these contentions are accurate in a significant number of cases.  I am, however, quite unimpressed by unsupported statements of this kind, particularly when they come from persons who have never faced, and never will face, the problems of supporting a family in unemployment and who, in the event of long illness are more than adequately provided for under the terms of their employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Such statements may reasonably be taken in conjunction with some of the more flamboyant arguments about capital taxation, which appear to come from the same general sources.  I detect in some of these utterances what I can only describe as a rather confused set of priorities and, certainly, no great evidence of an awareness of the real social problems in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give one or two examples which should help to clear up the position.  First of all, it must be stated that where a person is on a low wage and has a number of children it has always been possible that his flat-rate unemployment or disability benefit might equal or indeed exceed his earnings.  Thus a man earning £20 a week, with a wife and two children, would receive flat rate unemployment benefit of £20.80.  The question which arises in such a case is surely not whether the benefit payable is too high but rather how anyone with a <Col N="1788" /> wife and two children could be expected to live on a wage of £20 a week.</P>
    <P>I will take the example of a man, his wife and two children, at various levels of reckonable earnings.  It should be remembered that reckonable earnings are now related to the fiscal year 1973-74.</P>
    <P>At £20 a week reckonable earnings &mdash;which is equivalent to a rate of perhaps £27 today&mdash;flat rate benefit would be £20.80 and no pay-related element would be payable because of the wage-stop which means that the total of flat rate plus pay-related benefit cannot exceed earnings, unless flat rate of itself is higher.</P>
    <P>At £30 a week reckonable earnings &mdash;equivalent to about £39 now&mdash;flat rate would be £20.80 and the total benefit, including pay-related, would be £27.20, or 91 per cent of reckonable earnings.  That is about 70 per cent of the current wage level.</P>
    <P>At £40 a week&mdash;equivalent to £51 or thereabout at present&mdash;the total benefit payable, including pay-related, amounts to £31.20.  This is equivalent to 78 per cent of reckonable earnings or 61 per cent of the current wage level.</P>
    <P>At £50 a week-equivalent to approximately £63 now&mdash;the total benefit figure, including pay-related, amounts to £35.20.  The percentage equivalent amounts to 70 per cent of reckonable earnings or 56 per cent of the present wage figure.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the average weekly earnings figures for male workers in manufacturing industries in the September quarter of 1974 was in excess of £43 a week.  This figure will have been raised to at least £49 at present, through the working of the national agreements.</P>
    <P>I believe that these few examples serve to refute the idea that pay-related benefits provide some form of bonanza for malingerers and dishonest idlers.  I am happy that this scheme has proved to be a real support for many families who would have been in serious distress in the past year and that this fact is its justification.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> Let me say that, in this as in all other areas of the social welfare services, any proven case of abuse will be pursued vigorously by my Department and that I will not hesitate to take all the steps necessary to ensure that any loopholes or administrative difficulties which may arise in the operation of so complex a system will be dealt with at once.</P>
    <P>The introduction last year of the pay-related benefit scheme was a significant development in our social welfare code. It represented this country's first undertaking in the field of pay-related benefits, which are an established and internationally-accepted feature of highly developed social security systems.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Government have decided to publish a discussion document on pensions which will indicate the various issues connected with the introduction of a national income-related pension scheme.  This may be seen as a logical and highly-desirable direction in which to extend the application of the pay-related principle.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill will strengthen and bring to a higher stage of development the scheme which commenced last year and I am happy to recommend the Bill to the House for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary can be assured that this side of the House will give him every co-operation in the passage of this legislation.  Before we go into the mechanics of the Bill, its general nature and what it is intended to achieve, I wish to thank the person or persons who drafted the explanatory memorandum.  It is distinguished by its clarity and its helpfulness. Whilst I sometimes find it difficult for various reasons to comprehend legislative instruments, in this case my task is made much easier because the memorandum is most helpful.  Section 4, as the Parliamentary Secretary concedes, is a difficult enough section to comprehend but the explanatory <Col N="1790" /> memorandum goes a long way towards helping Deputies, and me in particular, towards a comprehension of what is intended.  My thanks to the officials and the parliamentary draftsman who so clearly set out with the intention of elucidating what the Bill means.</P>
      <P>That, I am afraid, is where we part company as far as any air of joy is concerned because one of the most significant passages in relation to the Bill appears at the very outset of the Parliamentary Secretary's introductory statement where he has the hard neck to say:</P>
      <P>This is a further advance in the social programme of the Government and it is in line with the general trend of development which is desirable in our social welfare provision.</P>
      <P>Whilst we will not quibble with or argue about the latter half of the statement the first half just does not bear examination.  What this Social Welfare (Pay-Related) Bill means is that the Government admit they have failed to provide jobs and they also admit that the serious unemployment situation is to continue.  That is basically what this Bill means.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, pay-related benefits are designed to ensure that during periods of unemployment people will be helped to avoid hardship, and properly so, but the reality of the Bill is that the Parliamentary Secretary, speaking on behalf of his Government, sees no hope for any reduction in the desperate rate of unemployment at the moment and they are bringing in this Bill to prolong the six-month period; they are extending the period by three months and it will be extended by a further three months should that become necessary.  Surely that is an admission by the Government of failure.  It is also a very morale sapping exercise in the sense that they quite clearly indicate they expect the serious unemployment situation to continue.  If it is not curable after nine months they will extend the period for another three months.  That certainly presents no ray of hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, the Minister <Col N="1791" /> for Industry and Commerce and a number of other Minister stated just prior to last Christmas that the inflationary spiral would be under control early in the new year and the unemployment situation would be at an end. I think the expression used by the Minister for Finance was that there would be light at the end of the tunnel. Clearly this Bill does not give any hope and the light is now out at the end of the tunnel; indeed, the length of the tunnel is extending.  I wonder what the next excuse will be by the cacophonist Ministers in their hysterical statements in relation to the very serious situation confronting us, a situation for which they are responsible, a situation in relation to which they have most definitely not measured up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The rate of unemployment is in the region of 10 per cent.  In addition to the unemployment there are redundancies. There is no new job creation. This is the climate in which this Bill is introduced.  We are now being asked by Ministers, who harassed and harried us when they were in Opposition, to be responsible, not to talk about jobs lost, price increases or inflation.  Because there is this infamous so-called psychology of inflation we should not talk about it; we only aggravate the situation by talking about it.  But we must speak about it.  We have to be concerned about it.  These same Ministers, when they were in Opposition, did not show that much concern but they are now concerned that we should do so.  It seems to me to be a form of inverted hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is at a record high, some where in the region of 10 per cent of the working population, the highest figure since 1942.  Redundancies are cancelling out new job opportunities or new job creation.  In addition, emigration has declined and will continue to do so because of world conditions. The marriage rate is rising.  The natural increase in population is quite substantial. Agriculture will continue to shed people.  That is the climate in which this Bill is introduced.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is an honest man; there is no doubt about <Col N="1792" /> that but I think he is being codded by those of his colleagues, not intentionally dishonest, who fail to put the situation in proper perspective.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been misled about this Bill.  It cannot be described as a further advance in the social programme of the Government because what it is doing is recognising that unemployment is continuing and will continue, not only continue but obviously get worse.  That is why it is necessary to extend the period by three months.  We hope it will not be necessary to extend it for a further three months.  By virtue of enshrining it in the legislation before us it introduces an air of hopelessness.  In addition to all that the Parliamentary Secretary made the valid point that there has been some unfair and negative criticism in relation to those people in receipt of social welfare benefits.  We should be positive in this regard.</P>
    <P>We believe people would feel better off in employment rather than unemployed. People want the dignity of a job rather than the indignity of the dole queue.  They do not want alms from anybody.  We believe the bulk of the working people and those who are unemployed at the moment want employment. They do not want to have to go to the unemployment exchanges on a regular basis.  They do not want hand outs.  They are prepared to contribute to the welfare of the country and to the welfare of their families through work rather than through idleness.</P>
    <P>History unfortunately has a habit of repeating itself.  This is once more happening in relation to Coalition Governments in the country.  During the first Coalition Government from 1948 to 1951 we had tragedy.  The second Coalition Government was from 1954 to 1957 and when they left office there were 100,000 people unemployed and the building industry was wrecked.  We now have the same position in 1975.  If you reverse 75 to 57 there is a touch of irony in the numerals.  No later than yesterday we had a treatise from a very reputable and a very respected member of the community, who represents the Federation <Col N="1793" /> of Building Industry, who stated that the private house building industry has never been worse since the last period of Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>I have already cleared our attitude in relation to unemployment. We believe that people would rather be in employment than be unemployed.  It appears that the Parliamentary Secretary, who is the agent of the Government in relation to the Bill before us, gives the people who are unemployed no hope of employment. It is a piece of humbug to introduce the Bill as some sort of social advance.  I believe the Government are living in some sort of drug situation.  They have actually begun to believe in their hand outs and propaganda.  Not so long ago we had the tragedy of another politician who was almost physically forced to resign his post because he did not realise the harm he was doing outside the four walls of the building in which he lived during his period of office.</P>

      <P>The Government now appear to be actually believing their own propaganda.  It is absolutely incredible to introduce this Bill as a <Col N="1794" /> piece of social advancement.  The economic condition of the country at the moment at the hands of the Coalition Government adds up to the need for a massive job creation.  We will require something in the region of 25,000 new jobs per year even after the present recession goes away.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach now admits that the inflationary spiral is not necessarily attributable to outside influences.  He has stated that the matter is internal. What is he doing about it?  Their taxation measures over the past few months, the capital gains tax, the capital acquisitions tax, the wealth tax and their Finance Bill have proved to be a disaster.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We brought in social welfare pay-related benefits as an insurance for people who, because of illness or temporary unemployment in a normal economic climate, were looked after, that they would be given a sum of money as near as possible to the wages they were receiving when they left employment.  We brought the Bill in for that reason. The Government are abusing the situation and are engaging in pretence in relation to the suggestion that the Bill, at present before the House, is some sort of social advance, and we have to expose the Government in this respect.  I am sure that those who will deal with the Bill after me will continue to divest the Government of their pretence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill must be examined in the context and the atmosphere in which the country finds itself at the moment. As I have already pointed out, and the Ceann Comhairle has quite properly interrupted me, one of the reasons for the state of the country is the Government's taxation policy and the fact that deficit financing is fuelling inflation.  It is interesting to note that the climate <Col N="1796" /> in which the Bill is being introduced is that Exchequer returns are £73 million worse than at this time last year. In addition, external reserves have fallen from £495 million at 31st December, 1974 to £472 million by 31st March, 1975.  That is an indictment of the Government's handling of the unemployment situation, with its effects on the national economy.  Will they not admit that they have no plans, that the calling in of employers and trade unions last week was a gimmick, a cover-up of their own inadequacy? It would be too much to expect them to be honest and to state that the reality is that they have no economic plan, that, in fact, they have no plan at all.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the cost of the Bill, it is intended that £1.8 million will be expended on current demands.  The cost of the pay-related benefit scheme borne by contributions from employers and employees and the annual cost of extending the period of payment by 78 days as proposed is estimated to be in the region of £1.8 million.  This raises another matter which has been brought before the House on another occasion. We stated that up to the end of December of last year there was collected in the first period of operation of the social welfare pay-related benefit scheme some £8 million from contributions and that from that pool of £8 million £3 million was expended in benefit, which left a balance of £5 million. We know that the £5 million was floating around somewhere but we have never received a satisfactory answer to our questions as to what purpose the £5 million was put.  What have the Government done with that £5 million, on the basis that we are being asked to expend £1.8 million in relation to this Bill and the collections from 1st January to date must be substantial?</P>
    <P>In addition, would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us, when he gets in to reply, the number of persons in receipt of benefits under this scheme?  It is very important that we should know the figure and that we should know the use to which the £5 million I have mentioned has been put.</P>
    <P>I put down a number of parliamentary questions in an effort to get <Col N="1797" /> information from the Parliamentary Secretary on the points I have made. The unemployment figure is in the region of 104,000, despite Deputy Desmond's suggestion that there are only 80,000 persons on the unemployed list.  I do not know where he managed to get that figure.  It is the product of Garret FitzGeraldian type of statistical exercise.  I give him credit for the exercise but reject the conclusion.</P>

      <P>In addition to the number of persons officially on the unemployed list, the lack of job opportunities raises another very serious matter.  There will be thousands of school leavers seeking employment in the not too distant future.  Can the Government tell us what plans, if any, they have to give those school leavers the hope of a job?  The Parliamentary Secretary might deal with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that we on this side of the House or any other Deputy need apologise for the thinking behind the social welfare pay-related benefit scheme or for the scheme itself.  It is as well to put the history of the scheme into perspective.  The social welfare pay-related benefit scheme came into being on 3rd April, 1973 by virtue of the President's signature. The date on the Act is 3rd April, 1973.  That date must be in the Long Title by reason of the Interpretation Act, 1937.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has stated, the scheme came into operation in April, 1974.  Therefore, the Act came into operation during the interim period between the exit of Fianna Fáil from office and the advent of the Coalition Government. <Col N="1798" /> Consequently, the Coalition Government could not have introduced the Bill or guided its passage through all Stages if the Act was signed into law by the President on 3rd April, 1973.  The Parliamentary Secretary would appear to pretend that the scheme was a product of the brains of the Coalition social thinkers. This is just not true as is evidenced by the facts and by the dates I have presented to the House.  We find it very difficult to comprehend section 3 (b) of the Bill which reads:</P>
    <P>... for any part of that period on and from the one hundred and sixtieth day of incapacity for work, or for any part of that period on and from the one hundred and sixtieth day of unemployment, 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, the reckonable earnings are between £14 and £50 and 40 per cent of the reckonable earnings between those two figures is the amount to which the recipient would be entitled under the pay-related scheme.  It is 40 per cent for the first six months.  Now the Parliamentary Secretary intends to reduce that 40 per cent to 30 per cent for the three-month period which is being sought in the Bill.  Surely if the Parliamentary Secretary were to be consistent with his well-padded statement he would continue to allow the 40 per cent as it applies to the six-month period.  Why is the Parliamentary Secretary reducing the figure from 40 per cent to 30 per cent?  After six months of unemployment a worker's morale has been lowered and his general psychological outlook has been eroded and hammered.  He feels deeply the indignity of unemployment.  Surely after six months, with the kitty getting barer and barer the 40 per cent should be continued?  Instead, it is being reduced by 10 per cent.  This seems extraordinary to us.  There may be an adequate explanation and if there is we will accept it.  We do not have the backing of a vast bureaucracy to advise us on these matters so we must bring them to the attention of the House during the course of a debate and have them explained by the person introducing them.  Are we to take it that for <Col N="1799" /> the next three-month period the amount will be reduced to 30 per cent? We would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to answer those questions.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that after one year of operation it is early to make a comprehensive statement on the effectiveness of the scheme but that it can be stated that it has proved to be of great significance for many families afflicted by the hardship occasioned by the illness or unemployment of the breadwinner.  We accept that the pay-related benefits scheme has proved of great significance for many families.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his well-padded statement goes on to give a number of examples where hardship has existed and has attempted to refute the suggestion that there are people abusing social welfare benefits.  Of course, the pay-related scheme is a good one.  It is a socially just scheme.  It is a scheme for which Fianna Fáil foresaw the need in the sense that it would operate as a form of insurance against temporary unemployment. However, the Government are using it in the sense that they cannot foresee the end of the unemployment spiral.  Of course, we welcome the extension of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary state whether there is any retrospective element in the working of the scheme?  I appreciate that the technicalities he outlined may take care of the situation where people have been unemployed for six months and their unemployment continues into the three-month period but before the commencement of the working of this Bill will people fall in between the six-month and the three-month period? We hope not and we will be glad to give the Parliamentary Secretary any assistance to ensure that that will not happen.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned to me that he required the Bill as a matter of urgency.  We will give him the Bill as quickly as is proper for a debate on the subject. We may consider the possibility of tabling an amendment or amendments depending on the replies we get to the questions raised in my contribution. I am not saying that by <Col N="1800" /> way of threat.  We may consider an amendment particularly relative to the 40 as against the proposed 30 per cent in section 3 (b).</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  It highlights the attitude of the Government towards social welfare in all its aspects.  After a year in operation it is time that the pay-related scheme was reviewed.  The whole idea of pay-related benefits is excellent.  For too long people who had reasonably good incomes were placed in impossible situations by reason of illness or unemployment. Because of the drop in incomes they were not able to meet their hire purchase or other commitments.  A person who was ill would not be helped in his recovery if debts continued to accumulate.  Indeed, it might be said that such a situation would militate against a person ever making a full recovery.  The extension of the scheme is a natural follow-through.  I can understand the Opposition dining off unemployment because that is about all they have to complain of.</P>

They never put forward a constructive idea but merely stir up trouble.  Only yesterday evening we had to endure this attitude from them for some time.  We awaited patiently for the light but were disappointed. One wonders what has happened to their think tank.  Has it sunk?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews was allowed stray somewhat.  He spoke of people not wishing to be out of work and said they objected to taking alms. This highlights the thinking of the Opposition in regard to social welfare. They regard social welfare benefits as handouts, but they never spared the people's money where vote-buying <Col N="1801" /> was concerned.  They used social welfare in their budgets as a votecatching effort.  If there was an election in the offing, old age pensioners were given an increase but these increases were very small, especially when compared with this Government's attitude to the whole area of social welfare.</P>
      <P>I do not know why the Opposition are creating such a fuss about this Bill.  The extension of the scheme will not involve any additional increase in contributions.  The £1.8 million is available.  The scheme is working well and the logical way to progress in relation to it was to extend the period of unemployment.</P>
      <P>Nobody will refute the figures for unemployment, but we have always had our unemployed.  At least, though, people are staying in the country now, whereas during the terms of office of Fianna Fáil the emigrant ships were nearly always full and this situation kept the unemployment figures down.  If people are out of work now they are assured of reasonable incomes by way of social welfare payments.  This is part of the social reform programme to which this Government are committed.  We introduced the deserted wives' allowance, allowance for the dependants of long-term prisoners and an allowance for single women.  All of this is an indication of the Government's concern for the less-well off.</P>
      <P>There have been complaints of abuse of the pay-related benefit scheme, but there is no scheme that is not subjected to abuse by some people.  However, because of a small element of abuse it would not be justifiable to write off an entire scheme.  The answer would appear to lie in educating people to respect social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>Regarding the building industry, a gentleman who is outside this House is often quoted on the problems of that industry.  Since this Government took office, the gentleman in question has been continuously pointing to these problems.  He might be regarded as being a very effective spokesman for Fianna Fáil rather than for the building industry.</P>

It is an extension and a further development of this system.  If the Opposition cannot see that, I can realise why they will remain in Opposition for a long time to come.</P>

      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Andrews, I fully support the introduction of this Bill and realise the obvious need for it.  I listened this morning to two contributions, one from Deputy O'Brien and one from the Parliamentary Secretary. Deputy O'Brien's contribution was the most pathetic contribution any Deputy could have made on a Bill of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with all the points made about the necessity and the obvious need for the type of cushioning which this Bill will provide for people in receipt of pay-related benefit and people who are unemployed.  In discussing a Bill of this nature, any Deputy, whether he is a back bencher on the Government side, brain-washed into supporting blindly all legislation produced by the Government, or whether he is on this side of the House, is entitled to speak on the reasons for its introduction and the alternatives to it.  The last speaker referred to the emigrant ship as being <Col N="1803" /> the solution to the unemployment problem when Fianna Fáil were in office.  Surely no Deputy could be so misinformed or so ignorant of the history of our country as to say that, or was it a deliberate misinterpretation by him of the facts?</P>
    <P>The Bill we are discussing is an extension of a Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil.  It is intended to cushion the 103,500 people who are unemployed at present.  Like our spokesman on social welfare I want to ask why the entitlement to pay-related benefit is being reduced from 40 per cent to 30 per cent in the extended three months.  As was clearly stitched into the record of this House this morning by our spokesman, the original Bill was introduced by Fianna Fáil who have always had a social conscience. We have always shown our concern for and our awareness of the needs of certain sections of the community. The Act has been in operation for well over a year.  The reduction in this Bill from 40 per cent to 30 per cent in the entitlement certainly requires explanation.</P>
    <P>Let me cite the case of a man who becomes unemployed in March or April of 1975.  For approximately six months he is entitled to be paid at the rate of 40 per cent.  If this Bill becomes law, at that stage he will qualify for a further three months at the rate of 30 per cent, but that 30 per cent will be based on figures which will, on average, be two years old.  With the huge rise in inflation this does not appear to me to be a sensible step for the Parliamentary Secretary to take. We are told it will cost £1.8 million.</P>
    <P>Where is the balance of the £5½ million approximately which was shown as being a profit on this scheme in the first nine months of its operation? The Parliamentary Secretary gave us that information by way of answer to a question some months ago.  If this costs only £1.8 million, why does the Parliamentary Secretary not continue it at the rate of 40 per cent?  Surely a man who has been unemployed for six months is far more in need of cushioning than he <Col N="1804" /> was at the beginning of that six months.  I would ask him to explain this in detail.</P>
    <P>Those are the major points I want to make on the Bill.  I am also concerned about the explanatory memorandum. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to explain what is the position of somebody whose pay-related benefit has expired and who has been unemployed for more than 315 days?  Is this Bill retrospective?  Will it cover his needs?  Is he being denied the opportunity which is being given to those currently in receipt of this benefit? This should not be the case. People who are unemployed should benefit from the introduction of this Bill which changes the concept of the original Bill.</P>
    <P>I have adequately expressed my appreciation and my party's appreciation of the need for this Bill, the obvious need for it having regard to the rising unemployment situation and the growing lack of confidence amongst working people.  I know it will be alleged, as it was recently by Deputy O'Brien and others, that we have nothing constructive to offer.  We have no problems in that regard. Where constructive proposals and policies are concerned our record speaks for itself.  In case Deputy O'Brien does not know it, let me tell him that it was the Fianna Fáil policy on employment which stopped the emigration which was so much a part of our problem during the mid 1950s, during the last period of Coalition Government. Fianna Fáil arrested that dreadful flow of emigration and achieved almost full employment.  The deterioration in that position is frightening for everybody. Despite the manipulation of figures which may be carried out by Deputy Desmond, the facts of the matter are that we now have approximately 35,000 more people unemployed compared with this time last year and there are now 35,000 more people unemployed than in May, 1972, the last month Fianna Fáil were in office.  We must add to that figure those who are not on the live register, the many school leavers still seeking employment and those who will complete their <Col N="1805" /> second and third level education in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>We are facing a frightening situation. This Bill is necessary to cushion the situation but it is the production of a lazy Government.  Government machinery is necessary to keep the wheels of industry moving and to keep our employment rate at the highest level but all we see is a rapidly increasing unemployment figure and a growing lack of confidence.  Informed sources tell us that there is little joy or hope for the immediate future.  I do not want to be described as a prophet of doom but last Friday's issue of <i>The Irish Independent</i> described the statement by the Minister for Finance the previous night as being an announcement of a dooms-day situation.  I would not care to see that situation come about but the Government have not done anything to prevent it.</P>
    <P>If an engine is using oil excessively the simple solution, the lazy solution, is to continue to pour oil into the engine and not attempt to remedy the problem.  The lazy solution is to let the problem drag on carelessly and gaily.  I am critical of the Government because they have not sought to find out the reasons why this Bill is necessary. I believe the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned about his responsibility and role in Government.  From his Labour interests I know he will agree with me&mdash;he may not be able to say it openly&mdash;when I say that because of the laziness, lack of effort and concern, by some of his colleagues in regard to the unemployment situation it is necessary for him to introduce this Bill.</P>
    <P>I was distressed to hear a Government back bencher referring to an individual who was not present to defend himself.  I have no notion of defending that person because he is capable of defending himself but the reference was typical of a man who denies the right of the freedom of expression and speech to anybody.  Is Deputy O'Brien concerned about the statement in today's issue of <i>The Irish Independent</i> which was to the effect that there are 5,800 fewer people working in the construction industry?  The <Col N="1806" /> CIF stated that in the course of the year 5,800 fewer worked in the industry compared with the previous year.  That report continued:</P>
    <P>Bemoaning what he called &ldquo;the extraordinary situation that while the private house-building sector is in the midst of the greatest crisis since the 1950s there is no official recognition of the fact despite all the evidence,</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of the statement by that representative of the CIF.  People like Deputy O'Brien, rather than being concerned about such a statement and exploring it, see fit to condemn a man for his utterances.  This is the open Government we were told so much about two years ago but it has now become so closed that a prominent Government back bencher seeks to deny the right of a man to express his views on what he believes is the problem affecting the construction industry.</P>

This morning's edition of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> contains an article which states that in Limerick there are 5,000 workers unemployed.  That newspaper carried an appeal by the Limerick Chamber of Commerce to launch an all-out campaign to bring pressure to bear on the Government to alleviate the situation.  That is a second comment in a morning newspaper by people saying that the Government are showing no concern or leadership in the unemployment situation.</P>

      <P>I would hate to think that the Chair is stifling me from discussing what I believe to be the reasons behind the extension of the pay-related benefits.  Pay-related benefit is designed to cushion and protect <Col N="1808" /> the unemployed or sick in certain circumstances.  I welcome this Bill but we should look at other angles to see how this situation could be cushioned in the present climate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my intention and I apologise.  I appreciate the Chair is not stopping me from discussing the unemployment situation in general.  There is a growing unrest among people that the Government are not showing enough concern, that they are not doing enough to protect jobs in ailing industries, that they are not creating new jobs to absorb the people who are becoming redundant and those on the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night in this House I said priority treatment should be given to our present serious problems by the appointment of a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary on a temporary basis, solely responsible for the unemployment situation.  I have no doubt that if the Parliamentary Secretary present in the House had that responsibility he would endeavour to highlight certain areas and that State bodies with certain responsibilities could be helped to protect jobs in ailing industries. There are several major industries that are in serious trouble: to name a few there are the car assembly workers, particularly in this city, there are the textile and leather industries and the building industry.  If the appointment I suggested were made the man concerned could concentrate on helping <Col N="1809" /> the industries in trouble.  With the assistance of the IDA he could endeavour to get industrialists throughout the world to invest in this country and, with the other State agencies, he could discuss the possibility of getting Government orders for the factories in trouble.  Most important, he could discuss with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare the possibility of channelling some payments into projects that would provide productive work.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the assistance given by the Department of Social Welfare is of benefit to homes that are affected by unemployment but regard must be given to the question of morale and the social problems that may be created.  Even though financial assistance may be of great help there is, for example, the problem created by the husband being at home more than formerly, there may be excessive drinking and many other problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary said in his usual well-dressed up handout, an extra payment of up to £10.80 is being provided. That rather reminds me of the bookie on the racecourse or at the greyhound track shouting the odds but when a person goes to him he gets shorter odds; this may apply in this case where the actual payment is concerned but I realise the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to window-dress a bad situation, ably guided by the Government Information Services. The creation of jobs would be a better and more attractive proposition and if one man were responsible solely for employment he would have more time to deal with the problem.  I would <Col N="1810" /> relate this to what was done during the war years when, under our excellent leader and the founder of our party who steered us through those difficult years, the post of Minister for Supplies was created.  The present situation could be regarded as an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation would be needed in such a case but the Deputy is no doubt aware we cannot advocate legislation on this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to introduce legislation but if it is necessary that argument should not be used.  We are in a desperate situation so far as jobs are concerned and this is why we are anxious about the Government's attitude.  It is typical of the attitude of Deputy O'Brien who said this morning that Fianna Fáil were continuing to talk about unemployment when discussing this Bill. If we can exert pressure on an inept and inactive Government in the present desperate situation, we will have done a good service for the country, and especially for the youth.</P>
      <P>In the newspapers this morning there was a report that 70 per cent of those interviewed were convinced unemployment would continue to grow.  That is indicative of a growing feeling among the people that the Government are not showing any leadership.  I appreciate the need for the Bill and I welcome it but I do not agree with the Government's approach.  That aspect must be looked at in greater detail.</P>
      <P>Economic measures can be taken to restore confidence and to create jobs. Recently we were told in a parliamentary question that £1.2 million per week was spent on unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit. A sizeable amount could be devoted towards productive work.  There is much work to be done on the roads and, if recent newspaper reports are correct, some Departments require office accommodation.  Those are projects which would provide employment for our people.  They would eliminate the necessity for introducing a Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to point out that I do not think it is possible.  We appreciate the necessity for the extension of this pay-related benefit.  I would prefer to have seen a clear six months extension of it.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons I see for this Bill.  The needs are very great. I am not happy about the 30 per cent. I shall be looking for a more detailed explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary when replying.  Apparently it will cost £1.8 million for the three months period.  What has happened the other £5½ million, plus the £5½ million we were led to believe from a question in this House would be surplus on this fund after the first nine months of operation?  I was expecting more detail from the Parliamentary Secretary regarding weekly payments. How many are now in benefit?  How many are there whose benefit is expiring and who will have to be put back on benefit?  This is what I want clearly spelled out.  Will all people who received pay-related benefit for the necessary 24½ weeks' period, whether or not the 315 days have expired, benefit from the extra 78 days because of the introduction of this Bill?</P>
      <P>On page 8 of his brief the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
      <P>I have indicated clearly the lines of development which the Government believe to be necessary in order to create in a planned fashion a fully comprehensive system which can meet the needs of all our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> I would not regard these types of measures as &ldquo;lines of development&rdquo;.  I would regard the provision of productive employment a line of development. I would refer to this as a necessary cushioning because of the neglect of some of the Parliamentary Secretary's colleagues to provide adequate jobs and opportunities for our people.</P>
    <P>We shall be looking forward to hearing the Parliamentary Secretary reply and ascertaining what our approach should be on Committee Stage.  At this stage I would ask that a directive be given to State bodies to ensure that, when contracts are being placed for development projects here, they are placed with Irish contractors and not, as is happening with many State bodies at present, being placed with English contractors.  I want to place on the record of the House that an unemployment situation such as obtains at present, is something of which any Government must be ashamed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I am sorry the Parliamentary Secretary has left the House because what I am about to say might be a compliment to him.  The situation is serious at present.  Everybody is worried and were it not for the fact that Deputy Frank Cluskey is dishing out so much money, with which we agree, to keep a bit in people's mouths, I do not know what would happen, having regard to unemployment and the fact that so many more people will be seeking employment and so many smaller farmers seeking off-farm employment.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
      <P>This is a further advance in the social programme of the Government and is in line with the general trend of development which is desirable in our social welfare position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary gave that as the reason for introducing this excellent Bill.  I do not believe that is the reason for the Bill before the House.  I am sorry to have to say that we need such a Bill but the real <Col N="1813" /> reason for it is that there is no hope of re-employing people.  Therefore, pay-related benefits must be extended in order to assure people a reasonable standard of living.  That is the real reason for its introduction; it is not forward thinking on social welfare; its introduction is an admission that the situation is bad.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also said:</P>
    <P>In particularly adverse economic circumstances, however, the period during which a worker may be unemployed may, unfortunately prove, in many cases, to be longer than that which would normally obtain.</P>
    <P>On page 1 of the Parliamentary Secretary's brief it is said that it is supposed to be a programme to advance social welfare, whereas on page 2 it is admitted that the period may be longer.  We fully approve of the amount of social welfare benefit being paid out at present.  We fully approve of the pay-related benefits scheme.  When I became a TD I was astonished to find so many people looking to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I can tell him he is the best known man in the country&mdash;because practically everybody is on social welfare at present.  It is a good thing that the social welfare benefits exist but why is there need for them?  The fact is that the country was never in a more serious situation.</P>
    <P>There is no point in saying that we on this side of the House are barking about it.  Rather I should like to hear some constructive suggestions as to how the country could be pulled out of this situation.  I am wondering are the Government leaving it to the Parliamentary Secretary to keep people happy.  Is there a genuine attempt being made to place a large proportion of people now living on social welfare in employment?  Factories are closing down daily with more and more people going on the dole queues.  All of those people have to live on social welfare.  They come along to me looking for benefit.  Thank God, it exists. I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on what he is doing to ease the situation.  But a better attempt should <Col N="1814" /> be made by the powers that be to ensure employment for everybody.</P>
    <P>Up to now one was dealing more or less with industrial employment but, because of the restructuring of farming, there will be thousands more people looking for off-farm employment in order to maintain a reasonable standard of living.  What will happen? Where are we going?  I wonder has any economist here investigated this matter.  Will we be able to keep paying without any production ultimately?</P>
    <P>Were we on that side of the House we would be doing as good, if not better, than this Bill.  The reason given for the introduction of the Bill is one with which we cannot agree&mdash;that it is forward thinking in social welfare.  It is not.  The real reason is that we cannot find employment for people, because there is danger of a revolution, of people getting up and asking what will happen us?  I do not agree with the cut-back from 40 per cent to 30 per cent and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give me an explanation of that.  The extension of this benefit will merely keep the wolf from the door for another while but the real point at issue is how long will the wolf be kept from the door.</P>
    <P>Is there a good look being taken at the building industry at present?  A regional fund has been established and we do not know where its benefits will be distributed.  We do not know if it will go into the national Exchequer to meet existing bills.  Should there not be a programme of development in the western region where money is scarce to give employment in order to take a number of people off the dole queues?  Has anybody given any consideration to the mounting unemployment? Has anybody really studied the situation?  I do not believe a political football should be made out of this but someone, certainly the Government with responsibility, must sit down and study the position.  Too many people are being told by their employers that their services are no longer required.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien talked about the small increases Fianna Fáil gave&mdash; always, he said, just before an election. Inflation never ran as high in <Col N="1815" /> those days as it has during the last 18 months.  When Fianna Fáil were in power the old penny had a certain value but, when an old penny was put on in the budget, the Opposition were crying out about the harsh Government we had.  It is not an old penny now; it is new pennies going on everything every other day.  The cost of living has become so high it is imperative to increase social welfare payments to make some effort to cushion those in receipt of benefits.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is doing his best but, fast as he is moving, inflation is moving faster still.  He cannot keep pace with it.  This is the problem.  If we go on spending money to put food in people's mouths, and there is no production, where will we end?  This is an emergency measure. We hope that by the end of the year there will be a downward trend in unemployment but no one has suggested that that will be the evolution. There were only two speakers on the Government side, the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy O'Brien.  The latter talked about Fianna Fáil buying votes.  If we bought votes with the dole, how many votes are these social welfare improvements designed to buy?  A great number are now existing on social welfare.  Are their votes being bought?</P>
    <P>I met a man recently after the Galway by-election and he told me a certain person in Government went into houses and asked the people how much they were getting in social welfare. He was told they did not look for it and he told them there were things to which they were entitled and about 50 more applications immediately went in.  It is the job of public representatives to tell people what social welfare benefits are available to them.  Very few people want social welfare.  I know unemployed people who would be much happier if they had work.  The father of a family would much prefer to earn a decent living for himself and his family.  It is not true that people do not want employment.  The vast majority would prefer to work.  They have a certain pride.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> I would like to see the Government getting down to a proper survey. There does not seem to be a clear picture of how many are unemployed at the moment.  That emerged in reply to a question tabled by Deputy Dowling yesterday.  It is a serious situation.  The Parliamentary Secretary should ask his Government how far more he will have to go to keep a bit of food in the mouths of the people and keep them from growing hostile. What effort is being made to retrain people and get people back to work? Incidentally, £20 a week ought not to be mentioned by anybody because it is a slave wage in these inflationary days; one has to be down to the level of £20 before pay-related benefits become effective.</P>
    <P>We approve of the Bill but not of the reasons for its introduction.  It is obvious that hope of getting people back into employment is no longer there and this Bill is necessary because the Government have failed to provide employment or stem the tide of unemployment. A complete examination of the situation should be made.  Industries are closing down all over the country and there is nothing to replace them.  There are industries which could expand.  There is tremendous scope for expansion in Bord na Móna. Could the regional fund be used for that purpose or is the money all gone? A great deal could be done within our own shores to put people back to work and engender confidence in the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary or any member of the Government has read the very revealing <i>Crossman Diaries</i> in <i>The Sunday Times</i> but, if anyone has, he will be struck by the disclosures of some of the attitudes of the British Government at a time when, as Crossman said, the pound was falling down around their ears, the economy was shuddering and the British Government were apparently concerning themselves with social welfare benefits and the level of the increases they would apply.  It is fairly significant that the subsequent history of the British economy&mdash;it is not for us to devote too much time to their <Col N="1817" /> economy although it obviously has an effect on ours&mdash;has proved they would have done well to have considered the social welfare payments in the various areas in the context of an overall economic plan.  You cannot divorce provisions, such as we are discussing this morning, from the overall policy of a Government.  I do not believe any Government would suggest that their social policy should be judged in isolation nor would they go further to suggest that success in social policy can be the criterion of the capacity of a Government to do their work and their capacity to guide the nation's economy.</P>
      <P>I say that simply by way of introduction because it seems to me that the Parliamentary Secretary is taking a defensive attitude this morning.  In the course of his address on at least three occasions he said he sees no reason to apologise for this, that or the other.  He sees no reason to apologise for benefits under the pay-related scheme.  He said that if the scheme introduced last year, which it is now proposed to improve, is achieving its objective he cannot see why fault should be found with it.  He goes on to deal with some of what he sees as unwarranted criticism directed against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an old adage that if you want to defend a position which is not particularly defensible, you defend a position which you should not have to defend in any event, which is not the valid position you should have. We had a very clear example of this this morning with the Parliamentary Secretary defending the whole concept of pay-related benefits and giving the impression to the House that it was this Government who introduced the concept.  He does not have to defend that to Fianna Fáil because we introduced the concept of pay-related benefits.  It is just trying to change the direction of the argument for him to defend something, which is not within his province to defend, in so far as it relates to the actual introduction of it. It is conveying an impression that this very worthwhile scheme introduced by Fianna Fáil, which this Government have had the opportunity, since they <Col N="1818" /> came into power, of implementing, is under attack.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary then started to defend the scheme against those he claimed are making arguments and speeches against it.  That is the first fallacy in his approach to it.  He should not be allowed to come in here to defend something worthwhile, which was introduced by another Government.  As Deputy Callanan and all other speakers on this side of the House said, we obviously will not oppose an extension of a scheme which was introduced in the original Pay-Related Benefits Act by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan also said that the Parliamentary Secretary is one of the best known men in the Government. He is also one of the most popular men in the present administration although he is not directly a Member of the Government.  He is becoming more popular and his responsibilities are becoming more onerous and more demanding, the more the Government fail to discharge their responsibility and the more the Minister for Finance fails to plan a proper programme for the development of our economy and adopts the attitude, as he has said so often, that it is not the time for planning in this whirlwind of inflation. Now he has apparently taken into his counsel other elements in the community to help him to plan when he has up to now decried the appropriateness of planning.  The more he fails to do that, the more the Parliamentary Secretary will be called on to come to the front of the stage and convey the impression that the Government have a social conscience.</P>
    <P>This is a totally contradictory stance for any Government.  The more the Minister for Industry and Commerce fails to nail down prices, the more inflation increases, the more pressures in the social area, the more the Parliamentary Secretary will be called on to come into the House again to soften the spreading infection we have at the moment.  We should assess the reasons the Parliamentary Secretary is in the public mind as one who is doing his job.  Never have so many people had need of direct access to the Department <Col N="1819" /> for which the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible.</P>
    <P>Nobody could decry the need to provide adequate benefits for those who for one reason or another find themselves unemployed or disabled.  Unemployment benefit, disablement benefit, pay-related benefit and other benefits in the social welfare area are not meant to be a constant pattern in our community.  They are an insurance against the unexpected and an insurance against casual unemployment or disability which can arise from time to time.  There may be pockets within the country from time to time, which for special reasons operating there, may have a higher level of unemployment than the national norm. There may be special circumstances which apply in certain areas for certain reasons.  It is for those that the unemployment benefit, the pay-related benefit, and all other social benefits with which we are concerned were introduced. They could never be a substitution for the earning capacity of a nation.  The day they are the nation is taking a backward turn.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the experience of our neighbour, Britain.  I am not saying this simply in order to criticise them. Anyone who takes a look at their economy knows that they concentrated on welfare and a welfare economy at a time when they failed to have a clear sense of direction about the development of their economy.  Events have proved that that was popular because the party that most concentrated on it is the one that has been in government for some considerable time. One is entitled to ask at what cost to the economy of Britain and one is equally entitled to ask at what cost to the morale of Britain?  We can come back and ask at what cost to the morale of Ireland are we now obliged to take those steps?</P>
    <P>Speakers on all sides of the House realise that no man wishes to be on unemployment benefit for a considerable period, for three months much less six months, much less nine months. That has a great effect on the morale of any man and on his family.  It has a great effect on his relations with his <Col N="1820" /> wife and children.  It also has a great effect on his social habits, whether it is drinking or otherwise.  This is not just an economic problem.  It is a major social problem as well.  Surely it must be the function of the Government to watch what is becoming a pattern in the country, which is eating into the morale of the people.  Anybody who says it is not is ignoring the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary this morning nailed down some of the overstatements that people are better off on pay-related benefits, even from the economic point of view, than they would be in employment.</P>
    <P>If there are people overstating, and there are some such, do the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government not think it worth their while to consider why these people are overstating the position?  I do not think they can suggest that these various spokesmen, whether in the Press, in industry or otherwise are mouthpieces of Fianna Fáil.  There must be some deeper reason.  It is that the most essential thing that a Government must have, the confidence of the people, is undermined, drained or totally lacking.  When the sense of direction is lacking, what are the people expected to do by way of reaction? The reaction, understandably, will be a reaction of almost emotional response, of fear, of apprehension. If this exists, it is not enough for the Parliamentary Secretary to come in and say that some of these people are misleading the people, mis-interpreting things.  Perhaps they are but the Government should look at the root cause of this reaction.  The reason is that the people see the total failure of consistent policy on the part of the Government to bring them out of the depression in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>If the Government have not a clear sense of direction and if they have now introduced a new gimmick, to a certain extent, by inviting the various interest groups to share with them and to set up a working party to come up with proposals, that further undermines confidence because there is already the National Economic <Col N="1821" /> Council to do that job.  What people see is a Government who cannot decide for themselves where we are going because there are obviously divided counsels within the Government, and who then wish to bring in others with them further to excuse the fact that they do not have a clear sense of direction.  This, of course, leads to further undermining of confidence.</P>
    <P>The most hardworking civil servants at the moment are those in the Department of Social Welfare and it is no wonder that their frustration has been given public expression in recent times albeit it may be directly related to the accommodation problem but derives from a great deal more than that, from the sheer pressure of work at the moment.  Those of us who are Deputies know that allowing for the diligence with which the officers in that Department approach their work and the courtesy they extend to us, there is certainly a delay in applying benefits, a delay which is not culpable on their part, and that we wait a while between acknowledgment and final reply.  There may always have been delay but it is fair to say that the delay now is certainly considerably more than it was at any time in the past.</P>
    <P>Surely the Government might have a little look at that fact and see what is causing it because we are now extending the period by three months and possibly later by a further three months and if we come here next year and find that there are 110,000 unemployed, will this Government be happy?  Will they say, as the Parliamentary Secretary said this morning, that this is in fact &ldquo;a further advance in the social programme of the Government&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Are we being asked to consider that any programme of a Government can operate in isolation?  The social programme of the Government is now being further advanced while the economic programme of the Government is being retarded and in fact is facing backwards and going downhill. Will this Government be happy if they come in in another few months with a further advance in the social <Col N="1822" /> programme while the economic programme is going exactly the other way?  If they will, the people will not be satisfied; the people cannot be satisfied.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan is right when he says that a man who is unemployed does not want it that way.  There are people&mdash;I know some individuals myself&mdash;who because of the pride which they have&mdash;and I do not use the word in the wrong sense&mdash;because they do not want to be seen to be relying on State assistance, which they have never done before, will not apply.  On two occasions recently wives came to me to know if anything could be done because of the terrible condition in which they found themselves.  The husbands&mdash;small farmers&mdash;would not apply.  This is characteristic of the attitude of many people.  They do not want to live on bread and circuses. Empires crumbled on that basis.  The provision of bread and circuses was the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire.  One can study the decline of many countries and one finds that when a cushion is provided without dealing with root cause and effect on people, without in other words offering the people the dignity of work and opportunity to realise their own plans for themselves and their families, then the extension of the social programme, as the Parliamentary Secretary has called it, is precious little consolation to them.</P>
    <P>I wonder if I am being too naive in thinking that while there are divided counsels in the Government, particularly in relation to tax proposals&mdash; and there is clear evidence now that counsels are indeed very divided, probably because of the views being conveyed by representative elements in the community to both sides within the Government&mdash;if the Government could climb down from the dogmatic stance they adopted at the time when the economy was going well, in the run into the last election, when they promised a wealth tax, a capital gains tax and all these packages, and if they postponed, indeed, if they repealed their intention to go ahead with one or other of these&mdash;I do not think it would suit the socialists; I do <Col N="1823" /> not think it would suit Deputy Barry Desmond, for instance&mdash;it is possible that we might see the most important thing, a restoration of confidence? Confidence may be something that is not very tangible but unless there is confidence in the economy, unless there is a sense of confidence on the part of workers and investors and persons who have built up businesses, there will be a sick feeling throughout the community and that is all too prevalent at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that the Parliamentary Secretary in introducing what normally would be regarded as very positive progressive legislation found it necessary to be so defensive and so apologetic this morning.  If a Bill of this nature were coming in at an ordinary time&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary admits that this is an abnormal time&mdash;there would be no need for this apology and this defence. In defending the scheme the Parliamentary Secretary is attempting to defend the Government in their failure to provide the proper job opportunities and employment that are so essential.</P>
    <P>There is another element that it is important to consider.  In common with a number of people in this House I came to maturity in the fifties.  I was a graduate of the fifties.  I was one of a number of graduates who emigrated and one of a small number who were fortunate enough to be able to come back when things started to pick up in the early sixties.  I remember in my home town the people who were unemployed in that period. There were no pay-related benefits available at that time.  I remember people who were unemployed for three or four years.  Because of that experience at that time these people became chronically unemployable.  If a man loses the habit of work and if the attitude of others towards him is that he does not wish to work, nobody will want to take him on. A number of those who were coming into employment in the twenties and thirties are now unemployable through no fault of their own.  If there had been pay-related benefits at that <Col N="1824" /> time they would have cushioned them in the short-term but it would not have been any real solution to their problems.  It would not have maintained their dignity and character. Men's lives have been ruined by the experience of unemployment.  Their families have suffered because of chronic unemployment.</P>
    <P>Here we are talking about an extension of the social programme without thinking of the effect this is having on families.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary not know that if you have a man sitting around the fire, even with a reasonable level of pay-related benefit, he is no asset to himself and less to his wife and family?  If he does this for six, 12 or 18 months what will be the effect when he finds he has lost the habit of employment?  Is this something the Government have considered or are they just extending their social programme without taking any account of the lack of economic planning? If they are it is reprehensible and something that no Government can stand over.</P>
    <P>Even if the Government were now to retrace some of their steps on their tax proposals and even if some people thought it was again becoming worthwhile to invest in one's own country, to work for one's own country, to create employment in one's own country, it would not be merely as significant as it should be because there would still be a gnawing doubt in the minds of many people that this Government who could have conceived such an idea when the economy was in a strong position and could have gone ahead with it when the economy was rolling fast downhill, might just come back, because of doctrinaire positions, and go on with it again. That is where the whole question of confidence comes in.</P>
    <P>We went through a period, particularly before the last election, when we were told about the potential Cabinet of all the talents on this side. and, for a short time after it, the Cabinet of all the talents on that side. It is now almost a part of the fairy tales of Ireland.  The Taoiseach himself said he was lucky to find a place <Col N="1825" /> in the Cabinet.  It was a Cabinet of individual talents as they seemed to be.  The reality has now emerged. Whether or not it is a Cabinet of all the talents, it is certainly a Cabinet of very divided counsel.  As in any walk of life teamwork, maturity, understanding and determination are essential and they are so clearly lacking in the present programmes of the Government.  They are happy, apparently, if individual Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries are being acclaimed for their activities in Europe, as distinct from the results of their activities, or for the promotion this Parliamentary Secretary is getting, or for the level of tolerance that they seem to show in certain areas, which does not affect, in any event, the economy, or for the level of intolerance that some of them show in other areas which keeps them in the headlines. All these things keep them in the headlines.  The Cabinet of all the talents.  Where is the collective will? Where is the collective sense of direction? While this is lacking we lesser mortals, on this side, who have a sense of responsibility or at least a contact with the people, we lesser mortals who may not enjoy those talents for writing, for projecting or for argument, as the case may be, think, with some justification, that the people recognise in us at least a certain sense of normality, of commonsense and of judgment, and that if we have nothing else but that&mdash;we may have a little more but it is not for us to present that, it is for someone else&mdash;then we have something which the Irish people can follow and can feel confident in following, something which would lead this country out of the morass in which it now is.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the unemployment figure continues to grow.  The number on the register now is over 103,000. What about the numbers in this city, and there are many of them in other cities too, who were engaged in many aspects of work and who were not insurable under the social welfare scheme?  What about those men who have no claim under the pay-related benefit scheme?  There are many of them.  They may have been in industry. <Col N="1826" /> They may have been in what some people would say are non-productive areas such as estate agencies, the stock exchange, banking circles. Qualified people such as architects do not have pay-related benefits.  What about the effect it is having on them and their wives and families?  It is all very well to say that our main preoccupation must be with the lower paid workers.  That, of course, is so when one talks in terms of social benefits, but we all inevitably develop social demands and habits of life according to our present status.  We may sometimes overspend.  We move in a certain circle because of our social conditions, and to find that because of unemployment the whole thing has been undermined is a crushing blow on many people.  This is one of the other tragic extensions of the present position.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues on that side must know many such cases.  It is a very limited social programme if it means some architects that I know, and many people like them, sitting at home in their own rooms waiting for Godot.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile inflation continues apace.  While that is running so fast any attempt to &ldquo;extend&rdquo; the social programme will be very ineffective indeed. The Minister for Industry and Commerce was the person who told us that we were living in a raging tempest of international inflation, we were lucky to be able to cling to the raft at all at the time.  Now the storm has apparently subsided and the winds have changed direction.  If there is an eye to the hurricane now it is centered right here with the exception of Iceland and Turkey to some extent. Now there seems to be some other cause.  This inflation is eating right into these benefits and is undermining any attempt to deal with this chronic condition.</P>
    <P>One cannot talk in terms of a social programme in isolation.  It defeats itself.  It will of course allow the Parliamentary Secretary to work even harder to be the most popular man within the Administration but it is a contradiction in terms.  We cannot have a meaningful social programme until such time as we have a clear <Col N="1827" /> economic programme.  When you do not have an economic programme and when you have to run to every corner of the country to find someone to help you to find it then a social programme is a nonsense, and it is no comfort to those who are the &ldquo;beneficiaries&rdquo; under the social programme.</P>
    <P>I only hope that in three, two or one year's time we will not have created what was created in the fifties &mdash;a generation of unemployables, a generation of people whose whole attitude to life was undermined because of the chronic unemployment conditions then which have unfortunately been repeated now, some of them broken up because of the unemployment of the wage earners and because of the undermining of the dignity of the workers.  No increase could compensate for that.  I trust that if the Parliamentary Secretary returns to this area of social welfare he will operate in a different context, in the context of acknowledging that while these benefits are essential they should not be so much part of a pattern of undermining the morale of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard the popular but, unfortunately, simplistic comment from Deputy O'Kennedy that one cannot have a social programme unless one has first an economic programme, I despair as to what our universities turned out in the fifties and sixties.  I say that with no disregard personally for Deputy O'Kennedy.  The Fianna Fáil attitude to the Bill is insidious.  It is so outdated as to be beyond all credibility. In a serious economic situation it is possible to have a radical, comprehensive and effective social policy development.  Indeed, it may well be that the greater the economic crisis the greater is the need for an effective social programme.</P>

      <P>Both programmes are intertwined inevitably but to say that in order to have a social policy one must first have an economic programme <Col N="1828" /> is to go back to the old argument of the fifties which was enunciated by the late Mr. Seán Lemass who said that provided we have a national cake we can divide it but that we must make bigger the national cake.  That kind of political clap-trap is finished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of arguments abroad that need to be shown for what they are.  One is that it is not possible to have a social policy because we happen to be facing a serious economic situation and the other, and more insidious one, is that nothing can be done about social welfare unless areas such as education are improved.  These kinds of <i>non sequitur</i> economic arguments are full of loop-holes and of economic fallacy and the greatest fallacy of all is that of Fianna Fáil which says that it is not possible to have a policy in relation to unemployment, to disability or to pay-related benefits relating to unemployment, because we have not sufficient employment.  That type of equation comes very badly from a political party which, supposedly, has a support service.  One would have thought that after two years the economists in the Fianna Fáil think-tank would at least have advised their spokesmen that one <Col N="1829" /> can develop a dynamic social policy even in very rigorous budgetary and economic conditions.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on his comprehensive speech to the House.  I wish him well in implementing the Bill but I have no doubt that he will be able to deal with the mealy-mouthed attitude of Fianna Fáil and their very clever phrases such as the one used by Deputy O'Kennedy when he said that this kind of Bill is morale sapping.  That phrase is a great comfort to the director-general of the Construction Industry Federaration. The pay-related benefit scheme was introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1973 but I wish that some of their Deputies would read the Bill introduced by that party.  Deputy Andrews seems to be labouring under the misapprehension that this Bill relates solely to unemployment benefits.  It relates also to occupational injuries and disability benefit.  I do not know what is the total number in receipt of pay-related benefit but it would be interesting to have a breakdown of the figures for unemployment benefit&mdash;disability benefit, maternity benefit and so on.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputies opposite that they talk with a worker who is in receipt of occupational injuries benefit and who is enjoying the benefit of flat rate also and ascertain whether his morale is sapped.  The unfortunate man will not be able to return to work because of his injuries but he will now be able to have pay-related benefits for a further three months.  These simple aspects of the Bill have been overlooked by the Opposition in their frenzy to work the country into a state of hysteria.  We know that there are serious employment difficulties in five or six different industries, for example, the textile, the metal engineering, a segment of the construction industry and the motor industry but this Government will not panic in relation to these industries.  Perhaps a few more industries will close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few doubtful ones in respect of which no State rescue can succeed but if the textile industry can be rationalised effectively, and if the economic difficulties can be overcome, <Col N="1830" /> unemployment in that area will drop. The same would apply to the clothing industry.  The same would apply to part of the construction industry.  I will come later to Mr. Reynolds whom I would classify as spokesman for the Construction Industry Federation and I hope to refute some of the propaganda he has put out.  Indeed, the Parliamentary Secretary dealt with it effectively here this morning.</P>
    <P>I would very seriously ask Fianna Fáil in a very difficult employment situation not to deliberately and insidiously and maliciously set out to make a difficult situation even worse.  Last week I asked people to look soberly at the unemployment statistics.  Within the unemployment figure of 103,000 there are quite a large number of persons over the age of 65 years who are listed in that group.  They are not unemployed. They have retired and they are covered by other benefit.  They are not covered by pay-related benefit, by and large.</P>
    <P>It is about time we faced up to the fact that there are some thousands of persons in rural Ireland who are on the dole and who never worked in manufacturing industry.  They are drawing farmers' dole which is a means of maintaining rural income.  The formal inclusion of many thousands of such persons in the totality of 103,000 unemployed gives an air of complete unreality to the unemployment figures. Deputy Meaney knows who I am talking about: the farmer down in North Cork with 30 or 40 acres and, even though he may have a fairly substantial creamery cheque, even though he may earn quite a bit from cattle, and so on, even though he may have a few acres of sugar beet, because of his valuation he gets the dole.  Fianna Fáil suggest that that man is totally unemployed. He has less than a subsistence income.  Incidentally some people who draw the dole have a higher income than that but they are included in the figure of 103,000.</P>
    <P>People who are sick and cannot work draw disability benefit but they are included in the Fianna Fáil figure. There is a percentage on the live register, as there would be on the live register in any country, of people who <Col N="1831" /> are regarded as chronically unemployable. I would not dare to hazard a guess as to how many there are precisely, because that would be unfair to my fellow Irishmen.  They have not got much prospect of employment and they, too, are included in the figure of 103,000.  I would ask the Irish people and Fianna Fáil in particular to look at&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One must not name people but one can always name the unemployed.  I should like to see him living for one solid week on pay-related benefit.  I should like to see many of the so-called spokesmen for some employer organisations&mdash;they are a very small minority because the more perceptive of the spokesmen of the employer organisations fully understand the situation&mdash;living for a couple of weeks on pay-related benefit. Some of them would spend the £20.80 flat rate benefit which a man with a wife and two children gets on one week's drinking on a casual basis in their local suburban pub.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to suggest that some of them might try to live on the flat rate benefit my mother enjoys as a contributory widow of £9.40 a week. Some of them would spend that on <Col N="1832" /> an evening's jarring, and some of them do.  In the course of that enjoyment they denounce all those who by virtue of the tragedy of unemployment&mdash;and it is a personal traumatic tragedy for any family&mdash;as spineless wastrels in our community.  Some of these attitudes are as prevalent in the public sector as they are in the private sector.  They too should live for a couple of weeks on flat rate or pay-related benefit and they would forget about some of their right-wing conservative propaganda.</P>
    <P>I want to quote the spokesman for the Construction Industry Federation as reported in yesterday's <i>Evening Press.</i> Listen to this furious propaganda splashed across the front page of the <i>Evening Press.</i> This is very popular with people who are not on unemployment benefit.  They say: &ldquo;Unlike the people who are sponging on society and the itinerants we pay our taxes.&rdquo;  This is supposed to be the great social conscience of many people.  This gentleman said: &ldquo;They...&rdquo; I suppose by &ldquo;they&rdquo; he means the Department of Social Welfare, or the Government, or the establishment, or the Houses of the Oireachtas enacting legislation.  He said:</P>
    <P>They gave increased benefits to the unemployed rather than seeking to maintain employment.</P>
    <P>That is a transparent equation with which it is difficult to come to grips because no matter how much one might talk about supporting the building industry, no matter how much one might talk about the millions of pounds which we pumped into the building societies in the past two years, no matter how much one might talk about the £6 million pumped into AnCO to retrain workers so that they can go back and get decent jobs, no matter how much one might talk about hundreds of thousands of pounds which we put into the national employment services, and in particular the national manpower services and placement services, spokesmen like the spokesman for the Construction Industry Federation can turn around and say: &ldquo;They gave increased benefits to the unemployed <Col N="1833" /> rather than seeking to maintain employment&rdquo;. This equation is false; it is insidious.  The only cure for this type of thing is for these spokesmen to spend a couple of months on pay-related benefit, wait for their social welfare cheque every Friday afternoon, or every Saturday morning in rural Ireland, present it in the local post office and try to keep their wives and children on that income.</P>
    <P>That spokesman went on to say:</P>
    <P>When unemployment benefits reached a level that in many areas were at or exceeded, normal wage earnings, then &ldquo;it appears there is a degree of abdication of responsibility at the expense of the persons and firms who continue to pay taxes....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has proved that the only occasion when a person can approximate to his normal earnings on pay-related benefit is when that unfortunate person is so grossly exploited as a worker that his earnings are so low that the flat rate benefit exceeds average earnings or the average earnings are equated to the unemployment pay-related benefit.  That is not a major fault within the pay-related benefit system.  There may be a tiny group of people who enjoy that kind of benefit but that is not a benefit, it is a coincidence of some of the lousiest exploitation of Irish workers that continues in terms of low pay. I can give an example of it and if the spokesman for the CIF wants further examples I will bring him to my constituency and introduce him to constituents who would provide him with the evidence.  A young woman called to see me on Saturday in the Christian Men's Institute in Dún Laoghaire&mdash;I will call her Mrs. P.  She has two children, is 21 years of age and her husband is 20 years of age.  An apprentice electrician he worked in Dún Laoghaire but at the end of his apprenticeship three or four months ago, his employer fired him. Up to then his average earnings were £20 per week.  He had been told that at the end of his apprenticeship he would be released by the employer.</P>
    <P>I am sure it would be of great interest <Col N="1834" /> to the Apprenticeship Board to know the name of that employer but I do not propose to disclose it although I would disclose it to the CIF if they sought that information. That man who is at present out of work lives with his wife and children in a flat for which they pay a rent of £5 or £6 per week.  They feed themselves and their children on £12 to £13 per week.  That man never worked long enough to qualify under the pay-related benefit scheme.  His wife told me that they do not have much to spend on clothes or fuel.  I undertook to put this man in touch with the National Manpower Service to see if he could be placed in suitable employment. That man told me he had been unsuccessful in his efforts to find employment and his wife said she had to go out to work.  Three nights each week.  Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, she leaves her husband and children to work in a fish and chip shop in Dún Laoghaire from 6.30 p.m. to 1.30 a.m. for the princely sum from a well-heeled proprietor of £2.50 per night.  No tax is deducted and there are no social insurance deductions; sweet nothing, but the money goes to supplement her husband's unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>It would be a charity if the spokesman for the CIF met these young men and women.  Not only are they in receipt of what I regard as fairly modest social welfare benefits but they are also in receipt of sheer exploitation in terms of their employment. That is why I endorse the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that the average worker here spends what he earns each week on his wife and family seeking to provide a reasonable standard of living for them.  The Parliamentary Secretary added:</P>
    <P>Very few of them are able to put by money week by week, especially in a period of high and continuing inflation.  If that worker is hit by unemployment, as so many are now hit in our country, then his family is at once confronted with very sincere difficulties.  In these circumstances a family may easily go into debt.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of life.  There are <Col N="1835" /> far too many well-heeled Deputies, very few of whom have had to experience existing on a limited weekly income or having to spend all of it on rent, food and fuel.  Very few of us in our childhood, adulthood or in our family life, have ever experienced that normal culture of a working family earning and spending every penny that comes in weekly.</P>
    <P>I wish some of the Deputies would consider going on a sabbatical resignation for ten or 12 years out of this House and back to earning an average of £30 or £40 a week in a factory.  If they did they would return to this House knowing what it is like to have to exist on that wage.  At most only about a dozen Members experience what I would call normal living on an average wage.  I say that having closely examined not only Ted Nealon's book but the style of living of some Members I know.  I strongly support the Parliamentary Secretary's condemnation of those who are endeavouring to stir up trouble in relation to the pay-related system.</P>
    <P>Some of the spokesmen who have made the allegation I refer to should also play the other side of the record. Are they loathe, afraid, or too much involved to make any comment about those who either in private employment or in the public service or manufacturing industry, although they pay their taxes, social welfare and their one per cent contribution with a maximum of 50p per week for pay-related, exploit workers?  It does not break anybody in terms of social welfare contributions to pay the one per cent or 50p.  For two pints a week the insured workers have a pay-related supplement available to them and that is not much to be asked to pay.  However, to judge by some of the selective whining that went on from some of the Fianna Fáil spokesmen today one would swear that the Government were bleeding the insured population pink in asking them to pay a maximum of 50p per week.  They are being asked to pay that so that when they are unemployed, injured at work, out sick or when there is maternity benefit to be collected, they can obtain <Col N="1836" /> benefit under this scheme.  Some of those who whine so much about these contributions and who are so selective in their condemnation of those who are on pay-related benefit when they go for an afternoon's golf, or take an extended lunch and have a few drinks, or when they bring their wives shopping to consider whether they should change the fridge and get a new freezer, should consider the advantage they have over the average worker. The castigation by the spokesmen of those on pay-related benefit ill becomes some of them.  That kind of criticism cuts both ways.</P>
    <P>The CIF spokesman has the nerve to suggest that one of the major reasons why people are idling on the employment registers is because the Government have been disastrously handling the construction industry.  I should like to put on record the fact that in the 12 months, to 26th March, 1975, as a Government we have built 26,396 houses.  That statistic has just come from the CSO.</P>
    <P>We have broken our record figure of 25,000 houses.  I should love to ask the spokesman for the construction industry to count each of the 26,396 houses.  Among them he would find 7,331 local authority houses, in the private grant-aided sector he would find 17,624, 441 other State-aided houses and 1,000 houses that have been converted.  This Government have had to face considerable propaganda with regard to the construction industry and it is about time some facts were stated.  The figure of 26,396 is new data and people should be made aware of it.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Fianna Fáil that they should not indulge in propaganda.  I note the statement by the Parliamentary Secretary that if there are cases of abuse with regard to social welfare benefits all people have to do is to contact their local Deputies.  In conscience, the latter are obliged to pass on this information.  During the years I have met many people who have told me that they know of cases where people are on the &ldquo;lump&rdquo; while they are getting unemployment benefit but when they are asked for information to substantiate their statements they <Col N="1837" /> refuse to give it.  As a result, the kind of evidence required to deal with any abuses is rarely produced.  So ignorant are Fianna Fáil about the operation of the social welfare system that they allege abuses occur in relation to unemployment benefit when, in fact, we all know they are more likely to occur in relation to disability benefit.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has done a good day's work in introducing this Bill.  I reject the propaganda now fashionable in the country, and particularly in relation to the financial difficulties of voluntary schools, where it is said that money should not be spent on social welfare but on education. That is a false equation.  The pay-related benefit is essential and the decision made by the Government in this instance is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>This morning Deputy O'Kennedy indulged in propaganda when he said the British introduced a welfare state and that it sapped the morale of that country.  That is the classic Margaret Thatcher Tory propaganda when all of us know the fundamental reason for the British difficulties is the outdated technological base of much of British industry.  I suggest their industrial relations problem has had a far greater impact on the economy than the morale-sapping social welfare schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With the other speakers I am glad it has been possible to extend the provisions of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Bill which I had the pleasure of bringing through both Houses of the Oireachtas. The attitude of the last speaker <Col N="1838" /> who tried to say Fianna Fáil were critical of extending this Bill is typical of a Government who wish to keep away from the real issue.  They are trying to pin the blame on Fianna Fáil for something that is not our fault.  Unfortunately, it is most necessary that the pay-related scheme be extended.  As Deputy Callanan and others pointed out, if this were not done the vast number of unemployed would be marching on the streets.</P>
      <P>On 21st November, 1972, I introduced the Second Reading of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Bill.  On that occasion there were only two speakers from the Opposition who contributed to the debate, Deputies B. Desmond and Creed.  The pay-related benefit concept was first mooted in the <i>Third Programme for Social and Economic Expansion.</i> In those days we had programmes that outlined our proposals for the economy and that set out the direction in which we were moving.  It was an essential part of a properly run Government.</P>
      <P>It was some time after the Third Programme was published that we got round to getting the Bill off the ground.  There was much research to be done and there was a limited staff to carry out the work in my Department. They did a tremendous job in making the necessary preparations for what has since proved to be even a better estimate for the payment of pay-related benefit than I thought it might.  At the time I pointed out I was happy to get something formulated that would give effect to pay-related benefits but I said that no doubt deficiencies would manifest themselves.  I thought that, in time, the measure could be made a better instrument for the disbursement of money, somewhat in keeping with normal earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember giving considerable thought to the whole concept of pay-related benefits as opposed to flat rate benefits.  While there is much to be said for it and, in the context of our economy, it is absolutely essential, at the same time, it is an admission that there are many people not sufficiently paid.  The discrepancy between the lower paid and higher paid workers <Col N="1839" /> is something which has never been properly provided for by any Government. It is an admission that some people enjoy a higher standard of living. Indeed, the whole concept of pay-related benefits is the maintenance for people of the standard to which they have become accustomed; that those who have not become accustomed to these standards can go without.  That is the fundamental thinking behind pay-related benefits.  I suppose it is true to say that if one family lives on £30 a week and another on £50 a week, the second family&mdash;having adjusted to a particular standard&mdash;if, due to incapacity, unemployment or something else have to fall back on State benefits they find it difficult to adjust to a lower rate.  Therefore, the actual principle behind pay-related benefits was to ensure that persons who became accustomed to a certain standard of living would be enabled, as far as possible, to maintain that standard in times of unemployment or incapacity.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the better concept, in any properly orientated social conscience of a Government, would be to raise the lower paid workers to a better level.  That was something to which we were moving rapidly at the time we were endeavouring to expand the opportunities available to the increasing population, when things were going well.</P>
    <P>To get pay-related benefit off the ground in the first instance required some method of putting tabs on everybody's incomes.  Were it not for the fact that the Revenue Commissioners, particularly under the PAYE scheme, had that index of incomes of all people, it would not have been possible to introduce the pay-related benefits scheme unless we set up a complete new section, rather elaborate machinery, in order to provide this information for the Department of Social Welfare itself which would have posed problems of space, recruitment, computer service and so on.  It was fortunate that the Revenue Commissioners were available at the time to enable us provide the record of earnings, based on income tax payments, so that the pay-related scheme could <Col N="1840" /> be made workable.  A £14 floor or limit was fixed at the time after a good deal of thought and comparison with other countries.  If I remember correctly the thinking behind it was that a single man's flat rate benefit then was £5.55 per week.  I may not be accurate in the pennies.  That was reckoned to be approximately 40 per cent of £14.  The £14 was fixed as the floor and it was decided that 40 per cent of the earning above £14 would be the amount payable under the pay-related scheme.</P>
    <P>It proved to be quite a useful exercise and has withstood the test of time. Very little change has been necessary in the structure of the legislation as then initiated.  The big problem was the question of the amount that should be collected in order to finance the scheme.  Whatever actuarial assessment we did make at the time, like all civil servants on such occasions, we erred on the right side.  It was decided also that the Bill be brought into operation before sufficient money had been paid into the fund to meet it. The Minister for Finance decided to come to the rescue in that respect, with an undertaking that he would restore to the fund the amount extracted from it in order to get the scheme off the ground before we actually started collection.  I think the collection date was the beginning of the financial year 1974.  I take it that that is why the Minister has not provided for the expenditure of the entire surplus in the fund at present. I assume that part of this money has gone to the restoration of what the Exchequer provided to meet the cost of the earlier introduction of the scheme.  The surplus in the fund would warrant something better than what the Parliamentary Secretary is doing at present.  If the figures given in the House time and again are accurate, the credit in the fund would justify some better provision than is being made at present.  I wonder has the Parliamentary Secretary considered raising the upper limit of the £50 or reducing the floor level of £14?  The amount to which the fund is in credit would permit the Parliamentary Secretary to undertake such exercises at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1841" /> I had the same experience when I brought the Redundancy (Amendment) Bill through the House.  At that time we had a very substantial credit balance in the Redundancy Fund and the pressure was on me to amend legislation in order to make better provision for redundancy, which I did at the time, virtually doubling the benefit and shortening the period for qualification.  It was not very long until the credit in the fund turned into a deficit; redundancies became more numerous.  It is very difficult to foresee what the future holds in that respect.  We had to raise the amount of the contribution payable in respect of the redundancy element in the weekly social insurance stamp. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary is afraid to dip too deeply into the fund at present.  If that is an indication of what the Government expect from the economy in the future it is a fairly gloomy outlook.  To my mind the fund would provide for a much more generous amendment than that now before the House.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will explain these matters when replying.  The previous speaker, Deputy B. Desmond, was setting up Aunt Sallys and knocking them down &mdash;contrary to that&mdash;we must welcome this because we were the fathers of this legislation, the people who piloted it through the House right through to the President's signature.  In the debate in that volume of the Official Report of November, 1972, when I made the principal introductory speech on the Second Reading, two members only of the Opposition contributed to the debate.  Deputy Barry Desmond threatened a great many amendments for Committee Stage.  My recollection is that he produced none, proof that, on careful reading of the Bill, he found it was a good effort and did not really leave scope for any ready amendment.  The Bill got a very quick passage through the House. Those who contributed to the debate on it welcomed it.  They did, of course, say it was overdue.</P>
    <P>In welcoming this extension of social legislation one must refer to <Col N="1842" /> the overall question of social services and social welfare generally.  In a progressive, organised, developing economy social services are less of a problem.  I do not envy the Parliamentary Secretary trying to steer a course in the sea of social welfare to meet the ever-growing and increasing demands for social welfare, to say nothing of the increasing numbers unfortunately being rendered eligible for benefits and the erosion in the amounts being paid as a result of the unchecked and galloping inflation the country is experiencing.  This is really a trying time in Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Parliamentary Secretary's position I used to point out frequently that social welfare was only part of the social services.  There are other things such as housing, education and so on.  Every Department has its social side and every social side is equally important.  When we come to make comparisons in regard to economic development&mdash;this is something that sickens me when I listen to the Government spokesmen&mdash;and when we talk about prices and income tax comparisons are invariably made with other highly developed economies. There is no comparison whatever. We were developing rapidly until we got a setback recently.  We will get over this but, had the same rate of progress we enjoyed in the years preceding 1973 been maintained for another ten or 15 years, the Minister for Social Welfare would have a relatively easy job.  Fewer people would be demanding benefits.  There would be better benefits for those who required them and there would be fewer unemployed.  The economy would be yielding up more money for redistribution.</P>
    <P>The opposite is happening now and that is why the Parliamentary Secretary's job is a difficult one.  He has to apply the cosmetic to put a gloss on social welfare.  The source from which we derive the money for redistribution is undergoing a severe test.  The numbers requiring social welfare benefits are increasing daily.  I am forcefully reminded of the situation because I was on that side of the House when the unemployment figure <Col N="1843" /> reached 80,000 at one time.  We had a profusion of speeches of the most vehement kind from the Labour benches about the disaster that had struck the country with 80,000 unemployed. We were being asked to declare a crisis.  It was a serious situation but when the spring came the figures rapidly declined.  I remember every Minister was asked to make some contribution towards reducing unemployment so far as his Department permitted.  The response was significant and before April the figures had gone down considerably.  We have unfortunately a figure we regard as normal where unemployment is concerned. Now we are entering the summer with the figures rising.  It is against this background we must examine the situation.  It is not the Parliamentary Secretary's duty but he could give us some indication of what he thinks will be the outturn of the efforts of the Government.  He is extending the pay-related scheme.  We are in complete agreement with him in this for the purpose of providing for people facing catastrophe but he might let us know if he has any information that the Government are stirring themselves towards the formulation of a programme and policy that will, first of all, ensure the production of wealth and, secondly, absorb some of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Where do we go if the position continues as it is?  Where do we go if firms keep going into liquidation, the unemployment figure keeps rising and the inflow of revenue falls?  What indication is there that the red will change to amber?  The stock-in-trade argument of the Government is that we talk gloom and thereby worsen the situation by reminding people of it.  It is the duty of an Opposition to pinpoint what is happening and, if possible, to wake the Government out of their stupor and get them moving in the right direction, doing something fundamental instead of performing the cosmetic exercise in which they have been engaged for the past two years.  The Parliamentary Secretary will not deal with this in depth but he could make some reference to it in the light of the insuperable task with <Col N="1844" /> which he is charged in dealing with social welfare in a situation where the economy is tending to become worse with each day that passes.</P>
    <P>It is a gigantic task and one which the Minister for Social Welfare and the Parliamentary Secretary will find impossible to continue if the position does not change.  I suppose all of us take a certain pride in doing things which are beneficial but this pay-related scheme is nothing more or less than making people save money to provide for themselves.  This scheme, which we are dealing with, is one which I introduced where the taxpayer does not contribute anything.  It is entirely contributed by the employer and the employee. They put aside a certain amount of money against the rainy day.  The Exchequer does not pay anything towards this.</P>
    <P>We know from the last budget that the Exchequer will no longer contribute to the social insurance fund.  The Minister for Social Welfare is merely taking from workers and employers a certain amount of money, putting it into the social insurance fund and distributing it as he thinks fit at times when unfortunate circumstances over-take people.  In this legislation we are taking from the employer and the employee £X and putting it into a fund from which we pay it to them when they are, unfortunately, due to incapacity, injury or unemployment, unable to work.  Maternity benefit is also paid in certain cases.</P>
    <P>So long as people who pay it are prepared to make contributions towards this fund the money is there to help them at times when we think they need it.  It is a godsend to the Government to have it now because O'Connell Street would have been blocked with the unemployed and they would be lying down on O'Connell Bridge protesting against the unemployment situation.  This Bill will ward off the evil day for another while. There is a provision in it where the Minister can by order in the future extend the period so that he need not come in with an amending Bill for the next extension.  He will just make an order which, if it is not annulled by the House after the customary 21 statutory <Col N="1845" /> waiting days, will automatically pass into law.  I can see no reason at the moment why the unemployment situation will improve so the Minister may have to make a further order. That is possibly the reason why he is not delving into the entire credit fund at the moment and is only using part of the fund to meet the requirements of the extension of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will probably explain this in his reply.  Perhaps the abnormal increase in the number of unemployed is the reason why a more generous provision is not made in respect of the scheme at this time.  The Department estimate of the cost of the legislation, which is usually on the right side, does not make any serious inroads into the credit available to the Minister at the moment.</P>
    <P>We are glad to see the extension of this scheme but we regret the need to have it extended.  When I brought this legislation through this House and the Seanad I thought the provision made for the duration of payment was sufficient for normal interruptions of work. I thought the economy would be doing very badly if the people unemployed could not be re-employed in that time. There is a serious reason for this extension and I hope a future extension will not be necessary.  If we could get back to the days when we were working to a programme, when we could see the future as one of greater development then we could look on social welfare and the social programme generally in a totally different manner.  We could look on it as something to which we could make a very genuine contribution from the improving economy, where we would have more money to redistribute and fewer people requiring the money.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to have his job made easier&mdash;and it is a difficult one in present circumstances and tends to become more difficult&mdash;and get into the position where the number of recipients will contract rather than expand and where the amount of <Col N="1846" /> money available for distribution will increase rather than diminish, let him get the Government to come out of their shell, out of their complacency and do something about inflation and the economy generally.  His job and that of the Minister for Social Welfare will become easier in those circumstances. Where the number of recipients is increasing and the value of what they receive is being eroded by inflation and when the economy is declining daily, the Minister for Social Welfare has an unenviable task.  I do not envy him.  I wish him the best of luck.</P>
      <P>Anyone who would not welcome this legislation or recognise the need for it at this time would have very little social conscience.  I trust that the circumstances that have prompted the introduction of this legislation will not continue so as to require further extension of the legislation.  If further extension is required we will again support the Parliamentary Secretary. It is a matter of personal triumph for me that the legislation that I had the pleasure to introduce has stood the test so well and so few changes were required since the legislation was first introduced in October 1972.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are today discussing a Bill to extend the time for the payment of pay-related benefit.  I do not castigate any recipient of pay-related benefit.  A member of the Labour Party seemed to insinuate that members of the Fianna Fáil Party were inclined to sneer at and to castigate recipients of pay-related benefit and social welfare recipients in general.  The truth is far from that. I sympathise with these people.  It is a shocking state of affairs that there should be so many in that category. The Parliamentary Secretary and others on the Government side of the House tried to claim credit for something that is inevitable.  Deputy Desmond suggested that the Government were responsible for some historic breakthroughs in social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I am sad that there are so many who have to apply for the benefit.  The Government can claim credit for the number of persons who have to claim benefit. <Col N="1847" /> A huge amount of money has to be made available because there are so many out of work.  That did not come about by accident.  The introduction of the Bill has been forced on the Government by the fact that there are so many out of work, so many who had good jobs.  There does not seem to be any hope of the situation returning to normal and of those people being able to take up employment again and receiving a living wage out of which to support themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>The Bill was introduced because workers are very near revolt.  They are sick and tired of the promises of the Government.  They are sick and tired because the bright future which they were promised is not being realised.  The workers are getting restless. The Government have got the message and have introduced this Bill and we as a party will not oppose the Bill.  There may be a few weaknesses in the Bill which this party will deal with on Committee Stage.  We will put down amendments.</P>
    <P>It is time that something positive was done to create employment. Large numbers of land workers who are unemployed should be returned to work.  The responsibility rests on the Government.  They are doing nothing to provide employment and to get the economy moving.  The economy is declining.  This is obvious from the reports that we get of the state of the nation.  The position is going from bad to worse.</P>
    <P>I was glad that Deputy Joe Brennan outlined the history of pay-related benefit and the part that the Fianna Fáil Party played in its introduction. Deputy Brennan also made the noteworthy point that when he introduced the Second Reading of the Bill that he brought in there were only two members of the then Opposition who spoke to it.  The Opposition at that time did not seem to have any great interest in the Bill.  They welcomed it and that was all.  They promised that they would do things later on.  It is no harm to remind the people now on the other side of the House that when they were in Opposition they <Col N="1848" /> were not very helpful in bringing in the pay-related benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is claiming credit for all that he is doing. There is one provision of which I cannot approve.  The Parliamentary Secretary indicated that the weekly rate of pay-related benefit payable at present is 40 per cent of the part of a claimant's reckonable weekly earnings which lies between £14 and the upper limit of £50. He said that the rate which will be payable in respect of the proposed additional period of 78 days will be 30 per cent of reckonable earnings between £14 and £50.</P>
    <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary think that a person who is out of work for a number of days finds it easier to meet the cost of living if his unemployment continues?  Does he think that such a man will not have the same bills to pay?  What is the reason for the reduction from 40 to 30 per cent?  If it is 40 per cent in respect of a certain period, why should it not be 40 per cent in respect of the additional period of 78 days?  It is becoming increasingly difficult to meet the cost of living.  The Parliamentary Secretary should rectify that and should indicate to the House that he will do so.  The Parliamentary Secretary states that the cost will be borne by present contributions from employers and employees.</P>
    <P>That may be the case but if unemployment is to keep rising will the present contributions be sufficient to keep the scheme functioning?  Was the reduction of 10 per cent brought in so that the Parliamentary Secretary would not have to tell anybody that he would have to pay a higher contribution or was it brought in as a warning to recipients to expect a reduction in their benefits?  There seems to be a new idea in the Department that if one is out of work for a certain period, through no fault of one's own but because of the mismanagement of the Government of the day, the State can say: &ldquo;We will reduce your benefit now and you will be all right.&rdquo; That is disgraceful.  The Parliamentary Secretary is making capital of the fact that he is not looking for higher contributions at present. The number of unemployed has not <Col N="1849" /> decreased this spring and summer as happened for so many years.  In the last few weeks there has been a marked increase in the number of unemployed registered.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary categorically state that if this continues there will not be an order made extracting higher contributions from employers and employees?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary ever look at our society and say to himself that he should be doing something more positive to create employment and putting proposals before his Minister and the Government?</P>
    <P>A high percentage of our population is in the under-16 category.  That means we have a small proportion of our people working, paying taxes, supporting the older people and seeing to it that the younger people are reared properly.  It is more important for this nation than any other to make sure that we have full employment. Various Ministers tell us about the economy of the United States, the economy of Russia or somewhere else, to justify what is happening here. Most of what is happening here is the result of present Government policy. Much could be done to boost our economy and provide employment but it is not being done.  The important thing is to get our people back to work and responsibility for that rests squarely on the shoulders of the Government. They do not seem to be able or willing to carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>I listened to various speakers in this debate and they seemed to ramble a lot from the Bill.  I would like to reply to one in particular, Deputy Desmond. He mentioned the number of houses built.  He talked about what unemployed people are receiving.  He even discussed what is being spent in fish and chips shops.  He went over that wide area and was not inhibited.  Deputy Desmond is a prominent member of the Labour Party.  He told us that some people would find it very difficult to live on what is paid to recipients of pay-related benefit, contributory old age pensions or widows' pensions. That is true but who is responsible for that but the Government? Why did they not bring in a better budget?  Why did Deputy Desmond <Col N="1850" /> not oppose the budget?  I wonder if he is on the one hand congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary and telling him he is behind him while on the other hand he is on a sway-away, politically gutting his own party.  He said a widow cannot live on £9.40 a week.  He is right but if he believes that he should be honest enough to stand up and say he cannot support the Government who brought in those proposals in the last budget.  He said it was a good budget.  Those people find it impossible to pay for food and heat, not to mention clothing.  He went on to tell us about housing programmes. How this came into it I do not know.  He knows as well as I do that there are fewer people employed today on building houses.  He said there were more houses than ever built during the past few years.  They were built on land purchased by the Fianna Fáil Government.  The foundation was laid by them.  It is up to the present regime to make sure that continues. It would be better for the Government to be providing money for local authorities to build houses than doing many of the things they are thinking of at present.  The local authority of which I am a member cannot accept a tender for a house now because we have not got the finance.  There is an official from the Department of Local Government coming down on 19th May to find out what kind of scheme we want.  Our manager has submitted the facts.  The Minister for Local Government on 1st May said he did not receive the facts. The manager has informed our meeting that he submitted them on 23rd April and it is more than dishonest for the Minister to say he did not receive them.</P>

      <P>Would we not have less money to pay out in pay-related benefits if adequate amenity grants were being paid at present?  There are no amenity grants being paid to local authorities.  They would create employment and reduce the number of people qualifying for benefit.  Of the people receiving pay-related benefit 99.99 per cent would prefer to be at work.  AnCO have great schemes for retraining workers but the State is not providing the money to give proper employment.  There would be fewer people qualifying under this Bill if the State had provided money to develop private housing schemes that have come to a full stop at present. There is no use in people trying to tell us of the great things the Government have done when we know that things are going from bad to worse.  It would be as well for them to face up to it because they are working on borrowed time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary covered a wide field.  He seemed to attack anybody who suggested the creation of a greater incentive to work.  There will have to be a campaign aimed at providing employment for those people who are out of work.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to allegations from politicians, individuals and in the newspapers to the effect that people are better off to be in receipt of pay-related benefits than to be working.  While I have much sympathy with a person who must resort to this benefit some of them have told me that for a period after becoming unemployed, they are better off than if they were working.  The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that a person with two children who had been earning £39 while employed would receive £27.20 if he had to resort to pay-related benefit.  In making this comparison the Parliamentary Secretary has not been honest because he has avoided referring to the side benefits that result from unemployment, for instance, the non-payment <Col N="1852" /> of social welfare or superannuation contributions, the entitlement to free medical service, the non-payment of income tax and the absence of travelling expenses which would be involved in a person travelling to work.  Also, if a person stayed in digs while employed he would probably not have to remain in such accommodation while out of work.  The Parliamentary Secretary should have emphasised these points.  Surely, then, a person is almost as well off on pay-related benefit as he is when employed.</P>
    <P>I am not against the payment of this benefit because I know it is necessary, but what is saddening is that week after week there is an increase in the number of people qualifying for such benefits.  This is a sad reflection on the country and, in particular, on the Government who promised full employment.  No effort is being made to provide work.  There are no prospects of employment for our school leavers.  Many of those who left school last year, whether at secondary or third level stage, have not succeeded in obtaining employment.  The situation will be much worse this year and, apparently, in the years to come.  If we are to survive economically we must have a positive policy, a policy that will enable us to hold our own in the world.</P>
    <P>Large sums of money are being spent on social services but this would not be necessary if we had proper Government thinking.  Surely the present situation affords a wonderful opportunity to embark on a house-building and hospital-building programme which would absorb those people who have been made redundant in the footwear, motor assembly and other industries.</P>

      <P>Surely I am entitled to suggest where money should be spent.  I am questioning why it is <Col N="1853" /> necessary for so many people to have to resort to unemployment benefit.  In this context I am discussing the finance that is being provided by way of this Bill and I am suggesting that if that finance were channelled into projects such as I have mentioned, many of our unemployed could be absorbed.</P>
      <P>Why should not the State move in and begin the building of houses, hospitals and community halls?  Would it not be better to do this than to continue to pay so much in social welfare? Most people would prefer to be at work, and that is another reason why the Government should do as I suggest.  More emphasis should be placed on retraining personnel.  All parties in this House must play their part in helping to achieve a full employment situation.</P>
      <P>In the main we support the Bill although we do not agree with the clause regarding a reduction from 40 to 30 per cent in earnings in order to qualify for pay-related benefit.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary endeavoured to refute the idea that pay-related benefits provide some form of bonanza for maligners and dishonest idlers.  No matter what Act is passed, there will be somebody to take advantage of it.  Having said that may I suggest that the greatest dishonest idlers in this House are those people who held an Ard-Fheis in the Mansion House not very long ago when the people were treated on their television screens to good government at work.  The members of the Government are doing nothing and the sonner they are on pay-related benefit, the better for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to extend by three months the period of pay-related benefits.  We support the Bill.  As has been pointed out ours was the party who introduced the original Bill.  In his introductory speech the Parliamentary Secretary gave certain reasons as to why the Bill was introduced.  I should like to point out that, in my view, the basic reason for it was the very serious deteriorating economic situation which is resulting in rapidly rising unemployment and <Col N="1854" /> escalating prices and which has placed those who are dependent on social welfare benefits in an intolerable financial situation.  I have no doubt that if no attempt is made to control inflation or to control rapidly increasing prices, this pay-related benefit scheme could very easily become a permanent part of our social welfare code.</P>
      <P>There is little doubt in anybody's mind that the flat rate benefits which are available, considering the exceptional inflationary period in which we are living, are much too low to support an individual or a family.  There is a very definite need for the introduction of this Bill.  That need is there because of a complete lack of Government policy and because of the Government's failure to safeguard employment, to provide sufficient new jobs and, as I said a moment ago, to control inflation.</P>
      <P>Everybody is aware that inflation is very rapidly eroding our competiveness in the foreign market.  Therefore, we have more and more on the unemployment list as week follows week. Unless some attempt is made to control this inflationary situation, whatever increases are given under the social welfare code will not be sufficient to enable those who are dependent on them to live in any sort of reasonable comfort.  What the workers would like to see coming side by side with this Bill, which is necessary in the present circumstances, are other Bills which would ensure that more jobs will be created, that the jobs which are already there will be properly safeguarded, and that some effort was made by the Government to control the shocking inflation which we are experiencing at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no coincidence that what are apparently insoluble crises always appear to come at times when Coalitions are in office.  We had the Korean War in the 1948-51 period, the Suez crisis in the 1954-57 period, and the oil crisis now.  If one were to believe that, one would agree that Coalitions were a particularly unlucky type of setup as Governments in this country. After all, they were approximately eight years only in office, while <Col N="1855" /> Fianna Fáil Governments were in office for about 35 years.  It would be a rather strange coincidence if during those 35 years no problems or difficulties had arisen.</P>
    <P>The difference was that, when problems and difficulties arose during Fianna Fáil Administration, we had a united Government with a developed and particular policy to tackle those problems.  The problems were tackled and overcome and, so far as the people in general were concerned, they were never allowed to reach a crisis situation. The Coalition are obviously unable to agree, particularly on a financial policy which is the basis on which future development depends, and because they cannot agree on financial policies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not in order in discussing general Government policy.  I would ask him to relate his remarks to the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating my remarks to what I believe are the reasons why it was necessary to introduce this Bill.  Let me stress again that the original Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefits) Bill was piloted through the Oireachtas by a Fianna Fáil Government and a Fianna Fáil Minister.  It was a Fianna Fáil measure.  This has been stated by a number of Deputies who spoke before me, but it is essential that we should continue to restate this fact because of the efforts by the Coalition over the past couple of years to give the impression to the workers that this Act was a Coalition Act.  It was intended by the then Fianna Fáil Government to introduce the actual scheme in April, 1974.  This was stated on a number of occasions during the debate by the then Minister, Deputy Brennan.  As it so happened by the time April, 1974, arrived the Coalition had taken office and the provisions of the Act were introduced by the Coalition Government but as planned by a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the introduction of the scheme I queried the income which <Col N="1856" /> would be available from the 2 per cent of the gross income which was to be paid by the employers and the 1 per cent of the gross income which was to be paid by the employees.  I was informed at the time that the total amount expected from this 3 per cent was approximately £12 million and that it was felt that the expenditure would be approximately £10 million per annum.  When I queried the need for the extra £2 million income I was told that, as the scheme was a new one, it was not possible to estimate income and more particularly outgoings and that adjustments could be made later on.  I accepted that as being reasonable.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question this year it was revealed that the income into the fund for the nine-month period was approximately £8 million while the outgoings which include administrative expenses were less than £3 million. It was clear from this that the income even in a time of high unemployment was very high.  I felt that an adjustment could be made either by reducing the contribution from the employer and the employee or by improving in some way the pay-related benefit scheme as it stood.</P>
    <P>At that time the Parliamentary Secretary said to me that, as the scheme had not been in operation for a full year, it was not possible to make the assessment necessary and that, when the scheme had been in operation for a year, it would be reassessed and he would then make whatever adjustments he felt were necessary.  In his statement today the Parliamentary Secretary said that the annual cost of extending the period of payment by 78 days as proposed would be in the region of £1.8 million.  It would appear to me that there is still quite a considerable excess of income over expenditure even allowing for the extended period.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House how much was paid into the fund for the year ending 31st March, 1975, and what the expenditure was.</P>

      <P>The only people who will be affected by the decision which I announced in March, 1974, to cease RTE 405-line transmissions are those who still have sets capable of receiving 405-line transmissions only.  I understand that manufacture of these sets ceased here about 1963 so that all of them must be over 11 years old and most, if not all of them, are probably overdue for replacement at this stage.</P>
      <P>There is no statutory provision under which I could assist those who retain their 405-line only sets after RTE cease to transmit on 405-lines and such persons will still be obliged to have a current television licence. Elderly persons may, of course, be eligible for a &ldquo;free&rdquo; licence under the scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare for certain categories of pensioners.</P>

      <P>My Department's policy in recruiting telephonists, day or night, whole-time or part-time, is to secure the services of people who will be the most suitable for the work and thus capable of giving to telephone users as high a standard of service as possible.  Applicants accordingly are assessed on that basis.  So far as part-time night telephonist posts are concerned experience has shown that, in general, these <Col N="1859" /> are not attractive to unemployed persons because the remuneration attaching to the relatively short attendances involved would be generally less than the current unemployment benefits.</P>

Is he aware that on other occasions they were informed that vacancies did not exist?  Is he further aware that when vacancies did occur persons who held outside employment were given the posts even though they were earning between £40 and £60 per week?

      <P>As I pointed out to the Deputy, my Department's policy in recruiting telephonists is to secure the services of people who will be the most suitable for the work.  Not all people are suitable for this work and there have been, from time to time, complaints, including complaints from the Opposition benches, about the standards of service being supplied by night telephonists at present.  In these circumstances my Department does not consider it would be justified in excluding from consideration for part-time telephone work persons in full-time employment.  In practice such a policy would be very difficult to implement.  My main concern has to be with the efficiency of the telephone service which is not all that we would like it to be and which we are anxious to improve.  I do not think it would be improved by adopting the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

The principal matters requiring attention by the company are the conclusion of the negotiations with Marathon Petroleum Ireland Ltd.  on a contract for the supply of gas from the Kinsale field, and the initial planning of onshore installations to bring the gas to the ESB generating stations at Marina and Whitegate and the fertiliser factory at Marino Point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos.  10, 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to a parliamentary question on the subject on 15th April, 1975, the whole question of electricity supply for houses in remote areas like Ballycroy remaining unconnected following conclusion of the present scheme is at present being reviewed by my Department in consultation with the ESB and it is hoped that this review will be completed shortly.  It is not envisaged, however, that the present subsidised arrangements will be continued.</P>
      <P>The FEOGA Fund provides for aid for the supply of electricity to farms for farming purposes.  The procedure laid down requires individual farmers or groups of farmers to apply to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for participation in the benefits provided by the fund.  Aid under this fund would not be available to electricity supply to meet domestic requirements in farmers' houses.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the area mentioned in the question 95 people applied for rural electrification and that only 24 have accepted because of the high cost involved?  In some instances almost £1,200 has been demanded. Would the Minister not agree that this is departing from the whole concept of rural electrification?  Would he not consider it necessary to do something about cutting the cost?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the fact that there are areas such as Ballycroy and other districts where the cost of electricity is very high. There is another category that must be considered also, namely, the houses being built in closed areas.  I am engaged in this study at the moment and I hope to complete it very shortly. It is my wish to formulate some plan to cater for these people.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose <Col N="1872" /> to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The publicity campaign conducted during the first three months of this year with the object of promoting conservation of energy in the home cost approximately £150,000, which included the cost of production of advertisements, posters and brochures, as well as the cost of advertising space on radio, television, Press, etc.</P>
      <P>The increase in electricity prices is due to a number of factors including the increase in oil prices, the effects of general inflation and the reduction in the growth of demand resulting from the economic situation, the relatively mild winter and the efforts of consumers to eliminate waste.  In so far as the energy conservation campaign reduces consumption it may have a marginal effect on the current unit cost of electricity but this would be more than offset by the reduction in fuel costs.  I am fully satisfied that the campaign to promote the efficient use of all fuels and the elimination of waste in energy consumption is necessary and that the expenditure of £150,000 on the campaign is well justified.</P>

Would not it be better spent endeavouring to provide funds with which to extract the energy from the bogs of Ireland and in providing grants to local authorities to do so, which they have not got at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures quoted are correct.  The increase is due to an increase in exports of residual fuel oil from Whitegate Refinery from 63,000 tons in January/February, 1974, to 81,000 tons in January/February, 1975, and to the substantial price increase that took place during that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <P>Present legislation requires that fishing boats over 60 feet in length must carry radio equipment capable of operating on the medium frequency radio-telephone distress channel of 2182 kilocycles.  I understand that a number of vessels carry VHF equipment for commercial purposes.  Because of its short range the utility of VHF for distress messages is very limited.</P>

      <P>The IDA regional industrial plans specify as locations for industry the following centres in West Mayo: Castlebar, Westport, Ballinrobe, Cong, Keel, Bangor/Erris.  Measures have been or are being taken in all of these centres to generate industrial employment.</P>
      <P>In Castlebar, net manufacturing employment has increased by 600 in the past two years and an expansion to create a further 30 jobs has been approved for a firm in the town.</P>
      <P>In Westport, construction of a 20,000 sq. ft. factory to cost about £200,000 will commence at an early date and the county council at the request of IDA is seeking larger sites to accommodate major industry.</P>
      <P>In Ballinrobe, a further IDA advance factory of 7,000 sq. ft. is now completed and a project to occupy it is at an advanced stage of discussion.</P>
      <P>In Cong, IDA has approved a grant for a local firm to create a further 16 jobs.</P>
      <P>In Keel and Bangor/Erris, the IDA in conjunction with Mayo County Council are actively seeking to acquire suitable sites for industry.  This area should also benefit from the jobs at the construction and production phases of the Asahi plant in Killala.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that people in the Westport area in particular have a very big grouse because of their disappointment in not having an industry established there in the last few years, particularly having regard to the tradition in the area and also to the fact that the urban council have a serviced industrial estate available there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy says that of that list of towns Westport is the place in the greatest need currently of special attention, that is correct and I agree with him.  It is fair that I should reply that, as he will be aware, there has been a water difficulty which was in the past an deterrent to development of industry in Westport.  I think the situation is now satisfactory and I can assure the Deputy that of the list there I consider that Westport need and should deserve the strongest promotion.</P>

The matter is receiving a certain amount of publicity at present.</P>

I am very pleased that it is in my time as Minister for Industry and Commerce that that can be said about Mayo, and I am pleased, though I admit there are matters of urgency, that the sort of progress I have been able to indicate in my answer has been made in that and other parts of Mayo in the period of office of this Government.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd.  that a proposed project by a US promoter for location in Doonbeg is still under negotiation. The project has an employment potential for 160 people.</P>
      <P>In addition, they are in negotiation with promoters for the location of two projects at Kilrush, which between them would have an employment potential of 70 jobs.  The company have been asked to do everything to secure alternative employment for the redundant workers in Kilrush.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot, because there is so much variation.  Sometimes things come to a quick conclusion. Sometimes they do not.  If a fair amount of work had not been done on them, we would not consider them sufficiently mature proposals to be mentioned at all.  I could not give an estimate as to how long they will take.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the seriousness of the situation in Kilrush <Col N="1892" /> in particular and is he aware that in reply to a question I tabled here in January he gave me an assurance about one particular industry there and within a week the industry in question closed down?

      <P>In regard to my awareness. I said in the last sentence of my written answer that SFADCo have been asked to do everything to secure alternative employment for the redundant workers in Kilrush.  I acknowledge the need in Kilrush.  At a time of economic difficulty I am not in a position to know the details of the affairs of very many companies, and indeed they often do not make those details public or make them available to me until a very late stage.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I tabled a private notice question in regard to redundancies in the Lough Swilly Railway Company last night.  I had an indication from you this morning that that was being refused because the Minister had no responsibility.  I would like to point out to you, for reconsideration, the fact that the Minister may not be in a position to interfere in the day-to-day working but in view of the fact that the Minister last year gave an outright grant to the Lough Swilly Railway Company, a direct action by the Minister, would the question not now be in order when redundancies are involved and when those redundancies could be obviated by another direct grant?  Surely then the Minister has responsibility and you were not correct in ruling the private notice question out of order?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Parliamentary Secretary restrained himself during the course of the discussion the whole matter would have been dealt with much less emotionally. Before the debate adjourned I was pointing out that Fianna Fáil introduced the pay-related benefits scheme in 1973.  I considered it necessary to <Col N="1903" /> reiterate that fact because of the efforts of the Coalition during the past couple of years to take credit for the Act.  When Fianna Fáil introduced the Bill they had in mind a particular problem.  It was obvious that the more a man earned the greater were his commitments and that, therefore, when he was unemployed, he found himself in an impossible situation. His commitments would probably include repayments on his house, hire purchase repayments and so on and if the unemployment continued for a prolonged period, such a person would be totally impoverished.  In those circumstances we decided that if a worker were willing to pay a contribution into a special pay-related fund, he would have the benefit of higher income in the event of unemployment or disability.</P>
      <P>This was a progressive step forward in the development of our social welfare code and was recognised as such. It removed some of the anxiety experienced by the breadwinner and his family regarding unemployment. In introducing the scheme Fianna Fáil were concerned with easing the position of those who were unfortunate enough to become ill or unemployed, but it was never intended to become a substitute for the provision of employment or for the preservation of employment, as appears to be the situation now.  The Government seem to be much more concerned with tiding people over for a period of time rather than with creating employment and protecting the jobs of those whose employment is in serious danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should remember that, when the pay-related Bill was originally introduced in 1972, the economy was in an exceptionally good condition due to careful and well-thought out financial policies by the Fianna Fáil Government.  There was quite considerable growth in the economy with a resultant increase in employment. Inflation was at a relatively low rate and the outlook was particularly bright.  Nobody could possibly have visualised at that time that any Government, even a Coalition Government&mdash;and we have come to the stage <Col N="1904" /> when we do not expect very much from Coalition Governments&mdash;could bring an economy which was thriving to its knees in such a short space of time.  Nobody could then visualise an inflation rate of 25 per cent, putting us almost at the top of the inflation league in the OECD countries.  This inflation is destroying our competitiveness on world markets and throwing more and more unfortunate workers onto the unemployment register week after week, and the Government are taking absolutely no steps to rectify the position or try to control inflation. Quite clearly they are unable to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>The Government claim to have a social conscience, but we should remember that a social conscience means more than simply a desire to help those who need to be helped over a difficult period.  It also means ensuring that our people will be provided with employment.  If a worker is unemployed or ill he must be properly protected, and the making available of pay-related benefit for whatever period helps to do this.  This is not the only thing to which the worker is entitled.  He is entitled to work.  He wants security in his job.  That is what he is being denied by the Government. While this Bill is very necessary in the circumstances, because of a complete lack of government policy on employment, it will not satisfy the father of a family, for example, who is now sitting at home unemployed and fearful of the future.  Nor can it satisfy the person who has a job and is fearful that that job may fold up within a few days.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the workers were duped for a considerable time by the Government propaganda machine.  Not very many months ago when the threat of a three-day week or of a few weeks on unemployment was foreshadowed, many workers were not particularly perturbed because they felt they could ride out a short period on the benefits provided. They felt that no Government could possibly permit the position to deteriorate further and that it was only a matter of time until they would have their jobs back.  They were told in <Col N="1905" /> speech after speech towards the end of 1974 that an upturn was expected in the economy in the following couple of months.  As time passed and that upturn did not appear, Government speakers further extended the time at which the upturn was likely to take place.  It has not taken place yet, and more and more people are joining the unemployment queues.</P>
    <P>We were told for quite a considerable time that the inflationary spiral and the general malaise of the economy were due to factors outside the control of the Government.  The Government relied for quite a considerable time on the oil crisis.  By referring to the oil crisis they tried to cover up their failure to take appropriate action.  When protests were made against some of the insane financial policies of the Government, the immediate reaction was to inquire if we wanted to create more unemployment. The simple answer was that we recognised that the lack of policy on the part of the Government would, as sure as night follows day, create the shocking unemployment problem with which we are faced and do nothing at all to provide a solid base on which future prosperity could be built.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted now by everybody, including the Central Bank, that control of inflation lies in the hands of the Government.  It is equally evident that the Government are unable or unwilling to take the political decisions which are essential if the economy is to be saved and if we are to halt and reverse the shocking trend in unemployment.  This Government were elected on a promise to halt redundancies at a time when redundancies were few and far between. It is ironic that this Government are now presiding over the chronic deterioration in the employment figures.  They are forced to bring in this measure to try to cope with a situation which should never have arisen.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there are quite a number of people who must now rely on social welfare benefits.  Quite recently, 170 people, the vast majority of them men, lost their employment <Col N="1906" /> in the Castleguard Textile Factory in Ardee.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary does not believe that extending pay-related benefits is any substitute for the jobs lost in that factory.  I can assure him that it is not pay-related benefits the workers want but employment. Not only did they lose their employment but the very jobs they had are gone.</P>
    <P>Does he think that the boot and shoe operatives will accept these proposals as a substitute for jobs?  The Government have been aware for quite a long time&mdash;because this matter was raised time and time again in this House by me and other members of this party&mdash;that the employment of the footwear workers and the textile and clothing workers was being seriously jeopardised by enormous imports from low-cost countries such as Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Comicon countries.  We gave chapter and verse about the position through speeches and questions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce but to no avail.  The situation in these industries continues to deteriorate and more and more workers are becoming redundant or going on short time.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter because I have particular knowledge of it by reason of the fact that very large numbers of workers in my constituency are working in these industries.  We failed to move the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who appeared to be more concerned with rules and regulations than with employment.  When pressed on this matter again and again he spoke of the serious economic consequences of breaking the rules.  What of the serious consequences of keeping them when other countries have no compunction in breaking them when their interests are threatened? Had the Minister understood the position, as one would expect that he would, and had he taken the advice we gave him, there would have been less need for this measure.</P>
    <P>A similar problem has arisen in the building industry.  In the case of building workers 6,000 more will receive pay-related benefit than would have been the case had this measure been before the House last year because <Col N="1907" /> there are 6,000 more building workers unemployed.  Had the Minister for Local Government acted on our advice those workers would not be on the unemployed register.  The number unemployed in building continues to grow and the problem has spread to ancillary industries.  I know of a firm where building materials are manufactured who had to make 90 men redundant and I believe a further 90 will be made redundant shortly.  If the Government concern themselves more with the employment situation it would be better for everybody.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Bill is there any provision to help those who will be leaving school this year?  The prospects of employment for these young people were never as bleak in our history.  I understand that it is not the intention of the Civil Service to take any additional staff and that the number of replacements will be fewer than ever.  I also understand that the semi-State bodies have issued instructions that no additional staff are to be taken on.  We also face a difficult situation in relation to those who will complete their third level education. For example, last year 1,700 students obtained the H.Dip. in Ed. but there <Col N="1908" /> were only 600 jobs available for them. I presume the position will be worse this year.</P>
    <P>With industry in such serious straits what will happen to the students who complete their course at the regional technical colleges?  The situation is frightening.  I accept the need for this measure, but the circumstances which have led to its introduction should never have come about.  I also believe that we should have other measures introduced in conjunction with this Bill to improve the employment situation, secure existing jobs and curb inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to discuss this Bill without referring to social welfare in its broader sense.  I welcome the Bill and I consider it necessary. It is unfortunate that the Parliamentary Secretary has been compelled because of circumstances to extend the limit for payment of pay-related benefits from six months to nine months.  He has told us the extension of the existing scheme is a reflection of the Government's satisfaction with its general effectiveness. I have no doubt that the scheme has been effective but I doubt if that is the real reason for extending it.  It is an effort to placate the workers because we know they are in dire straits at the moment.  At this time of the year normally the number on the live register is reduced but that has not happened this year.  The introduction of this Bill is an easy way out for the Government but instead of introducing Bills of this kind they should be occupied in providing employment. We know the vast majority of people have no wish to join the dole queues.  Most of them want employment so that they may provide themselves and their families with a decent standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pay-related benefit scheme has proved of great help to families where the breadwinner is unemployed or falls ill.  It is essential that these people have something other than the ordinary unemployment assistance. Since the foundation of Fianna Fáil, our party have tried to develop a comprehensive social welfare system and <Col N="1909" /> every social welfare scheme in operation has been introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government.  In fact, we were the first in these islands to introduce children's allowances and this achievement was a tremendous break-through.</P>
    <P>We know that workers have many financial commitments when they are unemployed and unless they get assistance other than the ordinary benefits they will not be able to provide adequately for the needs of their families. Many families enter into hire purchase agreements when they have what they consider to be secure employment. They have to buy and furnish their homes and many are obliged to buy cars.  It is frightening for those people when they find out that suddenly their jobs are gone and they have to depend on this kind of benefit.</P>
    <P>I consider that the 40 per cent level mentioned in the Bill could be much higher.  I realise that workers have to pay deductions for social insurance and income tax when they are in employment but I consider the level mentioned in the Bill too low.  It would be preferable if it were 65 per cent and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider if this might be done.  The Exchequer is not paying for these benefits; it is the contributions of the employer and the employee that are involved.</P>
    <P>I understand agricultural workers are not included and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this matter.  These workers are the lowest paid.  They are engaged in our most important industry and there is no reason to exclude them from this scheme.  There are 35,000 to 38,000 such workers throughout the country. Domestic employees are not included either and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see if they might be included.  The lower paid workers have to pay the same contribution as those earning higher wages.  A case could be made for excluding those people from paying into the fund; it would save them approximately £1 per week.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that so many people are depending on this pay-related scheme for help.  The blame must be <Col N="1910" /> laid at the door of the Government because they are responsible in many ways for our present economic situation. When they took office two years ago the country was in a sound condition. Employment was much lower and they were left approximately £30 million because of our accession into the EEC.  This money was there to provide for improvements in social welfare benefits and to create the right climate for employment.  Unfortunately, the reverse seems to be the case because industries are closing daily and the number of unemployed is growing.  The Government do not seem able to come to terms with the problems facing them.  Perhaps their budgetary policy can be blamed to a great extent for our present problems because the Government budgeted for a huge deficit in the last two budgets. I have no doubt that this has added to the inflationary trend evident for a few years past.  The increases granted by the Government to CIE and the ESB as well as the postal charges have added to our inflationary problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I respect the ruling of the Chair but it is difficult to discuss the Bill without referring to other aspects of social welfare and the real cause for the introduction of this Bill. The Government must accept responsibility for the present disastrous position. They are merely putting off the evil day and, perhaps, the situation will be even worse in three months' time.  Will the Government then come back to the House and ask for a further extension?  This is not the way to tackle the problem.  They must get to grips with the unemployment situation.  They must create the right climate for enticing industrialists to come to this country to set up industries; they must create more jobs and, above all, take the people at present on the unemployment lists off them because the vast majority have no wish to be in the dole queues.  They want to get work and that is what the Government should be concerned <Col N="1911" /> about&mdash;providing such employment for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very important when one reads it in depth. It is the Government's answer to the unemployment problem.  It is the only indication we have that there will be any income for the 103,000 people at present in the dole queues.  If that is the only answer that can be provided, then the Government should relinquish office immediately.</P>
      <P>Having examined the Bill in depth one comes to the conclusion that it is the thin edge of the wedge in relation to social welfare schemes as a whole.  If I might quote briefly from what the Parliamentary Secretary had to say, on page three, of his brief, as follows:</P>
      <P>As I have indicated earlier, the weekly rate of pay-related benefit payable at present is 40 per cent of the part of a claimant's reckonable weekly earnings which lies between £14 and the upper limit of £50.  The rate which will be payable in respect of the proposed additional period of 78 days will be 30 per cent of reckonable earnings between £14 and £50.</P>
      <P>That is the most important aspect of the Bill because it indicates clearly Government thinking in relation to social welfare benefits, that, in the future, they will begin to taper off rather than increase.  The Government agreed to fixing the amount at 40 per cent in the first instance.  Then they come along later, when costs are increasing, particularly to the unemployed, many of whom are existing at survival level only, and reduce the level.  They tell us they will extend the period but the benefit will be of a lesser percentage, this at a time when, as Deputy Hussey rightly pointed out, one would have expected the Government to increase the amount to meet the vicious increases taking place daily.  We have here a reduction of 10 per cent of the reckonable earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a norm that will be applied to other social welfare benefits in the future.  It may well affect the widow, the orphan, apart from the unemployed; <Col N="1912" /> the old age pensioner and indeed people right across the board. Now there is this socialist thinking in relation to stimulation of the purchasing power of individuals.  As Deputy Hussey rightly pointed out the workers are receiving only their own money.  The scheme is well funded and we would have expected an increase in any Bill being brought before the House to meet the upward spiral in the cost of living continuing daily.  Instead of that there is an extension of the period of benefit at a reduced rate.  The Government intend to convey they are assisting recipients whereas, in fact, they are creating a precedent for a reduction in social welfare benefits in the future. That is a very serious aspect worthy of comprehensive consideration.  Why the necessity to reduce?  Had the period and the percentage benefit been extended equally&mdash;the 40 per cent to apply across the board&mdash;then we might admit it was an effort.  But this is an effort to establish a precedent under which other social welfare benefits can be diminished in a similar fashion.</P>
    <P>I would hope the Government would reconsider the situation on the lines suggested by Deputy Hussey, by granting an increase in benefit to meet the upward spiral in the cost of living. We know that any reduction of standard or weakening of the purchasing power can further aggravate an already serious situation.  There have been demands made recently for the Government to take some positive measures to relieve the unemployment situation.  Only yesterday in the House the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach indicated that he, and in fact the Government, were not aware of the total number of unemployed. How then can they formulate any scheme in the future to eliminate such a problem?  How can one set about correcting a situation if one is unaware of the very base of such problem, which is the total number of people unemployed?</P>
    <P>At approximately 11 o'clock last night the Parliamentary Secretary came into the House again to give us additional information he could not furnish <Col N="1913" /> at Question Time yesterday, having consulted statistics other than those of the Central Statistics Office, the live register.  He had consulted the census of 1971, which is somewhat out of date.  He furnished us with some figures from that which had the effect of increasing further the number of people unemployed and formed a basis on which we could make calculations in regard to the Questions asked here yesterday by Deputy Fitzgerald.  Present Government policy in relation to unemployed persons is not sufficient; we want something more.  It is necessary that such people receive benefits rendering them capable of paying for the essentials of life.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the result of forward thinking and of constructive thought, like other Bills of aid to workers that have been passed in this House&mdash;the Redundancy Bill, the Wet Time Bill, the Pay-Related Benefit Bill and indeed hosts of others.  And some Ministers tell us this was the brainchild of the Government.  This was a Bill which was prepared, presented and put through this House by the then Minister, Deputy Brennan.  This weakening of the social welfare code by a reduction in the reckonable earnings is the thin edge of the wedge.  When we go round our constituencies it is very sad to see the broken homes as a result of the unemployment situation which has developed over the past 12 months. The Government have certainly wrecked the country in their short two years in office, notwithstanding the fact that they had substantial millions coming to their assistance from agricultural subsidies.  Indeed the nation was buoyant when Fianna Fáil left office.  What do we discover today?  A bankrupt nation, a nation put in pawn by the Government.  Now there has been an attack on the social welfare code by this scaling down which is a precedent which will be quoted in the future when other services are attacked.</P>
    <P>We want to know what will happen people who are on pay-related benefits in 78 days' time?  What will happen the 103,000 in 78 days' time?  At present the live register indicated <Col N="1914" /> 103,000 but the factual figure could possibly be somewhere in the region of 150,000 or 160,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach gave us some additional information at an hour approaching midnight last night.  He was unable to give us that information earlier yesterday. He admitted freely that the Government were not in possession of the facts.  As a result of supplementary questions yesterday and subsequently raising the matter on the adjournment the Government are now aware that there is a very serious unemployment situation, more serious than they apparently first thought, as a result of the Parliamentary Secretary doing some extra work.  As a result of that work we are now able to estimate more closely the total number of unemployed.</P>
    <P>The outlook is very dim indeed.  It would have been different had the Government come in and said there would be job prospects in 78 days' time for those who are unemployed.  This deteriorating situation has continued over the past two years.  One wonders what will happen if the Government remain in office for the full five-year period.  Probably the 200,000 mark will be reached before the end of this year, because we now know from Ministerial speeches that both CIE and the ESB are contemplating cutting down on staff.  The Minister for transport and Power referred to that many times in the course of his speech.  He said there was a desire on the part of people in this House to reduce the staff of CIE. These are the lines along which the Government are thinking at the moment.</P>
    <P>What will happen at the end of the 78 days?  When this legislation was first introduced it was thought the period set would have been adequate to meet any situation.  Now it is found to be inadequate and we have 103,000 people who will be in the dole queue for quite a considerable time.  There is too, the precedent for a 10 per cent reduction in future in social welfare benefit.  Who next will be attacked? Will it be the widow, the orphan, the old age pensioner?  Who will it be? Will it be the people for whom the <Col N="1915" /> Government have failed to provide employment?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance gave no indication in a speech recently that there would be an end to this serious situation.  We have once more the same kind of mentality that we had in this House on another occasion in the past.  The Government have no policy, and a Minister in the past stated that it was not the job of the Government to provide work.  The same basic approach is still there.  The same thinking permeates the Government. At Question Time some time ago the Minister for Finance said the Government had no plans and did not intend to formulate any plans until they saw the pattern throughout the world; then they would evolve a plan to solve the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>As a result of some investigations I have made the increase in ESB charges and CIE fares will amount to something in the region of £3.20 for a family in which the husband and two of the children are working.  That is what these people have to face.  In my constituency and in other constituencies there are broken homes and family life has been wrecked because of the irresponsible attitude of the Government in not correctly assessing the situation.  Parents feel there is no hope for their children.  A great many people have been blamed for the situation. The Belgians were blamed.  The French were blamed, the Germans were blamed, the Italians were blamed and the Russians were blamed.  We got a regular lesson in geography from Ministers; the position was bad in Belgium, in Germany and everywhere else.  We did not elect the Governments of these countries.  We elected an Irish Government and it is their job to ensure that people have some hope for the future and that the size of the dole queues will be reduced. Social welfare is no substitute for employment, desirable and necessary though it may be.</P>
    <P>I repudiate once again the statement that this scheme is the Government's scheme.  It was we who introduced social welfare.  This 10 per cent reduction <Col N="1916" /> is the thin end of the wedge.  I can see it extending in due process of time right across the board.  Is this period of 78 days a period during which the Government want to assess the situation in order to evolve some kind of programme?  I hope there will be some indication as to the future of these people.  The only answer so far to the 103,000 unemployed is the extension of the period to 78 days.  Is this the complete answer?  We have heard no other.</P>
    <P>The people want to know what the Government propose to do about the future.  What are they going to do about their children's future?  Is there any future for Irish men and women to bring up their children at home? Will there be job opportunities for them?  Every day we meet distressed families in the interview room of this House.  We see how family life has been wrecked as a result of unemployment over long periods.  We meet the distressed husbands and wives who are concerned about their future and about meeting the commitments they entered into on the basis that we would have what was promised by various Governments.</P>
    <P>The change of Government has brought about a very serious situation for many people with commitments. The Government must bear the responsibility for the broken homes.  We expected a Bill to compensate for the upward spiral in the cost of living but instead we get an extension at a reduced rate.  The money is available. Why should the workers not get what is their own?  Has the till been tampered with?  This appears to be the attitude of the Government in relation to the finances under their control. They have tampered with the till along the line.  The regional fund is now to be attacked.</P>
    <P>There has been too much covering up in relation to the unemployment situation over the last 12 months and during the last few days.  I was grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach for going to the trouble of finding out the exact position.  He indicated at 3 o'clock yesterday that the Government were not aware of <Col N="1917" /> the full magnitude of the unemployment problem, but I am glad to say that at 11 o'clock last night the Government had realised it is a much bigger problem than the 103,000 that appears as digits on a sheet of paper that comes from the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Desmond spoke recently on behalf of the Government he said that the situation was not as serious as the information supplied by the Central Statistics Office indicated, that the live register was a farce and gave an erroneous impression of the number of people unemployed. The Parliamentary Secretary, after digging into the 1971 census, discovered that a substantial number of other people were unemployed.  I hope he has conveyed this to the Government, who seem to have been covering up.  If they know and they will not convey the truth to us they should be ashamed of themselves, and if they do not know they should also be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner stressed the terrible situation facing those leaving school this year and in the coming years and also those who left school last year, who are unable to obtain employment.  We were told by the Parliamentary Secretary last night that approximately 11,000 would be available for employment in addition to those on the live register.  If we add that to the 103,000 on the live register it means that 114,000 are unemployed. There are also other people unemployed, such as professional people, outworkers and people who have become redundant and are being retrained by AnCO.  The school-leavers have a very bleak future to look forward to.  We have had no indication from the Government that they are preparing a plan to meet this terrible situation.</P>
    <P>When the Government were in Opposition they spoke about public works in times of crisis, works which could be undertaken the moment there was a decline in prosperity.  We had employment schemes in this city which relieved the situation from time to time.  The special works department <Col N="1918" /> of Dublin Corporation had a scheme which could benefit the community as a whole, not just the type of relief scheme we have seen from time to time, one person digging a hole and another filling it up.  We have heard about every aspect of life in the country except what the Government propose to do in relation to the unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>Other countries have adopted temporary means to arrest the unemployment situation, where people have been put into productive employment during a crisis.  The Dublin Corporation works scheme gave valuable employment to people who were on the labour market for a long period.  They were brought back into benefit again. The product of their labours is to be seen in the many parks, playgrounds and the many schemes which Dublin Corporation embarked on.  Something like this should be done on a national basis to give some hope to the many people who are at present unemployed.</P>
    <P>The indications are that the labour market will swell from week to week. We expect there would be a substantial reduction in the number of people unemployed but we find the figure increasing.  What do the Government intend doing about this? Last week they brought the captains of industry together.  Did they give them the whole picture?  Now that they know the full picture they can add an addendum to the literature about to be circulated to this sector.</P>
    <P>The people of the country prefer to work rather than obtain social welfare benefits.  We heard Deputies from the other side speaking about abuses. There may be abuses but, nevertheless, the Government have a responsibility to ensure that the people who have been productive over a number of years get, in their hour of need, the aids that are necessary to avoid disruption of their family life.  There are 78 days to go.  The count down is starting.  As the days pass, tension increases in the lives of husbands and their wives and families.  We wonder what will happen after the 78-day period.  Is there to be an election within the two months.  Is this addition of 78 days an effort to extricate <Col N="1919" /> the Government from serious difficulty? Is it an effort to paint a different picture?  The unemployed will answer that in due course, the people who were conned into believing that the survival of this nation would be best left to this Government.  The efforts of this Coalition Government are not different from the efforts of previous Coalitions.  The nation was deserted in the middle of the night by a Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The temperature at the moment is 103&mdash;dangerously high.  As the temperature increases, we are nearer to calamity.  Is there a desire on the part of the Government to correct the economic and financial situation by increasing unemployment?  One must assume that there is because they have given no indication of a policy that would reduce unemployment.  One must assume, taking the word of the Minister for Finance, that the Government are not in a position to formulate policy and will not formulate policy until such time as the position becomes clear.  The position is clear to many people that there is terrible tragedy facing the country.</P>
    <P>The school leavers this year and next year cannot look forward to any kind of employment.  There is a curtailment in the intake of personnel into almost every concern, every Government Department, every local authority.  There is a curtailment within the armed services which is threatening security.  There is a variety of curtailments for which we may be sorry in the future.  This vulnerable section, school leavers, will not appear on the live register as being unemployed.</P>
    <P>We know the manner in which the building trade has been mutilated and the number of operatives who are walking the streets.  One can get a carpenter, a plasterer or a plumber quite easily now.  That was not always the case.  The textile industry, the shoe industry, notwithstanding the guarantees that have been given, the motor car industry and other sections of industry are becoming vulnerable because of the reduction in the earning power of people.  We want to know <Col N="1920" /> what are the future prospects for those who will now get the benefit of the additional 78 days.  I hope there will be some answer forthcoming from the Government.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me that it is the Government's intention to ensure that unemployment will rise substantially higher than it is at the moment in order that the Government may correct their financial position.  This is a method that has been used in some countries&mdash;a very undesirable method &mdash;to bring about an end result.  This Government are pursuing that course and many thousands more will be unemployed before long.  The Government have not given any indication that they have a policy to create employment or that they are doing anything substantial to relieve the 103,000 persons who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that this Bill is the thin end of the wedge that will be used to reduce benefits in future.  We have here a departure from previous legislative practice in the reduction from 40 per cent to 30 per cent of reckonable earnings between £14 and £50.  This is done at a time whe we would have expected an increase in the rate to meet increased costs.  It is shabby treatment of people who are in need of assistance.  The Government are claiming this as something that they are giving the workers, whereas the workers have paid the money into a pool.  The reference to 30 per cent should be eliminated and a flat rate should apply across the board.  Forty per cent was the figure provided originally and that rate is being reduced to 30 per cent in respect of the additional 78 day period, notwithstanding the vicious increases that have taken place in the price of foodstuffs, bus fares, lighting, heating and all the other costs that parents have to bear.  One wonders what the situation will be in 12 months time.  There would appear to be no plans for the future.</P>
    <P>We hope that as a result of this debate those who are in need of benefits will get them and will get them at such a rate as will allow them to keep abreast of the increases in the cost of living that are taking place. Benefits that are given are almost <Col N="1921" /> eroded overnight.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the situation, to be realistic.  There are 78 days from the passing of this Bill.  Perhaps the Government desire that the House should recess before the 78 days expire. We will be back.  The 103,000 unemployed have nothing to look forward to but an additional 78 days at 30 per cent of their reckonable earnings.  It is an undesirable feature to insert in the Bill because it will be used as a precedent to tamper with other social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>There are other Deputies who wish to speak.  I have indicated what my views are.  I would ask the Government to give the additional period of 78 days and to indicate that there is some hope for the future for those who will receive these benefits and for their children.  They should give some hope to those who are pursuing educational courses that they can look forward to a future in this country, as would have been the case a year or two ago.</P>

      <P>I thought that this Bill would have been passed by the House within half an hour, that there would be such general support for it that members of the Opposition would say: &ldquo;Yes, we think it is a great idea and will not delay the passage of the Bill through the House&rdquo;.  I listened on the intercom before I came into the House and I have sat here for threequarters of an hour.  I have heard four or five set phrases repeated again and again. Those phrases were apparently handed out to certain people with instructions to keep repeating them.  We again have had an example of pull or push aboard, flying wildly in opposite direction. Deputy Dowling was the best example of that that I have seen for some time.  May I ask Fianna Fáil one straight question?  Are they in favour of the Bill or are they against it?  That is the issue.</P>

They brought in the Bill and they put a limitation on it.  They did not say that period plus 78 days, they said that period full stop.  Now they come along and complain that it is something that should not be done and should be done.  Deputy Meaney talked about people already getting too much, that there was no inducement to work.  He talked about people getting more than if they were working. He is not the only one.  Outside this House we have many Fianna Fáilers going around the country talking about the shocking thing the Government are doing, giving men so much money that they do not want to work.  A lot of damn nonsense.  Then they come into the House thumping their craws and saying that if they were here they would do a lot more. We, at least, are ensuring that if people, through no fault of their own, are unemployed they will have enough money to live.

We are giving an additional 78 days' benefit and Fianna Fáil say we are cutting back.  I was a little surprised when I first heard it, but I am not surprised now because it is a typical Fianna Fáil argument.  The plain facts are that if this Bill were not introduced and if the Bill which Fianna Fáil passed through this House and shelved went through as they <Col N="1924" /> wanted it there would be a full stop.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I may die of many things but grief is not one of them. Fianna Fáil have their proper position in Dáil Éireann, they appreciate it and they will stay there.  My reason for contributing to the debate is to refer to a couple of comments made by Deputy Dowling who referred ten times to the question of school leavers. I have not noticed any great concern up to now on the part of Fianna Fáil for school leavers.  They did not encourage AnCO to do much for people in this category.  However, I shall not cut across what the Parliamentary Secretary will be saying later so I shall conclude by expressing my surprise at the length of time the Opposition are spending on this Bill, a Bill which I should have thought would have gone through the House in 15 minutes. I do not think that Fianna Fáil would have the hard neck to try to prevent the Bill's passage.  One group in that party are saying that people are getting too much in benefit while another are saying not enough is being given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil must make up their minds as to whether they are for or against the Bill.  If they are for it, it should have been passed hours ago but if they are against it they should offer conclusive arguments which they can stand over and not continue the same rigmarole with <Col N="1926" /> one saying that the benefits are too great while another is saying they are not sufficient.  Deputy Dowling said that the Bill represents a reduction compared with what Fianna Fáil would do if they were on this side of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  We know what Fianna Fáil would give if they were on this side.  They introduced the legislation and imposed the limits in relation to it.  We are extending the period of payment.  If the Opposition do not agree, it is for them to vote accordingly but we know what the people want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Local Government has added any lustre to the Bill but he has convinced us that his prejudice where this party are concerned prevents him from making an objective contribution to it.  It is not my intention to recall the past.  What we did is obvious.  So long as there are people unemployed, there must be adequate means of supporting them and of ensuring that their dignity is upheld.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Minister I would remind him that we were returned to this House by the people just as he was and that we will claim our right to discuss any legislation going through the House, that we will not be rushed into passing any Bill in order to please the Government. Fianna Fáil introduced the first pay-related Bill but we did not put it into effect because there was a general election immediately afterwards and there was another Government in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to emphasise is that we do not oppose this legislation.  If Fianna Fáil were in power today, there would be no need to extend the period of payment of the benefit.  This need would not have arisen either had the Government kept their promises of full employment and so on.  However, there are now 103,000 people unemployed and we must realise that the State has a duty to marshall its resources so as to ensure an adequate <Col N="1927" /> income for those people.  We do not regard the type of benefit being discussed here as being any substitute for employment.  Every man has a right to a job.  It is very difficult to accept a 10 per cent rate of unemployment. I refute the suggestion by the Minister that this Bill should be passed in 15 minutes.  Of the 14 speakers today only two were from the other side of the House.  Had we allowed the Bill go through in 15 minutes we would be accused of not caring.  We cannot win according to the thinking of this Government. Unfortunately, they are the final arbiters but that privilege will be ours within a short time.</P>
    <P>However, we are not here to discuss the future.  It is our duty to remove some of the facade that has been put up in relation to the Bill, for instance, that the Bill is larger than the Government coffers, that they, out of the generosity of their hearts, have decided to extend the payments and that, consequently, the people should be grateful to them.  That would be all very well if it were not for the fact that these payments are coming from the fund that was built up by way of contributions from workers and employers.  I am no economist but I wonder how the fund has proved adequate to date in view of the ever-increasing demands on it. This achievement is a tribute to the wisdom of Fianna Fáil who, apart from World War II have never experienced an unemployment level of 103,000 during their terms of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was because the people had to emigrate in numbers of between 30,000 and 35,000 each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We can talk about emigration if the Parliamentary Secretary so wishes and we can prove that in that respect, too, the people opposite have excelled.  It is a tribute to Fianna Fáil that in framing the original legislation they were able to envisage the extent of the fund that would be needed.  It is evidence of their foresight that the funds have been adequate to meet the demands made on it, especially in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1928" /> If I suggest that in some way the funds may have to be increased, I may be accused by the Government of spreading gloom but in today's world one must be realistic if one is to help in getting us out of the morass in which we find ourselves. It may be said that we are no worse off than other countries but we must point out that we are a small country. Up to now we have not had any worthwhile mineral resources although the picture is promising in that regard.  The Government should come up with some kind of schemes which would ensure that we would not have to endure a 10 per cent rate of unemployment.  The future is not too rosy.  We may wait until such time as the world economy takes an upturn, and I hope it takes it very shortly.</P>
    <P>We cannot sit back and wait for this to happen.  Each nation must develop its own resources to the best of its abilities.  The Government have a duty to prepare and put into practice constructive economic policies. It is not good enough for them to say that other nations are also suffering. Of course they are, but no nation in Europe has the rate of unemployment we have.  One has the same rate of inflation as we have.  In fairness it can be said that inflation is created outside the State but the Taoiseach told us&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that we cannot hang a debate on the economy or unemployment on the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefits) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to finish, the Taoiseach said that a lot of the inflation was generated inside the State. Having made that statement, I wonder what the Taoiseach did about it. I am dealing with the smug attitude of the Government who by publicity and otherwise have tried to put it over that, but for such a generous Government being in power, the men and women who are so unfortunate as to have lost their employment would not be doing quite so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1929" /> As I pointed out earlier, the fund out of which this benefit is paid is made up of the contributions of the workers and the employers.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us when he is replying to what extent, if any, do the Central Fund bolster up this fund.</P>
    <P>Suppose this rise in unemployment continues&mdash;we hope it will not&mdash;and in three months' time the Government bring in an order extending this scheme further, will the fund be able to sustain the increased payments, or will the Government have to increase the contributions from a lesser number of employees and a lesser number of employers?  Unless there is some fresh thinking and some constructive thinking, the Government may well find that the law of diminishing returns will start to operate.  They may find that they have put too much of a burden on the fund as it is presently constituted.</P>
    <P>They should direct their thoughts towards the possibility of further enlarging the facilities of AnCO so that men and women will be given expert training or retraining because, unforfunately, they must face the fact that many of their jobs which are gone will not be restored.  We have to think ahead and see what we can do about retraining people so that they will not have to remain in idleness for many years but will be able to come back into gainful employment.</P>
    <P>If the Government were to say to the employers and the unions: &ldquo;We have a tough task to face. We want co-operation from all sides to do something about it&rdquo;, they would get a response.  The Government held a meeting like this some time ago but we have seen no reports from it.  We can only hope that they discussed an approach like this instead of saying they will pay out money from the fund for as long as it lasts.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that this benefit is not available because of the Government's generosity.  It is available because the Fianna Fáil Government in their wisdom enacted the earlier legislation and so constructed the <Col N="1930" /> fund that it could stand the strain even of a Coalition Government.  This Government will have to change their attitude.  They are relying heavily on Fianna Fáil legislation for this Bill. I do not say there is anything wrong with that.  When Fianna Fáil drafted their Bill they thought it would have to be used in exceptional circumstances only and never to the limit to which it is being used now.  They so framed it that the fund has been able to stand up to the frightful calls upon it at the moment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary has some plan under which social welfare payments will come to be regarded as temporary measures. For example, in the case of sickness benefit we all hope that such a payment would be temporary because the person will get better and will not need it.  Unless the Government study their own legislation the demands on this fund will go on increasing until such time as they will have to adopt new measures.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government asked us were we for or against the Bill.  He implied that because we had spent many hours discussing it we were against it.  That is a new concept of parliamentary discussion.  It is the duty of the Opposition to criticise Government legislation.  Our speakers did not just criticise.  They suggested how improvements could be made. They asked the Parliamentary Secretary when he was replying to try to clear up some doubts we have about the Bill.  Could anything be fairer than that?  We insist that we will examine every line of every Bill which comes before us.  In that way we will justify ourselves during our temporary stay on this side of the House. When we move to the Government side of the House &mdash;I am sure we will very shortly&mdash;we will understand much better what the people want.  We will bring in the new charter on social welfare and regard it as being a temporary measure while we provide full employment. This is where the Government are falling down.  The Government boast of their generosity in social welfare payments and they feel that as <Col N="1931" /> long as they pay out social welfare benefits they are doing well.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - CIE Fares and ESB Charges: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Barrett on Tuesday, 13th May, 1975:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the further huge increases in CIE fares and ESB charges sanctioned by the Government, and calls on the Government to take immediate steps to counteract the hardship and damage to the economy caused thereby.</P>
    <P>To this the following amendment was moved by the Minister for Transport and Power:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;recognises the role of the National Prices Commission; and recognises that if the Government were to refuse to sanction increases in CIE fares and ESB charges the result would be either subsidisation by the taxpayer or lowering of services and unemployment in these bodies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To the above amendment the following amendment was moved by Deputy O'Connell:</P>
    <P>To add the words</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and, further, recommends that consideration should now be given to the question of setting up a parliamentary committee to monitor the affairs of CIE and the ESB to ensure full public accountability.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the motion and amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I referred to the fact that it was made clear in the February report of the National Prices Commission relating to CIE that the 16th round wage increase was not taken into account in computing the increases for CIE although the ESB included it in their application.  The 16th round is the <Col N="1932" /> highest wage increase ever given in the history of the State and it is conservatively estimated that over a period of 12 months it will work out at 25 per cent.  Without that CIE still achieve an increase of 33? per cent. The Minister for Transport and Power informed the House that the proportion of CIE's costs which goes in wages is 66 per cent and on the basis that the increase will be 25 per cent it means an increase across the board of 16? per cent in costs for wages alone for that company.</P>
      <P>To this must be added the higher cost CIE will incur for electricity, vehicles and replacement of locomotives and the inevitable decline in business which must arise as a result of these savage increases.  Those increases will put those who have any option about travelling by CIE off travelling by that system.  They will find some other method of travelling. Adding a couple of percentage points to the 16? per cent one can conservatively estimate that, in addition to the increase already approved, about the middle of the coming wages year &mdash;about the end of October&mdash;there will be a further increase across the board in CIE rates, charges and fares of 18 or 19 per cent.  With the way inflation is going it may make 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>The ESB have given notice that they will be applying for a further increase from 1st September.  We have no way of estimating, from the information they gave the National Prices Commission, what that increase will be.  The Minister for Transport and Power tried to side step the problem posed by this motion.  He announced the setting up of a parliamentary committee to look into the affairs of semi-State bodies, not just CIE and the ESB but the 30 or so other bodies for whom that Minister is responsible.  In its own way this is a commendable move from the point of view of trying to get some accountability from semi-State bodies which, in many instances, have grown rather arrogant in their approach in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm that there will be some kind of public accountability but <Col N="1933" /> it will be public accountability for certain types of expenditure long after it is expended.  That may be of some value but it is of no value at all in so far as the problems our people are facing, the vicious increases that have taken place and the prospect, in the case of CIE, of another 18 or 20 per cent before the end of the year, are concerned.</P>
    <P>Setting up a committee of this House, on much the same basis as the Committee of Public Accounts which looks into the expenditure incurred by Departments, can do nothing to reduce the increases imposed on the people now or the increases that will be imposed before the end of the year by CIE and the ESB.  From the Minister's point of view it has the beneficial effect of diverting attention. In some way it gets the Government out of the firing line and spreads the load.  When there is an all-party committee questioning, for instance, the chairman of CIE or the chief executive of the ESB, in some vague way in the public mind the responsibility of the Government in relation to those bodies will become a little clouded.  It will be looked on in a vague way by the public that Dáil Éireann is the overlord of these semi-State bodies.  Dáil Éireann or the committee of it dealing with these matters will have no say about policy; expenditure will be looked into in the same way as the Committee of Public Accounts looks into the expenditure of Departments.  Of course that committee has no control whatever over departmental policy.  They can only look back on departmental expenditure, one, two or three years after it has taken place.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the Minister for Transport and Power never mentioned a word about the hardship being inflicted by these increases, particularly on the poorer members of our community who have to have daily resort to CIE.  For a worker, his wife or any member of his family to travel from a Limerick corporation housing estate, Southill, which is a mile and three-quarters from the city, by CIE will now cost 12p or 2s. 5d. in old money.  How are the less well off <Col N="1934" /> people supposed to be able to put up with that?  They now have to pay 12p for less than two miles.  In Dublin some of the top rates are now 24p, almost 5s. in old money, for an internal bus ride in the city.  A couple of years ago one could have got a taxi for that amount.  We did not hear a word of concern from the Minister for those people even though our motion called on the Government to take steps to counteract the hardship and damage to the economy caused by the increases.</P>
    <P>We did not hear a word from the Minister about the damage to the economy which is self-evident.  The Government arranged a strange amendment to an amendment on the part of Deputy O'Connell in order to give them the opportunity of making this announcement and so that attention would be diverted from the actual increases that are the subject of this debate.  The establishment of the committee is something we support but it has nothing to do with the problem of people who are now spending 3s. or 4s. on each bus journey they undertake between their home and place of business.  Is it any wonder that the workers look for huge increases in wages when this is being inflicted on them by the Government?  The Government, in their amendment, try to argue that they have no option but to sanction whatever increases are sought on the grounds that to refuse to do so would result either in subsidisation or lowering of service.  I gave four examples of where the Government did not accept the recommendations. In some cases they gave greater increases than recommended and in other cases they gave less.</P>
    <P>Surely those factors if valid then are valid now.  The Government are contradictory in this matter.  If they slavishly have to grant every increase now why did they not give them on previous occasions?  Surely the same principles apply.  I should like to refer to <i>The Irish Independent</i> of Saturday, 3rd May and to an article by the Business Editor, Mr. Colm Rapple, in which he points out that the increases in CIE fares and freight rates will add £70 million to industries <Col N="1935" /> wages bill.  An economist calculated that the increases in the ESB granted by the Government will add £20 million.  That is £90 million extra in wages in one year because of this. Do the Government realise the serious consequence of what they are doing?  Mr. Rapple pointed out:</P>
    <P>The postponement for a week of the fare increases highlights a Government ineptness in even recognising the problem.  If they were put off for two days further their impact would be transferred into the May-August index rise.</P>
    <P>The charges were announced last Monday.  Had they been announced tomorrow one-quarter of that £90 million would have been saved in inflation. That saving would have been effected if the Government had their eyes open.  I realise my time is up but there is a great deal more I should like to say about this matter and I hope that I will have an opportunity to do so on a future occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The bald fact is that the costs of CIE and the ESB have increased very significantly since the last increases were granted to them.  The Government had to face that situation and they had to decide what to do in the circumstances.  Perhaps I could illustrate the extent of the increased costs by referring to the ESB.  Since the last price increase was granted to them, their payroll costs increased by 40 per cent.  The costs of materials and other expenses increased by 24 per cent while interest and loan amortization costs increased by 20 per cent. Those three elements of cost amount to £16 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government had three options which they could follow.  First, they could refuse the price increase and also refuse to grant an extra subsidy. In the case of CIE this would have led to very substantial redundancies.  It has been estimated about 4,000 employees would have had to be laid off, with substantial cuts in services, in order to effect the kind of saving that would be necessary if CIE were to <Col N="1936" /> break even and yet not increase their fares.</P>
    <P>The second option was to refuse the price increases and grant an extra subsidy to make up the difference.  On an annual basis that would have meant giving an extra subsidy of £11 million to CIE and an extra subsidy of £16 million to the ESB, a total extra subsidy on an annual basis of £27 million, in order to keep prices and fares at their present level.  That extra £27 million would have had to be raised by the taxpayers and it has been estimated that it would involve an increase in the basic rate of income tax of almost 3p in the £ to maintain the situation in the face of the increases in cost that have taken place.</P>
    <P>I do not believe either of those two options were acceptable.  The option chosen by the Government was a courageous one, and in reality, it was the only one that could be taken.  They decided to allow increases in prices for the ESB and increases in fares for CIE.  There is an important economic merit in this choice in so far as it involves the consumer paying something approximating to the real cost of his electricity supply and the real cost of his bus ride.  This means a rational choice can be made in relation to a decision to use electricity to a greater or a lesser extent or to use a bus service to a greater or a lesser extent. Subsidisation can lead to distortion in consumption and, in the long run, it can be bad economically for the country.</P>
    <P>The option put forward on behalf of the Opposition by Deputy Barrett was expressed as clearly as one could get any option expressed from the Opposition benches.  When he was concluding his speech he said there should be a full inquiry regarding the cause of these massive increases instead of just a report from the National Prices Commission.  He said the increases should be suspended until such an inquiry was completed. Most of us here accept that the inquiries carried out by the National Prices Commission have been extremely exhaustive and we do not accept his case for a further inquiry. However, I should like to take the <Col N="1937" /> opportunity of telling him the cost of adopting his suggestion.  If we were to suspend the increases until such an inquiry took place, it has been estimated the cost of postponing the ESB increase would be £308,000 per week while the cost of postponing the CIE increase would be £250,000 per week.  That money would have to be found by the bodies concerned or by the Exchequer, all in order to get a further inquiry that would tell us something we know already from reading the NPC reports.  I do not think the option put forward by the Opposition was a viable one.  In fact, I consider it the worst of the four options.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy O'Malley seemed to suggest that the NPC did not have a very important role to play in scrutinising the increases in prices of goods or services produced by semi-State bodies.  I do not consider this to be the case.  In reading through the NPC reports on semi-State bodies in the last few months, I have noted a degree of rigour in the scrutiny with which they examined the bodies to an extent that even surprised me.  It is obviously beneficial that there is a body such as the NPC who will keep an eye on semi-State bodies, who have the power to hire consultants to examine their work and to produce independent criticism, whether of CIE or ESB policies or of the policies of any semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>The view of Deputy O'Malley that the NPC have not a role in relation to semi-State bodies was not correct. In fact, the Government's initiative in setting up a parliamentary committee to scrutinise these bodies complements the existing work of the NPC.  The commission will be producing detailed statistical analyses of various semi-State bodies in respect of their price increases and this will be of considerable benefit to the new committee. As a result of the work of the NPC and of the new committee, we will have a degree of scrutiny of semi-State bodies, from the point of view of price increases and of their general operations, which we did not have four or five years ago.  This is <Col N="1938" /> something of which all parties here can be proud.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the Government have accepted that there is an obvious need for improving the efficiency and productivity of the ESB. A recent comparison carried out by the NPC between the ESB and two Scottish electricity boards is not flattering to the ESB.  In fact, in view of the room for improvement shown in that report, the Government decided, on the recommendation of the NPC, that the further 3½ per cent increase necessary to recover the ESB accumulated deficit of £9 million over three years should not be granted.</P>
    <P>That decision, in itself, indicates the serious view the Government take of the statements made by the NPC in relation to that matter.  We all greatly regret the increase in electricity prices which have taken place but we must recognise they are taking place in other countries as well. In fact, even taking the present increases into account, electricity prices are still 7 per cent lower in Southern Ireland than they are in Northern Ireland; again I stress that that is taking the most recent increases into account.</P>
    <P>We must recognise also that CIE operates at a grave disadvantage in comparison with many public transport authorities in other countries. That is because in Ireland, for some reason, people have a preference for using their own cars rather than public transport.  Therefore, CIE does not have the volume of business to achieve economies on the scale which would have the effect of bringing down the price of transport as in other countries.  A survey published in table 9 of the NPC report demonstrates this very graphically, where it is shown that of a very large number of countries&mdash;Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, West Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, USA and Ireland&mdash;Ireland has the highest number of cars owned by individuals expressed as a percentage of its gross national product.  In other words, even though the Irishman may not be as well off as his <Col N="1939" /> counterpart in any of the other countries, he is more likely to spend money on buying his own car than is a citizen of any of the others mentioned.  If people here have money invested in cars, they are less likely to use CIE.  That means that CIE's operations will not be as economic as competing public transport bodies in other countries.  Those are the facts that must be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that we did not hear from the Opposition any real alternative to the decision the Government had to take in relation to the proposed increases for CIE and the ESB. Therefore, we can only conclude that the Opposition themselves tacitly admit that the Government took the right decision, but in fact they are going through the motions of criticising the Government in order to justify their existence.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice to that of others on this side of the House:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns the further huge increases in CIE fares and ESB charges sanctioned by the Government, and calls on the Government to take immediate steps to counteract the hardship and damage to the economy caused thereby.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett and Deputy O'Malley, in great depth and detail, have indicated to the Government, in no uncertain terms, the disgust of this party and suggested positive measures that should be taken.  They have dealt with the effect on the economy, and on the ordinary people of the country.</P>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Bruton tell us that the number of cars here was higher per head of population than in a number of other countries, I want to say that we have had that type of geography lesson from every Minister in relation to every aspect of national life.  Some country, or some group of countries, is always quoted; now it is motor cars; some time ago it was inflation, or unemployment; some country is quoted so that the Government can hang their hat on some peg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1940" /> Let us take a look at the situation as the increases affect the people of this country and indeed of this city. I shall take the average family living in my constituency, husband, wife and three or four children.  Let us investigate how they will be affected by the increases in ESB charges and bus fares.  I shall take the example of the average family living in, say, Ballyfermot.  The husband, if lucky enough to be working, commutes to the city daily and he will be charged now an additional 50p per week.  The increases in bus fares from Ballyfermot or Tallaght mean that the fares involved have risen from 15p to 20p.  If there are two members of that family lucky enough to be working they too will have to pay an additional 50p.  If there is a school-going child&mdash;allowing for the fact that that child may not be using free school transport&mdash;there is an additional 20p charge, together with the expense of the wife shopping twice weekly.  The total amount, taking into account also another member of the family who may be travelling to a hospital, dispensary, labour exchange or somewhere else, comes to £2.10.</P>
    <P>Then if we consider lighting and heating charges in respect of a centrally heated house, there is another weekly charge of £1.30.  This means that the average increase for the normal household in, say, Tallaght or Ballyfermot amounts to approximately £3.40 weekly which is a fairly substantial one.  But it does not end there. The price of foodstuffs is bound to rise because of the increase in freight rates which will be off-loaded by CIE onto producers, wholesalers, industrialists, which, in turn, means the necessities of life must increase.  As a result additional applications will be made to the National Prices Commission for sanction for increases on the basis of transportation and other costs having risen.  We can readily see the impact that both of these vicious increases will have on the ordinary family in the perimeter areas of the city.  I am merely taking as examples the areas around Dublin. There are other workers who have to commute a considerably greater distance <Col N="1941" /> to the centre of the city and whose costs will be increased so much more.  Indeed, the increase for people who will be commuting from the constituency of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the city centre will be far in excess of the amount quoted here.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that, with the housing situation in Tallaght and such places there is the necessity to utilise the services provided there. In a considerable portion of that area a lack of gas supply means there is no alternative source to that provided by the ESB.  Indeed, in other areas they are totally dependent on the ESB.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the farmers who utilise the services of CIE for the transportation of their farm produce from source to the market must offload the increased costs, as indeed must the other groups I have mentioned. Therefore, at a glance, one can see that there is developing a serious situation in relation to the upward spiral in living costs.  The Minister or members of the Government may try to indicate that the increases will not be as outlined by me.  I have checked out with a family in Ballyfermot as to what increases they will face as a result of the increases in bus fares. I have checked with a family in Tallaght and found out what the increased charges in electricity will cost them in a week.</P>
    <P>The situation is a serious one. When the Prices Commission meets again to consider further applications for increases I wonder how responsive the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be to these demands.  No doubt he will do the same again and permit the ESB to increase the price of electricity to the consumer and CIE to increase fares and freight rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his contribution to the debate talked about overstaffing in CIE and in the ESB.  Was there a suggestion that these workers should not get the increase in their wages freely negotiated with the trade union? There was a suggestion about sacking a proportion of the 10,000 or 11,000 <Col N="1942" /> workers in the ESB and a proportion of the 20,000 in CIE.  Will these workers be sacked?  Will they get the recommended wage increase?  There we have an indication of the lines along which the Minister is thinking. He has sown doubts in the minds of the workers in both the ESB and CIE. Many will fear redundancy.  This kind of parrot repetition by the Minister does nobody any good.  No one in Opposition has any desire to deprive any man of that to which he is justly entitled or to cut across any wage agreement.  No one in Opposition wants to see people become redundant or see people being laid off.  What we are concerned about is ensuring a future for those in employment.</P>
    <P>Was this a message, I wonder, to the boards of these bodies to curtail pay increases?  What does the Minister mean by the repetition about people being laid off and pay increases? We will insist that wage agreements are fully honoured. Deputy Barry has departed from the traditional line.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power has departed from the traditional line.  He says he saw the chairman of CIE last week and they are operating on a phased basis; they will reduce staff over a number of years, but not drastically. The already overcrowded employment exchanges will be more overcrowded still.  I hope CIE will become more efficient and more effective. The Minister told us he is not wholly satisfied with the efficiency of CIE.  I am quite certain that the workers who will be phased out could be utilised effectively and efficiently and thereby contribute to the national effort.  We have 10 to 20 per cent now uncertain of their future in the ESB.  The Minister says the National Prices Commission stated there was overstaffing to the extent of 20 per cent in the ESB and that is the message that has gone out to the workers from the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These increased fares will affect <Col N="1943" /> everybody.  They will affect the housewife commuting to the shops and her basket will be all the lighter.  They will affect the unemployed going to the unemployment exchanges.  They will affect the infirm visiting dispensaries and hospitals.  Will the Minister make free transport available for these people?  I would appeal to him to do so.  It is the weaker sections of the community who will be affected by these increased fares.  Is this what socialism is all about?  Is the burden to be placed on the weaker sections? Should we not take from the strong and give to the weak?</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to do something to reduce fares for people commuting to employment, for people visiting dispensaries and hospitals and for the unemployed.  They should be given special concessions to relieve the impact of the vicious increases that have been imposed.  If one questions any young man on the perimeter of the city about how the increased charges will affect him one finds that they will amount to a substantial amount every week.  He has to commute to work, his children have to go to school, his wife has to purchase the necessities of life and sometimes some of the children have to be taken to the dispensary.  Are people to switch off electricity if they have electric fires or central heating? Are they to remain cold during the winter?  Are they to remain hungry because of the reduction in the size of the bread basket?</P>
    <P>This is the dismal situation which faces many of the people in my constituency and also in the one the Minister will represent in the future. I have my doubts about him representing any constituency because as soon as the people get their hands on him they will make an example of him.  It is well known that the Minister is not a socialist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Minister for Industry and Commerce who sanctioned those increases although <Col N="1944" /> we were told it was the Government who sanctioned them.  I suppose it is fair to attack all the Ministers in this area of collective responsibility.  The people will be able to deal with them in a very effective way when they get the opportunity.  The sooner they get it the better so that we can get the nation out of the mess it is in.  I hope, while the Minister is still in office, that he will visit some of the Dublin constituencies, meet the housewives and discuss their difficulties with them so that he will have an idea of the impact of the increases he has granted.</P>
      <P>Were those increases forced by the right or the left of the Government ranks, the socialists or conservatives? They strike basically at the workers who are travelling to and from work. Perhaps it was, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, that we have so many cars in the country that the increase will not affect workers.  The bulk of the workers have no motorcars and commute to and from their places of employment by public transport. Rural workers have no other means of transport but CIE.  It is the few people who are still working who are carrying the burden of the increases but as time goes on fewer people will find work so fewer people will use public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This could be an effort by the Government to divert from CIE the industrialists who use their transport, render the service completely ineffective and give them the opportunity to abolish one of the company's services.  The substantial increase of 25 per cent in freight rates could be an effort by the Government to ensure that wholesalers, retailers, industrialists and the other people who use the freight service will turn away from that company and utilise some other service. This would give the Government the opportunity to close down the freight section.  If they want to close down the freight section or the road section of CIE they should tell us they intend to do so, why they are doing it and what the alternative is.  Those vicious increases are an effort to crack the CIE system.  If it is necessary to restructure the system, to have this watchdog committee, to have efficiency <Col N="1945" /> experts to perfect the system, then so much the better.  Let us have their reports and see how we can perfect the system if it has defects. An effort by the Government to destroy the system in an underhand manner is something which must be watched very carefully.</P>
    <P>We also have to consider the effect which the increased ESB charges will have on industry, which will find it difficult to be competitive in world markets.  It is likely there will have to be a cut down in staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This will create more unemployment.  If industry is utilising CIE at the moment they will not be as competitive in the international market in the future because of the increased charges.  The only way they can remain competitive is to cut back in some other area.  The most vulnerable area is that containing the few people who are still at work.  This is a very serious matter because the Government have given no indication that they have a policy to provide jobs for the thousands of people who are still unemployed.</P>
      <P>The increased CIE charges will have a bad effect on tourism.  The cost of bus tours will be substantially increased and prices in hotels will also increase so tourism is likely to be taxed out of the market.  People have endeavoured to survive during the past few years in the hotel business and the bus tour business but we can see the day approaching when they will have to close their doors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago, when the Government asked for a substantial subsidy for CIE to maintain the service and ensure continuity of employment, we thought they were planning for the future and there would be no further increases for some time. Apparently the Government's projections are week to week, even day to day.  We have had within a few months additional subsidies, now the fare increases and in the Minister's speech the indication or threat that <Col N="1946" /> they are substantially overstaffed and that the same applies to the ESB.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take into consideration workers living in perimeter areas.  Will any concessions be given to them?  They have to commute, not because of their desire to live at a distance from their work but because of the housing programme which to some degree forces them to live in these areas and because of the need for housing.  There is an increase in the fare from Tallaght to the centre of the city of 5p.  That involves an increase of 10p for the return fare. The same applies in the case of the fare from Ballyfermot to the centre of the city and from Whitechurch and other districts.  Rural workers will be affected to an even greater extent than city workers by the increased fares.  This arises, not because of their desire to work in a particular area but because of the location of industrial estates and the zoning by local authorities or by direction of the Government, which means that they have to commute.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to consider a reduction in fares for housewives, for persons attending hospitals, persons in need of medical services and for persons commuting for the purposes of their work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say first that although I was not present yesterday I have read carefully the whole of yesterday's one-and-a-half-hours' debate and I have been present since the beginning today, so that I am familiar with the whole debate.  I say that because, although I will indicate that I am disappointed with the contribution from the Opposition, nonetheless I think this is an extremely serious subject.</P>
      <P>I want, first of all, to say for myself and for my colleagues in Government that there is no lack of awareness of the effects of these increases on ordinary people.  It seems to Opposition Deputies that we are insulated in some way from the currents of ordinary life and the feelings of our constituents. I can assure the Deputies that we are not so insulated, that we remain exactly the same sort of human beings we were when we were in Opposition and are intensely aware of the effects and, indeed, that we are intensely concerned at the result of these increases. We do not yield to anyone in that concern.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about another aspect which, so far as I know, was only touched on by Deputy Dowling and then very briefly.  It is an aspect that particularly concerns me because I want, first of all, before talking about policy and about the methods to surmount the present difficulties in our economy to tease out a little the difficulty that we are currently in in regard to these prices and in regard to their effect on the areas of my own responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one takes the increase in the ESB charges, there is the direct input of energy into the final cost of a product that is made for sale.  That is a direct contribution to the price of that product and with a more and more open economy and with free trade moving inexorably towards us we are in circumstances where our competitiveness is under threat.  It is important that from where I sit and from the access to information that I have I should put that on the record of the House: our competitiveness is currently in danger in a number of ways <Col N="1948" /> but the biggest contribution to that now it seems to me is the rate of wage increase, but I will come to tease that out later on.</P>
    <P>If one turns to the matter of CIE, there is the effect on people themselves that Deputy Dowling has talked about but there is, of course, the direct input into the cost of an industrial product due to transport as well as the indirect effect due to the resulting increase in wage demands because transport prices have gone up for the workers.</P>
    <P>This, I think, is the first time that I have had occasion in the House to refer to the effect of inflation on our industrial competitiveness and on the level of industrial investment.  We are being rescued a little in industrial competitiveness by the continued down-flow of the £ but that is a terrible way to be rescued because it makes all our imports dearer and it sharpens inflation.  It is a contributor, in fact, this down-flow to the £.  Even if it makes our exports a little cheaper, it is importing inflation.</P>
    <P>We are also finding only very recently that the level of inquiries and new commitments industrially as reported to me by the IDA have held up extraordinarily well, better than one would have hoped in a world recession of this kind, but our rate of inflation is now becoming very much a preoccupation with people who find Ireland attractive in every other way as a location for industry, who like our incentive package and who like our physical location but who are worried by what our rate of inflation does to the necessary forward calculations that their economists and accountants have to make.</P>
    <P>The point of saying this is that we are now in a wage-led inflation.  I was affirming last year in debates similar to this one that the great bulk of our inflation was imported and that was then the case but it is necessary to put on the record of the House, to indicate to the people of the country, that that is not now the case.  Now, the great determinant to our inflation rate is the level of wage increases. One could have an argument about <Col N="1949" /> whether the wage increases come first and put up the cost of products where labour is a very important content of the cost of that product or whether the increases like the CIE or ESB increases come first and put wages up. One could have that argument but, in fact, it is a vicious circle.  Each chases the other and it is impossible to separate cause and effect.  Each is a cause and each is an effect.</P>
    <P>I wanted at the outset to indicate that this is a sombre position and that wage-led inflation is now extremely serious, in my view.  When other places were inflating simultaneously with us we retained our competitive position and we could do very little to control inflation because it was caused by the price of imports.  That is not now the circumstances.  We are now seeing a differential between us and other countries of a very serious kind.</P>
    <P>I then want to turn to the content of the debate because, as I say, this is a serious subject.  I do not want to poke my finger in people's eyes or that we should slag each other across the floor but I am bound to say that it is another example of the concept of Opposition which I believe to be inadequate.  I emphasised that I have read or heard every word of this debate so far.  I am bound to notice the absolute lack of suggestions from the Opposition.  The only useful suggestion that I can think of came from Deputy Barrett when he said that there should be a full-scale inquiry and that the increases should be held up pending the outcome of it.  That is the only one I can think of.  It is said, of course, that the task of an Opposition is to oppose but I have said on occasions similar to this that that opposition can take many forms and that the way, in fact, that you would genuinely contribute to the common weal, the well-being of the country, and the way you would simultaneously take the leadership of the country away from us would be by having better suggestions than we have to offer.  When they describe the situation I can see a great deal of truth in it and I can sense the difficulty <Col N="1950" /> of the people who are described. That is true, but let us come to the effects of exaggeration also.  Since I believe that wage-led inflation is now the great danger, exaggerating the situation is itself a contributing factor in generating further explosive wage demands.  It seems to me that electricity charges illustrate this because we have been offered the thought, with many extremely exaggerated and sharp phrases, that something quite extraordinary and remarkable has happened to the price of electricity.</P>
    <P>Let us go back to 1963 and compare the increase in electricity charges with the increase in the general cost of living, with the consumer price index.  The figures I have are March, 1963 to March, 1973. They do not include the latest round but neither do they include other price increases.  It is a 12-year period. In that time the consumer price index went up by 158 per cent and the price of electricity went up by 107 per cent.  Electricity, even with the latest increases, has not caught up with the consumer price index.  I set out sombrely to accept that the scale of these increases is very serious indeed. I am not suggesting it is trivial. I am trying to put it in context because it is important in relation to people's expectations and to future wage settlements that these prices should be seen in context.  The populace should not be driven mad with expectation or with the sense that they are continuously losing out on their incomes, because what we are seeing is that prices and incomes are both rising very rapidly&mdash;much too rapidly&mdash;but that real incomes are not declining.  Yet if you go and talk to people, and I assure Deputy Dowling that I do, everybody believes they are getting poorer.  The figures do not show that but everybody believes it to be the case, and if they believe it to be the case and if we contribute to that belief by what we say we are generating further explosive wage demands which will twist the cycle even further.</P>
    <P>I want to place on the record the mechanism of the operation of the NPC and Government decisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1951" /> First, the decisions are collective Government decisions.  There is a long-standing Department of Finance instruction which antedates this Government, which says that where there is a price rise for a State company it is treated differently from price rises in private industry.  In private industry the recommendation is made to me by the NPC.  I approve it or I turn it down and I inform the Government prior to laying the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the case of State companies there is actually a memorandum for the Government from the Department in question and it is a collective decision.  That is a result of the Act of 1972 made by our predecessors which brought the State companies under the umbrella of price control.</P>
    <P>I want to dispose of an argument of Deputy O'Malley's which seemed to me an unworthy one.  I do not mean that in the sense of being improper but just not being sensible enough to emanate from him.  He suggested that there is an inconsistency in our price behaviour because when these recommendations come to the Government we accept some, we reject others, and we increase some.  This was presented as being inconsistent, but if we were simply to rubberstamp them why bring them to the Government at all?  Surely it is the role of Government to deliberate on them and to pass an opinion on them in the light of their global responsibility for the whole of the economy?  The fact that different applications are treated in different ways is advanced as an example of inconsistency seems an extraordinarily weak argument.</P>
    <P>There is a real dilemma in the NPC, this I affirm, in regard to the control of prices in a semi-State company. In the case of CIE there is a subsidy which is decided by Government and, therefore, the ordinary law of the market-place is influenced by the size of the subsidy.  In that sense the ordinary guidelines of price determination do not apply to CIE because the level of the subsidy is <Col N="1952" /> decided by Government and the price has to make up the difference. In the case of electricity, under the 1927 Act they have to break even within the 12 months.  That is a constraint they work under but it does not indicate to me that we should not have the constraint of surveillance from an outside body placed on CIE or the ESB.  That surveillance was placed on them by our predecessors. I think they did a good thing, even though there is a bit of an anomaly because price determination in State companies, where public policy has an important influence on the final price, is different from price determination in the market-place. When that is said it seems to me extremely important that that surveillance of the ESB and of CIE and the other companies should go on from an outside body which is fairly independent and fairly tough.</P>
    <P>I would like to rebut the strictures implied and stated on the NPC.  Its composition is as it was established by our predecessors.  Its independence is widely accepted.  It is difficult for people representing different outlooks, including the housewives and trade unionists, to serve and to accept this awful imperative; if the arguments all say the price should go up it is hard for them to put that recommendation forward to me and I respect their courage.  It would be easy for various people to back out and say they did not want to do it. They are doing a good service to the public.  I think it is right that they should have surveillance.  It is right that they should employ very tough standards of examination and bring in the experts.  It is right that they should utter the criticism they do. They are serving a useful purpose and I want to defend their activities and their role publicly.  They deserve it. They are courageous, they get through an extraordinary amount of work and they are uninfluenced by anybody, myself included.  That is the way it ought to be.</P>
    <P>Let us talk about the price of electricity and transport, the determinance of these things and the correct policy towards them.  One of the <Col N="1953" /> great cures for everything, but specifically for these price increases, is growth of the economy, because when electricity consumption declines you have to carry the staff with the rising wages, you have to carry the new investment, you have to carry the existing plant, on a smaller total consumption of electricity.  The same applies to road transport.  The more the economy grows, the more people want to move around, the more goods there are to be moved around, the lower your unit costs are.  One half of the nutcracker which is now oppressing our whole economy, and specifically individuals and sectors of our economy, which is making life very difficult either way for CIE, the ESB or other agencies, is stable or contracting demand.  Growth is the great way that unit costs come down. Growth is what we currently have not got, and growth is the core of the Government's policy of deficit budgeting through a number of budgets on an unprecedented scale which was correct and which, though it is not controlling unemployment enough, is nonetheless controlling it to some extent.  It was the correct thing to do and it is being pursued to the limit of the possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not all that much quarrel between the two sides of the House. Let us look at the figures for CIE subsidies.  In 1971/72 it was £7.11 million and £8.88 million in 1972/73. These subsidies were paid by our predecessors.  The level of subvention is a matter of budgeting, a matter, ultimately, of a collective decision in this House.  In 1973/74 the subsidy was increased to £10.75 million.  That was in our time and it is estimated that the figure for 1975 will be £17 <Col N="1954" /> million.  Do the people opposite argue that there should not be any subsidy?  I do not think so because they also subsidised the company.  Do they argue that the level of subsidy is too low?  If it is too low, the answer should be to give more, but this would result in increasing taxes at a time when we are almost near the limit regarding revenue raising.  Is the subsidy too high?  If the Opposition think so, would they say that fares should be increased?  One is entitled to ask for opinions on these points. We have subsidised the company at reasonably comparable levels, even if at slightly higher levels than those of our predecessors.  Should the subsidy be higher, meaning more taxation, or should it be lower, meaning higher prices?</P>
    <P>The question of efficiency has been raised by the NPC consultants and also in speeches here.  There is inefficiency in both these companies but one must ask whether, in the event of over-manning, one wishes that there be a reduction in the labour force at this time.  I do not think the Opposition want that because if there is any reduction in the manning level, extra charges are being put on the social payments because of the additional people out of work.  If one situation is balanced against the other it can be seen that it is cheaper to maintain people in employment in these circumstances. While there is room for improvement in regard to efficiency, there is not room for a tightening that would increase the number of unemployed.</P>
    <P>The other way to greater efficiency is greater investment and this comes from retaining profits but it means higher prices.  Is that what the Opposition want?  Do they want more borrowing?  We are nearing the limit, too, in so far as borrowing is concerned. There are a series of options but at a time like this one finds that, in effect, the options are very few.  I do not think that the Opposition want a reduction in services.</P>

      <P>We are in an area with the UK where there is a down float of the pound, where we have desperate uncertainties regarding the UK which pose enormous difficulties for us.  There is a huge crisis regarding confidence in the UK but if one looks a little further, one finds in the last three weekly indices that the US, the German and the Japanese economies are on the up and these are the three biggest economies in the world.  The UK is in much trouble, but there is evidence from further afield that there is an upturn in the recession situation.  One gets a ritual opposition at a difficult time, an opposition which pretends that people are worse off than they are, an opposition which arouses the sort of fury that causes some sectors to use their industrial clout in order to get very large wage increases.  It is an opposition which fuels the inflationary process at a time when inflation is being caused by explosive wage demands. The appropriate policy is one of stimulant budgeting, of raising social welfare payments and an effort to moderate wage claims through a national partnership.  The demand to lose our calm and do something unspecified is very dangerous.  The task is to come through the next six months, to control explosive wage demands, to control the elements that are causing inflation.  We must avoid the social furies that put immense pressure on our economy.  When Deputy Dowling says that the object of price increases is an effort to wreck the system he is indulging in the sort of destructive criticism which contributes to the difficulty rather than helping to solve the problems.</P>

      <P>Having heard the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Local Government there are a few points I should like to raise.  Last evening the Minister for Transport and Power accused me of having no suggestions to offer during my contribution. Today the Minister for Industry and Commerce spent 30 minutes telling us what was wrong. The accusation of the Minister for Transport and Power was a complete misrepresentation of what went on. There has not been a positive suggestion either from him or from the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to how we might remedy the situation that has befallen us.  For the past two years the Government have proved themselves to be totally incapable of as much as realising the need for urgency in applying themselves to the major problems confronting this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Promises were made from time to time, mainly in response to pressure from the Opposition.  Promises to examine what can be done in the future are a further example of the <Col N="1957" /> lack of realisation of the urgency for dealing with these problems.  The only expression we have not heard is the one about on-going studies.  There is no positive approach by the Government or by either of the two Ministers who are directly involved in what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>The Government's lack of control over our economy has brought us to the point where only State employees can be sure of getting the wage increases which have been negotiated for the current year, together with a small proportion of employees in the private sector.  The money to pay these increases will come from the pockets of the workers who cannot get the increases themselves because their employers in industry will not be able to maintain the existing levels of employment and pay increased wages.  It is not the Opposition's problem to take steps to deal with this.  It is the problem of the people who were elected to govern.  It is of little use for Ministers to ask us what suggestions have we to make.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that we have made no suggestions.  During the course of the debate we dealt at length on the effect of the £200 million oil bill on inflation, on the ESB and CIE.  We pointed out that the Government must get to the root of the problem.  We must have an energy policy.  We have not got any semblance of an energy policy at the moment.  We fail to see one, as do the people of the country.  We have emphasised the necessity to be self-sufficient in oil refining.  This £200 millions which oil is costing us must be a major factor in inflation.  We have said what should be done.  Is that a suggestion?  Is that a positive approach?  We hear from the two Ministers that nothing has been forthcoming from this side of the House. This has been forthcoming for a year-and-a-half and we are still in the same position as we were in in October, 1973.  We have acknowledged that it would take three years from the time it was started and that it should be regarded as a long-term solution.</P>
    <P>We are positive that the Government, <Col N="1958" /> if they so wish, can go out and buy crude oil far cheaper than we are buying it from the multi-national oil companies, or the Russian brokers, or whoever is responsible for supplying oil to the ESB.  You can even be paid to charter tankers because they are so plentiful.  We could have this oil refined on the continent under contract and brought back to the ESB and to our industries at a much cheaper cost.  If the Government are not convinced of this we will produce the figures, and if they do not know where to get the crude oil refined at refineries which are operating below full capacity, we will make the necessary arrangements for them.  This is a very positive approach and a very possible solution to one major contributory factor to inflation. The oil crisis is causing serious trouble for industry, for CIE, for the ESB, for all our semi-State bodies and the whole economy.</P>
    <P>Whether they like it or not the Government must face their responsibilities in regard to CIE, the ESB, the whole energy situation and the inflationary situation we are now experiencing. The time for the exhortations which we have heard for the past two years is long gone.  We saw where they landed the ESB consumers. We saw £ notes burning on television and heard people being exhorted to cut down on their energy consumption.  Then they were asked to pay more for using less energy. This is the type of policy which has been put forward by the Government with the result that the Minister now has to tell us that we are now no longer importing inflation; we are creating it ourselves.  That is their problem and their responsibility.</P>
    <P>We would be prepared to deal with it and to take the necessary decisions if we were in government.  When such situations threatened this country in the past when this party were in government they were not afraid to do right by the country and deal with the problems.  Now we see the incapacity and the lack of will on the part of the Government to deal with the problems facing the nation.</P>
    <P>We moved this resolution because <Col N="1959" /> the Government are permitting CIE and the ESB to impose these increases. The net result will be national bankruptcy.  What greater authority can you ask for than the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance?  They said that if we continued to pay ourselves, disregarding all other considerations, we are forging the weapon of economic disaster.  The CIE and ESB increases which are now being permitted by the Government will trigger the whole nation into new areas of inflation and further wage claims, as Deputy O'Malley and other speakers from this side of the House pointed out in a very positive and definite manner.  Most productive industries will be faced with cost increase which will further limit their competitiveness. This is a key factor.</P>
    <P>No matter what Ministers may say industry must be competitive.  CIE and the ESB are not subject to the same discipline as industry.  They are monopolies and they are not subject to the discipline of exterior or commercial influences.  It is just a question of their customers or passengers paying up or lumping it.  This has been happening and the Government are permitting it to continue.  Then they come in here and accuse the <Col N="1960" /> Opposition of not producing a policy to rectify the ills which are besetting our economy and which are a threat to the life of the nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce spent a long time telling us what was happening all around us. We had no positive approach, no new departure by the Government in an effort to rectify these ills.  The same cannot be said of these benches.  We have put forward positive proposals and positive suggestions.  We will go on repeating them.  I agree that the oil situation has been a major factor but the Government have reminded us time and again that the oil crisis was the major cause of this problem. This has been going on for 18 months and the Government are still incapable of attacking the problem.  We are not incapable of dealing with the matter, we are not barren of suggestions or policies.  For the good of this nation we hope that in the not too distant future we will be returned to power to rectify what has occurred in the last two years.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This afternoon the Minister for Local Government criticised the Opposition because we were spending so much time discussing the Bill.  One might have thought the Government would be glad we were being so vigilant and were scrutinising the Bill carefully.  We scrutinised the Bill not for the sake of criticising it but to see if we could suggest any improvements.</P>
      <P>In this case and in future legislation perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would consider the possibility of allowing the lower paid workers to forego their contributions to the fund. In his brief he referred to the lower paid workers and I would ask him to give sympathetic consideration to my suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a Minister takes us to task for scrutinising a Bill too diligently he is suffering from a misapprehension about what we and the people think of the Government.  Do the Government think their record is so good, that they have instilled such confidence in the Opposition that we would allow the Bill to pass through this House without studying it?  That is too much to ask from any Opposition.  It is our intention to examine the Bill in detail, in view of the fact that it was Fianna Fáil who introduced the original Bill.  Today we were taunted <Col N="1963" /> by Deputies on the Government side who said that although Fianna Fáil introduced the legislation and put it through the Houses of the Oireachtas they did not implement it.  I would point out that the Government were more than a year in office before they decided to implement it.</P>
    <P>What does worry one is the fact that the demands made on the fund may become so great there would be a certain diminution of its powers to meet such demands.  This evening we will have seen the Taoiseach's statement of foreboding and gloomy predictions. I mention that because we on this side of the House have been accused of glorying in the fact that things may get worse.  We do not; we do hope the world economy will take an upturn because we have lost faith in the Government.  Unless some outside sources bring about a revival of the world economy, we do not trust the Government to do anything effective to stimulate our economy.</P>
    <P>Though we may deplore the conditions which make it necessary for the Government to extend the period of benefit, we accept this Bill.  In respect of people who have lost their jobs the Opposition will insist that proper compensation&mdash;if that is the best word to use&mdash;will be forthcoming in order to tide workers and their families over this period hoping that, in the not too distant future, things will change, that we will have our men and women returning to gainful employment and be not merely dependent on social welfare payments. We have got to drive home to the Government that we do not accept that social welfare payments are an end in themselves.  We must strive to create an economy here affording full employment to all our people.  Until that day arrives we cannot afford to be complacent about the extent of our social welfare payments.  We cannot forget our duty, which is to strive to build up the economy so that we will not have a 10 per cent rate of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In his brief the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned people who said that the system was being abused.  He <Col N="1964" /> went on to say there were politicians who were saying nasty things about some social welfare recipients.  Every system is abused by somebody but that is no condemnation of the total system.  Therefore, I do not place much importance on anything that is said in that line; it is too easy always to pick holes in any system.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, if there are found to be abuses, he will endeavour to have them eradicated; if for example a deserving case was being denied full payment, then there should be a deep probe conducted into such case.  But I am sure that in the various phases of life&mdash;in regard to the payment of income tax and so on&mdash;there are abuses to be found. However, I do not think we should waste too much time on that aspect. Rather we should investigate who are the people who most need this benefit. Having decided that, we should ask ourselves are we using the money from the fund in the best possible way?  The vast majority of people unemployed would prefer to be engaged in their trade, profession, factory or shop, and we must strive to achieve that.</P>
    <P>I would suggest also to the Parliamentary Secretary that he examine the possibility of extending the training facilities provided for some workers at present but not all.  I am told the number involved is about 5,000 but, when one thinks of 103,000 unemployed people, 5,000 is a very small percentage.  I put these two points to the Parliamentary Secretary: (1)  that he should try to relieve the lower-paid worker of contributions&mdash;that is, while he is working&mdash;and (2) that we expand our training facilities.</P>
    <P>I would hope the Government would not have to extend the period of benefit any further because we realise this is being implemented because unemployment is at a very abnormal rate. It would be very nice if we could look forward to the day, in the early future, when the unemployment figure would drop considerably, when our workers would be back in gainful employment, building houses, schools, the hospitals needed and so on.  But until such time we cannot afford to be complacent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1965" /> At some future date I hope the Government will introduce a really comprehensive scheme of social welfare, when perhaps we might codify all our Social Welfare Acts.  Until such time we must do the best we can with what the Government place before us. We reserve always the right to criticise and suggest improvements; that is the purpose of an Opposition.  I hope the Government will accept this criticism in the spirit it is offered and that we will not have Front Bench petulance as was experienced this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to know where to begin in replying to the Second Stage of this Bill.  As the House is aware the Bill is a very short one and deals with one particular aspect of social welfare, pay-related benefit.  We have been listening to what could best be described as an adjournment debate or a debate on the Estimates for the Department.  It is very difficult to reconcile the welcome verbally expressed by the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Andrews, with some of the other contributions made on this Bill. Once again the Opposition finds themselves at variance with each other as to what is the best approach, politically speaking, to this measure.  I have come to find that, as far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned, their approach to anything is determined solely by what political expediency recommends itself at that time, and we have been subjected to it again today.  Deputy Andrews' welcome for the Bill, for example, conflicted greatly with the contribution of Deputy Meaney who could be described, quite objectively, as being hostile to any extension of the social welfare services, if one is to judge by his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in commencing to reply, I should like to repeat something I said in my opening statement, that is, that this proposal is not intended as an emergency measure.  It is intended as a natural progression of the social welfare code in this country, as seen by the Government.  I can understand, and possibly even more so than I did this morning, the inability of many of the Fianna Fáil spokesmen <Col N="1966" /> who spoke on this Bill today to comprehend what exactly we are talking about when we talk about social welfare and the fully comprehensive scheme towards which we are aiming.  Do you know why I now have a little greater insight?  Because Deputy Brennan today, the immediate predecessor of the present Minister for Social Welfare, described benefits paid under this scheme, and I quote, as &ldquo;hand-outs&rdquo;.  The Fianna Fáil approach to social welfare was and still is a matter of &ldquo;hand-outs&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of record and it can be checked.  When you have that approach by a former Minister the kind of contribution we had from some Fianna Fáil speakers today becomes quite understandable. As I said, it was more like an adjournment debate than the Second Stage of a limited Bill.  One of the things running through every contribution by every Fianna Fáil speaker was the question of the number of unemployed.  It was implied that what we were trying to do in extending pay-related benefits was to buy their silence.  Indeed, that was openly stated on the benches opposite during the debate.  We ought to explode this Fianna Fáil myth that everyone who is unemployed became unemployed only since March, 1973.  Let us look a little closer at the record of unemployment since the foundation of the State and, more particularly, the record in the 'Forties, the 'Fifties and the 'Sixties and let us compare the figures.</P>

      <P>The Deputy specialises in being selective.  He is not alone in that.  Unfortunately people outside <Col N="1967" /> this House in positions of responsibility are very selective when they are trying to distort the facts in relation to payments under this pay-related scheme.  I shall come to that later. Let us talk now about the unemployment record.  We have approximately 100,000 unemployed.  To me, this is a very large figure.  It is a figure that causes me great concern.  It is a figure that every effort is being made to reduce. But that figure of 100,000 unemployed is in the context of a world economic crisis which has hit every economy in the free world.  Some of the strongest economies are suffering massive unemployment.  America is suffering massive unemployment. Japan is suffering massive unemployment. So are Western Germany, France, Britain, Belgium, Denmark and even the Scandinavian countries.</P>
      <P>Let us look now at the traditionally acceptable record of unemployment under Fianna Fáil who ruled this country for over 30 years.  When other economies from 1945 onwards, except for a short period in the middle of the 'Fifties, were enjoying full employment and getting almost hysterical if their unemployment rate went over 2 per cent a figure of 7 per cent unemployed was totally acceptable to the Fianna Fáil Government.  That figure was acceptable under Fianna Fáil right through the 'Forties, the 'Fifties and part of the 'Sixties.</P>

Added to the 70,000 approximately 7 per cent unemployed, which was acceptable to Fianna Fáil and regarded as normal for most of that period, we had 30,000 emigrating every year.  Add the two together and you come up with approximately 100,000 who could not find employment in this country.  Fortunately emigration has now stopped.</P>

      <P>In the middle 'Sixties emigration fell.  When all other western democracies had full employment, or damn near it, we had 60,000 and 70,000 people unemployed plus 30,000 emigrating every year right up to the middle of the 'Sixties.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  As a matter of fact, 47 per cent of the payments from the pay-related fund is not in respect of unemployment but in respect of illness, maternity benefit or occupational injuries.  I cannot understand how people can welcome a Bill and at the same time object, in the terms in which Deputy Meaney objected, to those payments being made to people who would be better off working.  Of course they would. Nobody would more prefer to be working than they would.  If a man is unfortunate enough to be unemployed or to suffer from a prolonged illness he is not, in my opinion, the recipient of a hand-out, as was described by the former Fianna Fáil Minister for Social Welfare.  He is entitled as of right to get sufficient benefit to provide in a reasonable way for his wife and his children during those periods that quite a large number of working men suffer during the course of their working lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This kind of talk and loose generalisation does a lot of damage.  One might be annoyed at outside people, who in some cases are described in very loose terms as leading industrialists, who make general statements and <Col N="1972" /> when they are asked to be more specific back away.  If they quote figures on examination the figures are found to be inaccurate.  While that is regrettable it is far more regrettable that Opposition Members of the House are apparently insinuating the same things.  They have an opportunity of readily examining how the scheme works.  They know that built into the operation of the scheme it is not possible, except in highly selective, isolated instances, for a person to get more money when unemployed than he would when employed.  The only instance which comes to mind is the case of a husband, wife and two children. If that man is earning £20 a week and becomes unemployed, he gets £20.80 from social welfare.  I do not regard that as a reflection on the operation of the social welfare system. I regard it as a reflection on some of the employers we have in Ireland who will ask a man to work for £20 a week.  That is where the examination should take place, not within the social welfare system.  That is where the criticism should be directed, not towards the social welfare system.</P>

They have the guarantee they will never have to face unemployment and if they are unfortunate enough to suffer from a prolonged illness they are assured that they, their wives and their children will be adequately looked after financially during that period.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just making a statement of fact.  If you like to read the record when it is published you will find that that cannot be contradicted. You should have heard the contributions that came across here today.  It makes sad reading.  It was Deputy Hussey who asked about agricultural workers not being included in pay-related benefits.  It is true that in the original Bill that was passed through the House by Fianna Fáil, a fact about which they are so insistent, agricultural workers were excluded but in our wisdom, by ministerial order, we included them.  Agricultural workers benefited in that respect also from the change of Government.  They are now included in the pay-related scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews and Deputy Gene Fitzgerald wanted to know the reason for the 30 per cent rate of benefit in the extended three-months period. That was best answered, in fact, by a <Col N="1974" /> contribution by Deputy Joe Brennan. As the House is aware, this scheme is in operation only since April, 1974 and it is not possible to give an overall judgment on its operation in that short period.  We feel that it is prudent to advance relatively cautiously in extensions of the scheme.  There is no increase in contributions embodied in this Bill although the period is being extended by 50 per cent.  Deputy Brennan gave a very honest report to the House on his experience with a similar type of Bill, the Redundancy Payments Bill.  He said that the fund was in a very healthy state.  He extended both the monetary benefit and the period and found, much to his surprise and, I am sure, dismay, that the redundancy fund had gone into financial difficulties in a very short period of time.</P>
    <P>One has to be influenced by an experience like that where a Minister, with the best possible intentions, proceeds to improve an existing scheme and finds that, by not exercising prudence, the scheme ends up in financial difficulties.  Because of the newness of the scheme, the limited period of its operation, it is felt that prudence should be exercised in this regard.  That should meet the queries by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>I do not see much point in going into much more of what was said. Most of it was repetitious, I am afraid. I have dealt with most of the points that were raised repeatedly.  There is only one thing I would ask.  When I say I resent criticism of the scheme I would not like to be misunderstood.  I have made a serious call for public debate on the whole area of social welfare.  That debate is not only desirable, it is necessary.  I do not think we can make any progress unless all the people are involved in discussion, in debate and in criticism of the social welfare services, the level of benefits, the various defects in their operation, <i>et cetera.</i> I do not want to be mis-interpreted as wishing that kind of debate to be discouraged.  I want it encouraged. I welcome it.  I object most strongly to people, whether they be newspaper columnists, politicians, would-be leading industrialists, groups <Col N="1975" /> or persons, generalising and in some cases distorting the facts as to the operation of pay-related benefit.  They are not doing a service to the community. They are doing a dishonest day's work as far as the unemployed are concerned.  Certainly, criticise the scheme but criticise it on the basis of fact.  That, surely is a reasonable request.</P>

      <P>I am extremely surprised at the former liberal's arrogant attack on the Opposition for producing a number of constructive views on the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to have got lost in emotion, in hysteria, attacking everybody. Would the Parliamentary Secretary be good enough to explain why he reduces the figure to 30 per cent of reckonable earnings on the one hand and, on the other hand, makes the point that the cost of the implementation of the items in this Bill is £1.8 million?  I have asked him on numerous occasions to account for the £5 million which was collected up to 31st January, 1974 in contributions from employer and employee to the amount of £8 million.  There was £3 million of this paid out in entitlements, <Col N="1976" /> leaving a balance of £5 million. Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us how much there is in the social welfare pay-related fund?  They are two simple questions.  If the Parliamentary Secretary does not want to answer, that is a matter for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in relation to that.  I thought I said it was a similar type of Bill.  Deputy Brennan when he was extending the Redundancy Payments Bill did so, as I acknowledged, with the best possible intentions and made, in my opinion, a progressive amendment to the Bill but, as he stated here today, having done that, the fund, from being in a relatively healthy financial position very quickly reached the point where it was on the verge of bankruptcy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not seem to be able to connect what I am trying to say.  This is a somewhat similar type of scheme.  It is a very new scheme.  It was only in operation a full 12 months last month.  As was said here in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill a short time ago, it is not possible to get a full picture of the social welfare accounts until three months after the end of the financial year.  It would not be in the best interests of the fund to go too wild at this stage with its resources. We believe this is a progressive proposal and will meet the requirements which it is intended to meet but will not endanger the operation of the pay-related fund.</P>

If the Deputy cares to look at the experience of the redundancy fund, the very healthy financial position in which it appeared to be and the very severe difficulties in which Deputy J.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 3 (b) where the reckonable earnings for the first six months of the operation of the Bill is 40 per cent between the figures of £14 and £50 the Parliamentary Secretary now intends to do something which we would like to <Col N="1979" /> have explained.  If a person finds himself unemployed for six months and has to remain in the dole queue for another three months, his pay-related benefit will be reduced by 10 per cent. This seems extraordinary in the light of the information we have finally squeezed out of the Parliamentary Secretary that the pay-related fund is £7 million in the black.  The Parliamentary Secretary tried to justify the 30 per cent figure and related the experience with the redundancy payments fund under the ministry of Deputy J. Brennan.  We are in a totally different situation here.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that 47 per cent of the people who are in receipt of pay-related benefit are in receipt of it because of injury or industrial disease.  That means that 53 per cent of those receiving it are doing so because of unemployment.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary please explain to us why, if he has so much money available to him, he will not continue the 40 per cent.  He has expressed a feeling for the under-privileged as we, on this side, have done and will continue to do despite the Parliamentary Secretary's strictures.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can explain this reduction in a reasoned and reasonable fashion, we will accept it.  I think he has found us to be reasonable and responsible on all occasions and never more so than on this occasion.  All we want is to be dealt with reasonably. We want a decent reason for the reduction of the figure from 40 to 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised at the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary in introducing this Bill on Second Stage did not spell out precisely the figure in the fund, a very relevant matter to any consideration of this Bill, nor did he spell out the reason for the proposed reduction from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.  When he was replying to the Second Stage debate the only explanation he gave for this reduction, the point having been raised, was to quote at some length from what was said by Deputy Brennan of his experience in relation to the redundancy payments fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> The Parliamentary Secretary was asked to give the figures in the fund but he did not appear to be giving them and continued talking about irrelevant matters until pressed, when he said that there was nothing to conceal. It appears to me that he was trying to conceal what was the situation; otherwise, he would have mentioned it in introducing the Second Stage.  One of the basic relevant facts of this Bill is the state of the fund, a fund produced by the contributions of employers and employees.  Eventually, when the figure was ascertained it emerged that the fund which was in credit to the extent of £5 million on 31st December last was £7 million in credit three months later and that was during a period when there was a heavy demand on the fund.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary tells us prudence dictates that he ought reduce the proportion concerned from 40 to 30 per cent.  If prudence dictates that, it must mean that the Parliamentary Secretary is expecting far more demands on the fund than has been the case up to now, because if during the first three months of this year the surplus increased by £2 million it would hardly be prudent to cut back in this way on pay-related benefits.  Even if the Parliamentary Secretary has some fears of this happening, he is not in a position to give an accurate estimate of what such demands would be.  It is all very well to talk of his concern, but actions speak louder than words.  The action of the Parliamentary Secretary is to reduce payments at a time when the surplus in the fund is growing and, that, at a time when there are enormous demands on the fund.  The Parliamentary Secretary owed it to the House to spell all this out on Second Stage.  Not having done that, he must spell it out now and tell us why he proposes the reduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to reconcile some of the contributions from Fianna Fáil.  We have had full-blooded attacks by Deputy Meaney and others in respect of the level of benefits being paid but there has not been any indication of courage on their part to attack the fund, to <Col N="1981" /> attack the extension of the period of payment or to attack the operation of the scheme.  All of this was done by way of insinuation during the debate, and now we are told that we are trying to avoid revealing the amount of money in the fund although these figures are published.</P>

      <P>It has been difficult to sit here since 10.30 this morning listening to the Deputies opposite questioning the wisdom of paying these benefits at all, questioning the whole operation of the scheme and of giving adequate support to people who experience prolonged periods of unemployment or illness.  After all that, they want to know why we do not maintain the benefits at a higher level.  I have explained repeatedly why the Bill is <Col N="1983" /> considered desirable at this stage.  I was not pushing Deputy Brennan into the forefront.  Deputy Brennan explained what his experience had been in relation to a similar fund.  He said the proper thing to do is what they are doing, that is, to show prudence and caution.  That is why it is 30 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was silent about the amount of the fund.  When we dragged it out of him he decided to tell us there was £7 million in the fund.  You and your Department and the senior officials in it must expect a very heavy demand on it in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>They must be expecting a very heavy demand on the fund.  I have no doubt that there will be, in view of the number of redundancies which are now taking place. I now know that the reason for the cut-back is that there will be a very heavy demand on the fund in view of redundancies and closures.  I was amazed to hear that the fund had increased from £5 million on 31st December to £7 million on 31st March.  I cannot understand why the Parliamentary Secretary shielded that.  We dragged it out of him.  That is not a nice word but it is the only word I can use.</P>
      <P>There will now be a bigger demand on the fund than ever there was, in view of the number of companies who are going into bankruptcy and in view of the increasing costs announced recently which will make extra demands on companies.  At the moment the fund is solvent.  In three months it has shown a profit of £2 million.  Because employers will have to reduce their staff to cover the extra cost of wages, many people will become redundant and there will be more of a demand on the fund.  That is why the Parliamentary Secretary decided to cut back on the allowance.</P>

      <P>I listened to the debate all day and I was astonished <Col N="1984" /> that the amount of the fund was not mentioned in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement.  I got the impression that the fund must be low but, at this late hour, the Parliamentary Secretary has admitted that it has gone up by £2 million since December last.  Why then is there a cut-back of 10 per cent in the last three months?  This is not Government money.  It was contributed by the employers and the workers.  I thought the fund must have gone down because of all the calls on it but apparently it is improving.  If it were below the figure of £5 million the Parliamentary Secretary could refer to the redundancy fund which Deputy Brennan talked about and which went down too low.  This fund has accumulated £2 million since December. Unless a catastrophe is anticipated&mdash;and we hope it will not happen&mdash;why has there to be a cut-back of 10 per cent?</P>

      <P>I will help him. I presume the Parliamentary Secretary is familiar with his own Estimate, Social Welfare, Estimate 48 in the Book of Estimates for this year.  The first fact which should be pointed out is that the Book of Estimates covers the period from 1st January, 1975, to 31st December, 1975.  It is certainly not under subhead A.  It is not under subhead B. It is not under subhead C.</P>

      <P>I was coming to that.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is referring me to the Appendix, pay-related benefit is given as £11,513,000 in 1975 as against £6,958,000 in the April-December period of 1974.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary say what the position of the fund was on 1st January of this year and what it was on 1st March?  It is as simple as that. This is all the information we have in the Appendix to which the Parliamentary Secretary has referred me. Obviously that is an estimate over a year as compared with a nine-month period in the previous year due to the change in the period of estimation. In those circumstances would the Parliamentary Secretary oblige me by giving me the information which I have asked for with, I hope, all due courtesy?</P>

      <P>There are some straight men in Opposition for that act.  When one considers the short period of operation of the fund, the difficult economic circumstances and <Col N="1986" /> the fluctuation during the 12 months of operation in unemployment figures, it is not in the best interest of anybody, least of all those who would be receiving benefits, to make hasty and imprudent decisions now regarding expenditure from the fund.  We are satisfied that the fund will meet the provisions required by this Bill.  Deputies will be pleased to note, in view of the uproar they caused over the increase in the price of insurance stamps recently, that no increase in contributions is called for under this Bill.  We are in the happy position of having a healthy fund financially and we are making sure it remains so.  The decisions are based with that in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We now have a surplus of £7 million and the Parliamentary Secretary has said he is maintaining it at 30 per cent rather than keeping it consistent at 40 per cent and urges caution.  After six months the Parliamentary Secretary is concerning himself with rhetoric in relation to his concern about the under-privileged. We are concerned about them also.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is so concerned about them he should be consistent but he is reducing the pay-related entitlement from 40 per cent to 30 per cent and that seems to be an amazing illogicality.  Are people who have been out of work for six months to be asked to take less money after that?  Employer and employee have contributed to the £7 million surplus and surely the workers are entitled to the benefit of that surplus.</P>
      <P>We agree that it is appalling to ask a man and his wife and children to live on £20 per week.  It is appalling when one considers that the rate of inflation is in the region of 32 to 38 per cent in real terms.  Some of the economists explain that the real figure is not 25 per cent but 32 per cent.  On a compound interest assessment some of them say it is 38 per cent.  I would appreciate if the Parliamentary Secretary would introduce an amendment increasing the percentage from 30 to 40 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has told us about the light at the end of the tunnel. I took that to mean that the unemployment <Col N="1988" /> situation was going to come to an end.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is consistent with the Minister we have £7 million to give out on the basis that unemployment is coming to an end.  By not giving out that money the Parliamentary Secretary is admitting that the light has gone out.  It is horrifying for the Parliamentary Secretary to abuse the Opposition who have been more than reasonable and patient.  When introducing the Bill the Parliamentary Secretary did not refer to the surplus in the fund.  That was very unfair in view of the fact that since taking over the spokesmanship on social welfare I have been urging him to explain where that surplus went.  We had to squeeze out of him that the surplus is £7 million.  It is not good enough for him to refuse to increase the percentage as we have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to harass the Parliamentary Secretary with figures, but in the Appendix to which he has referred the expenditure estimated for the total year is £150,110,000 and the estimated income is £114,925,000.  That includes the complete fund of which the pay-related benefit is only a part.  The difference between the two sums is approximately £35 million.  The difficulty is that we cannot get the information because, unfortunately, the item of income is not broken down in the same way as the benefits are set out under the item of expenditure.  It is not right to say the information can be obtained readily from the Book of Estimates.  It would have to be sought in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to clarify what is the fund under this heading.  I am not quite clear what he means by &ldquo;surplus&rdquo;.  I accept that there was a figure of £7 million on 31st March but I should like to know what is that £7 million. Is it £7 million of a fund or is it surplus on the portion relating to pay-related benefits?  The Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that we have a legitimate difficulty in assessing the financial position in regard to this important question.  I am not joining in the debate with regard to what <Col N="1989" /> benefit should be given but I should like to know the financial implications of the transaction.  It will be found out afterwards, but that may be too late.</P>

There is no doubt that the number of unemployed is great. It has been in the region of 100,000 for some time but this should be put in perspective.  During a long period of years, in the 1940s, the 1950s and the 1960s, Fianna Fáil Governments accepted that it was normal to have 65,000 or 70,000 people unemployed. It was regarded as a normal acceptable figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting a little more light on this subject, and the <Col N="1992" /> more light we get the more sinister becomes the whole thing.  The fact of the matter is that the Parliamentary Secretary introduced the Second Stage of this Bill without any reference whatsoever to the state of the fund. He replied to the Second Stage debate without referring to the state of the fund.  He was asked then to give the details and, looking back on it now, although he said there was no secret about it, that he was not trying to evade anything, it is clear that that is precisely what he was doing.  He then told us that the figure, which we knew, was £5 million surplus at the 31st of December last.  And we asked him what was the latest figure.  He told us the surplus was now £7 million at the 31st of March.  Therefore, we had an increase of £2 million in the surplus in the first three months of this year. When we pointed out that, in view of the fact that there had been a growth of £2 million in the surplus in those three months, there were heavy demands on the fund, it seemed peculiar&mdash;to say the least&mdash;that he proposed in this section to reduce the relevant figure from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.  The Parliamentary Secretary then became abusive.  Anybody can make a mistake.  I did not hear him say earlier on that he had made a mistake when he had said £8 million instead of £7 million but I accept immediately if he did make a mistake; any one of us can do that.  But, if the Parliamentary Secretary becomes abusive in the process of his mistakes, he need not expect to get away with it lightly.  When he tells this House that the figures he gave were available, were published, he is misleading the House.  He was asked, and given the opportunity to correct what he had said.  He was asked where and, in very abusive language and accompanied by abuse of Deputies on this side of the House, he said it was in the Book of Estimates, this, despite the fact that he should have known&mdash;and it was pointed out to him&mdash;that the Book of Estimates was made up to the 31st of December.  Therefore, it could not, and did not, contain a figure of £7 million to the 31st of March, which was the latest figure available according to himself.  When asked to say <Col N="1993" /> where it was, the Parliamentary Secretary became even more abusive.  I am now inviting the Parliamentary Secretary to say where is it published information, where is it a matter of public knowledge, as he subsequently said, that the surplus in the fund was £7 million on 31st of March last?  I am inviting him to point out precisely where that information was available and, if he cannot do so, would he mind withdrawing the mis-statement he made to the House, if not the abuse, to the effect that it appeared in the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was keen to range far and wide to cover up, firstly, the misleading of the House in which he had indulged and, secondly&mdash;quite clearly&mdash;the fact that there has been an attempt to cover up what is happening in relation to this fund and in relation to this section. Having disposed of the question of where precisely is the information as to the latest figure in the fund, I would then invite the Parliamentary Secretary to explain, not merely to the House but to the public in general, on what basis he says it is prudent to refuse to continue the 40 per cent in view of the fact that there has been an increase of £2 million in the surplus of the fund in the first three months of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a reasonable request, one that goes to the root of this Bill; a matter with which one would have expected the Parliamentary Secretary to deal when introducing the Second Stage of the Bill and certainly when concluding the debate on the Second Stage.  However, since he failed to do so and since we had to extract the information from him&mdash;considering it is vitally relevant to any consideration of a Bill proposing to extend the period of payments from the fund and also to this section proposing to reduce the percentage from 40 per cent to 30 per cent&mdash;it is not an unreasonable request to the Parliamentary Secretary that he carry out his normal duties, explain to the House the financial considerations involved and the method or reasoning by which it was decided it would be prudent to reduce the figure from 40 per cent to 30 per <Col N="1994" /> cent, having regard to the increase of £2 million in the surplus of the fund, bringing it to £7 million in the first three months of this year.</P>
    <P>Certainly it is conceivable that the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to produce figures to us to show the demands over a certain period and to show why he considers it reasonable and prudent to reduce this figure. He has not yet done so and I am inviting him to do it now.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to elaborate any further on what I have said.  I have given the reasons why this approach has been made.  We feel it is in the best interests of all concerned. Deputy Brennan had the honesty to stand up here and actually commend this approach, from his experience as a former Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Labour, who had a similar fund in operation which he over-extended, with the best possible intention and motive, and found then that, from a very healthy surplus, the fund was in financial difficulty.</P>

      <P>I am not, as I said earlier, interested in seeing what effects this will have.  I am neither criticising nor commending.  A few minutes ago I gave the total estimate for the year.  I want to find out how the fund is going for the year.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell me?  Under the heading &ldquo;Pay-Related Benefit&rdquo; for 1975 there is the figure of £11,513,000 as against £6,958,000 for April-December, 1974. Under the heading &ldquo;Income Pay-Related Scheme&rdquo; we have the figure of £17,980,000 for 1975 as against £9,075,000 for the April-December period 1974.  The difference between the two is £6,467,000.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary please relate these figures and the difference I have quoted over the 12-month period I have quoted to the figure he stated at the end of last year and at the end of March?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary be able to tell me what is <Col N="1996" /> the relationship of the figures he has given to these figures?  These are the only published figures we have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary in dealing with the objective approach taken by this side of the House to this question.  The Parliamentary Secretary scoffs and jeers and sniggers.  It is quite obvious to me that the Parliamentary Secretary, when he said, &ldquo;You will find it in the Book of Estimates&rdquo;, was acting on the advice he got from his staff because it is quite clear to me that he really does not know what he is talking about when he talks about an appendix in relation to the Social Welfare Estimate for 1974-1975. When Deputy de Valera asked him about the figure of £6,958,000 he said that was the surplus in the fund as at 31st December last year.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons I came into the House was that I heard the Parliamentary Secretary tell Deputy Colley that, when he wanted information of this nature, he should know where to find it; he, with his experience of Finance, should know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the Parliamentary Secretary refused to give the information&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and then proceeded actually to lecture us as to where we would find it.  This sent me frantically searching in my drawer for the Book of Estimates because I could not imagine this information was there and that is why I came in with the Book of Estimates to hear the Parliamentary Secretary himself utterly confused because he was not able to make up his mind whether the <Col N="1998" /> fund at present was £8 million or £7 million.  He contradicted Deputy Colley and informed Deputy de Valera it was £8 million and found himself having to apologise subsequently for his mistake.  I pay tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary in so far as he makes it very difficult to make a serious contribution here with his sneering, his jeering, his scoffing and his laughing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite clear. According to the Book of Estimates, the amount of actual expenditure under the pay-related benefits scheme for the period April-December last year was estimated as £6,958,000. The income for the same period into the pay-related benefits scheme was £9,075,000 according to the appendix. That means that the excess that should have accrued to the pay-related benefits fund during the course of that nine months period was £2,117,000.  This is where the Parliamentary Secretary says that the Book of Estimates will show a credit fund of £5 million.  Obviously, £3 million must have come into that nine months Estimate year, because the income exceeded expenditure, according to this Book of Estimates, by £2,117,000 last year.  This means a sum of £3 million was somewhere, perhaps coming in as balance last April.</P>
      <P>We now come to the present year where the amount of envisaged expenditure under the pay-related benefits scheme is £11.513 million.  I take it that the expenditure by the end of this year will far exceed that because of the increased number unemployed. I also feel that the income into the pay-related scheme, which was estimated at £17.980 million, according to the Book of Estimates, will show, during the course of 1975, a surplus of £6.467 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume in this regard the Parliamentary Secretary will have, arising from, as Deputy Andrews said, the increase in the pay-related contributions amount, an overall increase in the income.  On the other hand, the Parliamentary Secretary said today <Col N="1999" /> that the estimated additional cost, provided things did not disimprove, would be somewhere in the region of £1.8 million.  On the basis of the difference between the 30 per cent and the 40 per cent there will be a 10 per cent increase on that amount. That will not seriously rock the boat as far as the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister are concerned.</P>
    <P>The ridiculous statement by the Parliamentary Secretary that the figure in the fund of 31st March of this year could possibly be in the Book of Estimates prompted me to speak. I believe he should have a lot more to say in reply to the questions that have been raised here than simply apologising for his mistake about the £7 million and the £8 million.  It appears to me he is suffering from what a man suffers when he gets too much favourable press comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to another matter relating to figures.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated that the information is available.  I would like to remind him that the Appropriation Accounts for last year are not available yet and the Appropriation Accounts for this year probably will not be available until after the end of this year.  We are virtually confined to the Book of Estimates and to such answers as Ministers will give.</P>
      <P>I have tried to be as objective as possible on this, but I would like to register the strongest possible protest at the attitude of certain Ministers who will not assist the House with information or the furnishing of documents. The public should know there is great arrears in having information available.  We have had no opportunity of discussing these matters and we now do not know the position of this fund.  I have had occasion in another place to go into these matters and I am afraid that I must say that the Parliamentary Secretary does not know what he is talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Parliamentary Secretary's suggestion that in some way Deputy Joe Brennan, a former Minister for Labour and <Col N="2000" /> also a former Minister for Social Welfare, is allegedly supporting his approach to caution on the 30 per cent, that is the reduction from 40 per cent to 30 per cent, I want to make it quite clear that the money available to the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Joe Brennan, in the redundancy fund was considerably less than is available to the Minister in the social welfare pay-related fund. We are talking about £7 million here and it is money which belongs to the people who paid into the fund, the employers and the employees.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera and Deputy Colley have touched on other very important areas on this particular section, which is one we appear to be stuck on.  We will continue to stick on it if the Parliamentary Secretary continues to treat the House, as distinct from the Opposition who are collectively responsible to the House, with contempt.  It is not good enough for him to come in here and state that he will not act as a back-up service to the Opposition.  We do not want him to do that under any circumstances because his display here tonight quite clearly indicates that he would not be even a member of a back-up group to provide back-up services for Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>We want the Parliamentary Secretary to be a back-up group to the House as an entity.  I believe the House is entitled to it as a totality of individuals who were sent here by the people as public representatives.  This is what we believe should be made available.  We do not want, as an Opposition, to dissociate ourselves from the totality of the number of Deputies who are elected to make up this House.  The information is not forthcoming.  We are entitled to legitimately pursue the Parliamentary Secretary within the democratic process until we receive answers in relation to the matters we have brought to his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to nail the attempted lie that in some way the former Minister for Labour, Deputy Brennan, is allegedly supporting the Parliamentary Secretary's approach to caution on the matter of the 30 per cent.  It is a piece <Col N="2001" /> of spurious argumentation which does not bear examination.  We certainly do not accept his interpretation which is selective and prejudiced in regard to what Deputy Brennan said.  He spoke from his own experience as Minister for Labour but he also spoke from his experience in relation to the fund which was considerably less, as we understand it, than is now available to the Parliamentary Secretary in a far different set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>At the time Deputy Brennan was concerned employment was going well, everything was going well.  We now find ourselves in an employment situation where unemployment is increasing on a daily basis or even on an hourly basis.  I described inflation as an infinity of inflation, which goes on and on.  Under all those circumstances, surely my case is made even stronger.  With inflation at 25 to 32 per cent on an annual basis, offering people 30 per cent after six months, people living on the breadline, and reducing their living standards by 10 per cent is unfair and unjust.  It becomes even more unfair and unjust when one realises that the Parliamentary Secretary has £7 million available to him that we did not know about coming into this debate.  I do not think he was trying to conceal it.  I do not think he was aware of the amount at his disposal.  Perhaps that is the reason he could not give the information.  He has £7 million available to him.  In view of the stress of unemployment, the inflationary situation, the difficulties housewives face when the breadwinner is on social welfare payment, it is most unfair to reduce the 40 per cent to 30 per cent. I want to make an appeal to him to increase the figure to 40 per cent.  I hope this is only one of a number of such appeals which will be made until the Parliamentary Secretary agrees.</P>
    <P>There are other points to be made in relation to this section and to the Bill and those who will make them are well able to do so.</P>

      <P>While not wanting to divert from Deputy Andrews' main argument, I said something when the Parliamentary Secretary was out which I would not have said if I had noticed <Col N="2002" /> that he was absent.  I said that the Parliamentary Secretary did not know what he was talking about.  I do not want that to be taken in any personal sense.  What I am beginning to be afraid of is that if that is the case&mdash; both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary should take note&mdash;if Ministers are themselves not in a position to judge for themselves, if they are merely echoes for their Departments and of briefs given by the Departments, where are we going?  I am afraid that is what is happening.  I am afraid the real ministerial direction is on the other side of that barrier.  I am not making any personal accusations here. This is because we have not got the information.  This is because we are behind time in publishing the information. This is because this House is not given the information to enable us to judge.  We are all becoming puppets for a bureaucracy.  When I said the Parliamentary Secretary did not know what he was talking about, I did not mean it personally but I am afraid that is where this Government have got now and it is high time that all the information is made available.</P>

I can assure the Deputy and the House that this has not happened and I would like to make it quite clear that there has never been any attempt by the civil servants in the Department of Social Welfare in my experience to exercise any authority which would not <Col N="2003" /> be proper to them.

My whole record here has been defending the civil servants and pointing out that this House has thrown the whole burden on to them and that this Government in particular have thrown it completely on them.  It is anything but a slur on the civil servants.  It is a slur on the Government that do not see that the information is available to enable them and us to do our job.  It is the same with the unfortunate Revenue Commissioners.  We are throwing the whole burden of work, responsibility and everything else on the civil service. I have had to make that point here before.  It is anything but a slur on them.  If it was not for them the whole thing would have blown up long ago, the country would not be running, because of the incompetency of the Government.  It is the civil servants who are keeping things going.</P>
      <P>It is high time that you briefed yourselves with the information you should have and could talk from your own knowledge and not have to lean over and get notes the whole time, lean over to get the answer, and then to get confused as the Parliamentary Secretary did.  Do not misrepresent me like that.  Every time the Parliamentary Secretary has to lean over to get a note.  He tells us there is stuff published and it is not.

Does the increase in wages not mean that there will be extra money coming into the fund, but that may be counteracted by the redundancies and the closures that are about to take place?  The Parliamentary Secretary can smile all right.  He must see the writing on the wall when he has decided to reduce the breadline by 10 per cent on the pay-related benefit.

We on this side thought that with the very heavy burden on it in the last three months it would not show an increase of £2 million on 31st March.

I arrange every week's business in full consultation with the Opposition.  Frequently I arrange the sequence of business in response to suggestions from them. <Col N="2012" /> Very often business is ordered in almost the way suggested by Deputies Browne and Lalor.  I have no complaint personally against either of these two Deputies.  Last week I discussed the arranging of this week's business with Deputy Browne.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the House an undertaking about tomorrow's business which would involve turning upside down what the Opposition and I arranged last week and what I told my own Deputies would be taken.  I do not exclude it, but I cannot arrange it off the top of my head.  I accept that Deputy Browne did not give a guarantee that the Bill would go through in an hour.  I am not accusing him of not being perfectly straight about it, but he knew that the Government intended to give today and yesterday to the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  He knew that had we foreseen that this Bill, which I understood was not contentious, although it has not <Col N="2016" /> turned out like that, would take all day today, it would not have been ordered for today.</P>
      <P>As it happens, the Minister for Finance has to go to America so he cannot be here to take the Capital Gains Tax Bill tomorrow.  He is going to America in the public interest. It is a severe nuisance to him and to his programme that we did not get to the Bill at all today, and obviously we are not going to do so.  I am not accusing the Opposition of a breach of faith in regard to the ordering of the business, and I hope this will not damage my own relations with them, because it is of value that we should arrange the business by agreement rather than by dictation.  I hope that as long as I am in this position it will always be like that.</P>
      <P>Because of some factor which I cannot put my finger on, which has carried the Bill through the day although it was supposed to be non-contentious&mdash;and we have not had a single vote on a principle&mdash;the business which the Government intended to do today has had to be put on the long finger until next week.  I do not accuse either Deputy Lalor or Deputy Browne of the slightest degree of guilt about that or, indeed, anybody else, but I want to put on record the expectations which have been disappointed through no fault of our own. If there is any fault it is not on this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that we are not trying to hold up this Bill.  The reality of the situation is that the Parliamentary Secretary is attempting in this Bill to reduce from 40 per cent to 30 per cent the figure to be paid on reckonable earnings for the three-months' period under discussion. The Parliamentary Secretary has not told us why he intends reducing this figure from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.  He has not justified the reduction of that figure having regard to the amount of £7 million or thereabouts in credit in the fund.  He has not justified the introduction of section 3 (b) of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefits) Bill, 1975.</P>
      <P>It is a piece of hypocrisy for him to come in here and attempt in some way to suggest that the Opposition are deliberately trying to deprive people of benefit in view of the fact that he is reducing the figure from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.  He has £7 million in the fund.  We got this information in the past hour-and-a-half only.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is so concerned about the rapid passing of this Bill, the House is entitled to be given some reasons for the reduction of 10 per cent.  This figure has not been justified. The Parliamentary Secretary has not given any reason for it.  He has not once replied to Deputy Colley's very reasonable questions about the amount of the fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my thanks to the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise the subject matter of these questions on the Adjournment.  I sought this opportunity to draw the attention of the Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the public to the serious and unsatisfactory economic situation that has developed in west Clare.  This has arisen because of the closure of two factories.  When I raised the question of establishing new industries in that area some time ago I received a reply similar to that <Col N="2019" /> which was read out today, that negotiations were in progress and it was hoped to have some definite proposals in the near future.  Nothing has happened since.  In fact, since the Coalition came into office nothing has been done to improve the position in the area.</P>
      <P>There is uncertainty about establishing new industries and workers in long established industries in Kilrush are on short time.  In that town 1,500 people sign for unemployment benefit and assistance weekly.  The pay-related benefit scheme does not apply to most of those people because they did not have the necessary number of insurance stamps to qualify.  I expressed my concern about a factory which closed down some months ago in a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on 21st January last.  I asked that Minister if he was aware of the concern amongst employees of a company in Kilrush regarding future employment prospects at a factory in that town.  The Minister for Transport and Power, who replied on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce on that occasion, stated:</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by this company and I can understand the concern of the employees.  Initial problems have now been resolved but due to a downturn in demand the company has had to cut back its production programme with a consequent reduction in its workforce and the introduction of short-time working. Some further reductions are expected before the company's operations can be stabilised.  The Industrial Development Authority are working closely with the company in assisting it through the current difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that matter is specifically related to the questions raised by the Deputy this afternoon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  That reply refers to the same industry which has closed down.  At that time the Minister gave <Col N="2020" /> an assurance that the initial problems had been resolved.  He was hopeful that the matter would be resolved and the difficulties overcome.  However, within ten days of that assurance the factory closed down.  This raises a question in relation to the information supplied in reply to parliamentary questions.  In January the Minister informed me that there was a downturn in demand for the commodity produced in that factory but, nevertheless, the same week that factory closed down a similar industry for die-casting was announced for the Shannon region.</P>
      <P>If there was a downturn in demand how was it that after the Kilrush industry closed down another one commenced operation in Shannon?  I can not understand that.  When I raised the question about the second industry I was told in a reply that because of a recession in the demand for the product in the UK market the plant had ceased operation.  That factory was only in operation for less than six months and I cannot understand how it was not possible to foresee that type of recession in the UK market before operations commenced. Had an investigation been carried out prior to the establishment of that industry we would not have had the alarming situation that arose six months after it commenced operation.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Labour if any unsafe machines were being used by that die-casting company in 1974 and if a prosecution had been brought against the company.  Even though consultations were going on with the company in relation to its future at that time apparently the workers were not aware that the company was in breach of safety regulations.  However, this was the position even though £182,000 had been paid out of State funds but the Minister did not seem to know, at least he did not make this information available when he was asked this question.  In my view this calls for a detailed inquiry. The Minister is falling down in his responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to the Minister for <Col N="2021" /> Labour or the Minister for Industry and Commerce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Minister for Labour who was involved in the prosecution brought under the Factories Act, 1955.  Surely the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce and Labour are involved in this matter. One might expect the Ministers would have some way of finding out what was the position so that a situation would not arise where a factory had to close.</P>
      <P>There were hopes in the die-casting industry that this would be a major development, one that would spearhead further industrial development in the area and open the entire west Clare area.  The position now is that fully-trained people in the die-casting industry in Kilrush are unable to get alternative employment.  Many of these people returned with their families from England.  They bought houses in the area but now there is no apparent hope of their finding suitable employment.</P>
      <P>The position is so serious in Kilrush and in west Clare that the Kilrush Chamber of Commerce, the urban district council and other interested bodies have called a series of meetings to discuss this matter and one of those meetings is due to be held next week.  What is needed is immediate action by the Minister to ensure that something positive is done.  Promises are of little use unless they are backed up by performance.  Today the Minister gave some ray of hope with a promise of 230 jobs but it was a vague promise and I should like the Minister to elaborate on it.  In any event, 230 jobs will only solve part of the problem because, 1,500 people are signing at the local employment exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this area there is the Shannon estuary which is probably the finest deep-sea port in the west of Europe but the Government have not made any effort to develop the potential of the area.  There have been many studies, reports and outline plans but no positive action to attract industry which would open not only the Clare area but the west of Ireland for development. <Col N="2022" /> There was a proposal by the ESB for a high tension crossing of the Shannon from Tarbert in Kerry to Clare which would give worthwhile employment but this project has been postponed and, in view of the general recession, it is unlikely it will be proceeded with for a considerable time.  I realise this is probably a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power but I am mentioning it now to illustrate how another promise was not fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The whole issue boils down to the fact that there is a lack of action on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am glad to have the opportunity tonight of asking him to take a personal initiative in this matter in an effort to resolve this serious crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything Deputy Daly has said with regard to the closure of the Federal Die-Casting Company is true.  For a long time the previous Government and the people of the area concerned tried to encourage industry to that part of the county. Admittedly in the central part of the county, in the Shannon development area around Ennis, there was considerable success in encouraging industrialists. Possibly they were more attracted to the Shannon area because of its proximity to the airport and to centres such as Ennis and Limerick. There has always been considerable difficulty in attracting industrialists to the western part of the county but, with the help of the Shannon Development Company, efforts in recent years have been successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ceramics factory was successful. Some years ago that firm found themselves in serious trouble but the Government, through the IDA, came to their rescue.  That effort was successful and the industry has expanded. The Federal Die-Casting Company came to the area and got the usual encouragement and help that industrialists get.  A number of local people were trained abroad; now they are skilled in their trade and are well able to compete with other skilled people in that industry.  As Deputy Daly pointed out, this industry closed down <Col N="2023" /> some weeks ago but, at the same time, a similar type of industry started at Shannon Airport.  It was said the industry in Kilrush closed because of lack of demand and market conditions and people wondered why a similar industry was opening at Shannon.  It was considered they could have taken over the premises at Kilrush which had machinery, even though some of it was found wanting when it was examined at the time of closure.  If the new industry were located in Kilrush it would relieve the serious unemployment in the area.  Even though there is considerable industry in the central part of the county, people from other areas have to travel long distances to work and this is an important factor in view of the high cost of travel.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister spoke about the possibility of a large industry coming within eight miles of the area we are discussing.  We hope this will materialise but, as the Minister indicated today, it cannot be regarded as helping the immediate situation.  A lot of preparatory work has to be done, surveys to be carried out and so on, and it is too soon to be offering this as the safety valve for the one which has closed down.  It would be appreciated if something could be procured for the town of Kilrush in the immediate future in order to absorb a large number of unemployed people in the area.</P>

      <P>Unless I am mistaken&mdash;and we shall find out in the next few minutes&mdash;I think we have witnessed a fairly serious abuse of this Adjournment Debate by Deputy Daly.  I want to refer to the unrevised transcript of Question Time today where I believe he made a fairly serious mistake which either he has not spotted up to now or else he is trying to cover up because I did not answer the questions to which he made reference, but I had read my brief before coming in.  I am quoting from just after 4 o'clock&mdash;I cannot give a column reference since it is the unrevised version of the Official Report of today.  There Deputy Daly is quoted as saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2024" /> In reply to a question of mine on 21st of January in relation to one industry in Kilrush the Minister assured me that the initial problems had been resolved there and that he hoped everything was OK. Within a week of that assurance the place had closed down.  Is he not aware of that?</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Daly that that is not true; that he was confusing one factory with another, and that either he spotted that at the time and has not had the guts to own to it or else he has not spotted it yet.</P>

      <P>I reiterate that I believe&mdash;and we can check out who is right or not, because it is on the record &mdash;that that sentence: &ldquo;Within a week of that assurance the place had closed down&rdquo; is untrue; that Deputy Daly knew it was untrue, and that he obtained this Adjournment Debate on the basis of that knowledge.  That is an abuse of the procedures of this House.  I think perhaps he did it fumblingly at the time, because he had not thought his way through it.  Then he had not the courage, in the interval, either to call off this Adjournment Debate or else to clarify the position when he rose for his 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sentence stands on the record. We shall see.  Deputy Daly has read information on to the record.  I have to depend on my briefing.  As I say, we shall see in due course who is right and who is wrong.  But I am satisfied that that is an abuse of the House. I am satisfied it is an abuse of the facility offered to Deputies to raise matters on the Adjournment.  I do not take Deputy Daly seriously enough to differentiate against any part of his constituency on the basis of silly allegations <Col N="2028" /> that he may make.  But he must know that there are many people, in many offices and many organisations, who will simply get cross at this sort of lighthearted accusation and that, without anybody intending it&mdash;and certainly I do not take him seriously enough either way; I would be ashamed to take him seriously enough to do any&mdash;&mdash;</P>
