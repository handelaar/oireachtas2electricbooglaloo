      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of Public Works; for expenditure in respect of public buildings; for the maintenance of certain parks and public works; for the execution and maintenance of drainage and other engineering works; for the expenditure arising from damage to the property of External Governments; and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 7th May, 1975, the Dáil passed without debate a Vote of £18,235,000 for Public Works and Buildings.  The token Supplementary Estimate of £10 now introduced is to enable the activities of the Office of Public Works to be discussed.  When comparing the figure of £18,235,000 with the corresponding <Col N="1394" /> figure of £9,951,000 shown in the Book of Estimates for the period from 1st April, 1974, to 31st December, 1974, Deputies should note that the latter figure does not include the amount of the Supplementary Estimate passed by the House on 27th November or the amount recovered from the Vote for Remuneration to cover the cost of pay increases under the 1974 National Pay Agreement. When these amounts are taken into consideration the total expenditure in the nine months from 1st April, 1974, to 31st December, 1974, apart from national schools about which I shall have more to say later, comes to £10.85 million.  Total net expenditure for the first three months of 1974, came to £3.65 million giving a total of £14.5 million for the year.  The amount being sought for 1975 represents, therefore, an increase of over 25 per cent on 1974 expenditure.</P>
      <P>I will now comment on the various subheads that make up the Estimate. Throughout, when I mention expenditure for 1974, I will be including the amount of the Supplementary Estimate and the amount recovered from the Vote for Remuneration.</P>
      <P>Subheads A, B and C cover the administrative expenses of the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for subhead D covers purchases of sites and premises for various Government services including the acquisition of the fee simple of some existing leasehold properties. The subhead provides also for the purchase of land acquired for the National Monuments service and for National Parks and amenity areas.</P>
      <P>An important acquisition in the current year is the Kildare Street Club premises which are being bought by the Commissioners to relieve longstanding congestion in the National Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the National Monuments service, the purchase of 57 acres of land at Tara, which had been the subject of court and arbitration proceedings over a long period, has now been concluded.  The policy to which I referred last year, of creating national parks in a few areas, is being pursued to the limit dictated by the <Col N="1395" /> current financial position.  The creation of these parks while providing very attractive recreational facilities for visitors&mdash;home and foreign&mdash;will ensure that representative samples of our most important ecosystems and scenic areas will be conserved.</P>
    <P>Subhead E: The amount being provided here covers the cost of new and improved accommodation for various Government Departments and of improved facilities for the services which they administer, in addition to works in connection with our national parks, waterways and monuments and marine works.  A list of the works for which provision is made under this subhead has been supplied to Deputies.</P>
    <P>Before I refer to the more significant items included in the subhead I should say that the money which heretofore was provided in the Vote for Public Works and Buildings for the important service of building and improving primary schools will, in future, be borne on the Vote&mdash;No.  29&mdash;for Primary Education.  The actual building work will however, continue to be handled by the Office of Public Works as agents for the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Planning is proceeding for the installation of standby generators to provide emergency lighting for Leinster House and certain areas of the Government Buildings complex in the event of power failure.  It is expected that building work, preparatory to the installation of the generators, will commence later this year.</P>
    <P>Proposals to provide additional accommodation for the Houses and staff of the Oireachtas&mdash;items 2 (2)&mdash; are still under consideration.  The problem I may say is far from being a simple one.</P>
    <P>A total of £2,721,000 is provided for items 4-61 which fall under the heading of the Department of Finance.  A wide variety of works is covered.  The greater part of the estimate is for the provision of new offices and the fitting out of rented offices for Government staffs in Dublin and the provinces.</P>
    <P>The estimate also covers the completion of the printing building for <Col N="1396" /> the Ordnance Survey, adaptation of portion of the U.C.D. premises at Earlsfort Terrace for concert hall purposes, the restoration of Scoil Eanna Rathfarnham and the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, the provision of amenities and other development works at national parks, national monuments and inland waterways and marine works at Clare Island and Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    <P>The following is some additional information on specific items.</P>
    <P>Item 4 is for the fitting out, that is the provision of partitions, furniture, lighting fittings and so on, in rented offices, principally for the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Statistics Office and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Stamping Branch at Dublin Castle is now fully occupied.  The new building comprises a modern office block fronting on to the Lower Castle Yard with the Stamping Branch Security Printing works at the rear.  Much of the printing equipment was transferred from the former premises and, with the addition of new sophisticated equipment recently purchased, the branch has now one of the best equipped buildings of its kind in Europe.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that planning for the new Customs Road station at Monaghan was well advanced and that it was expected that the work of erection would commence during the latter part of 1974.  Delays were, however, encountered because of foundstion difficulties arising from the increasing weight of vehicles which will be using the site.  The problems have now been resolved and tenders have been invited.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for adaptation works in the south block of Government Buildings following the transfer of Department of Agriculture staff to the new office building in Kildare Place.  Tenders for this work have been sought and it is hoped that the bulk of it will be completed this year.</P>
    <P>Last year, I mentioned the general problem of office accommodation for Government staffs in Dublin and the commencement of a programme <Col N="1397" /> whereby the State would design and erect its own office buildings.  A considerable amount of planning has been done and tendering documents are now being prepared for a number of projects.  It is expected that construction work will commence this year on new buildings for the Geological Survey Office and the Meteorological Office.  A start will also be made on stage I of new headquarters for the Garda Síochána on a site adjoining the Depot in the Phoenix Park.  In addition, a new office building will be commenced at Earlsfort Terrace, and another at Shelbourne Road, part of which will meet urgent needs of the Veterinary College.  Plans for the reconstruction of Blocks 8-10 of Dublin Castle are well advanced and it is hoped that tenders will be invited later this year. The historical and architectural importance of this part of the Castle and the archaeological significance of the site will be taken fully into account in the proposed works.  The Commissioners are availing themselves of expertise available both inside and outside their own organisation to ensure that a careful reconstruction to the highest standard is carried out. Planning is proceeding for a new Garda Síochána metropolitan area headquarters at the Ship Street side of the Castle.</P>
    <P>The erection of a building for the processing and printing of ordance survey maps of various scales is at an advanced stage.  When completed, it will enable the Ordnance Survey Office to use the most modern techniques available for the preparation and printing of maps.</P>
    <P>Accommodation problems also exist in the provinces and these are now being tackled in a comprehensive way.  New offices at Drogheda and Letterkenny have been completed. Erection of a new office building is in progress in Roscommon and early developments are expected on the building of new offices at Mullingar. Planning for new office buildings at Navan, Waterford and Mallow has been put in hands and the needs of other provincial centres are being <Col N="1398" /> studied as part of the overall programme.</P>
    <P>Additional accommodation is being provided for the State Laboratory staff in part of the former St. Vincent's Hospital premises at Lower Lesson Street.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to the Government decision in May, 1974, provision is made to enable planning to proceed on the programme for the conversion of the Great Hall and ancillary areas at University College, Earlsfort Terrace, for use as a concert hall.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the continuing of the planning of stage II of the restoration of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.</P>
    <P>This is the only large building of the late 17th century in the country which survives complete and intact. Its restoration will be a large-scale operation which must be handled very carefully because of its unique historical and architectural importance.</P>
    <P>Consultants have prepared preliminary proposals.  These are being studied and it is hoped to proceed shortly with the more detailed work which will be needed to enable tenders to be invited.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to make a start this year on the internal rehabilitation of Scoil Éanna.  The preparation of the detailed specification necessary to enable tenders to be sought proved to be a time-consuming task.  I am afraid that the execution of the work itself will also prove tedious and painstaking with scope for the employment of only a limited number of highly skilled operatives.  The work will, in the event, have to be phased over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Items 32-39 accounting for a total estimate of £150,000, cover developments at our national parks both for the benefit of visitors and for better park administration.</P>
    <P>A sum of £30,000 is being allocated this year for improved sanitary services at Muckross House, Killarney. The work will be carried out in two stages.  The first stage, on which work is expected to commence in the next four months or <Col N="1399" /> so, will comprise the provision of a new water supply including the construction of a covered reservoir and provision of fire-fighting apparatus. The present water supply is unsatisfactory and there are no facilities for dealing with a serious outbreak of fire in the premises.  The destruction of Powerscourt House and other such fine buildings in recent times will have brought home to us once again the necessity for adequate fire precautions in the case of isolated buildings of this nature.</P>
    <P>The second stage of the improvement will, I hope, be commenced next year.  This will consist of a new treatment works for the sewage from Muckross House which at present has to discharge untreated into Muckross Lake. The present disposal system was designed to suit the use of the house as a private residence and is now totally unacceptable having regard to the number of people who visit the house annually.  As the house will in future function as a combined park visitor centre and folk museum, the number of visitors can be expected to rise steadily, making the installation of a satisfactory sewerage system a matter of urgent necessity from both amenity and environmental points of view.  The type of plant to be installed will be what is known as a &ldquo;tertiary&rdquo; treatment plant, that is, one adequate to deal effectively with the problem of nutrients such as phosphates and nitrates which, we are advised, lead to serious pollution in inland waters.</P>
    <P>The improvement scheme is being planned in consultation with, and with the co-operation of the Killarney Urban District Council.</P>
    <P>Items 34 to 36 provide for other improvements at the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park.  I spoke last year on the provision of public toilets and the construction of a new jaunting car road.  Work on these projects is continuing satisfactorily.  The new toilets at Torc should be completed this year.</P>
    <P>Good progress has been maintained on the work of restoring the picture gallery wing of Kilkenny Castle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> Serious defects, mainly caused by dry rot infestation, came to light during the contract involving considerable additional work and expense.  I am hopeful that this part of the castle will be opened to the public later in the year.  This will surely be good news for the many visitors to Kilkenny who are disappointed at not being able to gain admittance to the castle.  Consideration will then be given to the restoration of a further section of the castle.</P>
    <P>When introducing last year's Estimate, I informed the House that our proposals for a public golf course at Islandbridge in the Phoenix Park extension had run into difficulties because of road improvements planned for this area.  Since then further discussions have taken place with Dublin Corporation and, in the light of these discussions, our overall scheme for the development of these lands needs to be re-examined.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that my office had joined with Bord Fáilte in commissioning a comprehensive study of the River Shannon to assess its potential for recreational and tourist development purposes.  From preliminary reports received, the indications are that this study will prove invaluable in planning the long-term development and use of the waterway and adjoining areas.  Development works planned for the coming year include major works at Hudsons Bay, Mountshannon and Rossmore.</P>
    <P>It is also hoped to commence work on a new harbour at Portumna to provide easier and better access from the river to the town, the nearby national monuments, and the forest park which is being developed by the Forest and Wildlife Service of the Department of Lands.  I might mention here that, to the extent to which it is possible for them, the local authority are co-operating fully in this project.</P>
    <P>Provision is made again for some new works at certain national monuments; some of these are nearing completion, others are at the planning stage only.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the visitors' centre at Dunmore cave, County <Col N="1401" /> Kilkenny, is due to be completed very soon.  Considerable works, including the installation of electric light, have also been carried out within the cave to make it more readily accessible for visitors.</P>
    <P>An unusual project jointly sponsored by Bord Fáilte and the Office of Public Works is planned for Cahir Castle, County Tipperary as a contribution to European Architectural Heritage Year 1975.  It is proposed to provide at Cahir Castle an exhibition centre devoted to the cultural and physical heritage of our people, with special emphasis, especially during European Architectural Year, on its architectural and archaeological aspects.  Heating and lighting will be installed and static displays and film and slide shows with modern equipment will be provided.  The aim is to give visitors, both Irish and foreign, a better understanding and deeper appreciation of the wealth there is in our heritage.  Cahir Castle is one of our more impressive monuments and, as it is strategically situated in a tourist area and on a main tourist route, it is eminently suited for the use proposed. Further, the project is fully in accord with one of the main aims of European Architectural Heritage Year, that is, finding an appropriate use for ancient buildings.</P>
    <P>The Visitors centre at the Rock of Cashel is also expected to be completed this year.  This is another of the Office of Public Works projects for European Architectural Heritage Year, 1975.</P>
    <P>Items 54-57 are for the provision of improved accommodation for depots for the servicing of national monuments in some districts.</P>
    <P>Yet another project planned for European Architectural Heritage Year 1975 is the restoration of the Casino at Marino.  This building was erected by the first Earl of Charlemont in the 18th century to serve as a sort of summerhouse in the grounds of his out-of-town residence, Marino House&mdash;the area now called Marino being, at that time, in the country outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>It was designed by Sir William <Col N="1402" /> Chambers and is regarded as possibly the greatest gem of eighteenth century architecture in these islands.</P>
    <P>The structure has up to this been reasonably well preserved but the interior in particular is now in need of major works, including the provision of caretaker's quarters and the installation of heating and lighting.</P>
    <P>Item 59 is for the continuation of a scheme to improve landing facilities at Clare Island, County Mayo in the interests of transport and communication. The improvements involve widening the pier, raising the level of its deck, providing a sloping quay, a crane, a winch and a boat cradle.  The scheme has unfortunately suffered delay because of a contractual dispute, but arrangements are being made to enable the work to proceed this year.</P>
    <P>Item 60 is for the removal of a part of the structure which was erected in 1965 at the East Pier, Dun Laoghaire, to serve as a temporary car ferry terminal pending construction of the permanent terminal at St. Michael's Wharf.  The removal will be done in the course of the alterations to the mail boat pier covered by the next item.</P>
    <P>British Rail propose to operate their services at Dun Laoghaire Harbour, with ships having accommodation for passengers with or without cars.  This requires the erection of a ramp at the mail boat pier to unload the cars and the construction of a causeway connecting this pier with the car ferry terminal at St. Michael's Wharf.  These works are now well advanced.</P>
    <P>Planning for stage II of the building to provide office accommodation for staff associated with the computer division of the Department of the Public Service is progressing rapidly and it is hoped to commence construction before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Planning for the new Training Centre for the Institute of Public Administration and for the Department of the Public Service has reached an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>Apart from the sums included under <Col N="1403" /> item 17 for Garda Headquarters and Garda Metropolitan Area Headquarters, £808,000 is provided for works for the Department of Justice.  The main allocation is for the erection of new Garda stations, the improvement of existing stations and the provision of improved facilities for the gardaí generally.  Provision is also made for improved accommodation for the Film Censor's Office and for the erection of new courts in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Improvement works at the Garda Technical Bureau, and the provision of improved accommodation for the Commissioner's staff, are completed, except for some minor items which are being attended to.</P>
    <P>Improved accommodation is needed for the Garda Band.  A contract will be placed shortly and it is expected that the work will be completed this year.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to extend the transport garage in the Garda Depot in order to cater for the increasing volume of transport.</P>
    <P>The programme for the erection of new Garda stations and the improvement of existing stations has been speeded up considerably and I have every hope that it will be possible to accelerate the pace further over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Work is progressing at 22 centres and contracts have been placed recently at five others.  Planning is well advanced at a further 20 centres and is proceeding in all cases where sites have been acquired and future requirements have been determined.</P>
    <P>Work on the new divisional headquarters in Limerick city is well under way and considerable progress is expected this year.  The building, which is on the site of the former St. Munchin's College, will accommodate over 120 personnel.  Work is also proceeding on a new district headquarters and two houses at Ballyshannon.  Planning for a new divisional headquarters at Monaghan on the site of the existing obsolete station is well advanced.  This is a spacious site and the Garda personnel will continue to occupy the existing station while the erection of the new station is in progress.  All the <Col N="1404" /> new stations are being designed to provide full and adequate facilities for Garda personnel and for the public and to provide the gardaí with modern standards of accommodation.</P>
    <P>The erection of temporary court accommodation has been held up by reason of site difficulties.  It is hoped that these difficulties will be resolved this year.</P>
    <P>The planning of new permanent court building is a complex task but it is expected that definite progress will be made on it in the next year.</P>
    <P>Work is in progress on the erection of new office buildings to house some sections of the Department of Education at Athlone.  The work is expected to be completed in 1976.</P>
    <P>A scheme is being designed to rewire the National Museum buildings so as to provide improved lighting.  It is intended to put the work in hand this year.</P>
    <P>The new office buildings at Castlebar are making satisfactory progress. The buildings are shaping up nicely and on completion, which is expected to be towards the end of this year, they will be a pleasant feature of the area.</P>
    <P>Planning is proceeding for a new building at Furbo, County Galway, for the Department of the Gaeltacht. It is expected that tenders will be invited inside a few months and that work will be commenced in the latter half of this year.</P>
    <P>We now come to works for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for which a total of £615,000 has been provided.</P>
    <P>The items include alterations and additions to buildings at various agricultural centres, new accommodation for the scientific and research staff of the Fisheries Division at Abbotstown, research facilities at Thorndale, new offices at Carlow and Raphoe for the district veterinary staff, a cattle quarantine station at a location to be decided, the completion of the fitting out of the new office block at Kildare Place and the extension of the fishery research station at Dunmore East.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> The following is some additional information on particular items.</P>
    <P>Preliminary planning has begun for the provision of improved accommodation at the Botanic Gardens. The buildings, which will include a new herbarium, will provide better research facilities for students and as well an amenity of an educational nature for the general public.</P>
    <P>Item 85 represents the final payment for the erection in Limerick of the last of a group of regional veterinary research and dairy produce laboratories.  Laboratories at Athlone, Cork, Kilkenny and Sligo were provided in previous years.</P>
    <P>Planning is proceeding for the erection at Abbotstown of accommodation including laboratories and office space for the scientific and research staff of the Fisheries Division.</P>
    <P>Planning is also proceeding for the erection at Thorndale of a new building to house the butter and seed testing stations as the present accommodation and facilities are unsatisfactory and inadequate.</P>
    <P>Improvements to existing research facilities at Thorndale are also in train.</P>
    <P>A new office building for the district veterinary staff has been completed at Carlow and planning is in progress for a new one at Raphoe.</P>
    <P>The improvement of the sewage disposal arrangements and of the water supply at Ballyhaise College, County Cavan is planned.  The erection of improved accommodation for the college is also being investigated.</P>
    <P>The fitting out of the new headquarters for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in Kildare Street is virtually completed and the Department has already been able to house practically all its staff under the one roof.</P>
    <P>An enlargement of the fishery research station at Dunmore East fishery harbour centre is required to cater for the expected expansion of the station's activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> A new training school and synoptic reporting station for the meteorological service of the Department of Transport and Power is to be built at Galway.</P>
    <P>A sum of £378,000 is required for works for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  A new post office at Dungarvan has been completed while new post offices at Listowel and Donegal are in course of erection as are extensions to Phibsboro and Letterkenny post offices.  Planning for new post offices at Clonmel, Longford, Mullingar and Tipperary is well advanced and modernisation schemes are planned for the post offices at Ballyhaunis, Cobh, Enniscorthy, Limerick and Thurles.  The erection of a new sorting office at Baldoyle is in progress and new sorting offices at Fairview, Dublin and Glasheen, Cork are under consideration. A computer centre at Dundrum, County Dublin has been completed and a new philatelic sales office in the GPO Arcade is nearing completion.  The installation of a ventilation system in the central sorting office and of a sprinkler system at St. John's Road depot are progressing.</P>
    <P>In addition to the works covered by this Estimate, the Office of Public Works will carry out for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs works in connection with the telephone services estimated to cost £1,600,000 which will be met from the telephone capital account.</P>
    <P>The sum of £395,000 provided for works for the Department of Foreign Affairs covers expenditure in connection with the provision of conference facilities in Dublin for meetings of the Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers of the EEC and so forth, the fitting out of Embassy buildings abroad and improvements to existing Embassy premises.  Work on the fitting out of offices and of the ambassadors' residential accommodation at Tokyo and Luxembourg is complete.  Work on and furnishing of the staff's accommodation and the combined chancery and residence at Moscow are nearing completion and this year the fitting <Col N="1407" /> out of office premises at Vienna and Beirut is being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The work in connection with the accommodation for the EEC meetings in Dublin this year comprised provision of conference furniture and translation facilities at Iveagh House and at the State Apartments, Dublin Castle and the adaptation of and fitting out in the Castle area of ancillary office and press accommodation and the provision of the requisite facilities and services.</P>
    <P>It was found possible with very careful planning to meet in the State Apartments the EEC requirements in a very satisfactory manner, while at the same time ensuring the availability of the apartments for other Government functions.  I have been very gratified by the expressions of appreciation by the visiting statesmen and others of the arrangements for the meeting of the heads of government in March.  I acknowledge with thanks the many messages of congratulation received which were much appreciated by the Commissioners of Public Works and their staffs.  I also convey my sincere thanks to those in the public and private sector who were involved with them in the arrangements for the meeting.</P>
    <P>The amount provided under subhead F1 is £3,465,000, about two-thirds of which is required for normal day-to-day maintenance of Government offices, post office buildings, Garda Síochána stations, employment exchanges, social welfare offices and agricultural institutions.  The rest is for maintenance of this country's diplomatic missions abroad (about £115,000), of the three State harbours at Dún Laoghaire, Howth and Dunmore East (about £300,000), of the various national parks (about £640,000) and the River Shannon Navigation (about £150,000).</P>
    <P>The latter figure includes one item which I would like to mention.  In response to representations from local and tourist interests it is proposed to restore navigation on the old Lough Allen Canal between the Shannon and Acres Lough near Drumshanbo.  The <Col N="1408" /> work has commenced and it is expected to be completed in two to three years.</P>
    <P>Subhead F2 provides for the supply of replacement furniture and of additional items required for existing State buildings.</P>
    <P>Subhead F3, which provides for rents, shows an increased rate of expenditure over that of the previous period arising out of the leasing of new premises to accommodate additional staffs as well as to replace old premises which had become unsuitable or inadequate and for our diplomatic missions abroad.</P>
    <P>Subhead F4 bears the cost of fuel and light for government offices.  Increases in the cost of these commodities during the past year together with the demand for higher standards in new and existing accommodation, account for the substantial increase in the provision needed under this subhead.</P>
    <P>Again the greater part of subhead F5 will be expended on the former British Embassy premises at Merrion Square which have been acquired by the Electricity Supply Board.  The work, which is being carried out by the Electricity Supply Board on behalf of the Office of Public Works, is now virtually completed.  A smaller part of the provision is required for repairs to the French Government property at Kildare Street which was damaged by the explosion at South Leinster Street in May, 1974.</P>
    <P>The G subheads provide for expenditure in connection with the arterial drainage programme which is being carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
    <P>Subhead G1 provides for the carrying out of certain hydrometric studies and of comprehensive drainage surveys which are a necessary preliminary of arterial drainage schemes.  For this £70,000 is provided which represents an increase of over 20 per cent on the expenditure on this subhead in 1974. As in the case of previous years, most of the provision of £70,000 for 1975 is needed to continue hydrometric <Col N="1409" /> investigations.  The amount included in this subhead for catchment surveys is £2,000.  In this connection I might point out that the bulk of the provision for such surveys is included in subheads A and B.</P>
    <P>Last year reference was made in the context of subhead G1 to the cost/ benefit analysis.  The prototype study undertaken in respect of proposals for the Maigue catchment has been completed and has indicated a very favourable overall benefit/cost ratio in the case of the exhibited scheme which, in fact, is now in progress.  The further study, of proposals for the Corrib/ Mask/Robe area, is well advanced and will, all going well, be completed this summer.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, it is intended that all future proposed drainage schemes will be subjected at the appropriate stage of their development to cost/benefit analysis to determine their value as capital investments.  Each study will of course be valid only for the scheme under investigation.  The initial findings tend to favour arterial drainage but there may be cases of schemes which will be found not to be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Subhead G2 provides for expenditure on drainage works in progress.  A sum of £1,720,000 has been provided this year, an increase of over 25 per cent on expenditure in 1974.  This sum provides for the continuation of works on the Boyne scheme and also for the expansion of the programme of works on the Maigue scheme.</P>
    <P>Subhead G3 provides for the maintenance of completed schemes and embankment works.  A sum of £880,000 has been provided for 1975, an increase of almost 20 per cent on last year's expenditure.  The increase in expenditure under this heading reflects increases in wages and other costs.  The cost of the work is recoverable from the county councils and is brought to credit as an appropriation-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Subhead H covers the purchase and maintenance of engineering plant and machinery, the purchase of stores, and the payment of wages to the workshop staffs.  The provision covers not only increases since April, 1974, in wage <Col N="1410" /> rates and material costs, but also a larger volume of purchases of plant and machinery, mainly for arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>Subhead I bears the cost of the construction and maintenance of coast protection works.  The maintenance costs are repaid by the county councils involved, and the repayments are taken in as appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Six schemes are at present being maintained.  The subhead provides for an outlay of £33,000 on this service. The balance of the provision is required for prospective outlay on a new scheme at Enniscrone, County Sligo, which the county council have currently on exhibition, and also for the contingency of expenditure on proposals, of which preliminary examination has been made, for works at Ballyvoile, County Waterford and the Maharees, County Kerry.</P>
    <P>Subhead J1 is the subhead under which provision is made for the preservation and presentation of national monuments in State care, for archaeological excavations and for some of the expenses of the archaeological survey. The purpose of the survey is to record all the monuments in the country and its importance cannot be over-emphasised. It will continue in counties Cavan, Longford and Westmeath this year.  As I pointed out last year archaeological monuments are, in Ireland, virtually the sole source of information of past ages for the social historian. Once destroyed they cannot be replaced. Last year excavations financed from this subhead were undertaken at 22 sites.</P>
    <P>Conservation of monuments in the care of the Commissioners is also a continuing process.  Last year works were completed at, <i>inter alia,</i> Rathfran Abbey and Turlough Round Tower and Church, in County Mayo; at Fenagh Churches in County Leitrim, at Aughanure Castle and Clontuskert Abbey, in County Galway. This year conservation works will be continued at Portumna Castle, County Galway, Kells Priory, County Kilkenny, Charles Fort, Cork, Trim Castle, County Meath, Inishmurray, County Sligo, Kilcooly Abbey, <Col N="1411" /> County Tipperary, Ross Castle, Killarney and Donegal Abbey, among others.  Work will also continue at Newgrange Tumulus and Knowth Tumulus, County Meath.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to express my appreciation to the National Monuments Advisory Council and the Royal Irish Academy for their advice and assistance in the administration of this service.  While opinions sometimes differ on details, our objectives are overall the same, that is, to select the right priorities from an extensive range of options and to ensure that the available resources are used to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>Subhead J2 is the special subhead out of which the grant-in-aid towards the initial cost of the restoration of Holycross Abbey, County Tipperary, is provided.  The project is one of Ireland's two national projects for European Architectural Heritage Year and is due for completion this year.  The cost of the actual restoration work is being refunded by the diocesan authorities, the cost of preservation of the fabric of the monuments only being a final charge on State funds.</P>
    <P>Including works the cost of which is not being met from this Vote, namely, schools, telephone exchanges, prison buildings and the construction and improvement of harbour works for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and Roinn na Gaeltachta, the total gross expenditure for which the Office of Public Works will be responsible this year will exceed £35,000,000.  This expenditure of course, has a very large employment content and it is I may say a proof of the Government's intent to do all they can to promote employment.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in my statement with some of the more interesting of the varied and far-reaching activities of the Office of Public Works.  I now look forward to the Deputies' comments and, in my reply, I will do my best to deal with any queries they may have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> As long as I have been a <Col N="1412" /> Member of this House this has been an Estimate keenly debated.  I can see the reason for that because the Board of Works undoubtedly play a major part in every constituency.  As the debate continues Deputies will be relating their knowledge and experience to the problems within their constituencies. This Estimate covers both urban and rural problems.  Therefore, if any comments I make here seem to be somewhat urbanised, the House may be assured that I appreciate fully the problems prevailing also in the country.  But rural Deputies will be in a position to put forward their points of view in a forceful way.</P>
      <P>Before going into the various subheads of the Estimate, I should like to consider the overall policy of the Vote for the Board of Works this year. This is a token Vote to afford an opportunity to debate this Estimate.  Since I became Opposition spokesman on the Office of Public Works, I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his courtesy and to assure him that any criticism I may voice on this Estimate will not be directed at him.  Perhaps such remarks should be directed to other Government Departments. Nevertheless, the Parliamentary Secretary is the man commissioned to carry out these types of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vote is for £18,235,000 and the Parliamentary Secretary has said that this is an increase of 25 per cent over last year's Estimate.  I wonder on what wage agreement is that figure based? I presume that figure of £18,235,000 must keep the Office of Public Works going until 31st December, 1975.  I presume also that that figure was estimated on the basis of the 1974 National Wage Agreement.  Part of the 1975 one which is coming into being now will have to be met also and will automatically show a deficiency.  I very much doubt if the increase granted on this Vote will carry out the same amount of work as last year.  We know that an increase of 25 per cent has already been sanctioned on wages and salaries.  When one takes into account also the price of various building commodities, the cost of drainage and various other works throughout the country, I very much doubt if the Parliamentary <Col N="1413" /> Secretary will find himself at the end of this year having completed the same amount of work as last year, even with the increased amount of money granted.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary maintained, in his closing remarks, that the Office of Public Works had a high employment content.  I believe it has but that it has potential for even more.  I was hoping to see some positive move being taken now to increase his Vote in an effort to absorb some of our unemployed. But it is obvious that the Government have barely allocated an increase to cover the increased costs since last year.  They have taken no positive steps to expand this Office, for it is in this Department and others, such as Local Government, that we have an employment content. There are many undertakings throughout the country which could be expanded to generate more employment if the Government would only formulate a proper policy.  And this is the time to do so. We know there are schools throughout the country in dire need of attention; we know also that there are police stations requiring attention, as there are also arterial drainage, coast erosion, harbour maintenance and such works.  Those are the types of projects which should be undertaken by the Office of Public Works during this and coming years. If such schemes were implemented it would diversify employment throughout the country and not confine it to Dublin only.  There are harbours in the west, arterial drainage in other parts; schools to be built; Garda stations to be repaired and, if all these works were attended to, the Office of Public Works would be contributing in a very real way to solving the unemployment problem today.  Evidently they have seen fit to remain static; they appear to have decided that there will be no further development than that which took place last year.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Minister for Finance, might see his way, at some time during the year, to adopt such a <Col N="1414" /> policy.  Unless certain Departments such as the Office of Public Works undertake schemes in an endeavour to solve the serious situation obtaining, then I hold out no hope of taking people off the unemployment list.  I shall not involve the Parliamentary Secretary in a drawn-out type of debate but it is his duty, in the Office of Public Works, to create employment.  There is no use in saying it is the fault of the private sector.  On this Vote for the Office of Public Works a real opportunity is afforded us to do something to relieve the disastrous situation in which we find ourselves.  I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary; I blame the Minister for Finance and the Government for not allocating sufficient funds with which to carry out the work already existent.  Were such works undertaken, at least we would be contributing in some small way to easing the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I remember the Parliamentary Secretary speaking about the staffing situation of the Office of Public Works.  I know he answered a question some time ago in this House saying that there was a shortage of engineers, architects and surveyors within his Department.  I believe that position obtains still with regard to such personnel.  It is regrettable that that should be so but I can see the reason for it.  If one is to recruit sufficient personnel of that nature, one must compete, with regard to remuneration, with the private sector. It is no good saying that this is laid down in regulations for certain grades.  In the long run this may not be good enough.  The Office of Public Works must have highly qualified personnel. If they want to attract more young people, they will have to compete with the private sector.  It is important that the personnel of the Office of Public Works be as highly skilled as those in outside employment. They are responsible for major schemes throughout the country, such as harbours, arterial drainage, coast erosion and so on.  This is highly skilled work which can only be successfully carried out by highly skilled people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> I will now look at the various subheads and will start with Leinster House.  Over the years there has been much criticism about the interview room.  Before this room was changed we had cubicles which may not have looked very presentable but at least we had privacy when interviewing constituents.  As many Dublin Deputies will tell you, the only place we can meet our constituents is in Leinster House.  It can be embarrassing for members of the three political parties who may have to interview constituents at the same time. A week ago I interviewed a person and the following week I saw that same person being interviewed by a Deputy of another political party. That caused embarrassment all round. This type of situation is occurring all the time.</P>
    <P>The tables are quite near and it is impossible to discuss anything in confidence. I am not sure if that room was designed specifically for that purpose. It may be difficult to provide cubicles now, and they may take from the appearance of the room, but perhaps another place could be provided for this purpose.  I would appreciate a little more privacy when interviewing my constituents than I have at the moment.  In my opinion that room was suitable for only one purpose&mdash;a drawingroom.</P>
    <P>Last year some Deputy thought that lights should be suspended from the ceiling in the Oireachtas Library. Other Deputies took the opposite view.  I would not like to see lights suspended from the ceiling because it would take from the character and dignity of the room.  At the moment the room has a certain elegance.  If the lighting could be improved while maintaining their present position that would be a much nicer job.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned additional accommodation for the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He does not specifically state what he has in mind, but any additional accommodation for the staff will be very welcome.  They have to spend very long hours in this <Col N="1416" /> House and so require proper facilities. I hope during the year this additional accommodation will be available.</P>
    <P>I do not like the decor in the restaurant in Leinster House.  It has a canteen atmosphere.  It lacks a diningroom atmosphere.  I do not like the way it is painted.  Perhaps a velvet paper would add character to the room.  If I were planning a lounge or a diningroom it would not look like the restaurant.  It is not a place to which one would like to bring one's guests.  I am casting no disparagement on the staff of the Oireachtas restaurant by my next remarks.  The general appearance could be improved. I cannot put my finger on exactly why it does not look like a diningroom.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might look into this.  I realise that these are only very small matters but in my opinion they deserve attention.</P>
    <P>During the past week I noticed a very large number of school children visiting the House.  I am not sure if this would fall within the ambit of the Office of Public Works, but would it be possible to have leaflets printed giving the history of the Houses and the nature of the business carried on here?  I am sure it would cost very little.  Each child could be given a copy of this leaflet to take it home and not alone would they find it interesting but they would have a souvenir of their visit.  It might also give then an interest in the democratic institutions of the State.  It was mentioned last year that the names of our patriots should be put on the pictures in the hall.  Many visitors are not aware of the names of these men.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said a stand-by generator is to be installed.  I am glad of this because of the experiences we have had in the past two years with strikes of various descriptions.  I am sorry to say the bar in Leinster House has been badly planned.  There is very little room and we know the chaos that has prevailed there on certain occasions, particularly during budget days.  It was architecturally badly designed originally.  I understand <Col N="1417" /> it is possible to extend it into the Press diningroom but that would not have been necessary if it had been properly designed in the beginning.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about Government offices and Government policy in regard to the direct building of such offices.  The day before yesterday I got a reply to a parliamentary question stating that Government rental for office accommodation is running at a figure of £2.215 million. Before we involve ourselves in a policy of Government office building we must get our priorities right: we must have a decision on the amount of decentralisation of Government Departments that will be decided on.  I have no great objection to the renting of Government offices at the moment because when the lease expires they can always be vacated and, as I have said, before we embark on a major building programme in this respect we must have a decision on decentralisation.</P>
    <P>One thing that strikes me is the possibility of Army barracks in Dublin being used for Government office accommodation.  I have in mind particularly two such barracks in my constituency, Cathal Brugha and Clancy. There are large areas of land attached to each.  Cathal Brugha Barracks stands on between 30 and 40 acres.  I understand that there is a policy of centralisation in regard to the Army and such barracks would provide ample accommodation for Government staffs.  It is very important that staffs of Departments would be housed together to make for easy communication instead of being scattered throughout the city.</P>
    <P>I wonder what it is intended to do with the old offices of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  We now have a new building in Kildare Street and I have been told the old offices are being renovated.  What use will be made of them?  I also understand that the Kildare Street Club has been acquired and that it will provide extra accommodation for the National Library.  The acquisition of the Kildare Street Club, one of the finest sites in Dublin, was an excellent decision.  I hope good use will be made of it because <Col N="1418" /> I have had continuous complaints from visitors to the National Library about the accommodation there.  Their collection of maps had to be transferred to Earlsfort Terrace.  It is a very valuable collection which could not be properly preserved in the National Library and would have been lost to future generations.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned Dublin Castle and its accommodation for EEC meetings.  We can be proud we have such a place in which to accommodate visiting heads of State.  In passing, I wonder if each country in the EEC has to meet the expense of such meetings or if the money can be recouped from a special fund.  I suppose the valuable furniture that is being used during our EEC Presidency will be stored for future such occasions.  It is a pity that more people are not aware that we have such a fine building.  Even Dublin people very seldom visit it.</P>
    <P>Many of our public buildings in the city are not properly signposted.  This is part of tourism and although it is not the responsibility of the Board of Works they can play an important part in it.  Anyone who travels abroad knows only too well that one always gravitates to the historical part of the city.  This is what tourism is all about. I doubt if we are doing as good a job as we should in showing people abroad that we have historical monuments, buildings of all descriptions, which are of great interest.  There is a book published monthly which is called <i>Heritage</i> in which you will find the great historical building throughout the world publicised.  I have only glanced through it, but I wondered if any of the public buildings in Ireland were included in that book in this heritage year.</P>
    <P>I have been told in my constituency that at a meeting held recently it emerged that there is no room for some of the historical finds that have been excavated in Wood Quay in my constituency.  There was an exhibition recently in The Liberties of some of the most interesting finds that were made there.  I am told that there is no room in the museum to house them or display them to the public.  This is <Col N="1419" /> a rather sad state of affairs, which cannot be rectified overnight.  This is part of our historical background.  The finds from the excavations date back to the eighth or ninth century.  It was the local people who created an awareness of the historical importance of that part of the city.  I can stretch my mind back to seven or eight years ago when bulldozers from Dublin Corporation were about to demolish the Tailors' Hall.  Were it not for the action of public-spirited people at that time, instead of the Tailors' Hall standing there, there would be a roadway running right through the site. The Tailors' Hall is a tourist attraction. Medieval banquets are held there similar to those in Bunratty and other parts of the country.  This was an effort by public-spirited people to preserve an ancient building where some of our patriots met at one time.</P>
    <P>In mentioning the Tailors' Hall, I do not want to go outside the ambit of the debate, but this is the type of thing we must preserve for future generations.  We are only custodians of them for future generations.  The same type of excavation, I am told, can and should be carried out within the precincts of Dublin Castle.  The experts tell me that right outside the walls in an old premises belonging to Dockrells, most valuable excavations will take place very shortly.  This is not far from Dublin Castle, so any development within the castle itself will have to be carefully researched with this in view. I do not know what archaeologists are in the Office of Public Works but I wonder are any of the personnel of that office engaged in the excavations at Wood Quay.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham, which the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned in his brief.  As the Parliamentary Secretary says, this is one of the finest and oldest historical buildings in Dublin.  I know it is a difficult and delicate job to reconstruct it.  I hope as time goes on it will be laid out as one of our great show places in Dublin.  Whether it will be a museum or what it will be utilised <Col N="1420" /> for I do not know, but it is building that must be preserved.  We have lost many of these in the past but if we lose this one we will never be forgiven. I know the Parliamentary Secretary is keenly interested in it and I hope it will be brought into public view in the very near future.  Very few people in Dublin have seen the inside of the Royal Hospital or have any knowledge of what it contains.</P>
    <P>I asked the Parliamentary Secretary some time ago about the grounds surrounding the Royal Kilmainham Hospital. In the constituency I represent, Dublin Central, if there is one commodity that is scarce it is open space. Probably the only space we have in our new constituency is St. Stephen's Green, and that is at quite a distance from the part of the constituency I am speaking about.  I believe there is a considerable area of ground attached to this hospital.  It is surrounded by a densely populated area.  There are many children there who have no recreational facilities.  I appreciate that due to the condition of the Royal Hospital, it is not possible to do anything at present, but in the overall development I would hope that at least some of the area would be laid out as a park.  I am not visualising that it could ever be like St. Stephen's Green, but it could be laid out attractively with playing facilities, not perhaps for older children but for young children where their mothers could take them in the afternoon.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider what developments he can effect there, and I should like to know when he expects the Royal Hospital to be completed.</P>
    <P>There was a very pleasant function four or five years ago with the transfer of St. Enda's in Rathfarmham to the Office of Public Works.  It was in a dilapidated state at that time, but provision was to be made, and I believe was made, as regards renovations which are to be carried out. This is one of our great historical buildings which is associated with the Pearse family and was very kindly given to the State.  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that certain phases of the development have been carried out.  It is a slow job, and I <Col N="1421" /> should like to know what progress he intends to make during this coming year.</P>
    <P>If there is one thing we must protect in this city and throughout the country it is open space and parks. We here in Dublin have one of the finest parks in the world and I doubt very much if we appreciate it.  We may not appreciate it because it is on our doorstep but we must make sure that it is preserved from any encroachment from the type of development that has been taking place for some years past&mdash;excessive traffic.  Eight or ten years ago the Phoenix Park was a restful place but it has been turned into a highway and is like one of the main roads to and from the city.  This takes away from the attraction of the park which should be a place where people could enjoy leisure hours.  At weekends it is not unusual to see cars parked on the grass and even on playing pitches.  This is most undesirable and will have to be eliminated. There should be more car parking facilities in the Phoenix Park where there are few if any such facilities and it is hard to criticise anybody for driving on the grass when there is no car park.  More car parks should be provided within the Phoenix Park so as to ensure that the grass is not abused.</P>
    <P>I believe the Dublin Zoo would be glad to get additional accommodation. Even though some may not agree I think the zoo should be facilitated in this respect.  There is scarcely a family in Dublin that does not bring the children to the zoo.  I have been there recently on First Holy Communion days and I know how packed it can be, especially during April and May.  It is very overcrowded and apart from visiting the various exhibits, which are most attractive and numerous, there are few facilities for children there.  They lack open space.  A further seven or eight acres would be a great addition and a considerable help to the zoo.  I do not know if they have applied to the Board of Works but if they have their case should be seriously considered. The Phoenix Park must be <Col N="1422" /> preserved but the zoo is part of it and any addition that could be given should be given.</P>
    <P>I am most disappointed that no real development seems to have taken place in regard to the golf course in which I have taken a keen interest for many years.  I understand there are problems as regards Dublin Corporation and road planning.  People who are members of golf clubs are not concerned about a municipal course but the average person cannot afford to join a golf club and would like to play golf on a municipal course.  The cost of club membership at present is prohibitive for the average person as golf club members realise.  I should like to know if it is the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary to proceed with the 18-hole course or will he be compelled to reduce it to nine holes.  Many people in Clondalkin, Ballyfermot and Crumlin would enjoy a cheap game of golf but cannot get into a Dublin golf club &mdash;even with money.  It was thought once that golf was a snobs' game; this is not true; anybody who has spent time in Scotland knows that children from five years up are playing golf and there are public courses in practically every village.  This is a type of outdoor recreation we must encourage but people have no opportunity of participating in it at present</P>
    <P>I must congratulate the Board of Works on the excellent condition in which St. Stephen's Green is being maintained.  This is an oasis in the city and whenever I have an opportunity of going there from this House I like to spend a few minutes there.  It is kept in excellent condition and is a credit to the Board of Works especially when one considers the astronomic number of people and children who use it daily. It is not easy to achieve such a high standard of cleanliness in such conditions.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned to me recently that in the Memorial Gardens in Parnell Square the ponds were rather dirty.  I wonder how often they are cleaned.  Again, with the presence of large numbers of children and some trees these pools can easily become dirty and this can be more apparent, perhaps, in Parnell Square where there is so much concrete.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> I see that the Minister has purchased 67 acres of open space at Tara and this is an excellent idea.  I do not know the site but any facilities for parks throughout the country are very welcome.  During the Cork by-election there was talk about an estate in Doneraile; it was rumoured that it would be taken over by the Board of Works.  Did that project ever develop? Parks are a wonderful asset to any town or community and the only drawback is that they are not sufficiently utilised.  I should like to see greater use made of the Phoenix Park but there is a problem where Dublin people are concerned.  It can be quite expensive to get from South Circular Road to the Phoenix Park, for instance, for a man with a wife and four or five children as it might involve coming into town and taking a bus out again.  It might be possible in conjunction with CIE to arrange to reroute buses at weekends to provide a better service to the Phoenix Park.  Children are home from school at weekends.  Nothing is as pathetic as to see young children playing around concrete blocks of flats on beautiful summer days, as I have seen them on many occasions.  Perhaps some such scheme could be worked out with CIE so that they might direct part of their public transport towards the Phoenix Park on Sundays.  The regular services are not adequate for the many people who wish to visit the park at weekends.</P>
    <P>On the question of open spaces, much more could be done in the way of amenities in the Dublin mountains. One of the great attractions of this city is its proximity to the mountains but in their present state they are not suitable for rambles by young children.  A national park under the control of the Office of Public Works would be a tremendous amenity in this area.  There are some walks through the forests but these are limited.  I am not sure whether it is possible for the Office of Public Works to acquire control of some part of the mountain area but every effort should be made to preserve the existing amenities and develop others.  It is my hope that in the not too distant future the mountain areas around Dublin can <Col N="1424" /> be developed to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>I know that the Parliamentary Secretary concerns himself with the development of landing slips and harbours around our coasts.  Harbours play a big part in our commercial development. Some of them are under the control of the Department of Transport and Power while others are within the control either of the Office of Public Works or of county councils and some, I understand, are in private hands.  This fragmentation of power is not helpful and every effort should be made to co-ordinate responsibility in this sphere. There is this fragmentation, too, in other aspects of Government but it should be left to the Office of Public Works or to some semi-State body to control the entire development of our harbours.</P>
    <P>During the by-election in Galway West I became more aware than ever before of the importance of harbour development in places such as Cleggan and Roundstone.  If we are to develop industry in the west and if we are to encourage people to remain at home we must attach great importance to the development of harbours and landing slips.  This development, too, is of vital importance to the fishing industry. Without it we cannot hope to develop this industry to its full potential.  I do not visualise major industries for places such as Cashel and Roundstone but we should exploit whatever resources are there.</P>
    <P>During the by-election campaign I had occasion to travel to Boffin Island. I had often heard of how pleasant can be a trip to this island but I expect that the people who told me this had visited it in fine weather.  When I went there the weather was cold and wet and I had to travel from Cleggan in an open boat.  This did not make for a very pleasant journey but I expected that at least there would be a landing slip on the island.  However, to my consternation we had to change to a small rowing boat in an effort to get on to the beach.  The Office of Public Works have rejected this island by failing to provide a landing slip there. On the boat with me that evening were the local priest and some other people <Col N="1425" /> who had been to Cleggan or Clifden to buy groceries.  I remained on the island overnight and enjoyed myself but I realised the hardship caused to the people by the absence of landing facilities. I expect that there is a lack of such facilities, too, on other islands around the coast.  This is a matter to which the Parliamentary Secretary should direct his attention.  There is no better way of finding out people's problems than by campaigning in their area.  The people of Boffin deserve much credit for remaining on their island.  They lack many of the amenities that most of us take for granted.</P>
    <P>Another matter that was mentioned to me during my visit to Boffin was the question of coast erosion.  They referred to the east coast but I expect that they have made representations since then to their local representatives in this regard.  If effective steps are not taken soon to deal with the problem the road will have to be replaced at what would be much greater cost than if it were dealt with now.  I am not an expert on this work, but listening to the locals who have lived on the island all their lives, one can take it that they know what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>Harbours will in the future play an important and vital part in our economic life and will also constitute a potential for tourism&mdash;good boating and other such facilities.  We need to develop this type of tourist trade because we do not think in terms alone of lying on beaches.  All these facilities will have to be made available to our tourists if we are to encourage them to come here in greater numbers, and what we lack in sunshine will have to be made up by the provision of other facilities, park facilities and harbour facilities, which can be provided by the Board of Works to a great extent.  I believe that a comprehensive survey of our harbours is about to be carried out, if it has not already taken place, and this is a useful exercise from the point of view of ascertaining what the potentials are and what ports and slips should be developed for the good of the entire country.  There may be some which are of no consequence at all but we will then be able to decide <Col N="1426" /> what approach should be taken to future development along those lines.</P>
    <P>With regard to Garda stations, if we want to increase employment, there is the opportunity in the many stations throughout the country which are in urgent need of repair.  In the constituency I represent, I think there are more major Garda stations than in any other&mdash;Kilmainham, Store Street, Mountjoy and Bridewell.  Each and every one of these could be up-dated and made more acceptable because the police force in the future is going to play a major role in regard to security.  Unless our country is properly secured, any of the developments we undertake in the Board of Works will be futile.  The security of the State is of the first importance and for that reason we must ensure that proper provision is made and proper facilities laid on at Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I know that in Kilmainham and Kevin Street certain works have been carried out, but other works are necessary and I am not speaking of these two alone but of stations generally throughout the country.  It is important that we make these facilities available because there are bright young men today entering the police force and they will not put up with second-class standards.  They are entitled to the top standards which are available in industry and all types of business.  Trade unions today insist on certain standards for their members and the Department of Justice, through the Board of Works, will have to fall in line, especially in the rural parts.  I have seen some of these stations.  They are antiquated and cold and leave much to be desired.</P>
    <P>With regard to new Garda stations in developing parts of the city here, this is a matter which should be closely looked at with a view to ensuring that as people move in, Garda stations are built as soon as possible.  I remember that Ballyfermot must have been in existence for ten or 15 years before a barracks was erected.  The same applies to Coolock and Tallaght&mdash;I am not sure whether we are making provision for police stations in these expanding areas.  It is important that it be made <Col N="1427" /> because people like to see these developments in their areas.  They want schools and churches, but they also like to see that they are recognised for the law.  They are paying taxes, directly and indirectly, for this service and it is a service to the community just as is any other, and they look forward to the provision of police stations in these new built-up areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the courts, I know that the Parliamentary Secretary said he was having difficulty in relation to the building of a new courts complex. I understand that this is about to be undertaken in the Smithfield area, but I am not sure as to what extent it has developed.  I do not think any positive developments have taken place in that regard as yet but we have this problem of congestion in the courts.  I have not yet had to go through the courts but I have had occasion to call there to the area around the Bridewell where these courts are located.  The courts are dismal and drab, and probably if we sought a reason for many unfortunate people finding themselves before the courts today, we would find that it is because society has neglected them.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the children's courts.  Certain provision has been made, but this is the most delicate type of court of all, and we must ensure that the environment there does not impair a child's life forever.  I know that District Justices and others associated with these courts do their best to see to it that these courts have a good environment, because it must be one of the most frightening ordeals for a young person of 14 or 15 years to have to undergo.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned a sum of £395,000 for work carried out for the Department of Foreign Affairs, and I presume that much of this is in connection with developments in Dublin Castle for the EEC Summit and the acquiring of embassies abroad. I would like to know under what type of contract or regulation our embassy in Moscow is being acquired.  Is it on a rental basis or a purchase basis at <Col N="1428" /> some future date?  I think that in the case of embassies abroad, there should be an option to purchase.  Many of these embassies are acquired on a rental basis and some are purchased.  I think it is a good thing that we open embassies throughout the world because we must do so if we are to develop our trade.  The day of living in isolation is over.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the embassy in Moscow was a good thing.  We should use that embassy as a trade legation and for the promotion of inter-relationship.  There is a trading imbalance in favour of the Soviet Union.  I hope that the embassy in Moscow will be used to redress that imbalance.  If it succeeds in doing that the expenditure will have been justified.</P>
    <P>We have an embassy in Tokyo.  If we are to be a nation amongst the nations of the world it is a proper decision to establish embassies in other countries.  This may involve expenditure but it is necessary.  We must live by exports.  We know the dire consequences for our people of being unable to export.  Trading relationships should be developed.  There should be in every embassy a branch which would promote trade relationships and which would provide a means of easy introduction to business representatives from this country.  At present our embassies do provide such facilities and some of our ambassadors are excellent representatives. However, greater emphasis should be laid on the business aspect of embassies.  It must be the primary objective to increase exports, thereby generating employment.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the provision of £60,000 for damage to offices and embassies of foreign countries.  I take it that part of this is concerned with the British Embassy.  Is it a roll-over from the previous year?</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> There is one matter that rural Deputies will deal with in depth and which is a major problem in rural areas.  I have heard rural Deputies expounding on the shortcomings of the Department in regard to the extension of arterial drainage. I will leave this aspect of the Estimate to other Deputies.  Arterial drainage constitutes as important a part of the work of the Office of Public Works as any other section.  We cannot hope to get full production from land that is heavily flooded.  The amount provided under this subhead should be increased.  Rural Deputies who have made representations about this matter down through the years will tell the Parliamentary Secretary in no uncertain terms what they would like to have seen done and what plans there should be for the future.  I leave it to rural Deputies to point out the weaknesses in the administration of the funds at the disposal of the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to arterial drainage.</P>
      <P>Recently I received a letter on the matter of coast erosion.  The provision in the Estimate this year certainly does not carry the full 25 per cent increase. I have often spoken to people in the Donabate area with regard to the coast erosion that takes place there.  If one looks at the Book of Estimates one realises that there is no practical policy to deal with this matter, that there is no sincerity with regard to it.  The provision is £80,000.  That sum would not enable two miles of coast to be dealt with.  It is not the Parliamentary Secretary's fault.  That is all that he has been allocated for the purpose.  Coast erosion is taking place continually. Other matters can be postponed.  We may be able to build office blocks if we have sufficient money in the future; we may be able to build Garda stations or schools when the money becomes available; but it is not possible to replace land that has been eroded by the sea. This matter has been neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be in Ballybunion in July.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the serious erosion that is <Col N="1430" /> taking place there adjoining the Ballybunion golf course.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I understand a survey was carried out recently of national monuments in all the counties and it is important to preserve this part of our heritage for future generations. It is important that we ensure that these monuments are preserved. Once destroyed these monuments can never be replaced and for this reason we must devote our attention to their preservation.  There is a tendency to disregard such monuments because they are not of a materialistic nature, but that is a wrong attitude.  A great deal of work has been done in this regard by the Liberties organisation in Dublin.  That organisation has been active in the preservation of St. Audoen's, the old walls of Dublin, and other items of historical interest.  However, it took a great deal of public pressure to have them preserved.  If local authorities had their way I do not think such historical monuments would be preserved.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation are now playing an active part in the preservation of these monuments which are tourist attractions.  St. Audoen's relates to the 6th and 7th century and Marsh's Library and Christ Church Cathedral are also important historical features in that part of Dublin.  The Office of Public Works, in co-operation with local authorities, should ensure that all national monuments are protected. There may be overlapping in this regard and I am often confused as to whether the Office of Public Works or the local authority are responsible. People who go abroad make a point of seeing all the ancient monuments in the country they visit, but our national monuments are not even properly signposted.  A booklet giving details of our national monuments should be prepared and made available for tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Office of Public Works intend taking over the Grand Canal.  When Senator Lenihan was Minister for Transport and Power it was his intention to transfer the Grand Canal to the jurisdiction of the Office of Public Works.  Is that still the intention?  The Office of <Col N="1432" /> Public Works would be the right section to look after this waterway.  I am delighted to see that the canal is being preserved and I hope the Office of Public Works, if they assume responsibility for it, will keep it in a better state of cleanliness than CIE did.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the school situation.  Many of our schools need to be reconstructed.  In Dublin there are in the region of 738 prefab schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure relates to classrooms attached to schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> That is correct; I meant pre-fab units attached to schools.  The principal of the Holy Faith school in the Coombe is anxious that a permanent extension be provided in her school.  There is a big inflow of pupils to this school but it is only one of many schools in this city experiencing this problem.</P>
      <P>This estimate covers a broad field, and while there are many items I welcome in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech it is disappointing that he did not give an undertaking to expand the activities of the Office of Public Works.  In this field we could make a move towards helping our unemployment problem.  The amount voted for the Office of Public Works will hardly produce the same amount of work as last year.  It appears that there is no hope of any new jobs being created here.  If the Government gave an additional £10 million for the reconstruction of schools, arterial drainage and the erection and improvement of garda stations, the Office of Public Works would be in a position to play an important role in creating employment and reducing the dole queues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works covers a vast area and I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Estimate for this section.  The Office of Public Works should play a greater role by way of being more involved in amenities and the environment. They are responsible for the <Col N="1433" /> preservation of buildings, but the important thing is that the areas within their own scope should be looked on as amenity areas.  I realise we have not a Department dealing specifically with the environment but they could be taken under the auspices of the Office of Public Works.  Environment is an important aspect of life and it would fit in well with that office.  The Office of Public Works should be involved to a greater extent with local authorities and should give directions where this is necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the problem of coast erosion.  A coastline survey was carried out on behalf of local authorities by a firm of consultant architects.  I wonder if the Office of Public Works participated in the survey and if they will accept the recommendations made.  Various studies have been carried out regarding Dublin Bay.  An Foras Forbartha are undertaking such a survey for the Department of Transport and Power.  Are the Office of Public Works interesting themselves in this matter?  It is not sufficient for them to interest themselves in buildings; they must play a more meaningful role that would be helpful to the community.</P>
      <P>Students from the Bolton Street College carried out a survey of the Phoenix Park but I do not know if their recommendations were accepted. The Office of Public Works should carry out some research work on the Phoenix Park to see if it is being utilised to the maximum.  It is a fine park although I consider it is somewhat underdeveloped.  There are a number of playing pitches in the park but there should be some all-weather pitches.  At the moment the young people who play there on Sundays are often up to their ankles in mud.  In addition, the dressing rooms are inadequate and there have been many complaints about them.  I realise that may be a matter for the local authority but the Office of Public Works are also involved.  It is important that our young people have available as many amenities as is possible to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This week there was a motion before the Dáil with regard to a youth <Col N="1434" /> policy.  This is an area in which the Office of Public Works might interest themselves to ensure that we maximise the amenity value of the park.  I am sympathetic towards Deputy Fitzpatrick's comment about the zoo but I am always nervous about any encroachment in the Phoenix Park.  Various bodies have tried to do this under one guise or another in the past.  Once one encroachment is made, a case can be made for a second and a third.  I am convinced we should not allow any encroachment in the park because once it is done the question arises where do we stop.  The municipal golf course is limping along in a very slow way.  I accept that there are problems with the local authority regarding roads but it always appears that roads supersede the needs of people.  The Office of Public Works should take a firm stand and put pressure on the local authority to come to a speedy decision.  The provision of a municipal golf course is long overdue.  This facility is most desirable for a city of this size.</P>
    <P>Stephen's Green is a fine park and is well kept.  However, there is a green area beside a small playground which might be converted into an all-weather pitch.  It is close to Mercer Street, York Street, Cuffe Street and Iveagh Buildings and there is a large population in the district who have no play area.  People may object to the provision of such a pitch on aesthetic grounds or because it might upset the decorum of the area but we should keep our priorities right.  The space should be fenced in and set aside as a play area for young people.</P>
    <P>In Hyde Park and on the Continent artists are allowed to display their works of art and to sell them. Alongside the railings of Stephen's Green there is a wide pathway and this might be used by artists.  Perhaps this project could be done under the auspices of the Project Art Centre.  It would give many artists a way of displaying their art and it would encourage young people to take an interest in such matters.  Our art galleries are under-utilised but by bringing art to the notice of the public it would help to foster an interest in such matters and it would also be a <Col N="1435" /> tourist attraction.  If such an undertaking were controlled, as is done in other countries, it could work effectively. I am sure the Project Art Centre and other interested groups would be interested and would accept an offer from the Office of Public Works to permit artists to display their work.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about the major work being undertaken at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. It is a worthwhile project but I should like to know what will happen when it is completed.  A building is not of much value unless it reflects something within.  Will it be an art museum?  Will it be used to house the results of the excavations at Wood Quay?  We shall have to have some definite policy.  Preserving buildings for the sake of preserving them is not enough; they must be utilised for the benefit of the people generally.</P>
    <P>I put down a Parliamentary Question to the Parliamentary Secretary about open space at the Royal Hospital and he said he would look at the matter sympathetically.  In an area of high population density open spaces are tremendously important.  They should be made available for recreational purposes. The open space at the Royal Hospital should be available for these purposes. That would not detract in any way from the aesthetic value of the building.  Open spaces are essential for the proper development of people and nobody has a right, least of all a Government Department, to deprive people of this important asset.</P>
    <P>The amount of accommodation rented by Government Departments disturbs me.  This may not be the time from an economic point of view to build offices but we should certainly be planning for comprehensive development along these lines.  Government Departments need not be sited in the heart of the city.  They could easily be sited in peripheral areas in which there is a high population density.  That would eliminate traffic problems and the movement of people into and out of the city.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick said he <Col N="1436" /> did not go along fully with the idea of using army barracks for office acommodation.  Dublin Corporation has its beady eyes on these barracks and, if the Office of Public Works have designs on these, I would appeal to them to look elsewhere.  Most of them have a fair amount of open space and quite good housing accommodation could be developed in them. The policy now is towards decentralisation of Government Departments and, if hands are kept off these barracks, we may find a partial solution to our housing problem in Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>There are problems of accommodation here in Leinster House affecting both Members and staff.  This is under active consideration as a result of representations from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I hope the Office of Public Works will come up with some proposals as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the older historic portions of our cities should be preserved. These areas are a tourist attraction. The local people in the Liberties have made a worthwhile contribution in ensuring the preservation of that particular area.  Historic areas in all our cities should be preserved and some incentive should be given to the people to do the job of preservation in conjunction with the local authorities. Tourists want to see these historic areas; they do not want to look at glass office blocks.  They can be seen in Brussels, Antwerp and elsewhere in Europe.  People want history because it reflects the past.  The Office of Public Works should involve itself more widely in this work of preservation.</P>
    <P>The canals must be taken over by the Office of Public Works because they are a desirable amenity for both nationals and non-nationals.  Some have been allowed to deteriorate for one reason or another, chiefly because of lack of interest.  If they are not preserved the day will come when we will regret losing them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Parliamentary Secretary's brief.  What I have to say now <Col N="1437" /> is not in any way personal, because of all the people in this House the Parliamentary Secretary is one Member deserving of commendation.  In the entire brief there are only two pages on arterial drainage.  The amount of money mentioned in those two pages is so little that one could not be blamed for thinking that the Board of Works will have nothing more to do with arterial drainage or drainage of any kind.  I appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary is not getting as much money for the Board of Works as we thought he would get, but as Deputy Fitzpatrick said surely there was some justification for adding a few millions to the Estimate this year?  A sum of £18 million for this Estimate will just about keep the ship moving.  I do not believe there is any room for expansion in that.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot of talk about the oil crisis, the energy crisis, unemployment and the movement of people off the land.  An injection of some money to drainage would have been of great help, particularly in the west, towards the repair of drains and bog roads. We only have the LIS scheme to do bog roads.  The Board of Works should produce some scheme for this work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about a handout for visitors to this House. Many come from the west and there is no leaflet or small pamphlet to give them about the historical background of this House.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider some type of small handout to give to children when they visit this House.  It would be a nice souvenir for them to have, particularly if it told them the background to the House and what happens here.  I mentioned two years ago that some visitors to the House remarked that the curtain in the House should be replaced.  I hope that something will be done about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a shame to build office blocks in the centre of the city.  The new building for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in Kildare Street is a very fine building but there are no parking facilities.  Dáil Deputies can park their cars inside the gates of Leinster House and go out <Col N="1438" /> and do their business, but people who drive from the country find it impossible to get places to park their cars. If those buildings were erected outside the city with good parking accommodation they would be of great help to people from the country who have to do business in them.  Every section connected with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should be under one roof.  The same should apply to all Departments.</P>
    <P>Almost every Deputy has to visit the Department of Local Government. There is no parking space in the neighbourhood of O'Connell Bridge House.  I have got more tickets for illegal parking in that area than any other Deputy here because I am nearly always in a hurry, particularly when I have a document to hand in. There is a private parking place at the back and there are parking meters in the neighbourhood but it is impossible to get one free.  All Government buildings should be outside the city so that people will have no trouble finding parking space.</P>
    <P>I must differ slightly from what Deputy Fitzpatrick said about Phoenix Park.  People from the country who visit Dublin like to spend some time driving through the park or sitting in their cars looking at the deer.  There are some beautiful places there, such as the Furry Glen.  It is a lovely way to go to the west of Ireland.  You can drive through the park to Chapelizod and then on by the main road to the west.  It might be better for Dublin people if the Phoenix Park was closed to traffic, but from the point of view of tourists or people coming from the country it is one of the nicest places to drive.  It is probably one of the finest parks in the world.</P>
    <P>Practically all the Parliamentary Secretary's speech was concerned with repairs to offices and national monuments. The Board of Works are doing a reasonably good job on repairs to national monuments.  I am grateful for the work they have done to Portumna Castle and some of the other historical buildings in my constituency.  The harbour at Portumna needs to be improved.  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked about a survey of harbours.  It is very <Col N="1439" /> important to do this.  During the Summer recess the Parliamentary Secretary should take a trip around the country to see what harbours should and should not be developed. Harbours and amenities around the country are very important.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that there is no policy in the Board of Works on arterial drainage or bog development. The Parliamentary Secretary should tell the people in Brussels that we want money for drainage.  He knows all about the problem in the west of Ireland.  There are hundreds of acres of land under water due to lack of drainage.  A sum is provided for cost/benefit surveys and for doing catchments but this is only scratching the surface.  There are rivers in the west of Ireland which are number ten on the priority list for years and hundreds of acres of land surrounding them are flooded every year.  A lot could be done if a few million pounds were allocated to do some small jobs There is an old Act, which goes back to Queen Victoria, where catchment areas of certain rivers can be cleaned to a certain point.  I am a member of a drainage committee and I know all about this.  We can have work done to a certain point along a catchment but we cannot pass it.  It is useless to clean the river to that point because about ten or 15 yards further on there could be a large blockage.  Even though we have not money enough to do many of the large schemes hundreds of acres of land could be made reasonably good if we forgot about this old Act and allowed the drainage committee to go further out into the catchment areas.</P>
    <P>Land can be drained under the land project schemes and the LIS only where the levels are correct.  The Dunkellin river goes right through my county.  We cannot carry out LIS schemes because the levels are not correct.  Where the levels are right we could do a very good job if we had an intermediate scheme between the LIS and the major drainage jobs.  The LIS are sent down to the county council by the Office of Public Works.  Under that scheme a maximum grant per <Col N="1440" /> person is allowed and this cuts out any fairly major scheme.  It also cuts out major bog development.  I have at least three schemes on my plate at the moment but they are too big for the LIS scheme and therefore they cannot be done.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have a serious energy crisis.  There is plenty of energy in the bogs if we could get it out.  The Office of Public Works should take on these types of schemes.  They did it before.  There are a number of bridges across a river in Galway which need to be repaired. We tried to get this work done under the land project scheme but the estimate was £66,000 which cut it out completely.  The levels are all right and these schemes could be done.  If the levels are wrong you can do nothing.  If the levels from the Suck, the Shannon, or the Dunkellin are wrong, nothing can be done.  A lot of work could be done pending the drainage of the major rivers where the levels are right if we had an intermediate scheme.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous for us to talk about draining the Shannon.  I will never know anything about that.  I will be under the daisies for a long time before the Shannon will be drained. Rivers such as the Dunkellin should be drained.  Work on the Suck is held up by the Shannon.  While we are talking about major jobs we could be doing a good deal of good work if we had small intermediate schemes.  I know that no man is more anxious to do this work in the west of Ireland than the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Kenny.</P>
    <P>Pressure should be brought to bear in Brussels with regard to the priority of drainage in Ireland.  If drainage work is not carried out, how many more people will leave the land? We hear a lot of talk about off-farm employment.  We cannot even give employment to people who have no land.  People with no land are on the dole.  What will happen if thousands of other people leave the land and join the dole queues?  If these lands were drained they could be put into production.  Land cannot be viable until it is drained.  An instructor cannot <Col N="1441" /> draw up a farm plan until the land is drained.  That is why the EEC priorities are wrong when they talk about development programmes.  I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary for that.  The policy should be changed.</P>

If I were going to Brussels tomorrow morning to argue a case I should like the people behind me to be more or less kicking me so that I could say: &ldquo;I cannot go home unless I get this money.&rdquo;  Anything I say here is intended to help the Parliamentary Secretary when he goes to Brussels to get money for arterial drainage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should be sent to Brussels. I know he would pound the table in Brussels because he knows how important this work is.  I was disappointed that there were only two pages in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement dealing with arterial drainage.  I was explaining to the House that there is a great deal of work which could be done before the major rivers were drained if we had an intermediate scheme and if we had enough money to do it.  I was explaining that the catchment areas can only be drained to a certain point.  That law should be amended so that we can move out into the catchment area if the levels are right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are schemes which could be carried out but they are too big for the land project scheme and for the LIS.  A lot of land could be drained even without carrying out any major schemes.  I am convinced of that.  I am a member of a drainage board.  You can go to point X but you cannot pass it.  It is ridiculous to clean a river to <Col N="1442" /> point X when 100 yards down the place is all blocked up.  These drainage boards are doing good work with the money at their disposal.  If we had permission to move out further where the levels are correct, a fair amount of land could be drained.  I expected the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what he intended to do if he got the money. He should ask the Government to send him to Brussels.  No better man.  He should explain the position as he sees it and say what should be done.  You cannot put manure on wet land.  Therefore, development projects cannot be carried out because of the lack of drainage.</P>
    <P>I have been putting forward LIS schemes for bog development but they are too big.  A maximum grant per person is allowed under the LIS scheme.  We must get the energy, so badly needed, out of the bogs.  The Board of Works should introduce an intermediate scheme to drain the bogs particularly in the west, and have roads built into them.  That is the sort of thing in which I should like to see the Board of Works engaging, and they did it before.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a lot of things about Dublin while the Parliamentary Secretary was absent which I shall not repeat because the Parliamentary Secretary might laugh at me and say: what right has the Deputy to speak about Dublin?</P>

      <P>I was very disappointed that two pages only out of 21 in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech dealt with arterial drainage and that there was no policy expressed with regard to his intentions.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that that is not his business; he has to take what he gets.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a rural Deputy and knows the position in the west.  I have full confidence in him.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary has plenty of drive and that he could tell the people in Brussels where to get off.  It is support rather than criticism we want built up for the people in these areas, where there is <Col N="1443" /> reasonably good land were it drained. There are hundreds of acres in my county, and in the Parliamentary Secretary's, all along the west, which could be used were they drained but, until such time as they are, nothing can be done with them.</P>
      <P>I did pay tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary in his absence with regard to Portumna Castle and Clontuskert. The harbour at Portumna is being developed also and I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for these works being undertaken in my constituency. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make a trip during his holidays to ascertain what harbours&mdash; as Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested&mdash; should be developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will make sure to get some shortly.  The Government should send the Parliamentary Secretary to Brussels to explain to them the position here at present where we cannot find off-farm employment for our people and that, had we some money for drainage, we might be able to keep a lot more people on the land.  We are told that no problem exists; allow the people off the land and they will find employment. Will some genius tell me&mdash;if we put 80 per cent of our farmers who are supposed to be non-development farmers off the land in the morning&mdash; where they will find employment?  It is said that we need have only so many people farming, but where will the remainder find employment?  There is the land which could be made productive by undertaking its drainage, and I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to request the Government to undertake such work.  I am convinced that if he goes to Brussels he will not come home empty-handed.  We were told that a lot of money to be allocated from the Regional Fund would be devoted to drainage.  I would like to know where that money is going.  Even if we never got a shilling from Brussels, if the Exchequer added £10 million to the £18 million the Parliamentary Secretary has been allocated <Col N="1444" /> here and said: &ldquo;Spend that on drainage,&rdquo; it would be worth while. There are repairs to be carried out to schools also, which would give employment, but I would give first priority to drainage.  Drainage is of prime importance to any rural Deputy, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to impress that on the Government. The Local Improvement Schemes are very minor ones because, once the cost exceeds £1,000, no county is entitled to give a grant.  After a long dispute in my county, in each county council area, we have £7,000; that comprises seven schemes of £1,000 each.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary when replying, would indicate whether there is any hope of a cost/benefit survey being undertaken on the Dunkellin project.  I want to have an intermediate scheme implemented for the larger projects.  There are three bog development programmes which would cost approximately £4,000 or £5,000 but nobody will touch them, and there are other instances of land projects being similarly treated.  Were there an intermediate scheme implemented, which would not cost much more than an additional £10 million, the Parliamentary Secretary would be doing a good job for rural Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very impressed with Deputy Callanan's contribution.  I should like to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the work he is doing with the limited resources at his disposal.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said he would leave the rural aspect to the rural Deputies and, if I might say so, I think it has been adequately dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with what Deputy Callanan said in regard to arterial drainage and coast erosion generally; that if we have not got the money, then Brussels would appear to be the place to get it.  The general policy of the Treaty of Rome would appear to be that the maximum amount of people be employed to reasonable standards.  That is what the various Funds are all about.  The Government have been in office for a couple of years only but the question of arterial drainage should have been <Col N="1445" /> tackled years ago.  It is a mammoth job and I do not expect that the Parliamentary Secretary, or indeed a good many Henry Kennys, could accomplish all of it in a short space of time.  One has only to travel by train to Dublin to see how much of our land is in need of drainage and general reclamation. Arterial drainage is something to which the Office of Public Works could devote more attention, and with profit. It is fine to speak about monuments, parks and amenities but, when times are difficult, we must adhere to priorities. I would consider arterial drainage to be the first priority, which does not necessarily entail many millions of pounds.  If I might cite just one instance of a place called Flahey Bridge in my area where if sluice gates were fitted, hundreds of acres of land could be salvaged.  Those are the sorts of things to which attention should be devoted. There is then coast erosion; there is all of the area between Cork Harbour and Youghal being gradually eroded. It is all very well to say that it is the fault of the Board of Works; that one has been writing to the Department of Lands; that they refer one to the local authority and that it is a question of passing the buck.  I should like somebody to get down to the job and say: It is our responsibility; we will see what we can do about it.  I am weary of being pushed from one Department to another.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about a scheme which will cost £1 million a mile, all I am talking about is a very simple wooden-type barrier.  I have a small plot of land adjoining the sea and I have succeeded in protecting some of it with very simple wooden barriers over which the sands will flow and that in turn will form a very natural protection. Eventually those barriers will disappear under a wealth of sand. This is how we can keep out the tide. My experience has been that while the beach could be cleared of sand by one tide, the following week it could build up again.  There will be plenty of sand if we put up very simple barriers.</P>
    <P>The land being flooded is very valuable and could be even more valuable <Col N="1446" /> in the harbour area in the near future. As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, we can wait for an office block but the tide waits for no man.  Time is not on our side when we are talking about protecting our coast line, especially in an area which is the hub of the enormous expansion in gas and oil, that is, the seaboard area between Kinsale Head and Ardmore.  Every half acre of that land will be like gold in a few years' time.  Now is the time to do something about it.  The Parliamentary Secretary may tell me that that is not his responsibility but surely somebody will accept responsibility for this and make sure that something is done.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary and the Board of Works for the amount of work they have put into improving existing Garda stations. They have taken my advice and brightened up our courthouses.  There are some very fine old buildings which only need to be washed down.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to avail of the option of compulsory acquisition to build Garda barracks in areas where they are badly needed.</P>
    <P>We are dragging our feet with regard to the post office in Cobh.  We have been waiting for the post office to be reconstructed.  The Office of Public Works have rented the Cunard Buildings but they will not be there for ever.  Now that they are paying for the lease perhaps they will use it as a temporary post office.  Then they can get on with the job of reconstructing the post office.</P>
    <P>Midleton too, is sadly in need of new premises.  I went to the trouble of finding premises for the Office of Public Works only to find that they were not interested at the moment. This very suitable building will not be there for ever.  The Office of Public Works should take the ball on the hop when a suitable building in the centre of the town with parking facilities becomes available.</P>
    <P>Again I compliment the Board of Works on the very fine building, the agricultural building, in Dublin.  It is wonderful to have everything dealing with agriculture in one building.  I was responsible for encouraging the <Col N="1447" /> erection of another farm building&mdash; the new farm centre.  We were probably wiser in our choice of site because there are plenty of parking facilities there.  Perhaps the parking problems in Dublin could be overcome by underground parking.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works are doing wonderful work on the preservation and maintenance of our national monuments.  It is wonderful when visitors come here&mdash;especially those from the United States of America, full-blooded Americans without any knowledge of &ldquo;the old world&rdquo;&mdash;to be able to point out that this Cathedral or this castle dates back to the third or fourth century.  They can go back only a few hundred years and make a big thing out of it when they show you where such and such a battle took place.  Some of our monuments go back thousands of years before Christ.</P>
    <P>I visited Barry's Court Castle recently. It has been very badly damaged by young people.  For example, they have damaged very fine fireplaces.  It should be sealed off because it is in a dangerous condition at the moment.</P>
    <P>I hope the Office of Public Works continue their interest and financial aid to the walls in Youghal.  A lot of local effort has gone into restoring these walls.  This is one of the few places in Ireland where we have an almost complete wall dating back to the fifth century.  It is well worth preserving.  There is no point in having historic monuments and buildings if we do not show them off to their best advantage.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to visit the Office of Public Works on a number of occasions when school builders were dragging their feet.  I compliment the board for the speedy action they took in this regard.  On the occasions when I approached them I found them most helpful.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Board of Works have a function in regard to the maintenance of older schools.  We hear a lot about all sorts of new and expensive schools being built but very little about the maintenance of older schools.  In rural Ireland more could be done to <Col N="1448" /> maintain and brighten old schools. They were very well built and not alone could their maintenance eliminate the need to build new schools but in winter particularly it would mean a tremendous saving in fuel if children did not have to be transported to schools at a distance from their homes.  Socially, of course, it would mean that children would be educated in their natural environment.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Supplementary Estimate is Dublin orientated. I disagree.  I agree that Phoenix Park should be kept open at all times for everybody.  I also agree that the money spent on the maintenance of St. Stephen's Green is well spent.  I should like to say a special word about the Botanic Gardens.  When I was a member of Macra na Feirme I had a special interest in shrubs and plants, and it is wonderful to see the rare plants being cultivated in that beautiful place.  I brought my children along there recently and I found it to be kept better than ever.  A special compliment should be paid to the staff for whom it is a difficult job to maintain plants in what I might call an abnormal environment.  Visits to the Botanic Gardens are a golden opportunity for Dublin children to see some of the most beautiful flowers in the world&mdash;it is straight into the country for them.</P>
    <P>On this subject I compliment Dublin people generally, and Dublin children particularly, on their general attitude to parks in the city.  I have noticed they are quite concerned about any damage done in St. Stephen's Green, and their respect for such places.  This shows we are not as bad as we are painted, and I suggest that a little more education in this respect would improve things.</P>
    <P>Deputies spoke about the possibility of providing accommodation in Leinster House.  This is of particular interest to rural Deputies who are finding it more and more difficult to find hotel accommodation, particularly during show periods and because of the closing down of some of the city's older hotels.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of accommodation, <Col N="1449" /> I should like to see an effort to provide more living quarters in Garda stations, particularly in Dublin where young gardaí are finding it increasingly difficult and expensive to find accommodation. I am sure it would not cost too much to have them accommodated in Garda stations.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is endeavouring to expedite the building of a new Christian Brothers' secondary school in Youghal.  I appeal to him to give it a bit of a push.  All sorts of temporary structures have been put up and there is not space for any more.  There is a very fine site there, developed, and it should be built on without delay.</P>
    <P>I will wrap up my remarks by reference to some of the comments made by Deputy Callanan, particularly about the paucity of the Supplementary Estimate in regard to Brussels funds. If we are to have an effective national arterial drainage system and if we are to defeat coast erosion there must be finance from our EEC membership.  In this matter it is no use talking in terms of thousands of pounds: as far as both problems are concerned we must be talking in millions, and because Acts of Parliament dealing with these matters are limited in financing, the money we need must be found from an EEC fund.  If we are to salvage large stretches of our coastline&mdash;I am particularly interested in Cork&mdash;we must appeal to the people in Brussels for funds.</P>
    <P>In Cork harbour, for instance, we have the necessary terrain to reclaim 70 acres in addition to the five to ten acres now being salvaged.  There is further acreage which could be reclaimed right along the coast from Cork to Youghal, and this becomes urgent in view of the possibility of developments in relation to oil and gas. This work must be done before it is too late.  Coast erosion can be measured by 20 or 30 feet each winter.  Some farmers lose up to two acres in as many years because of erosion&mdash;that is the magnitude of the task we are facing.  I completely agree with Deputy Callanan on the need for a massive programme to defeat the sea.  These days we are <Col N="1450" /> talking about young people leaving the land to go into industrial employment which is not there for them.  We should be talking in terms of providing land for them to stay on.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Parliamentary Secretary and the staff of the Office of Public Works for their courtesy and help at all times.</P>

      <P>It is refreshing to listen to Deputy Callanan and Deputy Hegarty who come from rural parts telling us a few things that we jackeens would not know too much about.  It does prompt me to ask one question. Both Deputy Hegarty and Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to coast erosion. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the taking away of sand from beaches.  I have seen this going on in many parts of the country.  I have also seen rock and stone being chopped away from cliffs and taken away.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary say if any authority has the right to put a stop to this?</P>

      <P>Turning to the Estimate, what I have to say here may be more relevant to the Estimate for the Department of Finance, but the Office of Public Works are involved in the public services area in relation to the provision of works and buildings, and this has very serious cost factor implications for the economy.  I should first like to deal with the Estimate increase, which the <Col N="1451" /> Parliamentary Secretary refers to as 25 per cent and which I worked out at 35 per cent, but I think that did not include the cost of pay increases. I should also like to inquire if the figure of £18,235,000, which is for 12 months as against £9,951,000 for the previous nine-months' period, includes the national pay award increases for the coming year.  I would assume that it does not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard I wish to sound a note of warning in relation to our economy.  I personally know quite a number of firms in industry which are not and have declared themselves not to be in a position to pay the forthcoming national pay awards.  That is a very serious situation for the people working in those areas.  I understand there is a figure of 50 firms mentioned, which is confidential, but I happen to know quite a few of them.  The reason they are not in a position to pay these awards is simply that in competitive business you cannot pay what you have not got.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask who decides when the taxpayer has not enough to pay the national awards in the public service, because this is very serious for our economy?  It may be outside the scope of the Estimate, but I am referring to increases in pay for employees' of the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruriaí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take it up with the Minister for the Public Service. Nevertheless, the Board of Works Estimate has to include increases.  However, I do not want to quarrel with the Chair about it.  There will be plenty of time to go into that matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thoroughly approve of the purchase of sites and fee simples.  I have been urging for a good many years past that the State should avoid as far as possible a situation where it becomes a <Col N="1452" /> tenant, and the purchase of sites and freeholds for whatever properties are required for the State service is a good development.  That leads me to the question of the provision&mdash;although details have not been given&mdash;of new and approved accommodation, which is part of an earlier policy decision that the Office of Public Works should try to provide buildings rather than rent them.  Reading the Parliamentary Secretary's speech prompts a question as to who decides exactly what is necessary. I said last year or the previous year in this debate that I disapproved of this idea of allowing developers to provide State building on short leases, that I believed we should be able to do the same thing ourselves through the State.  This is a policy decision which was taken in late 1972 as a result of urgings on the part of some of us who realised what was happening in this connection, that money was being borrowed by private developers at that time at the same rate as the State could borrow it, and was being borrowed in some cases on the home market and in other cases on the London market.  Therefore, the taxpayer was involved in paying high rents subject to review at five- or seven-year periods for something that could have been provided, through a State borrowing system, by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The question that occurs to me is, how far does one go in increasing the number of buildings?  Who takes responsibility for the decision as to what is necessary?  The question that arises here is what can an economy afford. Are we going too far in regard to expansion in connection with public buildings and costs to the taxpayers? Is there any danger of what I might describe as pyramiding of public buildings taking place?</P>
    <P>I have not found any reference to embassies in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech; perhaps I missed it.</P>

      <Col N="1454" /> The provision of office accommodation is mentioned in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech.

I do not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to answer that now, but what I am thinking is that if the State can provide its own office accommodation it might cost less.  What is important is that the State should be providing office accommodation so as to release itself from leasing obligations.  To illustrate what I have in mind, I was a member of a semi-State body about 10 years ago and it was found necessary to provide some new accommodation for Radio Éireann which was not being properly serviced from the point of view of providing an efficient radio service and it was found, on examination, that if one borrowed the money to provide the new building one would actually save money.  At the time that body was renting so much accommodation that if you cancelled the rents you could provide the new building at a lower cost, once you allowed for the interest.  This is what they did, and the building is almost completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>And provided the money by way of loan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think on superannuation funds.  I am giving this illustration in relation to the increasing cost of relating private office accommodation leased by Departments of State.  I should like to know if there is a prospect of providing new office accommodation.  Would this mean that the £2 million rent which the State is paying at present could be reduced?  If this is planned within the next ten years it would be well if the people knew it; we are talking of taxpayers' money and it is important that the Commissioners work efficiently and anticipate reducing the high level of rent for State accommodation paid to private developers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was reference in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech to the taking over of the Kildare Street building to provide greater facilities for the National Library.  I agree with this. The National Library need more <Col N="1455" /> accommodation.  There is also reference to providing new buildings at the Garda Depot.  Having been a businessman for the past 25 years I am prompted to ask whether when new buildings are erected, the old ones are evacuated?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can answer that fully when replying but I must take particular note of it because it is a rather complex question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not taking the Parliamentary Secretary to task but for the record I would emphasise that in relation to replacing accommodation one must have regard to the amount of money available. Therefore, we must ask what is to happen to the old buildings.  In most private commercial concerns the older buildings would have to be disposed of on some sort of contract basis in order to provide new ones. The same approach should apply to public buildings.  If this is the approach of the Office of Public Works it would be well to let the people know this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens is that when one building is evacuated and its occupants transferred to a new building, there will be another volume of people to go into the old building from yet an older one.  This is the progression when there are a large volume of employees to be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of the public it is important that <Col N="1456" /> we should be seen to be approaching this whole, rather expensive area as efficiently as it would be approached by a private business concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>And we must be seen to be using the taxpayers' money to the full advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>A private company must have regard for its shareholders and we have even a greater responsibility in so far as the taxpayers' money is concerned.  I welcome the reference in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief to Scoil Éanna and to its internal rehabilitation.  The sooner this is done the better but I would like to have some idea of the cost that will be involved.  There is a notional figure of £30,000 in respect of Muckross House.  Is that the entire figure or is it the amount for this year only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This figure is for water and sewerage systems.  I have visited Muckross House on a few occasions and I was very concerned that the beautiful bay in front of the house should be polluted completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with this expenditure but I would like to know whether it is the total figure involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be only a tentative figure because as time goes on costs increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case the State is setting a good example in dealing with pollution and another factor that is important is, as has been pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary, there will be facilities for dealing with an outbreak of fire such as that which occurred at Powerscourt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Dubliner I welcome also the restoration of the Casino at Marino. This is a very famous building which is well worth preserving.  I would welcome, too, the preparation of some sort of historical leaflet&mdash;nothing very elaborate is necessary&mdash;relating to Leinster House.  The leaflets could be distributed to the many school children and adult visitors who come here and they might be provided also at tourist <Col N="1457" /> offices in the city.  Perhaps, too, they could be made available at our tourist office in Belfast in view of the small amount of knowledge in that area of Irish history.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred, too, to the work on the new buildings for the Departments of Lands and Education at Castlebar and Athlone, respectively.  Will it be the position that if buildings are vacated here as a result of the transfer of staff to these centres, these buildings will continue to be required or will we be able, from a business point of view, to sell some of the buildings concerned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that only a fraction of the full complement of employees of these two Departments are to be transferred. When I heard first of decentralisation I thought that the total staff of both the Departments would be transferred but that will not be the case.  The fraction of the total number of personnel who will be involved in the transfer will be minimal compared with the number that will remain in Dublin.  Therefore, these moves will not relieve to any significant extent the accommodation problems of these Departments. People, especially politicians, fall flat when they must retract something they have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate this but from a business point of view if one is to transfer staff from one area to another it should be possible to reduce the accommodation requirements in the areas from which the moves are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so in this case because there is not enough existing accommodation for the staffs of the Departments of Lands and Education. Only some weeks ago we found that to remove some hundreds of people from the Social Welfare Department at Store Street, we would only about break even in regard to accommodation. All of this must go on in a progressive way here in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that to say that the accommodation must continue to be increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the demands <Col N="1458" /> for greater ease of accommodation continue to be greater.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little dubious in this regard because we must have regard to the question of what can be afforded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Deputy, if a person builds a new house there is accommodation available automatically in the one he vacates.  That is not the situation in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as simple as that.  The approach is that if a portion of a Department is transferred, space vacated is filled automatically.  I do not know where the cost efficiency element comes into this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that staff should remain in accommodation that is not suitable?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still impressing on the Parliamentary Secretary the cost of public buildings to the community, but I will not ask him to reply now.  I want to congratulate the Commissioners and their staff on the provision made in the past six months, and it is still ongoing to some degree, in regard to the accommodation for meetings of the European Community during the period of our country's presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last point I should like to deal with, which has already been covered by other Deputies, is in relation to Phoenix Park and its use.  I can see now that there is a division arising as between rural and city Deputies in regard to the use of the park as a motorway and I can quite appreciate the feelings of rural Deputies who like to drive out through it.  Nevertheless <Col N="1459" /> a survey was carried out and I think some recommendation made in regard to curtailing its use as a motorway.  My interest at the moment in Phoenix Park is that I feel it can be used in an additional way as a tourist amenity.  I understand there were some discussions with the Dublin Region with regard to the possibility of using the park next year as a tourist attraction for a period of a couple of weeks, which discussions did not progress, but it does seem to me that the park being so near the city, it could be used for some attraction like the St. Patrick's Day parade in the city centre, the provision during a week or two of attractive events which might be organised by the Dublin tourist region.</P>
    <P>I am prompted to encourage the Parliamentary Secretary to look further into this because of the importance of tourism especially at present and over the next couple of years, with the low level of our economy. We have had difficulties in the tourist areas, currently due to something of a recession in Britain and the United States and also because of the Northern problem, but anything that can be done or can be encouraged in the tourist area means additional jobs within our economy, so I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to take a fresh look at the question of what could be done without doing damage to Phoenix Park which is a wonderful amenity for which the people of Dublin should be most grateful.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters covered by the Parliamentary Secretary's Estimate which I would like to go into but I will leave them over until next year and leave myself with something to say to him má tá sé ann fós an bhlian seo chughainn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The one feature of this whole Estimate is the cutbacks in various sections which, if the reverse approach had been taken, would have allowed for tremendous employment potential at a time such as we have at the moment of rising and massive chronic unemployment. <Col N="1460" /> No section of Government, I suppose, is more capable of absorbing manpower in the various areas under its control than the Office of Public Works, and I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that we have a look at the project undertaken and at present going on in Ulster called Enterprise Ulster.  This is a project under which in various areas throughout the Six Counties where there is massive unemployment, local schemes are undertaken under the heading of Enterprise Ulster.  They do not involve years of planning or tremendous capital expenditure on machinery.  It is really a manpower absorption enterprise.  There are many small local improvement schemes that could be done throughout the country that would benefit the local community and benefit the tourist industry, and at the same time have the effect of reducing our chronic unemployment, and I feel that it is in this year with the difficulties in the economy, the Office of Public Works could be making significant efforts towards a reduction of our unemployment figures.</P>
      <P>As I understand Enterprise Ulster it is that a local engineer or two or three engineers take a project around a lake shore or an estuary or a local town park and work out a rough sketch.  It involves perhaps laying a bit of grass, putting in a few benches in the park or maybe a sandpit for the kids, but it all takes men off the dole and gives them self-respect and jobs and is to be applauded.  I know they have been very successful with it, and something similar could and should be done here at this time. Rather than merely paying out dole money, surely it is better to give employment and have some worthwhile jobs done and amenities provided for the people and our tourists. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider this suggestion and see if he can wring money out of his Minister because it would be something constructive and helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility of his securing that sort of money is, to say the least of it, remote if one is to judge by the figures in the Estimate.  I pick one section of it, dealing with coast erosion and protection, <Col N="1461" /> and I find that for the nine months up to the end of December, there is a figure of £64,000 in the Estimate and this year for the 12-month period, it is a mere £80,000. Dublin County Council prepared a report on coast erosion as it affects the county and in particular the north county.  That report suggests eight projects estimated to cost £1,750,000 &mdash;nearly £2 million.  The provision for coast erosion in the Estimate presented by the Parliamentary Secretary is a mere £80,000 for a full 12 months. This shows the respect the Government have for the problem.  What is true in the case of North County Dublin area is true also of every maritime county.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the report that was prepared for County Dublin, even in the light of the fact that the money is not forthcoming. The project that we put forward followed on a question that I had down to the Minister for Finance some 18 months ago.  At that time I questioned the Parliamentary Secretary about coast protection for an area known as the Burrow, Portrane.  His reply was that there was no proposal before his Department and consequently no proposals from the county council and consequently he could not do anything about it.  There is a proposal now before his Department for nearly £1,750,000 of work.  I quote part of this report:</P>
    <P>The Velvet Strand, Portmarnock, £300,000; the problem of erosion at Loughshinny harbour, £25,000; North Shore, Skerries, £10,000; Barnageera, an area between Balbriggan and Skerries, £50,000; the area south of Balbriggan Harbour, £26,000; the Burrow, Portrane, £160,000; South County coastline, £1,100,000; and Rogerstown, Rush, £106,000.</P>
    <P>This report was submitted under section 2 of the Coast Protection Act, 1963, which says:</P>
    <P>If the council is satisfied that land within the county is being progressively damaged by the continuing encroachment of the sea as distinct from occasional or abnormal storms <Col N="1462" /> and that the encroachment is liable to endanger the safety of a harbour, the buildings or amenities of a residential area or other valuable property, it may declare that the promotion of a coast protection scheme is expedient and that the Commissioners of Public Works should be asked to carry out a preliminary examination.</P>
    <P>The council took that decision.  They have agreed to ask the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out the preliminary examination on the projects that I have read out.</P>
    <P>The need for the work to be done is evident when I read, for example, the location and the extent of the encroachment at the Velvet Strand, Portmarnock.  It is the area from Farney Gutter north of the Country Club Hotel, where it joins with Portmarnock-Malahide Road, along the banks towards Sutton Point and Portmarnock Golf Club.  The lands abutting the Velvet Strand consist of a ridge of dunes.  Severe damage is taking place at the Farney Gutter end, where, for a distance of approximately 500 yards, piles of eroded sand is speedily engulfing this wooded area and making its way to the main road. Accumulation of sand in this area is blown onto the public road, into gardens and drains and from time to time bulldozers and lorries have to be used to remove it.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows that the Velvet Strand is a very popular resort for the people living in the north county, that North County Dublin is a rapidly expanding area and Portmarnock is no exception to that.  It is a popular resort for day trippers.  In fine weather there may be thousands of people using that strand area every day.  The vegetation has been damaged along its length, approximately 2,000 linear yards, by children cutting tunnels, slides and trenches, as children do on beaches. This exposes the sand along the banks and in turn this sand is blown inwards in south-easterly gales towards Farney Gutter at the northern end.  High tides driven by south-easterly gales lash the toe of the inward dune face, causing cutting back along its full length.  The <Col N="1463" /> height of the banks varies from 30 feet to ten feet.</P>
    <P>The suggested work and the estimated cost as prepared by the engineers of Dublin County Council and submitted to the Commissioners of Public Works are as follows:</P>
    <P>Without a full scale survey and a decision on what is eventually envisaged for the area regarding roads, promenades, car parking areas <i>et cetera</i>, it is difficult to recommend the type of protection works which would be suitable.</P>
    <P>Large stone protection works could spoil the beach area for the trippers.  Stepped gabions constructed of slab type stones might fit the bill.</P>
    <P>In any case works at £100 per yard could be anticipated, making the cost in the region of £300,000.</P>
    <P>That is just one example at the Velvet Strand in Portmarnock.  I should like to give other examples of the extent of the problem in North County Dublin at all of the other sites but I shall mention only one, the Burrow, Portrane. The report reads:</P>
    <P>Burrow Portrane/Rogerstown&mdash; The area from Rogerstown Estuary South along the banks towards the old coastguard station in Portrane Village.  The distance involved is approximately 1,600 linear yards. The area affected by erosion is about 22 acres of sand dune lands.</P>
    <P>The Burrow area is a ridge of dunes, and the seaward face has been suffering severe erosion.  At the Rogerstown Estuary end the high water mark has moved approximately 240 yards landward, and the erosion decreases to the south until it is zero at approximately 1,600 linear vards.  This would account for the erosion of the twenty-two acres mentioned above.  High storm tides are probably the main cause of erosion with wind as secondary cause.</P>
    <P>Cost of laying large rubble rock protection breakwater along the seaward face 1,600 linear yards, £140,000; vegetation cover, planting <Col N="1464" /><i>et cetera,</i> £20,000&mdash;overall cost £160,000.</P>
    <P>What I have said of the Velvet Strand and the Burrow also holds in respect of the other areas, Loughshinny Harbour, North Shore, Skerries, Barnageera, the area south of Balbriggan Harbour, south County Dublin and Rogerstown.  The erosion problem in the Burrow, Portrane, is of the magnitude that from high water mark up 240 yards of beach is being wiped away.  I was born in Portrane and lived there until about 1959 when I left to live in Santry.  Since 1959 over 240 yards of dunes have been wiped away.  What is to happen if remedial measures are not taken?  Lip service is no good, and that is all we are getting from a Government who have provided a mere £80,000 to cope with this problem.  It should be remembered, when talking about coastal erosion, that it costs £100 per yard to carry out remedial work.  That estimate was prepared by Dublin County Council engineers. Bearing that in mind and spreading the £80,000 over the other beaches in the country one can see how little work will be carried out this year.  It is also an indication of the lack of interest by the Government in the problem of coast erosion.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to review this situation and make every effort to allocate additional finance for this work.  At a time of rising unemployment, when school leavers have no prospect of getting work, there is a tremendous employment potential by allocating money for eradicating the problem of erosion. It has been estimated that the cost of carrying out such work on the Velvet Strand, in Portmarnock, would be £300,000.  This may be considered excessive for one beach, but we should remember that this strand is used not only by Dubliners but by holidaymakers from other parts of Ireland and Great Britain.  It has always been a great tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the value of the strand as a tourist attraction Dublin County Council are seeking to compulsorily acquire 200 acres of land there.  It is the intention of the council to reserve this area for use by visitors.  The <Col N="1465" /> county council have asked the Government to take the necessary action to protect the beaches in that area, but little or nothing has been done. Unless something is done fairly soon we will have a situation similar to what happened in Portrane where 240 yards of coastline was eroded in a few years.  These strands are too valuable to be washed away by the tide and blown away by the wind.</P>
    <P>The Government should do something concrete about the question of amenities, the provision of recreation areas and the protection of the environment. What I have said in relation to my constituency applies equally to seaside resorts around our coast. Deputy Esmonde is in a position to tell the House of the problems of coast erosion in County Wexford and I hope he supports me in my call for extra money for this.</P>
    <P>This is European Architectural Heritage year and, in conjunction with this, a progressive society was formed in Swords, the Swords Progressive Preservation Society.  To date that body has collected about £1,500 to help in their work.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the European Architectural Heritage Year and the efforts the Office of Public Works could make in north County Dublin, particularly in regard to Swords Castle.  The Swords Progressive Preservation Society collected approximately £1,500 which I understand was lodged with the Office of Public Works&mdash;I am open to correction on the exact details&mdash;with a view towards making a contribution towards the necessary restoration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in my speech I referred to the employment potential of work of this kind at a time when the economy is in a difficult state and when there is massive unemployment. Such work would restore a magnificent castle; it would also have the effect of meeting commitments to local organisations that have shown initiative in gathering money and giving it to the State as their contribution, it would be a constructive <Col N="1466" /> act in European Architectural Heritage Year and it would provide employment.</P>
    <P>Swords Castle is just one of many fine buildings in north County Dublin. I should like to compliment the Office of Public Works on their recent work in removing the magnificent ceilings from Kenure House in Rush.  This was a famous building in north County Dublin.  Some years ago the estate was bought by the Land Commission, some of it was purchased by the county council from the Land Commission and some of it was given to the local farmers.  Unfortunately the house was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair and it is now a danger. The Office of Public Works were aware of the value of the ceilings; they removed them with the stair bannisters and I gather they will be put in some of the new offices in the city.  I went to Kenure House to see the work they were doing and it was a pleasure to watch men doing work they obviously enjoyed very much.  By using a system of foam which was used at the ceiling level, a section of the ceiling was cut away, lowered, cased and taken away.  This was done in two square yard slabs.  The attention and loving care with which the men worked on this job was a pleasure to behold.  I was very proud to see we had men of their ability and devotion to duty.  I should be interested to know where the ceilings will be re-erected and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to let me know if he has this information.  I should like to have an opportunity of seeing them again and I know that people in the Rush area are also interested.  It is certainly a pity that Kenure House was allowed to fall into such a state of disrepair.</P>
    <P>A notable feature of the east coast is the Martello Towers.  Some of them have been altered and have been converted into residences but others have been left to the elements and unless some action is taken to protect them they will fall into the same state of disrepair as Kenure House.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to commission a report on these unique buildings.  If there was a report on <Col N="1467" /> each tower he could study how it might be preserved.  He should try to ensure that not too many alterations are carried out on the buildings that are inhabited because this might destroy their character.  If extensions are carried out in a higgledy-piggledy way the final result may be disastrous.  The Martello Towers should be preserved in their natural state if this is possible and where they need repair it should be done at national level.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have responsibility for the erection of Garda stations.  There is a rapidly expanding population in north County Dublin and I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary is pushing ahead with the provision of a new Garda station at Swords.  Some time ago I tabled a question on this matter.  I know there were some delays at local authority level and I made a point of speaking to the local council about the matter. I gather the problems were ironed out and that tenders will be invited soon. I hope the work will be more successful than the work at Lusk Garda station.  A certain amount of money was spent on renovation of that Garda station.  The work was badly needed but how successful it was is open to question.</P>
    <P>I understand the building suffers from dampness and, no matter how many heaters are installed, it is still uninhabitable.  A sergeant and his family were living in it but he has bought a new house, not a million miles away, and I am sure he would not have done that had the house been habitable.  I had occasion to call to the public section of the station in the winter time and it was not, to say the least of it, the warmest building I have ever been in despite fires and so forth.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to investigate the success, or otherwise, of the job that was done and see if something further could be done.  There is a distinct improvement but something still needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I have had the pleasure on a number of occasions of enjoying that stretch of the Shannon from Carrick to Athlone.  The navigational aids <Col N="1468" /> were very good and the lock-keepers were most co-operative, very efficient and very friendly.  They are good ambassadors for our tourist industry. They are as fine tourist agents as any we could hope to have.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to continue this development and improve further still the navigational aids.  The area of water could be extended; if you extend the navigational aids you will extend the area of water that people can use.  It is a magnificent natural amenity.  It is a wonderful experience to be the only boat on a lake stretching for a couple of miles.  The waterways in Europe are overcrowded and the waters themselves are polluted. We should do everything possible to develop and protect this peaceful stretch of water.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary and, through him, to Bord Fáilte to advertise this amenity to an even greater extent than is being done at the moment.  I have never known anything so peaceful and so relaxing; to use the old cliché, one really gets away from it all.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has responsibility for our embassies.  I had the pleasure and privilege of being a member of a delegation from the Oireachtas last year to Germany.  Our hosts looked after us very well indeed and one could have nothing but the highest praise for the friendship and courtesy extended to us.  We attended a couple of functions, one in our embassy in Bonn and another in our consulate in Hamburg.  I could not speak too highly of both our ambassador and our consul and the way they looked after us.  Our embassy building in Bonn is something to be proud of.  I gather it is a rented building and has been rented for a long number of years.  It is on a prime site, on what is probably the equivalent of Ailesbury Road and the question of purchasing the building should be examined.</P>
    <P>I cannot say the same for our consulate in Hamburg.  We are now members of the EEC.  Hamburg is a very important trading centre with a very fine port.  To put it crudely, our shop front in Hamburg needs to be improved. <Col N="1469" /> The young Consul there is doing a magnificent job and is obviously very highly respected.  People spoke very highly of him.  He is obviously well known and doing an excellent job in what I would consider trying circumstances.  I am speaking now without having mentioned anything of this to the official involved. There was no question of him complaining, or anything like that.  On the contrary, he was more than attentive to us.  We could do a great deal better as far as our consulate premises in Hamburg are concerned.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have referred to the preparation of a souvenir booklet for visitors to Leinster House.  I should like to add my voice to theirs.  Nothing extravagant or elaborate is needed. All that is required is a simple booklet giving the history of the House and interesting details with regard to legislation and so on.  We should not have to be talking about this now. This is something that should have been produced years ago.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Board of Works are installing a standby generator.  We had the experience here of debates going on in candlelight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some talk about the Phoenix Park and the amenity which it provides.  I would not agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick who suggested that cars in the park should be restricted. We should encourage people to go to the park.  In this day and age most people get to it by car.  We should provide extra parking facilities.  With <Col N="1470" /> the expansion of Castleknock, Blanchardstown and Clonsilla the main road through the park is used extensively. I do not think it would be feasible to ban cars from it.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the extra land which they are requesting being given to the Zoological Gardens.  I am a member of the Zoological Gardens Society and club, and the staff are doing a fine job.  The sponsorship of the various animals by the business community is well worth while.  A great number of people visit the zoo. I am sure most members of the House have brought their families to the zoo. It is a tremendous amenity.  I am not anxious to see the Phoenix Park damaged.  The zoo is an integral part of the park and giving them extra ground is to be encouraged.  It is not in any way contradicting the aim of providing an amenity for the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Like the zoo the Botanical gardens provide a tremendous focal point of interest for the people.  They are world famous gardens.  We have the problem of the massive pollution of the Tolka, and its effects on the Botanical Gardens.  When I was young I often saw children paddling in the Tolka, and now people run away from the stench.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have a survey carried out on the problem of the pollution of the Tolka.  It runs alongside the Gardens.  This is something which should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Like all Dubliners I am delighted to hear that a repair job is to be done on the Casino in Marino.  This is a fine building.  To a northsider like myself it is a very important building.  I like the point made by the Parliamentary Secretary that the casino was built as a summer house in the country residence of the gentleman who owned the house.  I am afraid that buildings similar to the Casino&mdash;not of the same quality, of course&mdash;will be swallowed up by expansion and the urban sprawl.  I should like to see the Office of Public Works well ahead of any demands made because of the expansion of the population, well ahead in the protection of buildings which are worthwhile protecting in areas <Col N="1471" /> where an expansion of the population will take place.</P>
    <P>Kenure House was bought by the Land Commission and through neglect it was allowed to reach a stage at which it was no longer possible to restore it.  I would be afraid that land would be bought and houses allowed to fall into a state of disrepair.  The Office of Public Works should be ahead of the posse, so to speak, in protecting these old houses.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about decentralisation. I was disappointed to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that the decentralisation which is planned to Athlone and Castlebar will merely be a flea bite in the overall employment of civil servants in the Department of Education and Department of Lands.  My original understanding was that the two Departments were to be transferred.  Now I understand that merely sections of the Departments are to be transferred.  This is a contradiction in terms.  There is a massive expansion in the population of Dublin with the consequent demands for new roads, new sewerage services, new water services, and new schools. At the same time, we have towns with the infrastructure already established of community life and the essential services.  These towns should be developed and there should be more decentralisation rather than bringing everything into the County Dublin area.  We should get away from the Pale mentality.  As a first step towards a general decentralisation we should be moving civil servants out into the towns.  Rather than taking the population out of those towns we should be encouraging people to go back into them.</P>
    <P>I know this creates problems for the civil service.  It creates problems for their families.  It creates educational problems and other difficulties. Even taking that into account I still believe there should be great encouragement to &ldquo;go west, young man&rdquo;. With a limited budget and with limited money available&mdash;and this will always be the way; it is not a bottomless pit&mdash; there is no point in imposing massive <Col N="1472" /> burdens of expenditure on the Dublin area.  This year in County Dublin we were asking for £8 million for sewerage work.  Of course, we got only around £2 million.  We also have a road programme for a motorway in the city and county area which will cost a couple of hundred million pounds.  Moving people into the greater Dublin area and leaving the towns denuded of population does not make economic or social sense.  We should be making decisions which bring people into the provincial towns without incurring massive expenditure.</P>
    <P>Those are the general comments I wanted to make on the estimate. There are many other points which could be made on such matters as school buildings and national monuments.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed about the amount of money being spent this year by the Board of Works on coast protection.  We have a report that from one county alone there has been a request for £1.75 million for very necessary work; yet the sum for the entire country has been fixed in the Estimate at £80,000.  To say that the Coast Protection Act of 1963 is being given lip service by the present regime is the understatement of the year.  I hope the matters I have raised and the urgency of dealing with them will be considered and acted on by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is always an interesting Estimate because its tentacles extend throughout the country. The last speaker dealt at some length with coast erosion and obviously came into the House with a full brief.  He is now better briefed than he was 18 months ago on the 1963 Act when he asked a Parliamentary Question.  I suppose he was suffering from a certain amount of chagrin at the time, and like a good Deputy, he settled himself down to find out what it was all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As he probably now knows, there are a lot of steps to be taken before a local authority's recommendations reach the desks of the Office of Public Works and then there are a lot of other steps that must be taken.  The <Col N="1473" /> 1963 Act was virtually ignored by the previous Government for a number of years.  It was virtually unknown to most local representatives, and when they began to know about it, it took them a long time to understand its requirements before any suggested scheme could be got off the ground.</P>

      <P>The weekend before last, I visited Ballyconnigar Strand in Wexford and was appalled by the amount of coast erosion there.  Deputy Burke mentioned in yards what can be mentioned in miles in all directions in County Wexford.  We have a problem in regard to coast erosion and sometimes I wonder if it is humanly possible to arrest it.  In Wexford we have the problem of running sand which is drawn out by the tide and is not replaced.  We have a problem in Wexford of not alone trying to deal with sand erosion but of working hard to maintain hard clay subsoil because of collapsing banks.  We have now reached the stage at which we have to consider whether it is wise to allow public access to beaches in certain areas, and this poses the twin problem of loss of amenity and of a valuable tourist asset. I am aware that there is a lot of thinking in public circles about this very serious problem but I do not think any definite decision can be arrived at in regard to a national plan, as Deputy Burke described it.</P>
      <P>Certain new findings have emerged from detailed studies in other countries and it has become apparent that where the human hand has been put to the plough to protect coastlines, the cure has been worse than the disease.  This has been particularly apparent where there is natural regeneration.  Anyone who has taken the time to study the natural history of this country will be aware that a great part of the east coast has been made from sandhills which is now fertile land.  The evidence is there for those who care to take note of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> Possibly one of the solutions, or part of a solution, to this frightful problem &mdash;it is frightful when you see a whole roadway collapsing in a matter of months as it did at Blackwater&mdash;will come from application to the EEC Regional Fund or by application to the World Bank.  I do not think the problem is of a size that can be dealt with under any scheme envisaged under the 1963 Coast Protection Act.  Any work carried out under the provisions of that Act would involve delays because of lack of expert staff.  Such work requires marine engineers with experience, experience which cannot be easily picked up by a course of three or four years in a university or polytechnic college.  It is science which can be learned only by people who have been in the profession for a lifetime or the greater part thereof. At this stage it is only right that the university authorities should get together with the Board of Works, in suggesting some scheme under which engineers be chosen every year, or every few years, to undertake part-time work in the Board of Works in this section.  I know the work is complicated and may not be spectacular for or attractive to young engineers.  But one must remember that a lot of these engineers who qualify in a university do so with the assistance of State grants.  That would be a fair way in which some retribution could be made by these people to the State, by making themselves available for this type of work on a part-time basis, either in the short or long term.  There is plenty of room for further training on this and we have plenty of material on which to work here.  It would be of assistance also to local authorities, particularly, that their engineers would have experience in that line of work.</P>
    <P>Under item No. 19, I am delighted to see that there is mention of the Ordnance Survey Office and maps. Over a number of years I have experienced a certain amount of frustration, on behalf of clients, in reference to mapping in the Land Registry.  I think a lot of people will have had similar experience in that regard.  I do not think the blame can be laid in any particular quarter.  One must be fair <Col N="1475" /> about this.  If there was blame to be laid it could be levelled only on past administrations as not having appreciated the development of the country and the implications of being short of full and proper mapping facilities.  This difficulty arises particularly with regard to registered land, land that was registered originally under the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act, 1891.  There is a more up-to-date Act now, in the sixties.  The object of that Act was to have a national register of the title to land in Ireland, which was built up in conjunction with the Land Purchase Acts. Instead of large estates, with tenants holding on these large estates doubtful tenures, the policy of the Land Acts was to vest the property and title to the land in the tenant farmers of Ireland.  That has been largely effected. For the purposes of this scheme&mdash; registration of land&mdash;a good, overall mapping survey, original survey, revised surveys and up-to-date surveys are required.  I have the feeling that there are certain parts of Ireland&mdash; more than one might care to think of&mdash; that have not been surveyed since the turn of the century.  We all know how the face of a nation, in physical terms, can change, the evolution that has occurred and the progress brought about in this field.  This type of delay causes considerable difficulties.  To illustrate how serious is the matter, I would put it this way: I know the Land Registry, on more occasions than they care to admit, have had to rely on maps made by people from outside official sources.  This occurred largely in reference to development projects because of delays which occurred in necessary revisions of the ordnance survey maps, due partly to lack of equipment and personnel.  This meant that, in some cases, the boundaries of properties were suspect.  We all know what is the cost of development and building, and of investment in development nowadays, when a foot one way or another in a boundary might be a very serious matter.  Since 1891 the ordnance survey maps have been used by the Land Registry as the official record for mapping purposes.  We have <Col N="1476" /> all seen ordnance survey maps where there are fields here and there no longer existing&mdash;it is a village, a town, a factory settlement or a development in the area and where the lines on the original map bear no resemblance to today's situation.  Therefore, I am glad to see expenditure of money on new printing buildings for the Ordnance Survey Office.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to really put the spurs into that section of his office. Perhaps I might make a special plea that he give that sector some priority.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this which is causing considerable delay and difficulty in development, particularly in urban areas.  I am aware of the fact that the Ordnance Survey Office have perfected a special system of mapping to deal with this problem, that is, what they call &ldquo;section mapping&rdquo;.  This would be particularly relevant to the environs of Dublin city and county, which was once agricultural land but is now highly developed with a concentration of buildings and for which the old, conventional ordnance survey maps cannot be used.  I understand there has been a very earnest effort made to keep up-to-date with this aspect of the Ordnance Survey Office's activities. I believe they are just keeping pace but one must realise that, if there is any failure at that end, then the land registry system falls down.  That is why the matter is of some seriousness.</P>
    <P>At the outset of my remarks I referred to the fact that various areas of this country had not been surveyed since the turn of the century.  As a matter of fact, I had a rather awkward experience about 12 or 15 years ago of being one of the lawyers involved in a title action in Tipperary circuit court, when we were fighting about a river.  Various maps had been drawn up by engineers on both sides more or less agreed.  But the lawyers, amongst themselves, were arguing about the official map; as to who owned the land at a certain inch of the river. Measurements were taken in relation to the Ordance Survey sheet.  We then went back to the private local men who had done the job for their respective <Col N="1477" /> clients and found that the river was about 50 or 60 yards off course.  The problem arose: who owned what land and where?  It ended up that the case was not decided by the judge because they did not think there was any law which could decide such a case.  The lawyers got together and made a bargain outside the court. This is a typical instance of pleading which started on the basis of the official Ordnance map on which the Land Registry folio was based.  We found that the land and the river were in completely different places.  That is an extreme example of what can occur if revision is not kept up to date.</P>
    <P>I hope that with more up-to-date buildings, equipment and assistance of mapping this difficulty can be got over.  Under the auspices of bodies such as the IDA, local authorities, local development associations and chambers of commerce, areas have been developed intensively.  There have been some difficulties about mapping because there are now roads where there were none before, land has been acquired by the local authorities and original boundaries are no longer relevant.  There has been difficulty finding people to do this remapping. As a result much of this had to be placed on the shoulders of the private sector.  As we all know, when there is no gauge of the right standard, standards can vary greatly.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and his Office for their interest in national parks.  I will not be specific, but since he took office it has been obvious that he has a very real interest in these parks.  I suspect that his real interest is motivated by the fact that he is a countryman.  He sees these national parks as monuments of our nation which should be preserved.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that the Office of Public Works are going slowly with the golf club at Islandbridge.  I know there are difficulties there.  Care will be exercised to ensure that they will not interfere with any other amenities in the area.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have carried out a considerable amount of work on the Shannon water scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> This area is attracting a great many people who wish to build in the immediate catchment area of the Shannon and its lakes.  Some of us are aware that there is a draft directive proposed by the EEC which is being considered by the Secondary Legislation Committee of these Houses.  It is primarily orientated towards bathing places and the maintenance of clean water.  This would include fresh water and sea water.</P>
    <P>I have been informed&mdash;I do not know this at first hand but I will refer to it in case there is some truth in it &mdash;that people in the launches and barges on the Shannon are cleaning out their toilets near landing places and harbours.  This will give rise to serious pollution problems.  It will be difficult to monitor and police this very serious abuse, because the people who will destroy these beautiful places by such conduct may not even be Irish nationals who have rented boats. These harbours on inland waterways are usually in sheltered areas where there is not a real current.  If people empty their toilets in these areas, there is very little chance of getting rid of this effluent.  The only way we can deal with that is by very stringent penalties.</P>
    <P>I do not think this can be left to individual local authorities.  A large waterway, such as the River Shannon. will pass through many local authority areas.  Power should be given to a body, such as the Office of Public Works, to police and monitor this with heavy penalties imposed if the rules are breached.  If this is not within the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Secretary no doubt he will report it to the proper agent of the State.  This is a very serious matter. We know what happened to the River Rhine and other rivers.  We would not like to see that happen to the Shannon or any of our other rivers which are used as inland waterways. Apart from the pleasure it gives tourists, it is a natural beauty spot of which we are all proud and would not like to see damaged or depreciated.</P>
    <P>I would like now to deal with the temperature in this House.  I have not been responsible for either raising or <Col N="1479" /> lowering temperature here, although I was very heated sometimes when I made my representations to the Parliamentary Secretary.  It was not internally generated heat nor was it caused by imbibing in any liquid or food.  It was a natural reaction to the discomfort I and other Deputies suffered.  Many of us have little disabilities which become apparent when the temperature is not properly controlled. Could we have a little revision of the Office of Public Works catechism which says that central heating does not start until November nor end until the end of May?</P>
    <P>I know changes have been made in recent times but it should surely be possible to adjust the heating and temperature in accordance with the seasons.  Sometimes when we come into this House on a warm afternoon it is practically impossible to stay awake. One does not have to imbibe at all for this to happen.  I hope, with that suggestion, that we might save a little on the fuel bills.</P>
    <P>During the past week I went into the Members' Bar and found that the temperature, according to the thermometer on the wall, was around 72º. I do not know what the state of the beer and the stout were that evening after being in that temperature.  I did not touch it, but certain other Deputies may not have felt too well afterwards. Eventually the temperature was brought down.  This has happened on more than one occasion.  I believe there is something wrong with the mechanism of the heat control in the House.</P>

If people feel a little cold there is a restaurant where they can get a nice hot cup of tea or they can plug in a radiator instead of roasting the rest of us.  Politicians are <Col N="1480" /> not glasshouse plants.  We take a good deal of knocking around.  The country Deputies, in particular, who get fresh air are not delicate plants.

I was made aware of the bad condition of this building when I visited Luxembourg on one of the parliamentary fact-finding trips concerning the EEC a few months ago.  They were talking about doing something about it then and I am glad to see the work has now begun.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and his staff deserve the very highest possible praise in regard to the work done in providing accommodation for EEC meetings in Dublin this year.  They did not get much time in which to do it.  The work came at a time which must have been very awkward for the Board of Works.  I have heard the highest praise from anybody who had anything to do with the functions. The Irish people can be very grateful that the Parliamentary Secretary's Department carried out their duties so efficiently.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the Parliamentary Secretary is taking an interest in that nice country, Austria, and the beautiful city of Vienna, which he visited some time ago.  I hope that it remains in his dreams and that shortly we will have an embassy there.  We all have a certain romantic attachment to the city of Vienna with its music, song and nice people.  There are plenty of songs about that beautiful city.  I understand there is a certain affinity between traditional Irish airs and some of the Viennese music.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary can put some of the Wexford areas on the priority list for coast erosion. I am becoming more than a little alarmed at the degree of running sand we have on the east and south east coast.  It is one of the gateways to tourism.  We have a large area of good <Col N="1481" /> clean sand and safe bathing places but I believe we are getting to the stage when we may have to close off some of those strands because of danger of collapse of some of the banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the co-operation I, as a member of the Opposition, have received from him during his time in office.  I would like to couple with that an expression of thanks to the officials of his Department, who, sometimes under very trying circumstances, have moved very quickly on certain things which were urgent to some people but probably were every day affairs as far as the Office of Public Works were concerned. Despite this they were still sensitive to the urgency of the particular problems.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a special plea to the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park.  During Private Members' business on the youth motion this week I said that one of the problems which the Scout Association of Ireland had was that the Board of Works were reluctant to allow scouting groups to use the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park for camping.  The Scout Association of Ireland tell me that the Board of Works say that youth groups cannot be trusted to use national parks such as Bourn Vincent. I do not know whether they expressed it as strongly as that.  I am sure they did not, but this is the way it was conveyed to me.  Apparently there is a requirement within the Bourn Vincent bequest that the park be made available for young people. I do not know whether it says camping specifically.  The Scout Association have a very good record as a responsible body, and I should be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would examine this with his officials to see if they can be accommodated even on a trial basis to see what the reaction is and to show that in fact there is nothing to fear from allowing groups to have camping facilities there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is probably not aware that I am chairman of the cultural committee of the <Col N="1482" /> corporation and as such we have a great interest in European Architectural Heritage Year.  We have set up a subcommittee to advise us and it is chaired by a very well-known gentleman, Professor Kevin B. Nowlan, whose interest in architecture and planning is very well known. I wish to put on the record of the House that, as chairman of the cultural committee of the Dublin Corporation I am aware of the friendly co-operation that is taking place between the Board of Works and the corporation.  The corporation are very grateful for it, just as I am sure the Board of Works are equally grateful to the corporation for their co-operation.</P>
    <P>At the moment one of the interesting projects which is being examined is the widening of Dame Street at Palace Street near the City Hall. Adjacent to the City Hall there was a business called Masons.  Some years ago it was burnt out in a fire.  It is just at the near Castle gates, Palace Street.</P>

I hope the corporation and the Board of Works will be able to cooperate in regard to the overall plan. One of the things we want to do it to preserve the present facade in Palace Street.  No. 3 Palace Street has to be demolished as it is in a state of decay, and the plan is to rebuild it, but we hope to refurbish No. 2 and No. 1 which are the property of the Board of Works, to bring them up into a new building with the same Georgian line.  This is only one of the things we are working on.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to see that the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham is to be restored.  The Parliamentary Secretary states:</P>
      <P>Provision is being made for the continuing of the planning of stage II of the restoration of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.  This is the only large building of the late 17th century in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> There is a group called the Institute of Irish Studies who sent a letter to the European Architectural Heritage Year committee asking that the corporation would take an interest in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.  It was explained at the meeting that we in Dublin Corporation have no function in regard to the future of the Royal Hospital, but it would strike us in the cultural committee and the advisory sub-committee that the suggestions they have to make deserve sympathetic consideration.  At the next meeting of the cultural committee it is my intention to put it to the members that we pass a resolution at the next public meeting of the council to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to implement some of the suggestions they have made.  When the Parliamentary Secretary hears some of them he may find himself quite sympathetic to them. They say that:</P>
    <P>At present the Royal Hospital is under-used and proposals by the National Museum to create a folk museum there have been shelved as the grounds are not large enough. Parts of the buildings have been restored by the Board of Works.  A worthy project for Architectural Heritage Year would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>It may be a little bit ambitious for Architectural Heritage Year, as they admit themselves.</P>
    <P>&mdash;would be to set in train the voluntary restoration of the rest of the building by allocating rooms to craft unions for use as an exhibition, working, teaching area.  Eventually a craft village is envisaged in the Kilmainham-Camac Valley area on the lines of the community village with workshops for students at Roskild in Denmark.</P>
    <P>The idea is to develop the whole area, to have the hospital itself used as a folk museum.  They also say:</P>
    <P>The idea would be to restore the Royal Hospital as a teaching museum and resort centre with particular relation to crafts.</P>
    <P>From my knowledge of the interest the Board of Works have already taken in such matters and other things which <Col N="1484" /> they are doing for the European Architectural Year, I know they will consider that sympathetically.  They have not received this yet, but it will be sent to the Parliamentary Secretary to show. I believe it will have unanimous endorsement of the cultural committee and also of the Dublin Corporation. We certainly would encourage these people of the Institute of Irish Studies in their suggestions to go ahead, but we have explained that this would be something for the Office of Public Works and not for us.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the translation system we have here is operating now or not, but I hope it is being discontinued. It is not being used and I felt myself that it had been tried but it was a little wasteful from the point of view of the expenditure for having it there.  If it was being used regularly that would be fine, but at the present time when we are looking for realistic economies I think this is one the Parliamentary Secretary should look at.  I do not know whether I am speaking for the rest of my party, or not, but I think this is one economy that could usefully be made.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the traffic in the Phoenix Park.  I was more concerned about the speed of traffic through the park.  There are people who would bar traffic completely from the Phoenix Park but I do not necessarily agree.  There are people living in Castleknock who get there by driving along the quays by Heuston Station and if they did not have access to Castleknock through the park we might have worse traffic problems.  But the matter of people using the park as a racing circuit is something that should be examined.  Many learner-drivers use the Phoenix Park and I do not see anything wrong with that.  I learned to drive there and I am glad to say the nearest I came to having an accident was with a cow and, fortunately, we managed to stop in time.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Board of Works are co-operating with An Bord Fáilte in connection with the European Architectural Heritage Year in the unusual project of providing at Cahir Castle an exhibition centre devoted to the cultural and physical heritage of <Col N="1485" /> our people.  This is an excellent idea which is good in itself in preserving in the people a knowledge of where they came from.  It is as important to the human being to know where he came from as to know where he is going.  We like to have a heritage and we value it.  This project gives an opportunity to develop good public relations between the Office of Public Works and the public.  I notice that where the community and environment section of Dublin Corporation can directly help community associations, it does a good deal to bring local government closer to the people. In the same way, the Office of Public Works have a unique opportunity to bring government closer to the people through exercises like that.  People tend to regard a Department of State as being completely aloof and with little interest in leisure and this project offers a great opportunity to display a better image.  The more co-operation there is between the Board of Works and local authorities in this kind of work the better.</P>
    <P>I think the Office of Public Works would even be justified in seeking contributions from local authorities towards works they are carrying out within the area.  Some local authorities have much more money than others; some have very small incomes. We cannot afford to direct restoration or reconstruction work only into the better-off areas but where these exist they should make some contribution. This would be fair and would allow the Office of Public Works, possibly, to spend more money in areas where cash is not so readily available.  I may be shot down by the city manager for saying this.</P>
    <P>We have a gigantic unemployment problem and the Office of Public Works offers the best possibility of creating employment.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary said that the Vote was up by 25 per cent or £10 million on last year.  Is this exclusive of wage increases?  Does it mean there is an increase in the work being done?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is up to £18 million and this year's increase in wages is not included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1486" />
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>So, this is actually a net increase on projects.  I am glad of that because I know that in Dublin there are many skilled tradesmen seeking work.  I know of carpenters and painters, people who could be engaged in some work like this.  These men do not want to be on the dole; they prefer to exercise their craft and if they could be engaged in restoration work it could only be beneficial.  This could be arranged with the unions: we want to see people working so that they will not get out of the habit of work.  If they do, they lose confidence. I think some scheme could be worked out by which such people could work, even at a subsidised rate, on restoration. We have tremendous talent and skill in this country and people who possess these qualities should be encouraged at all levels.</P>
      <P>I am very keen on and very much engaged in the promotion of community weeks each year in certain areas of my constituency.  We have arts and crafts competitions and so on to get the community to work together for one week.  This also involves the schools.  I have been astonished in the arts and crafts exhibitions by the results coming from adults and young children and astonished at what they are capable of producing.  I have seen these results in areas such as Crumlin, Harolds Cross and Churchtown.  We speak of the old skills and say that everything is mass-produced today and that nobody can make anything or design beautiful things any more but there are people quite capable of doing this and we must encourage them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When restoration work arises, unemployed people who posses the necessary skills&mdash;very often the older craftsmen&mdash;should be given the opportunity of exercising their talents.  It would be bad not only for the individual but for the nation if such talents were allowed to go to waste.  The improvement of existing Garda stations could create employment for carpenters, plumbers and painters.  I have been in the Garda station in Terenure in my own constituency on a number of occasions on various errands and I noticed that a coat of paint would <Col N="1487" /> improve it.  The expense would be small.  The gardaí have to work in dull, uninteresting surroundings.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is free to use any of his funds for such a purpose it would be well spent in doing work like this, painting and decorating many Garda stations that need such attention.  This is not the only Garda station in such bad condition.</P>
    <P>I notice that there is provision for improving accommodation at the film censor's office.  I trust that there will be violent pink on the wall rather than that which the censor lets through in some of the more violent films.  However, that is another matter.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that accommodation for the Garda Band is to be improved. This band has a place in the hearts of all our people.  Since the band was re-established by the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, they have found a new sense of pride in themselves and the citizens of Dublin got much pleasure from seeing and hearing the band on St. Patrick's Day. We have the same sense of pride in our No. 1 Army Band and it is only right that adequate accommodation should be provided for them.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the grounds of the Zoological Gardens come within the Parliamentary Secretary's control?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The zoo is an independent body but we license them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently when the superintendent of the zoo was being interviewed on radio I understand he referred to the financial difficulties in which the zoo finds itself and said this is because of the high cost of maintaining it.  I had hoped that there might be some way in which the Office of Public Works could make a contribution to this body.  I intend finding out whether any help can be got from the corporation since as many Dubliners as people from other parts of the country visit the zoo each year.  Perhaps the State, either through the local authorities or otherwise, would be able to help them through a difficult time.  The zoo can be considered to be a national institution. <Col N="1488" /> However, I may have to direct my suggestions to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The rent is nominal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have expected that.  Perhaps it is about 5p per year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It might help if all Deputies were paid-up members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The more people who can be encouraged to become interested in the zoo the better.</P>
      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying he might let us know what progress has been made in regard to the Children's Court.  This is a matter that is causing much concern to all of us, especially those involved in any way in social work.  We want a Children's Court which will not look like the normal court-room.</P>
      <P>I notice, too, that work is progressing on the new office buildings at Athlone for the Department of Education and I expect that staff will be transferred to this building as soon as it is ready.</P>
      <P>There is an allocation of £16,000 for rewiring the National Museum.  On reading this I was prompted to ask whether there is any danger of the museum catching fire.  In other words, is the wiring there very bad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The wiring is not defective or dangerous.  This money is for lighting to show up the exhibits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We must ensure that the museum is preserved.  I am glad to note that money is to be spent on improving accommodation at the Botanic Gardens but I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary has any figures for the numbers of visitors to the gardens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries but in my reply I will give the Deputy details of the number of visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure many people visit the gardens each year.  We are told that £378,000 is required for <Col N="1489" /> work in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  One way of creating extra work would be the building of post offices and the decorating of others because I expect that some of them are as much in need of decoration as is the Garda station to which I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>We only act as agents for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but we have no responbility for branch post offices.  We are concerned only with the larger ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has told us of how gratified he was by the expression of appreciation from various people regarding the arrangements for the EEC summit meeting held here.  Deputy Lynch has already paid tribute to those involved in the organisation of that effort.  Much credit is due to the Board of Works for the work they carried out.  This helped to create a very good impression of us on people who had never been to Ireland before.  They could see how we preserved what we have.</P>
      <P>There is provision for the supply of replacement furniture and of additional items required for existing State buildings.  What happens to the old furniture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>We make all our own furniture.  When we replace old furniture we try to repair it and anything that is not repairable is sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmond, among others, referred to the question of fuel and lighting.  Something which causes me concern is the practice in some Government offices to light fires or to avail of electric fires although central heating systems are in operation. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will circularise all Departments requesting that this practice be discontinued.  I am sure it should not happen but it does happen and it should be looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is then this crazy practice of the heating being turned off on 30th April.  It can be very warm in March and the heating is not needed, and one complains to somebody about the <Col N="1490" /> heating being so high, and whether you want it or not you get it, and if you have a freezing day in August, you can turn the heat on.  We had a very mild winter last year, thank God, but nevertheless the heating was being turned on and this is something which I agree with Deputy Esmonde we must keep an eye on.</P>
    <P>With regard to pollution of our beaches, this is a matter which the Board of Works should be primarily concerned with and which the Board of Works should have a special section to watch.  My impression is that the Department of Transport and Power are called in if there is an oil leakage or spillage, but it is something in respect of which the Office of Public Works should have an emergency unit, with all the latest techniques for dealing with such pollution.  That may exist already, but the Parliamentary Secretary can say whether or not that is so.  In stating this in ignorance, we may be informing many people like myself who might not know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be Local Government.  I think that in fact there is a Bill on the stocks relating to pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board of Works would seem to be the most suitable office, in that the experts could discuss various ways of dealing with the problem.  It is a pretty vast office, I know, but this fits in more with that office than with other Departments. I know the Parliamentary Secretary does not want any more work or bring any more fire on himself, but I have made my point.</P>
      <P>Again I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his courtesy and his co-operation during the year and wish him well for next year.  I would ask him to keep a special eye on the creation of job opportunities because this is the Office which can contribute most in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said in previous years that I always regarded this Estimate as being one of the most interesting of those that come before the Oireachtas because it covers such a very large and interesting expanse <Col N="1491" /> of the national activity and there are few facets of our living which are not touched on in some way by the Estimate.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the reference to the extension of the National Library because for many years one felt that one should apologise to people going there and to the staff for the gross congestion and overcrowding there and the fact that the buildings were fairly old.  While one does appreciate a kind of academic atmosphere in a library being conducive to good reading or painting, in the society we have today, a library can be a source of great knowledge on all aspects of our living and our National Library should be something of which we can really be proud.  The fact that the Kildare Street Club is to house part of the library is to be welcomed and one can appreciate that a bit of history is being made when the National Library is being extended and a premises such as the Kildare Street Club will now house part of it.  This club has had a rather chequered career over the years but it could have met a lot worse fate than the housing of the national archives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know what is to become of the site at Morehampton Road which was purchased some years ago by the National Library.  That site is lying derelict, not doing any harm but not doing any good.  It was mentioned that the National College of Art might be moved out there, and I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to press the Government to make some definite move in relation to that site, which is much too valuable to be left lying idle.  If the Government have decided that they do not want to use it.  I suggest that as we have two hospitals very close to that site&mdash;in fact it used to be part of the grounds of one hospital which was then a private hospital but which has now become more public and is supported by the Eastern Health Board&mdash;we might well have a very good hospital complex there, with two existing hospitals extending out to the front of Morehampton Road.  At the same time, if the Government were to decide to put the <Col N="1492" /> National College of Art there or indeed a new National Library, I would not criticise the decision.  The only thing I criticise now is the inactivity regarding that site.  One could suggest many uses to which it could be put. It cost a lot of money, although I know its value has appreciated very much in the past few years and that it was wise buying then.  The Government now have a great asset there in the land, about two acres, and I hope that in the near future the Government will make a definite decision and the Parliamentary Secretary might tell us what we are going to do with the site.</P>
    <P>One is very pleased to note that the purchase of land at Tara has been completed and we should be very pleased with the result of the negotiation by the staff in this rather difficult operation.  I suppose one becomes slightly romantic, or even emotional, when speaking of Tara.  Here we have the cradle of some of our civilisation and it is something about which in our excavations there we should be very careful.  Over many years any work done at Tara has been done with the greatest expertise.  One may discover in many ways and one of the best ways of doing so is archaeological excavation.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his statement referred to this fact, that if we do not preserve such things and they are lost, they are gone forever.  They are often our only guidelines to the past.  They are so valuable to us that money should not be spared in excavating them.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reference in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech to the Wood Quay excavations although I was pleased last week when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education assured us, in reply to a question of mine, that the Wood Quay excavations are being carried out to the highest degree of excellence. This is good to know.  I wonder if the Government have seen fit to assure the National Museum authorities that all the necessary backing will be forthcoming so as to ensure that the Wood Quay site will be excavated properly.</P>
    <P>I would take this opportunity of recording my thanks to and appreciation <Col N="1493" /> of the National Museum personnel who have been engaged in the Wood Quay excavation.  To my amateur mind they are doing an excellent job.  In my youth I took time off to take a course in archaeology which lasted about three months and which had the effect of showing me how little I knew about archaeology and still know about it.</P>
    <P>Painstaking excavation of Wood Quay will repay us.  There are those who criticise how it is being done and who want it to go on for ever.  One can never fully excavate a site.  A site would need to be left bare so that generations could work on it before it could be adequately excavated.  I am satisfied with the assurance of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education that the excavation at Wood Quay is being done properly. We have the goodwill of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and he will give any possible backing to ensure that the excavation will be carried out in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>On subhead E&mdash;accommodation&mdash; the accommodation in this House for some Deputies is rather overcrowded. I share a room on the fourth floor with seven other Fianna Fáil Deputies. After the next election when there will be so many more Fianna Fáil Deputies, we will have a real accommodation crisis in this House. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary is making a note of this.  There are eight of us in one room.  All of us being such very hard working Deputies we find the conditions overcrowded.  The Parliamentary Secretary might have some changes made there.  We do not grumble about it but in case it might be taken for granted that we are happy there, I would invite the Parliamentary Secretary to view the room and to see how overcrowded it is.</P>
    <P>It is possible that if Dublin Corporation were to take more seriously their duties in regard to office overcrowding we would be found to be in breach of the law on this point.  The Office of Public Works, probably, is not subject to corporation by-laws in this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> I notice that new offices are to be built for the Geological Survey at Beggars Bush.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to see to it that this building will not have the effect that the post office building has on the people living in the flats there. The post office building has taken the light away from several flats.  At the time when the building was being erected I raised this matter and was assured that the building would have no detrimental effect on the life of the people in the flats.  The flats were built a century ago by the British Army as married quarters.  If not palatial, they are still very adequate according to present housing standards.</P>
    <P>The development at Beggars Bush Barracks is being carried out piecemeal, which is not the way it should be done.  Many years ago the Stationery Office took part of the building. They did not carry out any alteration, so nobody criticised.  Then the post office were given a site for a telephone exchange and they certainly did interfere with the life of the people in the flats.  Now a new block is going up. I have not seen the plans and I do not think the corporation have any control over the plans because generally when the Office of Public Works apply for planning permission, the members of the corporation get a polite note to say that the corporation have no objection.  I do not think they can offer any objection.</P>
    <P>The Government should make up their minds about Beggars Bush.  The barracks is of historical importance. If the Government wished to provide more office accommodation at the barracks, that would be feasible but it should be part of an overall plan and not carried out in a piecemeal fashion.</P>
    <P>Now that it has been finally decided that the Kennedy Memorial Hall will not be built there, the Government should consider what they will do with it.  We are in a rather bad way for housing space in the city and we are trying to regenerate the city centre. The Parliamentary Secretary might consider the possibility of giving some <Col N="1495" /> space for housing at the Beggars Bush Barracks site.  We could get quite a few houses there.  I do not mean flats; I mean houses, because there are people in the area who need houses. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is a busy man but I would ask him to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have something done at the front of the barracks along Haddington Road.  There is a green patch <Col N="1496" /> there which needs attention.  The cannon which stand there would be all right if they were painted.  I am told they are relics of the Crimea War.  We will not hold that against them.  The lawn should be mowed and if a garden were made there it would improve the environment.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 4th June, 1975.</P>
